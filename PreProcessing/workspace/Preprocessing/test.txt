Easy, boy. 
( Gasps What do you expect? 
They're savages. 
One lot steals a goat from another lot, before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces. 
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. 
I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life. 
How close did you get? 
 Close as any man would. 
 We should head back to the wall. 
Do the dead frighten you? 
Our orders were to track the wildlings. 
We tracked them. 
They won't trouble us no more. 
You don't think he'll ask us how they died? 
Get back on your horse. 
Whatever did it to them could do it to us. 
They even killed the children. 
It's a good thing we're not children. 
You want to run away south, run away. 
Of course they will behead you as a deserter, if I don't catch you first. 
Get back on your horse. 
I won't say it again. 
Your dead men seem to have moved camp. 
They were here. 
See where they went. 
What is it? 
It's... 
 Game of Thrones 1x01  
Winter Is Coming Go on, father's watching. 
And your mother. 
Fine work as always. 
Well done. 
Thank you. 
I love the detail that you've managed to get in these corners. 
Quite beautiful. 
The stitching... 
And which one of you was a marksman at 10? 
Keep practicing, Bran. 
Go on. 
Don't think too much, Bran. 
Relax your bow arm. 
Quick, Bran! 
Faster. 
Lord Stark! 
My lady. 
A guardsman just rode in from the hills. 
They've captured a deserter from The Night's Watch. 
Get the lads to saddle their horses. 
Do you have to? 
He swore an oath, Cat. 
The law is law, my lady. 
Tell Bran he's coming too. 
Ned. 
10 is too young to see such things. 
He won't be a boy forever. 
And winter is coming. 
Lad, go run back and get the rest. 
White Walkers. 
I saw the White Walkers. 
White Walkers. 
The White Walkers, I saw them. 
I know I broke my oath. 
And I know I'm a deserter. 
I should have gone back to the wall and warned them, but I saw what I saw. 
I saw the White Walkers. 
People need to know. 
If you can get word to my family... 
Tell them I'm no coward. 
Tell them I'm sorry. 
Forgive me, Lord. 
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,  the first of his name... 
 Don't look away. 
...King of the Andals 
and the first men... 
Father will know if you do. 
...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms 
and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and warden of the north, sentence you to die. 
You did well. 
You understand why I did it? 
Jon said he was a deserter. 
But do you understand why i had to kill him? 
"Our way is the old way"? 
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. 
Is it true he saw the White Walkers? 
The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years. 
So he was lying? 
A madman sees what he sees. 
What is it? 
Mountain lion? 
There are no Mountain lions in these woods. 
It's a freak! 
It's a direwolf. 
Tough old beast. 
There are no direwolves south of the wall. 
Now there are five. 
You want to hold it? 
Where will they go? 
Their mother's dead. 
They don't belong down here. 
Better a quick death. 
They won't last without their mother. 
 Right. Give it here. 
 No! 
Put away your blade. 
I take orders from your father, not you. 
 Please, father! 
 I'm sorry, Bran. 
Lord Stark? 
There are five pups... 
one for each of the Stark children. 
The direwolf is the sigil of your House. 
They were meant to have them. 
You will train them yourselves. 
You will feed them yourselves. 
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves. 
What about you? 
I'm not a Stark. 
Get on. 
What is it? 
The runt of the litter that one's yours, snow. 
As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you: You worry too much. 
 It's starting to show. 
 And you never worry about anything. 
When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock, 100-foot drop into the water, and you were never afraid. 
There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. 
"We're lannisters. 
Lannisters don't act like fools." 
What if Jon Arryn told someone? 
But who would he tell? 
 My husband. 
 If he told the King, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. 
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. 
And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King-- someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores or is it the other way around? 
And life will go on. 
You should be The Hand of the King. 
That's an honor I can do without. 
Their days are too long, their lives are too short. 
All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here. 
You have five northern children. 
You're not an outsider. 
I wonder if the old gods agree. 
It's your gods with all the rules. 
I am so sorry, my love. 
 Tell me. 
 There was a raven from King's Landing. 
Jon Arryn is dead. 
A fever took him. 
I know he was like a father to you. 
 Your sister, the boy? 
 They both have their health, gods be good. 
The raven brought more news... 
The King rides for Winterfell... 
with the Queen and all the rest of them. 
If he's coming this far north... 
There's only one thing he's after. 
You can always say no, Ned. 
We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. 
I'm told he reads all night. 
I'm told he drinks all night. 
How much could he possibly drink? 
A man of his... 
Stature? 
We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. 
 Perhaps we'll find out. 
 In any case, candles. 
Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the King? 
It's for the Queen, I bet. 
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink. 
I hear the prince is a right royal prick. 
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick. 
Go on, Tommy, shear him good. 
He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair. 
Gods, but they grow fast. 
Brandon! 
I saw the king. 
He's got hundreds of people. 
How many times have I told you no climbing? 
But he's coming right now down our road. 
I want you to promise me, no more climbing. 
I promise. 
 Do you know what? 
 What? 
You always look at your feet before you lie. 
Run and find your father. 
Tell him the King is close. 
Where's Arya? 
Sansa, where's your sister? 
 Hey hey hey hey. 
 Ohh. 
What are you doing with that on? 
Go on. 
Move! 
Your Grace. 
You've got fat. 
 Cat! 
 Your Grace. 
Nine years-- why haven't I seen you? 
Where the hell have you been? 
Guarding the north for you, your Grace. 
Winterfell is yours. 
 Where's the imp? 
 Will you shut up? 
Who have we here? 
You must be Robb. 
My, you're a pretty one. 
Your name is? 
Arya. 
Oh, show us your muscles. 
You'll be a soldier. 
That's Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother. 
Would you please shut up? 
My Queen. 
My Queen. 
Take me to your crypt. 
I want to pay my respects. 
We've been riding for a month, my love. 
Surely the dead can wait. 
Ned. 
Where's the imp? 
Where is our brother? 
Go and find the little beast. 
Tell me about Jon Arryn. 
One minute he was fine and then... 
Burned right through him, whatever it was. 
I loved that man. 
We both did. 
He never had to teach you much, but me? 
You remember me at 16? 
All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. 
 He showed me what was what. 
 Aye. 
Don't look at me like that. 
It's not his fault I didn't listen. 
I need you, Ned down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody. 
Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King. 
I'm not worthy of the honor. 
I'm not trying to honor you. 
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave. 
Damn it, Ned, stand up. 
You helped me win the iron throne, now help me keep the damn thing. 
We were meant to rule together. 
If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood. 
Well, it's not too late. 
I have a son, you have a daughter. 
We'll join our Houses. 
It is true what they say about the northern girls. 
Did you hear the King's in Winterfell? 
I did hear something about that. 
And the Queen and her twin brother. 
They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms. 
And the other brother? 
 The Queen has two brothers? 
 There's the pretty one, and there's the clever one. 
Mmm, I hear they call him the imp. 
I hear he hates that nickname. 
Oh? 
I hear he's more than earned it. 
I hear he's a drunken little lecher, prone to all manner of perversions. 
Clever girl. 
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion. 
Have you? 
 Oh! 
 Already? 
The gods gave me one blessing. 
 Don't get up. 
 My Lord. 
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door  in a whorehouse, brother? 
 You have much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention. 
She has odd cravings, our sister. 
A family trait. 
Now the Starks are feasting us at sundown. 
Don't leave me alone with these people. 
I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. 
And this is the first of many courses. 
I thought you might say that. 
But since we're short on time... 
Come on, girls. 
See you at sundown. 
Close the door! 
Did you have to bury her in a place like this? 
She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her. 
She was my sister. 
This is where she belongs. 
She belonged with me. 
In my dreams, I kill him every night. 
It's done, your Grace. 
The Targaryens are gone. 
Not all of them. 
Daenerys! 
Daenerys. 
There's our bride-to-be. 
Look, a gift from Illyrio. 
Touch it. 
Go on, feel the fabric. 
Mmm. 
Isn't he a gracious host? 
We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything. 
Illyrio's no fool. 
He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. 
You still slouch. 
Let them see. 
You have a woman's body now. 
I need you to be perfect today. 
Can you do that for me? 
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you? 
No. 
When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today. 
It's too hot, my lady. 
Where is he? 
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality. 
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven. 
May I present my honored guests? 
Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name, the rightful king of the Andals and the first men, and his sister Daenerys of House Targaryen. 
Do you see how long his hair is? 
When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids so the whole world can see their shame. 
Khal Drogo has never been defeated. 
He's a savage, of course, but one of the finest killers alive. 
And you will be his Queen. 
Come forward, my dear. 
Where is he going?! 
 The ceremony is over. 
 But he didn't say anything. 
 Did he like her? 
 Trust me, your Grace, if he didn't like her, we'd know. 
It won't be long now. 
Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. 
The people drink secret toasts to your health. 
They cry out for their true king. 
When will they be married? 
Soon. 
The Dothraki never stay still for long. 
Is it true they lie with their horses? 
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo. 
Do you take me for a fool? 
I take you for a King. 
Kings lack the caution of common men. 
My apologies if I've given offense. 
I know how to play a man like Drogo. 
I give him a Queen and he gives me an army. 
I don't want to be his Queen. 
I want to go home. 
So do I. 
I want us both to go home, but they took it from us. 
So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home? 
I don't know. 
We go home with an army. 
With Khal Drogo's army. 
I would let his whole tribe fuck you all 40,000 men and their horses too if that's what it took. 
Do you think Joffrey will like me? 
What if he thinks I'm ugly? 
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived. 
He's so handsome. 
When would we be married? 
Soon? Or do we have to wait? 
Hush now. 
Your father hasn't even said yes. 
Why would he say no? 
He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms. 
He'd have to leave home. 
He'd have to leave me. 
And so would you. 
You left your home to come here. 
And I'd be Queen someday. 
Please make father say yes! 
 Sansa  Please please! 
It's the only thing I ever wanted. 
Fill that up! 
Boys, Rodrik, come on. 
Come on! 
Is he dead yet? 
Uncle Benjen. 
You got bigger. 
Rode all day. 
Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. 
Why aren't you at the feast? 
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst. 
Well, you're always welcome on the wall. 
No bastard was ever refused a seat there. 
So take me with you when you go back. 
 Jon  Father will let me if you ask him. 
I know he will. 
The wall isn't going anywhere. 
I'm ready to swear your oath. 
You don't understand what you'd be giving up. 
We have no families. 
 None of us will ever father sons  I don't care about that! 
You might, if you knew what it meant. 
I'd better get inside, rescue your father from his guests. 
We'll talk later. 
Your Uncle's in The Night's Watch. 
What are you doing back there? 
Preparing for a night with your family. 
I've always wanted to see the wall. 
You're Tyrion Lannister, the Queen's brother? 
My greatest accomplishment. 
And you-- you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you? 
Did I offend you? 
Sorry. 
You are the bastard though. 
Lord Eddard Stark is my father. 
And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you the bastard. 
Let me give you some advice, bastard. 
Never forget what you are. 
The rest of the world will not. 
Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you. 
What the hell do you know about being a bastard? 
All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes. 
You at a feast it's like a bear in a trap. 
The boy I beheaded  did you know him? 
 Of course I did. 
Just a lad. 
And he was tough, Ned, a true ranger. 
Pfft. 
He was talking madness. 
Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends. 
The two he was with are still missing. 
Hmph. 
A wildling ambush. 
Maybe. 
Direwolves south of the wall, talk of The Walkers, and my brother might be the next Hand of the King. 
Winter is coming. 
Winter is coming. 
 Uncle Benjen. 
 Robb boy. 
 How are you? 
 I'm good. 
Is this your first time in the north, your Grace? 
Yes. 
Lovely country. 
I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing. 
I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time. 
Hello, little dove. 
But you are a beauty. 
 How old are you? 
 13, your Grace. 
You're tall. 
Still growing? 
I think so, your Grace. 
And have you bled yet? 
No, your Grace. 
Your dress, did you make it? 
Such a talent. 
You must make something for me. 
I hear we might share a grandchild someday. 
I hear the same. 
Your daughter will do well in the capital. 
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever. 
 Your pardon. 
 I hear we might be neighbors soon. 
 I hope it's true. 
 Yes, the King has honored me with his offer. 
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title if you accept. 
It would be good to have you on the field. 
The competition has become a bit stale. 
 I don't fight in tournaments. 
 No? 
Getting a little old for it? 
I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real I don't want him to know what I can do. 
Well said. 
Arya! 
It's not funny! 
She always does this. 
This was my favorite dress. 
She always does it and it's not funny! 
Time for bed. 
I'm a Northman. 
I belong here with you, not down south in that rats' nest they call a capital. 
I won't let him take you. 
The king takes what he wants. 
That's why he's King. 
I'll say, "listen, fat man." 
"You are not taking my husband anywhere. 
He belongs to me now." 
How did he get so fat? 
He only stops eating when it's time for a drink. 
It's Maester Luwin, my Lord. 
Send him in. 
Pardon, my Lord, my Lady. 
A rider in the night... 
from your sister. 
 Stay. 
 This was sent from the Eyrie. 
What's she doing at the Eyrie? 
She hasn't been back there since her wedding. 
What news? 
She's fled the capital. 
She says Jon Arryn was murdered. 
By the Lannisters. 
She says the King is in danger. 
She's fresh widowed, Cat. 
She doesn't know what she's saying. 
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. 
Do you think she would risk her life her son's life if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered? 
If this news is true and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the King? 
They murdered the last Hand. 
Now you want Ned to take the job? 
The King rode for a month to ask for Lord Stark's help. 
He's the only one he trusts. 
You swore the King an oath, my Lord. 
He's spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. 
He owes him nothing. 
Your father and brother rode south once on a King's demand. 
A different time. 
A different King. 
When do I meet with the Khal? 
We need to begin planning the invasion. 
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,  you shall have it. 
 When? 
When their omens favor war. 
I piss on Dothraki omens. 
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back. 
A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. 
Jadi, zhey jorah andahli! 
Khal vezhven. 
A small gift, for the new Khaleesi songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms. 
Thank you, Ser. 
Are you from my country? 
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. 
I served your father for many years. 
Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful King. 
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. 
The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful. 
Thank you, Magister. 
She's beautiful. 
Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say thank you in Dothraki. 
There is no word for thank you in Dothraki. 
Make him happy. 
No. 
Do you know the common tongue? 
No. 
Is "no" the only word that you know? 
No. 
Rough night, imp? 
If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other it'll be a miracle. 
I didn't pick you for a hunter. 
The greatest in the land my spear never misses. 
It's not hunting if you pay for it. 
Are you as good with a spear as you used to be? 
No, but I'm still better than you. 
I know what I'm putting you through. 
Thank you for saying yes. 
I only ask you because I need you. 
You're a loyal friend. 
You hear me? 
A loyal friend. 
The last one I've got. 
 I hope I'll serve you well. 
 You will. 
And I'll make sure you don't look so fucking grim all the time. 
Come on, boys, let's go kill some boar! 
Come on, you. 
Stop! 
Stop. 
Are you completely mad? 
 He saw us. 
 It's all right, it's all right. 
 It's all right. 
 He saw us! 
I heard you the first time. 
Quite the little climber, aren't you? 
 How old are you, boy? 
 10. 
10. 
The things I do for love. 
﻿1  Game of Thrones 1x02  
The Kingsroad You need to drink, child. 
And eat. 
Isn't there anything else? 
The Dothraki have two things in abundance: Grass and horses. 
People can't live on grass. 
In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. 
It murders all other grass. 
The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything that's the way the world will end. 
It'll get easier. 
Khaleesi! 
Your hands. 
We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. 
Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. 
You'd be more comfortable there. 
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. 
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown. 
As you wish, your Grace. 
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. 
What did Ned Stark want you for? 
Buying from a slaver? 
Selling to one some poachers I caught on my land. 
Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. 
You can rest assured of that. 
Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. 
My mother's been looking for you. 
We ride for King's Landing today. 
Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies. 
What good will my sympathies do them? 
None. But it is 
expected of you. 
Your absence has already been noted. 
The boy means nothing to me. 
And I can't stand the wailing of women. 
One word and I'll hit you again. 
I'm telling mother! 
Go! 
Tell her. 
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. 
Do you understand? 
You can't Do you understand? 
The prince will remember that, little lord. 
I hope so. 
If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. 
Ah. 
Time for breakfast. 
Bread. 
And two of those little fish. 
And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. 
And bacon, burned black. 
Hyah. 
 Little brother. 
 Beloved siblings. 
Is Bran going to die? 
Apparently not. 
 What do you mean? 
 The Maester says the boy may live. 
It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain. 
Only the gods know for certain. 
All the rest of us can do is pray. 
The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you. 
I still can't believe you're going. 
It's ridiculous even for you. 
Where's your sense of wonder? 
The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of The Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers. 
Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black. 
And go celibate? 
The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. 
No, I just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world. 
The children don't need to hear your filth. 
Come. 
Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. 
Give me a good clean death any day. 
Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. 
Death is so final, whereas life... 
Ah, life is full of possibilities. 
I hope the boy does wake. 
I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say. 
My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on. 
My dear brother, you wound me. 
You know how much I love my family. 
Please. 
Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace. 
This is your home. 
I'm your guest. 
Handsome one, isn't he? 
I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. 
He was a fighter too tried to beat the fever that took him. 
Forgive me. 
It's the last thing you need to hear right now. 
I never knew. 
It was years ago. 
Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care. 
The boy looked just like him. 
Such a little thing... 
A bird without feathers. 
They came to take his body away and Robert held me. 
I screamed and I battled, but he held me. 
That little bundle. 
They took him away and I never saw him again. 
Never have visited the crypt, never. 
I pray to the mother every morning and night that she return your child to you. 
I am grateful. 
Perhaps this time she'll listen. 
A sword for the wall? 
 I already have one. 
 Good man. 
 Have you swung it yet? 
 Of course I have. 
At someone, I mean. 
It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. 
You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. 
Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. 
We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us. 
We've guarded the kingdoms for 8,000 years. 
Is it "we" already? 
Have you taken your vows then? 
Soon enough. 
Give my regards to The Night's Watch. 
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. 
And if not? 
It's only for life. 
Thank you, Nymeria. 
Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. 
My things weren't properly folded, she says. 
Who cares how they're folded?! 
They're going to get all messed up anyway. 
It's good you've got help. 
Watch. 
Nymeria, gloves. 
 Impressive. 
 Shut up. 
Nymeria, gloves! 
I have something for you. 
And it has to be packed very carefully. 
A present? 
Close the door. 
This is no toy. 
Be careful you don't cut yourself. 
 It's so skinny. 
 So are you. 
I had the blacksmith make it for you special. 
It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough. 
I can be quick. 
You'll have to work at it every day. 
How does it feel? 
Do you like the balance? 
I think so. 
First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end. 
I know which end to use. 
I'm going to miss you. 
Careful. 
All the best swords have names, you know. 
Sansa can keep her sewing needles. 
I've got a needle of my own. 
I came to say goodbye to Bran. 
You've said it. 
I wish I could be here when you wake up. 
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. 
I'm taking the black. 
I know we always talked about seeing the wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. 
I'll know my way around by then. 
I'll be a sworn brother of The Night's Watch. 
We can go out walking beyond the wall, if you're not afraid. 
I want you to leave. 
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. 
You came back a year later with another woman's son. 
And now you're leaving again. 
I have no choice. 
That's what men always say when honor calls. 
That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. 
You do have a choice. 
And you've made it. 
Cat I can't do it, Ned. 
 I really can't. 
 You can. 
You must. 
You've said goodbye to Bran? 
He's not going to die. 
I know it. 
You Starks are hard to kill. 
My mother? 
 She was very kind. 
 Good. 
Next time I see you, you'll be all in black. 
It was always my color. 
 Farewell, Snow. 
 And you, Stark. 
There's great honor serving in The Night's Watch. 
The Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years. 
And you are a Stark. 
You might not have my name, but you have my blood. 
Is my mother alive? 
Does she know about me? 
Where I am, where I'm going? 
Does she care? 
The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. 
Huh? 
I promise. 
Gods, this is country! 
I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going. 
I've half a mind to go with you. 
What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight. 
You should have asked me 20 years ago. 
There were wars to fight, women to marry we never had the chance to be young. 
I recall a few chances. 
There was that one... 
Oh, what was her name? 
That common girl of yours? 
Becca? With the great big tits 
you could bury your face in. 
Bessie. 
She was one of yours. 
Bessie! 
Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. 
Yours was... Aleena? 
No. You told me once. 
Meryl? 
Your bastard's mother? 
 Wylla. 
 That's it. 
She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. 
You never told me what she looked like. 
Nor will I. 
We were at war. 
None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. 
You're too hard on yourself. 
You always have been. 
I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already. 
The worst thing about your coronation I'll never get to hit you again. 
Trust me, that's not the worst thing. 
There was a rider in the night. 
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. 
What of it? 
Should we send her a wedding gift? 
A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it. 
She's little more than a child. 
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding. 
 Tell me we're not speaking of this. 
 Oh, it's unspeakable to you? 
What her father did to your family that was unspeakable. 
What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved. 
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on. 
But you can't get your hands on this one, can you? 
This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde. 
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. 
They have no ships, Robert. 
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper. 
If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back,  the scum will join him. 
 He will not cross. 
And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea. 
There's a war coming, Ned. 
I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming. 
Sit. 
You'll be fed. 
Untie them. 
Ah, rapers. 
They were given a choice no doubt castration or the wall. 
Most choose the knife. 
Not impressed by your new brothers? 
Lovely thing about the watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one. 
Why do you read so much? 
Look at me and tell me what you see. 
Is this a trick? 
What you see is a dwarf. 
If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. 
Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. 
Things are expected of me. 
My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years. 
Until your brother killed that King. 
Yes, until my brother killed him. 
Life is full of these little ironies. 
My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. 
I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? 
But how? 
Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. 
And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. 
That's why I read so much, Jon Snow. 
And you? 
What's your story, bastard? 
Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf. 
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of The Night's Watch, alongside his Valiant brothers-in-arms. 
The Night's Watch protects the realm from ah, yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. 
You're a smart boy. 
You don't believe that nonsense. 
Everything's better with some wine in the belly. 
It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. 
You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us. 
Talk to Poole about it. 
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. 
We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require  our immediate attention  I don't care about appointments! 
I'll make the appointments. 
We'll talk about it first thing in the morning. 
Very good, my Lord. 
My Lady. 
When was the last time you left this room? 
I have to take care of him. 
He's not going to die, mother. 
Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed. 
What if he's wrong? 
 Bran needs me. 
 Rickon needs you. 
He's six. 
He doesn't know what's happening. 
He follows me around all day,  clutching my leg, crying  close the windows! 
I can't stand it! 
Please make them stop! 
Fire. 
You stay here. 
I'll come back. 
You're not supposed to be here. 
No one is supposed to be here. 
It's a mercy. 
He's dead already. 
No! 
 Have you ever seen a dragon? 
 Dragon gone, Khaleesi. 
Everywhere? 
Even in the east? 
No dragon. 
Brave men kill them. 
 It is known. 
 It is known. 
A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon. 
The moon? 
He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. 
But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. 
Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire. 
Moon is no egg. 
Moon is goddess wife of sun. 
 It is known. 
 It is known. 
Leave me with her. 
Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories? 
Men like to talk when they're happy. 
Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy. 
 How old were you? 
 I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house. 
Nine?! 
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. 
First you must learn. 
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy? 
 Yes. 
 Will it take three years? 
No. 
Welcome. 
What I am about to tell you must remain between us. 
I don't think Bran fell from that tower. 
I think he was thrown. 
The boy was always sure-footed before. 
Someone tried to kill him twice. 
Why? 
Why murder an innocent child? 
Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see. 
 Saw what, my lady? 
 I don't know. 
But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. 
We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown. 
Did you notice the dagger the killer used? 
It's too fine a weapon for such a man. 
The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. 
Someone gave it to him. 
They come into our home and try to murder my brother? 
If it's war they want If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you. 
What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? 
Huh? 
Too easily words of war become acts of war. 
We don't know the truth yet. 
Lord Stark must be told of this. 
I don't trust a raven to carry these words. 
 I'll ride to King's Landing. 
 No. 
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. 
 I will go myself. 
 Mother, you can't. 
I must. 
I'll send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you. 
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. 
I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming. 
Let me accompany you at least. 
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone. 
What about Bran? 
I have prayed to the seven for more than a month. 
Bran's life is in their hands now. 
No, Khaleesi. 
You must look in his eyes always. 
Love comes in at the eyes. 
It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes. 
Finish a man? 
Oh. 
Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. 
Magisters sold their palaces. 
Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. 
They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all. 
Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. 
I-- I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top. 
You will make him like it, Khaleesi. 
Men want what they've never had. 
And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. 
Are you a slave, Khaleesi? 
Then don't make love like a slave. 
Very good, Khaleesi. 
Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you. 
I-- I don't think that this is the Dothraki way. 
If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you? 
No. 
No! 
Ajjalan anha zalat vitiherat yer hatif. 
Pardon me, Ser. 
Do I frighten you so much, girl? 
Or is it him there making you shake? 
He frightens me too. 
Look at that face. 
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. 
Why won't he speak to me? 
He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. 
Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers. 
He speaks damn well with his sword though. 
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. 
The royal executioner. 
What is it, sweet lady? 
Does the hound frighten you? 
Away with you, dog. 
You're scaring my lady. 
I don't like to see you upset. 
The Sun is finally shining. 
Come walk with me. 
Stay, lady. 
I probably shouldn't have any more. 
Father only lets us have one cup at feasts. 
My princess can drink as much as she wants. 
Don't worry you're safe with me. 
I'll get you! 
 Arya! 
 Ow! 
What are you doing here? 
 Go away. 
 Your sister? 
 And who are you, boy? 
 Mycah, my Lord. 
 He the butcher's boy. 
 He's my friend. 
A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? 
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. 
Let's see how good you are. 
She asked me to, my Lord. 
She asked me to. 
I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword. 
It's not a sword, my prince. 
It's only a stick. 
And you're not a Knight. 
Only a butcher's boy. 
That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that? 
 Stop it! 
 Arya, stay out of this. 
I won't hurt him... 
Much. 
Arya! 
Filthy little bitch! 
No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. 
You're spoiling it. 
You're spoiling everything! 
I'll gut you, you little cunt! 
 Arya! 
 Nymeria! 
 Arya! 
 Nymeria! 
No. 
No. 
Please don't. 
Arya, leave him alone. 
My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. 
Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help. 
Then go! 
Don't touch me. 
The wolf's not here. 
Look down by the stream. 
You've got to go. They'll kill you for 
what you did to Joffrey. 
Go on-- run. 
Go! 
Leave now! 
 It's a direwolf. 
 I'll check down here. 
I think I heard a noise. 
Go! 
Arya! 
 Distant man: Arya! 
 Ned: Arya! 
Arya-aa! 
Arya! 
Arya! 
My lord! 
My lord! 
They found her. 
She's unharmed. 
Where is she? 
She's been taken directly before the King. 
 Who took her? 
 The Lannisters found her. 
 Aryaaa! 
 Right, get back. 
The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him. 
Back! 
Back to the inn. 
All back! 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
 Are you hurt? 
 No. 
Oh, it's all right. 
What is the meaning of this? 
Why was my daughter not brought to me at once? 
How dare you speak to your King in that manner? 
Quiet, woman. 
Sorry, Ned. 
I never meant to frighten the girl. 
But we need to get this business done quickly. 
Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. 
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off. 
That's not true! 
She just... 
Bit him a little. 
 He was hurting Mycah. 
 Joff told us what happened. 
You and that boy beat him with clubs  while you set your wolf on him. 
 That's not what happened! 
Yes it is! 
They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river. 
 Liar! 
 Shut up! 
Enough! 
He tells me one thing, she tells me another. 
Seven hells! 
What am I to make of this? 
Where's your other daughter, Ned? 
In bed asleep. 
She's not. 
Sansa, come here, darling. 
Now, child... 
Tell me what happened. 
Tell it all and tell it true. 
It's a great crime to lie to a King. 
I don't know. 
I don't remember. 
Everything happened so fast. 
 I didn't see. 
 Liar! 
 Liar liar liar! 
 Arya! 
 Hey, stop it! That's enough of that. 
 Liar liar liar! 
 Stop! Arya! 
 She's as wild as that animal of hers. 
I want her punished. 
What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? 
Damn it, children fight. 
It's over. 
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life. 
You let that little girl disarm you? 
Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined. 
 I'll do the same with my son. 
 Gladly, your Grace. 
And what of the direwolf? 
What of the beast that savaged your son? 
I'd forgot the damned wolf. 
We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace. 
No? 
So be it. 
We have another wolf. 
As you will. 
 You can't mean it. 
 A direwolf's no pet. 
Get her a dog. 
She'll be happier for it. 
He doesn't mean Lady, does he? 
No no, not lady! 
Lady didn't bite anyone! 
 She's good! 
 Lady wasn't there! 
 You leave her alone! 
 Stop them. Don't let them do it. 
Please please, it wasn't Lady! 
Is this your command your Grace? 
 Where is the beast? 
 Chained up outside, your Grace. 
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor. 
No. 
Jory... 
Take the girls to their rooms. 
If it must be done, then I'll do it myself. 
Is this some trick? 
The wolf is of the north. 
She deserves better than a butcher. 
The butcher's boy you rode him down? 
He ran... 
Not very fast. 
﻿2 Welcome, Lord Stark. 
Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the small council. 
The honor of your presence is requested. 
Get the girls settled in. 
I'll be back in time for supper. 
 And, Jory, you go with them. 
 Yes, My Lord. 
If you'd like to change into something more appropriate... 
Thank the gods you're here, Stark. 
About time we had some stern northern leadership. 
About glad to see you're protecting the throne. 
Sturdy old thing. 
How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? 
Um, what's the line? 
The King shits and the Hand wipes. 
Very handsome armor. 
 Not a scratch on it. 
 I know. 
People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss. 
You've chosen your opponents wisely then. 
I have a knack for it. 
It must be strange for you coming into this room. 
I was standing right here when it happened. 
He was very brave, your brother. 
Your father too. 
They didn't deserve to die like that. 
Nobody deserves to die like that. 
But you just stood there and watched. 
500 men just stood there and watched. 
All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? 
No, Lord Stark. 
500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. 
Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. 
And later... 
When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... 
It felt like justice. 
Is that what you tell yourself at night? 
You're a servant of justice? 
That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back? 
Tell me If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more? 
You served him well when serving was safe. 
Lord Stark. 
Lord Varys. 
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. 
We are all praying for prince Joffrey's full recovery. 
A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. 
Renly! 
You're looking well. 
And you look tired from the road. 
I told them this meeting could wait another day, but But we have a kingdom to look after. 
I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. 
 No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me. 
 She has, Lord Baelish. 
I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well. 
All too well. 
I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone. 
Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with. 
It wasn't the man that I chose, My Lord. 
It was Catelyn Tully. 
A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree. 
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark. 
Grand Maester. 
How many years has it been? 
 You were a young man. 
 And you served another King. 
Oh, how forgetful of me. 
This belongs to you, now. 
Should we begin? 
 Without the King? 
 Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother. 
His Grace has many cares. 
He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load. 
We are the lords of small matters here. 
My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King. 
 Mmm, how much? 
 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer. 
Can the treasury bear such expense? 
I'll have to borrow it. 
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. 
We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. 
What's another 80,000? 
Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt? 
I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt. 
How could you let this happen? 
The Master of Coin finds the money. 
The King and the Hand spend it. 
I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm. 
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace  doesn't always listen. 
 "Counting coppers," he calls it. 
I'll speak to him tomorrow. 
This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford. 
As you will. 
But still, we'd best make our plans. 
There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. 
Forgive me, my Lords. 
I'm  I had a long ride. 
 You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure. 
 Ow! 
 Please, it's nearly healed. 
 It's ugly. 
 A King should have scars you fought off a direwolf. 
You're a warrior like your father. 
I'm not like him. 
I didn't fight off anything. 
It bit me and all I did was scream. 
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them. 
That's not true. 
You killed the beast. 
You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. 
I didn't, I When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. 
Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it. 
Do I have to marry her? 
Yes. 
She's very beautiful and young. 
If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. 
And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. 
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. 
You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. 
Do something nice for the Stark girl. 
 I don't want to. 
 No, but you will. 
The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road. 
We allow the northerners too much power. 
They consider themselves our equals. 
How would you handle them? 
I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army. 
 A royal army? 
 Why should every lord command his own men? 
It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. 
We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives. 
And if the northerners rebel? 
I'd crush them. 
Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. 
Uncle Kevan, maybe. 
And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord? 
 For me. I'm their King. 
 Mmhmm. 
But you've just invaded their homeland,  asked them to kill their brothers. 
 I'm not asking. 
The North cannot be held not by an outsider. 
It's too big and too wild. 
And when the winter comes, the seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. 
A good King knows when to save his strength... 
And when to destroy his enemies. 
So you agree... 
The Starks are enemies? 
Everyone who isn't us is an enemy. 
Enough of that, young lady. 
Eat your food. 
 I'm practicing. 
 Practicing for what? 
 The prince. 
 Arya, stop! 
He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend. 
The Hound killed your friend. 
The Hound does whatever the prince tells him to do. 
 You're an idiot. 
 You're a liar, and if you told the truth  Mycah would be alive. 
 Enough! 
What's happening here? 
Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady. 
Go to your room. 
We'll speak later. 
That's for you, love. 
The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. 
Don't you like it? 
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. 
 May I be excused? 
 You've barely eaten a thing. 
It's all right. 
Go on. 
War was easier than daughters. 
 Go away! 
Ned: Arya, open the door. 
May I come in? 
 Whose sword is that? 
 Mine. 
Give it to me. 
I know this maker's mark. 
This is Mikken's work. 
Where did you get this? 
This is no toy. 
 Little ladies shouldn't play with swords. 
 I wasn't playing. 
And I don't want to be a lady. 
Come here. 
Now what do you want with this? 
It's called Needle. 
Oh, a blade with a name. 
And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? 
Your sister? 
Do you know the first thing about sword fighting? 
Stick 'em with the pointy end. 
That's the essence of it. 
I was trying to learn. 
I asked Mycah to practice with me. 
I asked him. 
 It was my fault. 
 No, sweet girl. 
No no, you didn't kill the butcher's boy. 
I hate them! 
I hate all of them. 
The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa. 
Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... 
And asked to call the prince a liar. 
So was I! 
He is a liar. 
Shh, darling, listen to me. 
Sansa will be married to Joffrey's someday. 
She cannot betray him. 
She must take his side even when he's wrong. 
But how you can let her marry someone like that? 
Well. 
Look at me. 
You're a Stark of Winterfell. 
You know our words. 
Winter is coming. 
You were born in the long summer. 
You've never known anything else. 
But now winter is truly coming. 
And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. 
Sansa is your sister. 
I don't hate her. 
Not really. 
I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. 
We've come to a dangerous place. 
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. 
All right? 
Go on. 
It's yours. 
I can keep it? 
Try not to stab your sister with it. 
If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it. 
Don't listen to it. 
Crows are all liars. 
 I know a story about a crow. 
 I hate your stories. 
I know a story about a boy who hated stories. 
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. 
Those were always your favorites. 
Those weren't my favorites. 
My favorites were the scary ones. 
Oh, my sweet summer child. 
What do you know about fear? 
Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. 
Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. 
That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the white walkers move through the woods. 
Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. 
Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. 
And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. 
So is this the sort of story that you like? 
In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. 
They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds What are you telling him now? 
Only what what are the little lord wants to hear. 
Get your supper. 
I want some time with him. 
 One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macomber. 
Maybe we do. 
How do you feel? 
You still don't remember anything? 
Bran, I've seen you climb a thousand times. 
In the wind, in the rain A thousand times. 
 You never fall. 
 I did though. 
It's true, isn't it, what Maester Luwin says about my legs? 
I'd rather be dead. 
 Don't ever say that. 
 I'd rather be dead. 
Fewer eyes back here, My Lady. 
But still too many. 
It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. 
And no one knew who I was the last time I came either. 
My Lady. 
Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. 
Would you mind following us? 
I would. 
We've done nothing wrong. 
We've been instructed to escort you into the city. 
Instructed? 
I don't know who's providing your instructions, but Follow me, Lady Stark. 
Cat! 
Go on. 
Go upstairs. 
You little worm! 
You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a Pssst! 
I meant no disrespect to you of all people. 
How dare you bring me here! 
Have you lost your mind? 
No one will come looking for you here. 
Isn't that what you wanted? 
I'm truly sorry about the locale. 
How did you know I was coming to King's Landing? 
A dear friend told me. 
 Lady Stark. 
 Lord Varys. 
To see you again after so many years is a blessing. 
Your poor hands. 
How did you know I was coming? 
Knowledge is my trade, My Lady. 
Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? 
My little birds are everywhere... 
Even in the north. 
They whisper to me the strangest stories. 
Valyrian steel. 
Do you know whose dagger this is? 
I must admit I do not. 
Well well, this is an historic day. 
Something you don't know that I do. 
There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. 
 It's mine. 
 Yours? 
At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. 
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. 
When the Knight of the Glowers unseated him, I lost this dagger. 
To whom? 
Tyrion Lannister. 
The Imp. 
Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of. 
 If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. 
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. 
Pyp. 
Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us? 
Next! 
Next! 
Well, Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. 
Go clean yourselves up. 
There's only so much I can stomach in a day. 
A charming man. 
I don't need him to be charming. 
I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch. 
And how's that going, Commander Mormont? 
Slowly. 
A raven came for Ned Stark's son. 
Good news or bad? 
Both. 
Lord Stark. 
I meant to give you this earlier. 
So forgetful these days. 
A raven from Winterfell this morning. 
Good news? 
Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife? 
 My wife is in Winterfell. 
 Is she? 
Woman: Yes, I'm looking at you. 
I thought that she'd be safest in here. 
One of several such establishments I own. 
You're a funny man. 
Huh? 
A very funny man. 
Ned! 
Ah, the Starks Quick tempers, slow minds. 
You broke my nose, bastard! 
It's an improvement. 
If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit. 
I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did. 
What're you looking at, Half Man? 
I'm looking at you. 
Yes. 
You've got an interesting face. 
Hmm, very distinctive faces. 
All of you. 
And what do you care about our faces? 
It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. 
Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it. 
We'll talk later, Lord Snow. 
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. 
No one but you. 
My father knew and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same. 
Grenn's father left him too... 
Outside a farmhouse when he was three. 
Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. 
His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. 
He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. 
I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. 
Fascinating stories. 
They hate me because I'm better than they are. 
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. 
I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. 
Oh... 
Your brother Bran. 
He's woken up. 
The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason. 
We have proof. 
We have the blade. 
Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. 
The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf. 
Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. 
He's like a little brother to me, Ned. 
He would never betray my trust. 
I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. 
A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything. 
I won't forget this. 
You're a true friend. 
Don't tell anyone. 
I have a reputation to maintain. 
 How could you be so stupid? 
 Calm down. 
He's a child 10 years old. 
 What were you thinking? 
 I was thinking of us. 
You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. 
 What has the boy told them? 
 Nothing. 
He's said nothing. 
He remembers nothing. 
Then what are you raving about? 
What if it comes back to him? 
If he tells his father what he saw We'll say he was lying. 
We'll say he was dreaming. 
We'll say whatever we like. 
I think we can outfox a 10-year-old. 
 And my husband? 
 I'll go to war with him if I have to. 
They can write a ballad about us: "The War for Cersei's Cunt." 
 Let me go. 
 Never. 
 Let me go. 
 The boy won't talk. 
And if he does, I'll kill him. 
Him, Ned Stark, the King the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world. 
I wish I could see the girls. 
 It's too dangerous. 
 Just for a moment. 
Until we know who our enemies are I know they did it, Ned. 
The Lannisters. 
In my bones, I know it. 
Littlefinger's right. 
I can't do anything without proof. 
And if you find the proof? 
Then I bring it to Robert... 
And hope he's still the man I once knew. 
You watch yourself on the road, huh? 
That temper of yours is a dangerous thing. 
My temper? 
Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday. 
He still loves you. 
Does he? 
Off with you. 
Yes, it's been a long time. 
But I still remember every face. 
You remember your first? 
Of course, Your Grace. 
Who was it? 
A Tyroshi. 
 Never learned the name. 
 Hmm. 
How'd you do it? 
Lance through the heart. 
Quick one. 
Lucky for you. 
Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. 
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. 
He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with single swing of his sword. 
I knocked him down with the hammer. 
Gods, I was strong then. 
Caved in his breastplate. 
Probably shattered every rib he had. 
Stood over him, hammer in the air. 
Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait! 
Wait." 
They never tell you how they all shit themselves. 
They don't put that part in the songs. 
Stupid boy. 
Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. 
He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. 
Wine! 
Lancel. 
Gods, what a stupid name. 
Lancel Lannister. 
Who named you? 
Some halfwit with a stutter? 
What are you doing? 
 It's empty, Your Grace. 
 What do you mean it's empty? 
 There's no more wine. 
 Is that what empty means? 
So get more. 
Tell your cousin to get in here. 
Kingslayer! 
Get in here. 
Surrounded by Lannisters. 
Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. 
It must wound your pride, huh? 
Standing out there like a glorified sentry. 
Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... 
Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. 
So come on. 
We're telling war stories. 
Who was your first kill, not counting old men? 
One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood. 
I was there that day. 
You were only a squire, 16 years old. 
You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. 
Best move I ever saw. 
A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina. 
Your outlaw... 
Any last words? 
 I cut his head off, so no. 
 Hmmm. 
What about Aerys Targaryen? 
What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? 
I never asked. 
Did he call you a traitor? 
Did he plead for a reprieve? 
He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... 
"Burn them all." 
If that's all, Your Grace... 
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves? 
The Dothraki don't believe in money. 
Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts. 
 From whom? 
 If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices: Pay tribute or fight. 
An easy choice for most. 
Of course, sometimes it's not enough. 
Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. 
He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. 
Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months  and need the practice. 
 Kash qoy qoyi thira disse. 
Tell them all to stop. 
You want the entire horde to stop? 
For how long? 
Until I command them otherwise. 
You're learning to talk like a Queen. 
Not a Queen. 
A Khaleesi. 
Annakhas dozgosores. 
 You dare! 
You give commands to me? 
To me? 
You do not command the dragon. 
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. 
I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. 
Do you hear me? 
Hash shafka zali nharees, zhey Khaleesi? 
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi. 
No. 
Ishish chare acharoe hash me nem éjervae  nharesoon. 
 Rakharo say you should take ear,  to teach respect. 
 Please please, don't hurt him. 
Tell him I don't want my brother harmed. 
Khaleesi vos zalo meme nem azisa. 
Huh? 
 Shafki. 
Mormont! 
Kill these Dothraki dogs! 
I am your King! 
Shall we return to the Khalasar, khaleesi? 
Uh uh uh uh uh. 
You walk. 
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. 
 I'm leaving this morning. 
 You're leaving? 
I'm the First Ranger. 
My job is out there. 
 There have been disturbing reports. 
 What kind of reports? 
The kind I don't want to believe. 
I'm ready. 
I won't let you down. 
You're not going. 
You're no ranger, Jon. 
 But I'm better than every  Better than no one! 
Here... 
A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. 
We'll speak when I return. 
 A bear's balls. 
 Oh, you're joking? 
And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. 
When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves. 
And how do a bear's balls taste? 
A bit chewy. 
And what about you, My Lord? 
What's the strangest thing you've eaten? 
Do Dornish girls count? 
So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits? 
Aye. 
But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. 
Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. 
Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory. 
They have a better chance finding feed than glory. 
The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? 
Is that what we are, Lannister? 
An army of jesters in black? 
You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny. 
I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. 
But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. 
Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. 
They die in pain. 
And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort. 
Do you think I'm plump? 
Listen, Benjen May I call you Benjen? 
Call me what you like. 
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. 
I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. 
I've great admiration for you as First Ranger. 
You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word "but" really counts. 
But... 
I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. 
I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it. 
You're right. 
The wildlings are no different from us. 
A little rougher maybe. 
But they're made of meat and bone. 
I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. 
It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. 
You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there. 
Are you going below? 
 Keep well, keep warm. 
 Enjoy the capital, brother. 
Oh, I always do. 
I think he's starting to like me. 
 "Going below"? 
 Aye. 
Into the tunnel and out the other side. 
He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two. 
So you're heading down to King's Landing too. 
Aye, day after tomorrow. 
I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons. 
Let's share the road. 
I could use some decent company. 
I... I travel a bit 
on the grubby side, My Lord. 
Not this time. We'll be staying at 
the finest castles and inns. 
No one turns away a Lannister. 
At Jakar? 
Athjahakar. 
Ath ja haker. 
Athjahakar. 
Athjahakar. 
Yes, Khaleesi. 
Oh, what are you doing? 
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? 
You change, Khaleesi. 
For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. 
It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. 
But a man in full plate Shori tawakof the arakh won't get through the steel. 
That's where the broadsword has the advantage. 
Designed for piercing plate. 
 Armor. 
 Armor. 
Armor make a man... 
 Vroz? 
 Slow. 
 Slow. 
 It's true, but it also keeps a man alive. 
He still is. 
A man of great honor and I betrayed him. 
I don't think she wants to eat dog. 
The Khaleesi have baby inside her. 
It is true. 
She does not bleed for two moons. 
Her belly start to swell. 
 She does not want to eat horse. 
I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. 
I need to ride to Qohor. 
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak. 
Don't worry. 
I'll catch you. 
The horde's easy to find. 
Don't stand so still. 
It's harder to hit a moving target. 
Except for you. 
You move too much. 
I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me. 
How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion? 
Eight-- no, nine. 
All of them brief? 
They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon. 
This summer has lasted nine. 
But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. 
The Starks are always right eventually: Winter is coming. 
This one will be long and dark things will come with it. 
We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. 
They're fleeing south. 
The ones who flee say they've seen the White Walkers. 
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids. 
One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. 
He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off. 
The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. 
And it has has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. 
There are less than a thousand of us now. 
We can't man the other castles on the Wall. 
We can't properly patrol the wilderness. 
We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed  and fed. 
 Your sister sits by the side the King. 
Tell her we need help. 
When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready. 
I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister. 
It's either me or this cold. 
And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. 
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South? 
I expect I will. 
Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing. 
If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. 
Tell him I'd visit if I could. 
Of course. 
He'll never walk again. 
If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. 
You take care, Snow. 
Farewell, My Lord. 
You are late, boy. 
Tomorrow you will be here at midday. 
Who are you? 
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel. 
Tomorrow you will catch it. 
Now pick it up. 
That is not the way, boy. 
This is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it. 
 It's too heavy. 
 It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. 
Just so. 
One hand is all that is needed. 
Now you are standing all wrong. 
Turn your body sideface. 
Yes. 
So. 
You are skinny. 
That is good. 
The target is smaller. 
Now the grip Let me see. 
Yes. 
The grip must be delicate. 
What if I drop it? 
The steel must be part of your arm. 
Can you drop part of your arm? No. 
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. 
He knows these things. 
You must listen to me, boy. 
I'm a girl. 
Boy, girl you are a sword, that is all. 
That is the grip. 
You are not holding a battle-axe. 
 You are holding  A needle. 
Ahhh. 
Just so. 
Now we will begin the dance. 
Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. 
This is the Bravo's dance... 
The water dance. 
It is swift and sudden. 
All men are made of water, do you know this? 
If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. 
Now you will try to strike me. 
Ha! 
Up! 
Ha! 
Ah. 
Dead. 
Oh! 
Dead. 
 Hup! 
Very dead. 
Come. 
Ah ah ah! 
 Hup! 
Again, faster. 
Ah. 
﻿1  Game of Thrones 1x04  
Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things The little lord's been dreaming again. 
 We have visitors. 
 I don't want to see anyone. 
Really? 
If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. 
Anyway, you don't have a choice. 
Robb's waiting. 
 I don't want to go. 
 Neither do I. 
But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say. 
Hodor! 
 Hodor? 
 Help Bran down the hall. 
Hodor. 
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit. 
Any man of The Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell. 
Any man of The Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy? 
I'm not your boy, Lannister. 
I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away. 
Then you might learn a lord's courtesy. 
So it's true. 
Hello, Bran. 
Do you remember anything about what happened? 
He has no memory of that day. 
 Curious. 
 Why are you here would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? 
 My neck is beginning to hurt. 
 Kneel, Hodor. 
 Do you like to ride, Bran? 
 Yes. 
Well, I mean I did like to. 
 The boy has lost the use of his legs. 
 What of it? 
With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride. 
 I'm not a cripple. 
 Then I'm not a dwarf. 
My father will rejoice to hear it. 
I have a gift for you. 
Give that to your saddler. 
He'll provide the rest. 
You must shape the horse to the rider. 
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice. 
Will I really be able to ride? 
You will. 
On horseback you will be as tall as any of them. 
Is this some kind of trick? 
Why do you want to help him? 
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things. 
You've done my brother a kindness. 
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours. 
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. 
There's a brothel outside your walls. 
There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier. 
Couldn't resist some Northern ass? 
If you like redheads, ask for Ros. 
Come to see me off, Greyjoy? 
Kind of you. 
Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters. 
 He's not my master. 
 No, of course not. 
What happened here? 
Where is Lady Stark? 
Why didn't she receive me? 
 She wasn't feeling well. 
 She's not in Winterfell, is she? 
 Where did she go? 
 My Lady's whereabouts My Lady? 
Your loyalty to your captors is touching. 
Tell me, how do you think balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? 
I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. 
I believe your uncles were responsible? 
Must have been a pretty sight. 
Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. 
Yes, a great victory for your people. 
 Shame how it all turned out. 
 We were outnumbered 10 to one a stupid rebellion then. 
I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. 
Now here you are, your enemy's squire. 
 Careful, imp. 
 I've offended you. 
Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. 
Anyway, don't despair. 
I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. 
Your next tumble with Ros is on me. 
I'll try not to wear her out. 
Shoulder, legs. 
Leg, shoulder, leg. 
Left foot forward. 
Good. 
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. 
Put all your weight behind it. 
What in seven hells is that? 
They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in. 
Tell them your name. 
Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill I mean, I was of Horn Hill. 
 I've come to take the black. 
 Come to take the black pudding. 
Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. 
Rast... 
See what he can do. 
I yield. 
 Please, no more. 
 On your feet. 
Pick up your sword. 
Hit him till he finds his feet. 
It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down South. 
 Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. 
 Jon! 
Again, harder. 
I yield! 
Enough! 
He yielded. 
Looks like the bastard's in love. 
All right then, Lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. 
You two. Three of you ought 
to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. 
All you've got to do is get past the bastard. 
 Are you sure you want to do this? 
 No. 
Yield yield yield! 
I yield. 
We're done for today. 
Go clean the armory. 
That's all you're good for. 
 Well fought! 
 Piss off. 
Did he hurt you? 
I've had worse. 
You can call me Sam... 
If you want. 
 My mother calls me Sam  it's not going to get any easier, you know? 
You're going to have to defend yourself. 
Why didn't you get up and fight? 
I wanted to. 
 I just couldn't. 
 Why not? 
I'm a coward. 
 My father always says so. 
 The Wall's no place for cowards. 
You're right. 
I'm sorry. 
I just... wanted 
to thank you. 
A bloody coward. 
People saw us talking to him. 
Now they'll think we're cowards too. 
You're too stupid to be a coward. 
 You're too stupid to be a  Quick now, before summer's over. 
C'mere! 
Hyah hyah! 
Vaes Dothrak the city of the horselords. 
A pile of mud. 
Mud and shit and twigs  best these savages can do. 
 These are my people now. 
You shouldn't call them savages. 
I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. 
This is my army. 
Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army. 
If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms? 
The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. 
They fear any water their horses can't drink. 
But if they did? 
King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different. 
 And you know these men? 
 I fought beside them once, long ago. 
Now Ned Stark wants my head. 
He drove me from my land. 
You sold slaves. 
Aye. 
 Why? 
 I had no money and an expensive wife. 
And where is she now? 
In another place, with another man. 
 Your Grace? 
 Yes, my dear? 
They call you the Last Dragon... 
They do. 
You have dragon's blood in your veins? 
It's entirely possible. 
What happened to the dragons? 
I was told that brave men killed them all. 
The brave men didn't kill dragons. 
The brave men rode them. 
Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. 
The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the usurper is keeping warm for me. 
The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... 
Melted together like so many candles. 
I have always wanted to see a dragon. 
There is nothing in the world that I would rather see. 
Really. 
Why dragons? 
They can fly. 
And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... 
Far away. 
And they can kill. 
Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... 
...Like so many candles. 
Ow. 
Yes. 
Seeing a dragon would make me very happy. 
Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy. 
I was not locked in. 
I have seen things. 
 What have you seen? 
 I've seen... 
A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. 
 Ooh. 
 I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. 
And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. 
So... 
Have you seen one? 
 A pirate ship? 
 A dragon. 
No. 
No, the last one died many years before I was born. 
I'll tell you what I have seen: Their skulls. 
They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. 
When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. 
When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. 
The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. 
Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. 
But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... 
They got bigger and bigger and bigger. 
There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius Archonei, Meraxes, Vhagar... 
And Balerion the dread... 
...Whose fire forged 
the Seven Kingdoms into one. 
What happened to the skulls? 
I don't know. 
The usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. 
Scattered to the wind. 
That's very sad. 
Yes, it is. 
What did I buy you for? 
 To make me sad? 
 No, your Grace. 
To, uh, teach your sister. 
To teach my sister how to be a better lover? 
You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? 
Oh, you pretty little idiot. 
Go on then. 
Get on with it. 
Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. 
And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. 
All the Lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince what if I have a girl? 
Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them. 
What if I only have girls? 
I wouldn't worry about that. 
Jeyne Poole's mother had five children all of them girls. 
Yes, but it's highly unlikely. 
But what if? 
Well, if you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother. 
And everyone would hate me. 
Nobody could ever hate you. 
 Joffrey does. 
 Nonsense. 
Why would you say such a thing? 
That business with the wolves? 
Sansa, I've told you a hundred times:  A direwolf is not  please shut up about it. 
Do you remember your lessons? 
Who built the Iron Throne? 
Aegon the Conqueror. 
And who built the Red Keep? 
Maegor the Cruel. 
And how many years did it take to build my grandfather and Uncle were murdered here, weren't they? 
They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes. 
 The Mad King. 
 Commonly known as the Mad King. 
Why were they killed? 
You should be speak to your father about these matters. 
I don't want to speak to my father-- ever. 
Sansa, you will find it in your heart to forgive your father. 
No, I won't. 
It's The Hand's tournament that's causing  all this trouble, My Lords. 
 The King's tournament. 
I assure you The Hand wants no part of it. 
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. 
Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters. 
 Dreadful. 
 If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can. 
 I need more men. 
 Ned: You'll get 50. 
 Lord Baelish will see it paid for. 
 I will? 
You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. 
I'll also give you 20 of my household guard till the crowds have left. 
Thank you, My Lord Hand, Ser. 
They will be put to good use. 
The sooner this is over, the better. 
The realm prospers from such events, My Lord. 
They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes. 
And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged. 
I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. 
 Hmmm. 
 Now... 
If there's nothing else, My Lords? 
Oh, this heat. 
On days like this, I envy you Northerners your summer snows. 
Until tomorrow, My Lord I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn. 
Lord Arryn? 
Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us. 
I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. 
His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. 
I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. 
Lord Jon often came to me for counsel. 
Why? 
I have been Grand Maester for many years. 
Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since What did Jon want the night before he died? 
Oh, he came inquiring after a book. 
A book? 
What book? 
Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, My Lord. 
A ponderous Tome. 
No, I'd like to read it. 
"The Lineages and Histories of the Great H of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children." 
"Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. 
Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt." 
As I said, My Lord, a ponderous read. 
Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it? 
He did not, My Lord. 
And I did not presume to ask. 
 Jon's death... 
 Such a tragedy. 
...Did he say anything to you 
during his final hours? 
Nothing of import, My Lord. 
Oh-- there was one phrase he kept repeating: "The seed is strong," I think it was. 
 "The seed is strong"? 
 Mm. 
 What does that mean? 
 Oh, the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. 
For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words. 
And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness? 
What else could it be? 
Poison. 
A disturbing thought. 
No no no, I don't think it likely. 
The Hand was loved by all. 
What sort of man would dare I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon. 
Yes, women, cravens... 
And eunuchs. 
Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch? 
Everybody knows that. 
Yes yes, of course. 
How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know. 
I've taken enough of your time. 
No trouble at all, My Lord. 
It's a great honor thank you. 
I'll find my own way out. 
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours. 
It's a hard fall down these steps. 
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. 
 Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. 
 Cats? 
Syrio says. 
He says every swordsman should study cats. 
They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. 
You have to be quick to catch them. 
He's right about that. 
Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us? 
Well, he needs to get his strength back first. 
He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard. 
 He can't be one now, can he? 
 No. 
But someday he could be Lord of a Holdfast or sit on the King's Council. 
Or he might raise castles like Brandon the builder. 
Can I be Lord of a Holdfast? 
You will marry a high lord and rule his castle. 
And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords. 
Hmm? 
No. 
That's not me. 
Hello. 
Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new Watch partner. 
I should warn you, I don't see all that well. 
Come stand by the fire. 
 It's warmer. 
 No, that's all right. I'm fine. 
You're not. 
You're freezing. 
I don't like high places. 
You can't fight. 
You can't see. 
You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. 
What are you doing here, Sam? 
On the morning of my 18th Nameday, my father came to me. 
"You're almost a man now," he said... 
"But you're not worthy of my land and title. 
Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start North. 
If you do not," he said... 
"Then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. 
Or so I'll tell your mother. 
Nothing would please me more." 
Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he? 
Yes, he is. 
I'm not going to get any better, you know? 
Well... 
You can't get any worse. 
I hear you're reading a boring book. 
Hmph. 
Pycelle talks too much. 
Oh, he never stops. 
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? 
Not surprising. 
Until recently, he was only a squire Jon Arryn's squire. 
He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death. 
Knighted for what? 
Why are you telling me this? 
I promised cat that I'd help you. 
Where is Ser Hugh? 
 I'll speak to him. 
 A singularly bad idea. 
Do you see that boy there? 
One of Varys's little birds. 
The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. 
Now look there. 
That one belongs to the Queen. 
And do you see that septa pretending to read her book? 
Varys or the Queen? 
No, she's one of mine. 
Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely? 
 Yes. 
 The wiser answer was no, My Lord. 
Get a message to this paragon of yours discreetly send him to question Ser Hugh. 
After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. 
He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel. 
 Why? 
 I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death. 
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you. 
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse. 
...Two, three, 
24, five, six, 27,  28, 29  Ser Hugh? 
30, 31, 32  Ser Hugh! 
 As you can see, I'm busy. 
I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King. 
I'm the Captain of his guard. 
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name, Ser... 
No "Ser." 
I'm not a knight. 
I see. Well, it just 
so happens that I am. 
He said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself. 
He's a knight, you see. 
Ah, a knight. 
They strut around like roosters down here. 
Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way. 
You shouldn't be out here, My Lord. 
 There's no telling who has eyes where. 
 Let them look. 
The former Hand did call on me, My Lord, several times. 
I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage. 
What did Lord Arryn want? 
He always came to see the boy. 
I'd like to see him as well. 
As you Gendry! My lord. 
Here he is. 
Strong for his age. 
He works hard. 
Show the hand the helmet you made, lad. 
 This is fine work. 
 It's not for sale. 
Boy, this is the King's Hand! 
 If his lordship wants the helm  I made it for me. 
 Forgive him, My Lord. 
 There's nothing to forgive. 
When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about? 
He just asked me questions is all, My Lord. 
What kind of questions? 
About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. 
But then he started asking me about my mother. 
 Your mother? 
 Who she was, what she looked like. 
What did you tell him? 
She died when I was little. 
She had yellow hair. 
She'd sing to me sometimes. 
Look at me. 
Get back to work, lad. 
If the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me. 
Find anything? 
King Robert's bastard son. 
He likes that. 
This is for the King from Lord Stark. 
Should I leave it with shhh. 
Listen. 
Do you hear them? 
How many do you think are in there with him? 
Huh? 
 Guess. 
 Three? 
Four. 
He likes to do this when I'm on duty he makes me listen as he insults my sister. 
Forgive me, My Lord Why do I have to forgive you? 
Have you wronged me? 
We've met before, you know. 
Have we? 
Strange, I've forgotten. 
The siege of Pyke. 
We fought side by side one afternoon. 
Ah. 
 That's where you got your scar? 
 Aye. 
Oh. 
One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye. 
 Vicious sons of whores. 
 They like their bloodshed. 
They stopped liking it at the end. 
That was a proper battle. 
Do you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach? 
With his burning sword? 
I'll remember that till the day I die. 
I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. 
It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop. 
Theon? 
He's a good lad. 
I doubt it. 
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! 
Let me smell it. 
Come here. 
Can I leave this with you? 
The message from Lord Stark. 
I don't serve Lord Stark. 
 Where have you been? 
 Watch duty. 
 With Sam. 
 Ah, prince porkchop. 
 Where is he? 
 He wasn't hungry. 
Impossible! 
That's enough. 
Sam's no different from the rest of us. 
There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. 
We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. 
Never again, no matter what Thorne says. 
He's our brother now and we're going to protect him. 
You are in love, Lord Snow. 
You girls can do as you please. 
But if Thorne puts me up against lady piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon. 
No one touches Sam. 
What are you waiting for? 
Attack him! 
You get in there. 
Hit me. 
Go on, hit me! 
I yield! 
Yield yield. 
I yield. 
You think this is funny, do you? 
When you're out there beyond The Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? 
Or a sniveling boy? 
You send this whore to give me commands? 
I should have sent you back her head! 
Forgive me, Khaleesi. 
I did as you asked. 
Hush now. 
It's all right. 
 Irri, take her and leave us. 
 Yes, Khaleesi. 
 Why did you hit her?! 
 How many times do I have to tell you? 
You do not command me. 
I wasn't commanding you. 
I just wanted to invite you to supper. 
 What's this? 
 It's a gift. 
 I had it made for you. 
 Dothraki rags? 
 Are you going to dress me now? 
 Please. 
This stinks of manure. 
All of it. 
Stop-- stop it. 
You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? 
Next you'll want to braid my hair. 
You've no right to a braid. 
You've won no victories yet. 
You do not talk back to me! 
You are a horselord's slut. 
And now you've woken the dragon I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! 
I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. 
The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands. 
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in mole's town. 
I wouldn't doubt it. 
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? 
Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side? 
 Sally on the side? 
 It's silly, isn't it? 
What, we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate? 
It's absurd. 
I didn't think you'd be so upset about it. 
Why not? 
 Because I'm fat? 
 No. 
But I like girls just as much as you do. 
They might not like me as much. 
I've never been with one. 
You've probably had hundreds. 
No. 
As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you. 
Yeah. 
I find that hard to believe. 
I came very close once. 
I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but you didn't know where to put it? 
I know where to put it. 
Was she... 
Old and ugly? 
Young and gorgeous. 
A whore named Ros. 
What color hair? 
 Red. 
 Oh, I like red hair. 
And her, um... 
Her... 
 You don't want to know. 
 That good? 
 Better. 
 Oh no. 
So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect--? 
What's my name? 
Jon Snow? 
And why is my surname snow? 
Because... 
You're a bastard from the North. 
I never met my mother. 
My father wouldn't even tell me her name. 
I don't know if she's living or dead. 
I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a Fisherman's wife... 
Or a whore. 
So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. 
But I couldn't do it. 
Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? 
It's not a good life for a child. 
Ah, mmm. 
So... 
You didn't know where to put it? 
Enjoying yourselves? 
You look cold, boys. 
It is a bit nippy. 
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. 
It's still summer. 
Do you boys even remember the last winter? 
How long has it been now? 
What, 10 years? 
I remember. 
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? 
Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built? 
 I build my own fires. 
 That's admirable. 
I spent six months out there, beyond The Wall during the last winter. 
It was supposed to be a two-week mission. 
We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. 
So we went out to look for some of his men capture them, gather some knowledge. 
The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. 
Harder than you'll ever be. 
They know their country better than we do. 
They knew there was a storm coming in. 
So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. 
And we got caught in the open. 
Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. 
If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. 
And all in darkness. 
You don't know cold. 
Neither of you do. 
The horses died first. 
We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. 
Eating the horses was easy. 
But later when we started to fall... 
That wasn't easy. 
We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? 
Soft, fat boys like you. 
We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. 
Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of The Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. 
You're boys still. 
And come the winter you will die... 
Like flies. 
I hit him. 
I hit the dragon. 
Your brother Rhaegar was the Last Dragon. 
Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake. 
He is still the true king. 
The truth now: Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne? 
No. 
But the common people are waiting for him. 
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return. 
The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. 
They don't care what games the high lords play. 
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah? 
Home. 
I pray for home too. 
My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. 
He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. 
He'll never take us home. 
Lover's quarrel? 
I'm sorry. 
Do I...? 
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. 
He's known an old friend of the family. 
I've known your mother a long long time. 
 Why do they call you Littlefinger? 
 Arya! 
 Don't be rude! 
 No, it's quite all right. 
When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname. 
I've been sitting here for days! 
Start the damn joust before I piss myself! 
Gods, who is that? 
Ser Gregor Clegane. 
They call him the Mountain. 
The hound's older brother. 
 And his opponent? 
 Littlefinger: Ser Hugh of the Vale. 
He was Jon Arryn's squire. 
Lo how far he's come. 
Yes yes, enough of the bloody pomp. 
Have at it! 
Not what you were expecting? 
Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? 
Lovely little tale of brotherly love. 
The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. 
Gregor a few years older already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. 
Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. 
One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. 
Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. 
Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. 
There aren't very many people who know that story. 
I won't tell anyone. 
I promise. 
No, please don't. 
If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you. 
My Lord, her Grace the Queen. 
 Your Grace. 
 You're missing your tournament. 
Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine. 
I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us the ugliness with the wolves. 
And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. 
Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. 
How is Sansa? 
She likes it here. 
She's the only Stark who does. 
Favors her mother, not much of the North in her. 
 What are you doing here? 
 I might ask the same of you. 
What is it you hope to accomplish? 
The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise. 
You can't change him. 
You can't help him. 
He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. 
You'll try your best to pick up the pieces. 
If that's my job, then so be it. 
You're just a soldier, aren't you? 
You take your orders and you carry on. 
I suppose it makes sense. 
Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow. 
I was also trained to kill my enemies, your Grace. 
As was I. 
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk! 
And to you. 
Boy! 
Bread, meat and beer. Quickly. 
Ah, good idea, grandfather. 
I'm starving. 
A song while we wait or--? 
I'd rather throw myself down a well. 
Now now, grandfather, this may be your last chance if you're heading North. 
The only music the Northerners know is the howling of wolves! 
Gods. 
I'm sorry, My Lord. 
We're full up. 
 Every room. 
 Tyrion: My men can sleep in the stable. 
As for myself, I don't require a large room. 
Truly, My Lord, we have nothing. 
Is there nothing I can do... 
...To remedy this? 
You can have my room. 
Now there's a clever man. 
You can manage food, I trust? 
Yoren, dine with me. 
 Aye, My Lord. 
 My Lord of Lannister! 
Might I entertain you while you eat? 
I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing! 
Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. 
Lady Stark! 
What an unexpected pleasure. 
I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell. 
Lady Stark! 
I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. 
You, Ser, is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat? 
It is, My Lady. 
And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun? 
She is. 
The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. 
My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen. 
Our lord is honored by his trust. 
I envy your father all his fine friends, Lady Stark, but I don't quite see the purpose of this. 
I know your sigil as well the Twin Towers of Frey. 
How fares your lord, Ser? 
Lord Walder is well, My Lady. 
He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th Nameday. 
He plans to take another wife. 
This man came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. 
In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the King's Justice. 
﻿1  Game of Thrones 1x05  
The Wolf and the Lion Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital? 
No. 
I stood vigil for him myself last night. 
He had no one else. 
He'd never worn this armor before. 
Bad luck for him going against the Mountain. 
Who determines the draw? 
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark. 
Aye. 
But who holds the straws? 
You've done good work, sisters. 
Life is strange. 
Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the trident. 
I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan. 
As is my wife. 
I don't think the widow's life would suit her. 
You're too modest. 
I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights. 
My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. 
I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat. 
He was a fine man, your father. 
What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime. 
And that lad he was a squire until a few months ago. 
How could he afford a new suit of armor? 
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? 
I hear the King wants to joust today. 
Yes, that will never happen. 
Robert tends to do what he wants. 
If the King got what he wanted all the time, he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion. 
It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go. 
Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat ass. 
Did you know that? 
Look at this idiot! 
One ball and no brains. 
He can't even put a man's armor on him properly. 
You're too fat for your armor. 
Fat? 
Fat, is it? 
Is that how you speak to your King? 
That was funny, is it? 
No, Your Grace. 
No? 
You don't like the Hand's joke? 
You're torturing the poor boy. 
You heard the Hand. 
The King's too fat for his armor. 
Go find the breastplate stretcher-- now! 
"The breastplate stretcher"? 
How long before he figures it out? 
Maybe you should have one invented. 
All right, all right. 
But you watch me out there I still know how to point a Lance. 
You have no business jousting. 
Leave that for the young men. 
Why, because I'm king? 
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody! 
 And who's going to hit you back? 
 Anybody who can. 
 And the last man in his saddle  Will be you. 
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you. 
Are you telling me those cowards would let me win? 
Aye. 
 Drink. 
 I'm not thirsty. 
Drink. 
Your King commands it. 
Gods, too fat for my armor. 
Your squire... 
A Lannister boy? 
Mm. A bloody idiot, 
but Cersei insisted. 
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. 
"Cersei Lannister will make a good match," she told me. 
"You'll need her father on your side." 
I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. 
Enough of this. 
Let's go watch 'em ride. 
At least I can smell someone else's blood. 
 Robert? 
 What? 
Oh. 
An inspiring sight for the people, eh? 
Come, bow before your King! 
Bow, you shits! 
 Where's Arya? 
 At her dancing lessons. 
The knight of the flowers. 
Thank you, Ser Loras. 
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him. 
 Hey. 
 I can't watch. 
100 gold dragons on the Mountain. 
I'll take that bet. 
Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? 
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? 
Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys? 
Or you could even buy a friend. 
He's going to die. 
Ser Loras rides well. 
Such a shame, Littlefinger. 
It would have been so nice for you to have a friend. 
And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend? 
Loras knew his mare was in heat. 
Quite crafty, really. 
Ser Loras would never do that. 
There's no honor in tricks. 
No honor and quite a bit of gold. 
Sword! 
Leave him be! 
Stop this madness in the name of your King! 
Let him go! 
I owe you my life, Ser. 
I'm no Ser. 
Remove his hood. 
 on that Eve, the captive Imp   downwards from his horse did limp   no more would he preen and primp   in garb of red and gold.  
This isn't the Kingsroad. 
You said we were riding for Winterfell. 
I did... 
Often and loudly. 
Very wise. 
They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. 
Word's probably gotten to my father by now. 
He'll be offering a handsome reward. 
Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. 
Would you be so good as to untie me? 
 And why would I do that? 
 Why not? 
Am I going to run? 
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. 
Unless a Shadowcat ate me first. 
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns. 
Ah, the eastern road. 
We're going to the Vale. 
You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. 
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister? 
Five years ago. 
She's changed. 
She was always a bit touched, but now you might as well kill me here. 
 I am not a murderer, Lannister. 
 Neither am I! 
I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life. 
 The dagger found  What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade? 
 Should I gag him? 
 Why? 
Am I starting to make sense? 
Rodrik! 
My Lady, this way. 
Untie me. 
If I die, what's the point? 
Ah! 
Rodrik? 
I'll be fine, My Lady. 
There's no need to bloody yourself. 
Your first? 
You need a woman. 
Nothing like a woman after a fight. 
I'm willing if she is. 
Bran. 
The Iron Islands. 
A Kraken. 
We do not sow. 
 Lords? 
 The Greyjoys. 
Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking. 
And failed rebellions. 
A stag a crowned stag now that Robert's King. 
 Good. 
 Words: Ours is the fury. 
 Lords: The Baratheons. 
 Mmhmm. 
The Westerlands. 
 Sigil: A lion. 
 Mmm. 
A Lannister always pays his debts. 
No. 
A common saying, but not their official motto. 
The Lannisters. 
 We're still on their words. 
 I don't know them. 
You do know them. 
Think. 
"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken." 
 That's House Martell. 
 "Righteous in wrath." 
 House Hornwood. 
 "Family, duty, honor." 
Those are Tully words your mother's. 
 Are we playing a game? 
 Family, duty, honor... 
 Is that the right order? 
 You know it is. 
Family comes first? 
Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family. 
How can she protect the family if she's not with her family? 
Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept and then she left! 
When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. 
I placed you in her arms. 
From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. 
Absolutely. 
 Fiercely. 
 Why did she leave? 
I still can't tell you,  but she will be home soon. 
 Do you know where she is now? 
Today? 
No, I don't. 
Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon? 
Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good. 
I'll never shoot another arrow. 
And where is that written? 
 You need legs to work a bow. 
 Hmm. 
If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback. 
Really Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. 
Why shouldn't you? 
Shh, keep it down. 
You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls. 
I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here. 
Important enough for the likes of you. 
You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know. 
Who, the Imp? 
I'd call him half a nobleman. 
Jealous? 
Why should I be jealous? 
Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. 
What's a dwarf like down below? 
I've always wondered. 
 Might surprise you. 
 Hmm? 
He's good with his fingers too. 
And his tongue. 
Generous tipper. 
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister. 
You are jealous. 
I'm a Greyjoy. 
We've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. 
There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters. 
And what about the Starks? 
I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old. 
A ward that's a nice word for it. 
Your father rebelled against King Robert  and if he does it again  My father fought for the freedom of his people. 
What did your father do? 
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore. 
You're a very serious boy. 
 I'm not a boy. 
 Oh yes, you are. 
A serious boy with a serious cock. 
I don't want to pay for it. 
Then get yourself a wife. 
Come on. 
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
How is your son, My Lord? 
He'll never walk again. 
But his mind is sound? 
So they say. 
A blessing then. 
I suffered an early mutilation myself. 
Some doors close forever... 
Others open in the most unexpected places. 
May I? 
If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. 
And who would mourn poor Varys then? 
North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. 
But there are things you must know. 
You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool your friend, I know, but a fool and doomed unless you save him. 
I've been in the capital a month. 
Why have you waited so long to tell me this? 
I didn't trust you. 
So why do you trust me now? 
The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. 
There are few men of honor in the capital. 
You are one of them. 
I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem. 
What sort of doom does the King face? 
The same sort as Jon Arryn. 
The tears of Lys, they call it. 
A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. 
It leaves no trace. 
Who gave it to him? 
Some dear friend, no doubt. 
But which one? 
There were many. 
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. 
There was one boy. 
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn. 
The squire, Ser Hugh? 
Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely. 
If Ser Hugh poisoned him who paid Ser Hugh? 
Someone who could afford it. 
Jon was a man of peace. 
He was Hand for 17 years 17 good years. 
Why kill him? 
He started asking questions. 
Man's voice: He's found one bastard already. 
He has the book. 
The rest will come. 
Man #2: And when he knows the truth, what will he do? 
The gods alone know. 
The fools tried to kill his son. 
What's worse they botched it. 
The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. 
 We will be at war soon, my friend. 
 What good is war now? 
We're not ready. 
If one Hand can die, why not a second? 
This Hand is not the other. 
We need time. 
Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. 
You know how these savages are. 
"Delay," you say. 
"Move fast," I reply. 
This is no longer a game for two players. 
It never was. 
The first to arrive and the last to leave. 
I admire your industry. 
You do move quietly. 
We all have our qualities. 
You look a bit lonely today. 
You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. 
First boy is on the house. 
I think you're mistaking business with pleasure. 
Am I? 
All those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things. 
Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations. 
Oh, I'm sure. 
Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear. 
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally important. 
Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? 
Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees? 
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse. 
And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. 
Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. 
The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot. 
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws. 
Strictly speaking. 
Tell me does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box? 
I've often wondered. 
Do you know I have no idea where they are? 
And we had been so close. 
But enough about me. 
How have you been since we last saw each other? 
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you? 
Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King. 
 Saw me with your own eyes? 
 Eyes I own. 
Council business. 
We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark. 
Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. 
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... 
To think a simple word to the Queen  one shudders at the thought. 
 Ooh. 
But you know something? 
I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me. 
 Have you? 
 Yes. 
Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers. 
Was that you under the bed? 
And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... 
Council business? 
Of course you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea. 
You're from there yourself, after all. 
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? 
I'd like to think we are. 
So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies. 
To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right loyalty to the realm  Oh, please. 
 To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King What are you two conspiring about? 
Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. 
My brother is coming. 
To a small council meeting? 
Disturbing news from far away. 
Haven't you heard? 
Off with you. 
No begging. 
I'm not a beggar. 
I live here. 
D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing? 
I want to see my father. 
I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me. 
You want your father, boy? 
He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends. 
My father is Hand of the King! 
I'm not a boy. 
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes. 
Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing? 
You know I had half my guard out searching for you? 
You promised me this would stop. 
They said they were going to kill you. 
 Who did? 
 I didn't see them,  but I think one was fat. 
 Oh, Arya. 
I'm not lying! 
They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage. 
 Where did you hear this? 
 In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls. 
What were you doing in the dungeons? 
Chasing a cat. 
Pardon, My Lord. 
There's a night's watchman here begging a word. 
He says it's urgent. 
 Your name, friend? 
 Yoren, if it please. 
This must be your son. 
He has the look. 
I'm a girl! 
Did Benjen send you? 
No one sent me, My Lord. 
I'm here to find men for the Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service. 
Oh, we'll find recruits for you. 
Thank you, My Lord. 
But that's not why I disturb you now. 
Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black makes him as much my brother as yours. 
It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse. 
There are others riding too. 
The whole city will know by tomorrow. 
Know what? 
Best said in private, My Lord. 
Go on. 
We'll talk more later. 
Jory, take her safely to her room. 
Come along, My Lady. 
You heard your father. 
How many guards does my father have? 
Here in King's Landing? 50. 
You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you? 
No fear on that count, little lady. 
 Well? 
 It's about your wife, My Lord. 
She's taken the Imp. 
You're far from home, Lady Stark. 
To whom do I speak? 
Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale. 
Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit? 
There was no time to send word. 
May I ask, My Lady, why he is with you? 
That's why there was no time. 
 He is my prisoner. 
 He doesn't look like a prisoner. 
My sister will decide what he looks like. 
Yes, My Lady. 
She will at that. 
The Eyrie. 
They say it's impregnable. 
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes I'll impregnate the bitch. 
I like you. 
Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. 
A meeting has been called. 
I need to see the King first-- alone. 
The King is at the small council meeting, My Lord. 
He has summoned you. 
 Is it about my wife? 
 No, My Lord. 
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen. 
The whore is pregnant. 
 You're speaking of murdering a child. 
 I warned you this would happen. 
Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. 
Well, hear it now. 
I want 'em dead, mother and child both. 
And that fool Viserys as well. 
Is that plain enough for you? 
I want them both dead. 
You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this. 
Honor?! 
I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! 
One King, Seven Kingdoms. 
Do you think honor keeps them in line? 
Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? 
It's fear fear and blood. 
Then we're no better than the Mad King. 
Careful, Ned. 
Careful now. 
You want to assassinate a girl because the Spider heard a rumor? 
No rumor, My Lord. 
The princess is with child. 
Based on whose information? 
Ser Jorah Mormont. 
He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens. 
Mormont? 
You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact? 
Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. 
Small difference, I know, to an honorable man. 
He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. 
We commit murder on the word of this man? 
And if he's right? 
If she has a son? 
A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army... 
 What then? 
 The Narrow Sea still lies between us. 
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water. 
Do nothing? 
That's your wise advice? 
Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores? 
You're my council. 
Counsel! 
Speak sense to this honorable fool. 
I understand your misgivings, My Lord. 
Truly, I do. 
It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. 
Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. 
Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed. 
I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? 
How many towns will burn? 
Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live? 
We should have had them both killed years ago. 
When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. 
Cut her throat. 
Be done with it. 
I followed you into war twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. 
But I will not follow you now. 
The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child. 
She dies. 
I will have no part in it. 
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. 
You'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will. 
And good luck to him. 
I thought you were a better man. 
Out. 
Out, damn you. 
I'm done with you. 
Go, run back to Winterfell! 
I'll have your head on a spike! 
I'll put it there myself, you fool! 
You think you're too good for this? 
Too proud and honorable? 
This is a war! 
I'll go ahead with my daughters. 
Get them ready. 
Do it yourself. 
 Don't ask anyone for help. 
 Right away, My Lord. 
Lord Baelish is here for you. 
His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. 
The word "treason" was mentioned. 
What can I do for you? 
When do you return to Winterfell? 
Why? What do you care? 
If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. 
If that sort of thing still interests you. 
I don't have the time. 
It won't take more than an hour. 
But as you please. 
Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. 
 Who are your best two swords? 
 Heward and Wyl. 
Find them and meet me at the stables. 
You bring him here without permission? 
You pollute my home with his presence? 
Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. 
You remember her, don't you? 
Isn't he beautiful? 
And strong too. 
Jon knew it. 
His last words were "the seed is strong." 
He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. 
Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale. 
Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters,  warning me  To stay away from them! 
Not to bring one here! 
Mommy? 
 Is that the bad man? 
 It is. 
He's little. 
He's Tyrion the imp of house Lannister. 
He killed your father. 
He murdered the Hand of the King! 
Oh, did I kill him too? 
I've been a very busy man. 
You will watch your tongue! 
These men are knights of the Vale. 
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn. 
Every one of them would die for me. 
If any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do. 
You can't hurt us. 
No one can hurt us here. 
Tell him, mommy! 
 Tell him! 
 Shh shh shh, my sweet boy. 
He's just trying to frighten us. 
Lannisters are all liars. 
No one will hurt my baby. 
Mommy... 
I want to see the bad man fly. 
Perhaps you will, my little love. 
This man is my prisoner. 
I will not have him harmed. 
Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. 
Take him down below so he can rest. 
Introduce him to Mord. 
You go sleep, dwarf man. 
Sleep good, little dwarf man! 
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head. 
Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. 
He adores the man. 
You're jealous. 
Are you sure this won't hurt? 
Only if I slip. 
 And you'd prefer me like this? 
 Mmhmm. 
If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy. 
I want you. 
My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. 
He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. 
Oh, and you're not? 
Loras Tyrell, the knight of the flowers? 
How many wars have you fought in? 
Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours? 
Hold still. 
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood you did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee. 
His eye was dangling out of the damn socket! 
He shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight. 
Easy for you to say. 
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman. 
It's not a gift. 
No one gave it to me. 
I'm good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick. 
I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you. 
Yes well, I guess we'll never know. 
 Everywhere? 
 Everywhere. 
So how did it end up? 
The Targaryen girl will die? 
It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. 
Robert's rather tasteless about it. 
Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches. 
It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife. 
He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. 
You have to give it to the Lannisters they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money. 
I have an outrageous amount of money. 
Not as much as the Lannisters. 
But a lot more than you. 
Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. 
Last time we were out there for two weeks. 
Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day, all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh. 
Oh. But Robert 
loves his killing. 
 And he's the King. 
 Hmm. 
 How did that ever happen? 
 Because he loves his killing. 
And he used to be good at it. 
Do you know who should be king? 
 Be serious. 
 I am. 
My father could be your bank. 
I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you. 
I'm fourth in line. 
And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? 
Joffrey is a monster. 
 Tommen is eight. 
 Stannis? 
Stannis has the personality of a lobster. 
He's still my older brother. 
 What are you doing?! 
 Look at it. 
You cut me. 
It's just blood. 
We've all got it in us. 
Sometimes a little spills. 
If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. 
You need to get used to it. 
Go on. Look. 
People love you. 
They love to serve you because you're kind to them. 
They want to be near you. 
You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. 
You don't love killing. 
Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? 
That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared? 
You would be a wonderful King. 
I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. 
You seemed so good together. 
I'm glad I could do something to make you happy. 
Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces. 
I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime. 
No. 
He's not serious enough. 
I'll say this for Ned Stark: He's serious enough. 
Was it really worth it? 
Losing him this way? 
I don't know. 
But I do know this: If the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea... 
We won't be able to stop them. 
The Dothraki don't sail. 
Every child knows that. 
They don't have discipline. 
They don't have armor. 
They don't have siege weapons. 
It's a neat little trick you do: You move your lips and your father's voice comes out. 
Is my father wrong? 
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back. 
We hole up in our castles a wise move only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. 
They leave us in our castles. 
They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. 
How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? 
When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all? 
We still outnumber them. 
Which is the bigger number: Five or one? 
Five. 
Five... 
One. 
One army a real army united behind one leader with one purpose. 
Our purpose died with the Mad King. 
Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. 
And everybody wants something different. 
Your father wants to own the world. 
Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow. 
What do you want? 
We haven't had a real fight in nine years. 
Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. 
And that's all the realm is now: Back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. 
Sometimes I don't know what holds it together. 
Our marriage. 
Ah, so here we sit 17 years later, holding it all together. 
Don't you get tired? 
Every day. 
How long can hate hold a thing together? 
Well, 17 years is quite a long time. 
Yes, it is. 
Yes, it is. 
What was she like? 
You've never asked about her, not once. 
Why not? 
At first, just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. 
I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. 
When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. 
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. 
And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you. 
As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it. 
So why now? 
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over? 
You want to know the horrible truth? 
I can't even remember what she looked like. 
I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... 
Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind. 
I felt something for you once, you know? 
I know. 
Even after we lost our first boy. 
For quite a while, actually. 
Was it ever possible for us? 
Was there ever a time, ever a moment? 
No. 
Does that make you feel better or worse? 
It doesn't make me feel anything. 
She looks like him, don't she, My Lord? 
She has his nose, his black hair. 
Aye. 
Tell him when you see him, My Lord. 
If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is. 
I will. 
And tell him I've been with no one else. 
I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new. 
I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. 
The King was always good to me. 
When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want? 
He wasn't that sort of man, My Lord. 
He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy. 
He looks healthy enough to me. 
The girl shall want for nothing. 
Brothels make a much better investment than ships, I've found. 
Whores rarely sink. 
What do you know of King Robert's bastards? 
Well, he has more than you, for a start. 
 Ned: How many? 
 Does it matter? 
If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents. 
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why? 
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps 
Robert wanted them looked after. 
He was overcome with fatherly love. 
Come. 
 Jory! 
 My Lord. 
Such a small pack of wolves. 
Stay back, Ser. 
This is the Hand of the King. 
Was the Hand of the King. 
Now I'm not sure what he is lord of somewhere very far away. 
What's the meaning of this, Lannister? 
Get back inside where it's safe. 
I'm looking for my brother. 
You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? 
Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man. 
I remember him well. 
It seems he had some trouble on the road. 
You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you? 
He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes. 
My lords! 
I'll bring the city watch. 
Come, Stark. 
I'd rather you die sword in hand. 
 If you threaten My Lord again  Threaten? 
As in, "I'm going to open your lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of"? 
You kill me, your brother's a dead man. 
You're right. 
Take him alive. 
Kill his men. 
Yah! 
My brother, Lord Stark we want him back. 
﻿1  Game of Thrones 1x06  
A Golden Crow Your pardon, Your Grace. 
I would rise, but... 
Do you know what your wife has done? 
She did nothing I did not command. 
Who'd have thought she had it in her? 
By what right dare you lay hands on my blood? 
I am the King's Hand, charged with keeping the peace... 
You were the King's Hand. 
You shall now be held accountable. 
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?! 
Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime. 
He butchered my men Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime. 
 Quiet, woman. 
 Jaime has fled the city. 
Give me leave to bring him back to justice. 
I took you for a King. 
 Hold your tongue. 
 He's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other. 
I should wear the armor and you the gown. 
I shall wear this like a badge of honor. 
Wear it in silence or I'll honor you again. 
See what she does to me? 
My loving wife. 
I should not have hit her. 
That was not... 
That was not Kingly. 
If we don't act, there will be a war. 
So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing. 
She's had her fun, now put an end to it. 
You hear me? 
Send a raven and put an end to it. 
And what about Jaime Lannister? 
 What about Jaime? 
 I'm half a Kingdom in debt to his bloody father. 
I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits. 
I don't want to know. 
This is what matters I can't rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats. 
So enough. 
As you command, Your Grace. 
With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight. 
Piss on that. 
Send a raven. 
I want you to stay. 
I'm the King. 
I get what I want. 
I never loved my brothers. 
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true. 
You were the brother I chose. 
We'll talk when I return from the hunt. 
The hunt? 
Killing things clears my head. 
You'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away. 
You'll hate it more than I do. 
The Targaryen girl seven hells, don't start with her again. 
The girl will die and I'll hear no more of it. 
Put on the badge. 
And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister. 
Khaleesi? 
Oh, Khaleesi! 
You're hurt. 
 Not too fast. 
 Come on, Dancer. 
When are you gonna tell him? 
Not now. 
 Blood for blood. 
 Bran: Come on! 
You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others. 
 Robb: You're talking about war. 
 I'm talking about justice. 
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army. 
A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. 
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him you want me to march on Casterly Rock? 
 You're not a boy anymore. 
 Bran: Come on. 
They attacked your father. 
They've already started the war. 
It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't. 
And it's not your duty, because it's not your House. 
Where's Bran? 
I don't know. 
It's not my House. 
Robb? 
All alone in the deep, dark woods. 
I'm not alone. 
My brother is with me. 
I don't see him. 
Got him hidden under your cloak? 
Ooh, that's a pretty pin. 
 Silver. 
 We'll take the pin and the horse. 
Get down. 
Be quick about it. 
I can't. 
The saddle the straps. 
What's wrong with you? 
You some kind of cripple? 
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell. 
If you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed! 
Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth. 
The boy's worth nothing dead. 
Benjen Stark's own blood? 
Think what Mance would give us. 
Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North. 
We're going as far South as South goes. 
There ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne. 
Drop the knife! 
Let him go and I'll let you live. 
Robb. 
 Robb. 
 Shut up. 
Drop the blade! 
 No, don't. 
 Do it. 
Are you all right? 
Yes. 
It doesn't hurt. 
Tough little lad. 
In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. 
Well done. 
Have you lost your mind? 
What if you'd missed? 
He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat. 
 You don't have the right  To what, to save your brother's life? 
It was the only thing to do, so I did it. 
What about her? 
Give me my life, My Lord, and I'm yours. 
We'll keep her alive. 
Mord! 
Turnkey! 
Mord! 
Mord! 
Dwarf man making noise! 
How would you like to be rich? 
Dwarf man still making noise. 
My family is rich. 
We have gold, lots of gold. 
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in No gold! 
Well, I don't have it here. 
No gold. 
Fuck off. 
I don't want to practice today. 
No? 
They killed Jory. 
My father is hurt. 
I don't care about stupid wooden swords. 
You are troubled. 
 Yes. 
 Good! 
Trouble is the perfect time for training. 
When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens. 
I don't like dolls and k You're not here. 
You're with your trouble. 
If you are with your trouble when fighting happens More trouble for you. 
Just so. 
How can you be quick as a snake... 
...Or as quiet 
as a shadow... 
...When you are 
somewhere else? 
You are fearing for your father, hmm? 
That is right. 
 Do you pray to the gods? 
 The old and the new. 
There is only one God and his name is Death. 
And there is only one thing we say to Death: "Not today." 
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj! 
 Priestess: Khalakka Dothrae!

She's doing well. 
She'll never keep it down. 
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj! 
Khalakka Dothrae! 
Khalakka Dothrae! 
Tell me what she's saying. 
"The prince is riding. 
I have heard the thunder of his hooves. 
Swift as the wind he rides. 
His enemies will cower before him... 
And their wives will weep tears of blood." 
She's going to have a boy. 
He won't be a real Targaryen. 
He won't be a true Dragon. 
Vezh fin saja rhaesheseres!

The stallion is the Khal of Khals. 
He shall unite the people into a single Khalasar.

Rhaego... 
They love her. 
Rhaego! Rhaego! 
Rhaego! 
Rhaego... 
She truly is a queen today. 
Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. 
You know the law. 
It's not my law. 
They don't belong to you. 
Whatever is hers is also mine. 
Once, perhaps. 
If I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship. 
Two eggs-- a ship and an army. 
 And you have all three. 
 I need a large army. 
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. 
The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. 
Never. 
Not a piece of it. 
How can I carry what I need to carry without it? 
Hmm? 
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love? 
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. 
You don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? 
Don't think I know what you want? 
I don't care. 
You can have her. 
She can be Queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. 
But let me go. 
You can go. 
You can't have the eggs. 
You swore an oath to me. 
Does loyalty mean nothing to you? 
It means everything to me. 
And yet here you stand. 
And yet here I stand. 
Mord! 
Mord! 
Mord! 
Mord! 
Mord. 
Noise again! 
 About the gold... 
 No gold! 
 No gold. 
 Listen to me! 
Listen to me. 
Sometimes possession is an abstract concept When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine. 
Where? 
Where? 
I don't know where, but when they free me You want free? 
Go be free. 
Have you ever heard the phrase "rich as a Lannister"? 
Of course you have! 
You're a smart man. 
You know who the Lannisters are. 
I am a Lannister. 
Tyrion, son of Tywin! 
And of course, you have also heard the phrase, "a Lannister always pays his debts." 
If you deliver a message from me... 
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. 
I will owe you gold. 
If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do. 
What message? 
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes. 
You wish to confess your crimes? 
Yes, My Lady. 
I do, My Lady. 
The sky cells always break them. 
Speak, Imp. 
Meet your gods as an honest man. 
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? 
I'm a vile man, I confess it. 
My crimes and sins are beyond counting. 
I have lied and cheated... 
gambled and whored. 
I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. 
You want specifics, I suppose. 
When I was seven I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. 
I stole her robe. 
She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears. 
If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. 
When I was 10 I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit. 
When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. 
Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice. 
When I was 12 I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. 
I flogged the one-eyed snake. 
I skinned my sausage. 
I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. 
At least I hope she did. 
Once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb  into a brothel  Silence! 
What happened next? 
What do you think you're doing? 
Confessing my crimes. 
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King. 
Oh, I'm very sorry. 
I don't know anything about all that. 
You've had your little joke. 
I trust you enjoyed it. 
Mord, take him back to the dungeon. 
But this time find a smaller cell... 
With a steeper floor. 
Is this how justice is done in the Vale? 
You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve? 
Where is the King's Justice? 
I am accused and demand a trial! 
If you're tried and found guilty, then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life. 
I understand the law. 
We have no executioner in the Eyrie. 
Life is more elegant here. 
Open the moon door. 
You want a trial, My Lord Lannister. 
Very well. 
My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment. 
Then you will leave... 
By one door or the other. 
No need to bother Lord Robin. 
I demand a trial by combat. 
You have that right. 
My Lady, I beg the honor. 
Let me be your champion. 
The honor should be mine. 
For the love I bore your Lord husband, let me avenge his death. 
 I'll fight for you, My Lady. 
 It'll be my honor. 
 The honor should be mine. 
 Make the bad man fly! 
Ser Vardis... 
You're quiet. 
Don't you want to avenge my husband? 
With all my heart, My Lady. 
But the Imp is half my size. 
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice. 
Agreed. 
You demanded a trial by combat. 
Now I demand a champion. 
I have that right, same as you. 
My Lady, I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you. 
I wouldn't be too glad, Ser. 
I name my brother Jaime Lannister. 
The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here. 
Send a raven for him. 
I'm happy to wait. 
The trial will be today. 
Do I have a volunteer? 
Anyone? 
Anyone? 
I think we can assume that no one is willing I'll stand for the dwarf. 
More wine, Your Grace? 
 What was I saying? 
 Renly: Simpler time. 
It was! It was. 
You're too young to remember. 
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy? 
 It was, Your Grace. 
 The enemy was right  in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. 
Nothing like today. 
 It sounds exhilarating. 
 Exhilarating, yes. 
Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. 
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl? 
Once. 
I think. 
You think? 
I think you'd remember. 
Back in our day, you weren't a real man until you'd fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. 
 We used to call it "making the eight." 
 Those were some lucky girls. 
You ever make the eight, Barristan? 
I don't believe so, Your Grace. 
Those were the days. 
Which days, exactly? 
The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? 
Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? 
Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground? 
Easy, boy. 
You might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King. 
I suppose it was all rather heroic... 
If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight. 
More wine, Your Grace? 
They burned most everything in the Riverlands: Our fields; Our granaries; our homes. 
They took our women, then they took 'em again. 
When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. 
They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire. 
Brigands, most likely. 
They weren't thieves. 
They didn't steal nothing. 
They even left something behind, Your Grace. 
It's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King. 
The King is hunting. 
Fish. 
The Sigil of House Tully. 
Isn't that your wife's house Tully, My Lord Hand? 
These men, were they flying a Sigil? 
 A banner? 
 None, your Hand. 
The one who was leading them... 
Taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword. 
That sounds like someone we know. 
The Mountain. 
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane. 
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? 
The man is an anointed knight. 
I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog. 
I'm sure you have as well. 
Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife? 
Maester Pycelle: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the King's protection,  it would be  That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital. 
Well... 
I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our King, Robert. 
Lord Beric Dondarrion. 
You shall have the command. 
Assemble 100 men  and ride to Ser Gregor's keep. 
 As you command. 
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I charge you to bring the King's Justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. 
I denounce him and attaint him. 
I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings,  and sentence him to death. 
 My Lord... 
This-- this is a drastic action. 
It would be better to wait for King Robert's return. 
 Grand Maester Pycelle. 
 My Lord. 
Send a raven to Casterly Rock. 
Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. 
He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. 
A bold move, My Lord, and admirable. 
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? 
Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. 
Gold wins wars, not soldiers. 
Then how come Robert is King and not Tywin Lannister? 
Hold! 
 Attack attack! 
 Come on, Ser Vardis! 
Attack! 
Stand and fight, coward! 
Yes! 
Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him. 
What are you doing? 
Get up! 
Get up, get up, get up! 
Raise your sword. 
Raise it! 
Get up, man! 
 On your feet! 
 Get up! 
Get up and fight, Ser Vardis! 
No! Have mercy! 
Is it over? 
You don't fight with honor! 
No. 
He did. 
Can I make the little man fly now? 
Not this little man. 
This little man is going home. 
I believe you have something of mine. 
A Lannister always pays his debts. 
You wear your hair like a real southern lady now. 
Well, why shouldn't I? 
We're in the South. 
It's important to remember where you come from. 
I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles. 
My mother isn't from the North. 
I'm aware of that. 
Why do you care? 
Do you even have hair under there? 
Yes. 
I have hair. 
I've never seen it. 
Would you like to? 
No. 
Where are you from anyway? 
The North or the South? 
I come from a very small village in Oh, wait. 
I just realized I don't care. 
 Sansa  Septa. 
Now you are being rude. 
My prince. 
My prince. 
My Lady. 
I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. 
With your permission? 
It's beautiful, like the one your mother wears. 
You'll be queen someday. 
It's only fitting you should look the part. 
Will you forgive me for my rudeness? 
There's nothing to forgive. 
You're My Lady. 
One day we'll be married in the throne room. 
Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the Salt Shore in the South, and you will be Queen over all of them. 
I'll never disrespect you again. 
I'll never be cruel to you again. 
Do you understand me? 
You're My Lady now, from this day until my last day. 
Stop. 
 Stop! 
 Whoa. 
 What are you doing? 
 Going to King's Landing. 
In a turnip cart? 
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor. 
And you can afford that? 
Some of my friends are more generous than others. 
There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing. 
So I'll have lots of company. 
Yes, you'll be very popular... 
Until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out. 
And what will happen to me if I stay here? 
Will I become Lady Greyjoy,  mistress of the Iron Islands? 
 Don't be a fool. 
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing. 
Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back. 
There's nothing left for me here. 
Let's go, Stefon. 
Giddyup. 
Let me see it one more time! 
See what? 
I'm going to miss you. 
I know. 
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell. 
 What?! 
 Listen  What about Joffrey? 
 Are you dying because of your leg? 
Is that why you're sending us home? 
What? No. 
Please, father. 
Please don't. 
You can't. 
I've got my lessons with Syrio. 
I'm finally getting good. 
This isn't a punishment. 
I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety. 
Can we take Syrio back with us? 
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? 
I can't go. 
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. 
I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen  and have his babies. 
 Seven hells. 
When you're old enough, I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! 
He'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair. 
The lion'sot s Sigil, idiot. 
He's a stag, like his father. 
He is not. 
He's nothing like that old drunk King. 
Go on, girls. Get your Septa and start 
packing your things. 
 Wait! 
 Come on. 
But it's not fair! 
"Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair." 
"Axel Baratheon, black of hair." 
"Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair." 
"Steffon Baratheon, black of hair." 
"Robert Baratheon, black of hair." 
"Joffrey Baratheon... 
Golden-haired." 
Daenerys! 
Where's my sister? 
Stop him. 
Where is she? 
Hmm? 
Where is she? 
I'm here for the feast. 
 The whore's feast? 
 Come. 
Get your hands off me! 
No one touches the Dragon! 
Khal rhae mhar!

I'm here for the feast.

That is no place for a King. 
You are no King. 
Keep away from me! 
Viserys, please. 
There she is. 
Put the sword down. 
They'll kill us all. 
They can't kill us. 
They can't shed blood in their sacred city. 
But I can. 
I want what I came for. 
I want the crown he promised me. 
He bought you. 
But he never paid for you. 
Tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back. 
He can keep the baby. 
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.

He says yes. 
You shall have a golden crown... 
That men shall tremble to behold. 
That was all I wanted. 
What-what was promised. 
Qora mae. 
No! 
No! 
You cannot touch me.

No, you can't!

Not dirts. Lands. 
Lands, yes... 
There are thousands of ships in the free cities. 
Wooden horses that fly across the sea... 
Let's speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs. 
lt's not a chair. It's a... 
A chair for a King to sit upon, Or... 
...a Queen. 
A khal does not need a chair to sit upon. 
He only needs a steed. 
Sweet reds. I have it. I have it.  
Sweet reds... 
l have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor! 
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours! 
l have them! l have them! 
A taste for the Khaleesi? 
l have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady. 
One taste and you'll name your first child after me. 
Put down that cask. 
Moon of my life. 
Are you hurt? 
Jorah the Andal, l heard what you did. 
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours. 
l make this gift to you for what you did. 
And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world, l will also pledge a gift. 
l will give him the iron chair... 
...that his mother's father sat upon. 
I will give The Lands of the Andals. [[l will give him Seven Kingdoms.]] 
l, Drogo, will do this. 
l will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends... 
...and ride wooden horses across the black salt water... 
 ...as no Khal has done before. 
l will kill the men in iron suits... 
 ...and tear down their stone houses. 
 l will rape their women... 
...take their children as slaves... 
...and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak. 
This, l vow... 
...l, Drogo, son of Bharbo. 
l swear before the Mother of Mountains... 
...as the stars look down in witness. 
As the stars look down in witness. 
﻿312 Lamb men make good slaves. 
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold... 
...and silk, and steel. 
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi. 
The riders do her honour. 
lf her wailing offends the Khaleesi, l will bring you her tongue. 
Do as l command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why. 
Mago! 
Only while blood of my blood still lives. 
 She is my prize. I will take her with an arakh. 
It's an insult! Khaleesi will give me my prize 
or I will take it with my arakh. 
She will speak before me; until then you will keep yourself quite. 
Moon of my life, Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount. 
Tell me the truth of this. 
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars. 
l have claimed many daughters this day... 
...so they cannot be mounted. 
This is the way of war. 
These women are slaves now... 
...to do with as we please. 
lt pleases me to keep them safe. 
lf your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives. 
Does the horse mate with the lamb? 
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike. 
You are a foreigner. 
You do not command me. 
l am Khaleesi. l do command you. 
See how fierce she grows? 
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire. 
l will hear no more. 
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock. 
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal. 
Be still. 
Don't move! 
l will not have your body burned. 
l will not give you that honour. 
The beetles will feed on your eyes. 
The worms will crawl through your lungs. 
The rain will fall on your rotting skin... 
...until nothing is left of you but bones! 
First you have to kill me. 
l already have. 
My sun and stars is hurt. 
A scratch... 
...moon of my life. 
Where are the healers? 
This is the bite of a fly. 
l can help the great rider with his cut. 
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep. 
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:34,186* She is mine. Let her speak. 
Witch. 
Too many words. A witch's words poison the ears. 
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars... 
...it makes me hurt to see you bleed. 
﻿1  Game of Thrones 1x09  
Baelor You've seen better days, My Lord. 
Another visit? 
It seems you're my last friend. 
No no, many still love you. 
Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life. 
On her knees, begging for me, hmmm. 
Did you laugh with the others? 
You do me wrong, My Lord. 
Your blood is the last thing I want. 
I don't know what you want. 
I've given up trying to guess. 
When I was still a boy before they cut my balls off with a hot knife I traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. 
They taught me that each man has a role to play. 
The same is true at court. 
I am the master of whisperers. 
My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. 
I'm a good actor, My Lord. 
Huh. 
Can you free me from this pit? 
I could. 
But will I? 
No. 
As I said, I'm no hero. 
What do you want? 
Tell me. 
No riddles, no stories tell me, what do you want? 
Peace. 
Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? 
Loyal lad fighting for his father's freedom. 
Robb? 
He's just a boy. 
Boys have been conquerors before. 
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the King's the late King's brother. 
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the Throne, he is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy. 
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. 
The Throne is his by rights. 
Tsk tsk. Sansa pleaded 
so sweetly for your life, it would be a shame to throw it away. 
Cersei is no fool. 
She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one. 
You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King, who butchered my men, who crippled my son? 
I want you to serve the realm! 
Tell the Queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. 
Cersei knows you as a man of honor. 
If you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the Black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son. 
You think my life is some precious thing to me? 
That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... 
Of what? 
You grew up with actors. 
You learned their craft and you learned it well. 
But I grew up with soldiers. 
I learned how to die a long time ago. 
Pity. 
Such a pity. 
What of your daughter's life, My Lord? 
Is that a precious thing to you? 
It's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda. 
Or so Walder Frey would have you think. 
Keep shooting them down. 
We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters. 
He's grandfather's bannerman. 
We can't expect his support? 
Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. 
Look. 
Father rots in a dungeon. 
How long before they take his head? 
We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now. 
Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. 
We've got five times his numbers. 
You can take the Twins if you have to. 
Not in time. Tywin Lannister 
marches north as we speak. 
The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll. 
Have my horse saddled and ready. 
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannis. 
Or throw you in a dungeon. 
Or slit your throat. 
My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. 
Whatever it took. 
If I'm going to lead this army, I can't have other men doing my bargaining for me. 
I agree. 
 I'll go. 
 Theon: You can't! 
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl. 
He would never harm me. 
Unless there was a profit in it. 
What do you want? 
It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, My Lord. 
Oh spare me. 
Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. 
What am I supposed to do with you? 
Father, you forget yourself. 
Lady Stark is here Who asked you? 
You're not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. 
Do I look dead to you? 
Father, please I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? 
Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn't squirted you into her belly. 
All right, you come forward. 
There. Now that I've observed 
the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths. 
Is there somewhere we can talk? 
We're talking right now. 
Fine. 
Out! All of you! 
You too. 
You see that? 
15 she is. 
A little flower. 
And her honey's all mine. 
I'm sure she will give you many sons. 
Huh. Your father didn't 
come to the wedding. 
He is quite ill, My Lord. 
Didn't come to the last one either. 
Or the one before that. 
Your family has always pissed on me. 
 My Lord, I  Don't deny it. You know it's true. 
The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine. 
I'm sure there were reasons why I didn't need reasons. 
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters. 
You see how they pile up? 
Why are you here? 
To ask you to open your gates, My Lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way. 
Why should I let him? 
If you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls. 
They'll be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. 
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. 
Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm. 
You swore an oath to my father. 
Oh yes, I said some words... 
And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right. 
Joffrey's King now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. 
If I had the sense the Gods gave a fish, I'd hand you both over to the Lannisters. 
 Why don't you? 
 Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon, give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you? 
And... engage. 
When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand? 
 Soon, he says. 
 Good. 
You'll be ready for this then. 
I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear... 
So I had a new pommel made. 
It's called Longclaw. 
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think. 
This is Valyrian steel. 
It was my father's sword, his father before him. 
The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. 
It was meant for my son Jorah. 
He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros. 
My Lord, you honor me, but I can't Oh, you can and you will. 
I wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. 
A bloody dead man tried to kill me... 
So you'll take it. 
I'll hear no more about it. 
 Is that understood? 
 Yes, My Lord. 
Right. 
Now don't think this means I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. 
That's a man's sword, it'll take a man to wield it. 
I'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight. 
No you won't! 
I sent him to King's Landing yesterday. 
The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist I've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this... 
Boy King. 
That should get young Joffrey's attention. 
And it puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. 
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper. 
Yes, My Lord. 
 Well done. 
 Well done. 
You earned that, Snow. 
Well done. 
Go on, let's have a look. 
 At what? 
 Grenn: The sword! Show us the sword. 
Sword! Sword! 
Sword! Sword! 
 Let's have a look. 
 Piss off. 
Get off of it. 
Piss off. 
Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light. 
Give it here! 
What is it? 
 I  Look at its eyes. 
 Give it. 
 I can't. 
You can't what? 
I-- I'm really not supposed to say. 
And yet you really want to say. 
You want to say that...? 
There was a raven. 
I read the message to Maester Aemon. 
It's your brother Robb. 
What? 
What about him? 
He's heading south. 
To war. 
All his bannermen have rallied to his side. They'll keep him safe. 
I should be there. 
I should be with him. 
...If we do that, they'll never 
get back across. 
Well? 
What did he say? 
Lord Walder has granted your crossing. 
 His men are yours as well  Greatjon: Huh. 
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you. 
And what does he want in return? 
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. 
 He expects a knighthood in good time. 
 Fine fine. 
And? 
And Arya will marry his son Waldron  when they both come of age. 
 She won't be happy about that. 
Hmmm. 
And? 
And when the fighting is done... 
You will marry one of his daughters. 
Whichever you prefer. 
He has a number he thinks will be... suitable. 
I see. 
Did you get a look at his daughters? 
I did. 
And? 
One was... 
Do you consent? 
Can I refuse? 
Not if you want to cross. 
Then I consent. 
Sam said you wanted to see me? 
I did indeed. 
Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. 
Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of The Night's Watch take no wives and father no children? 
No. 
So they will not love. 
Love is the death of duty. 
If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do? 
He would do whatever was right. 
No matter what. 
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. 
Most of us are not so strong. 
What is honor compared to a woman's love? 
And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? 
Or a brother's smile? 
Sam told you. 
We're all human. 
Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. 
Honor comes easy then. 
Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose. 
And this is my day? 
Is that what you're saying? 
Oh, it hurts, boy. 
Oh yes. 
 I know. 
 You do not know! 
No one knows. 
I may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother. 
The Gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. 
They waited till I was old. 
What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House, the death of my family? 
I was helpless, blind, frail. 
But when I heard they had killed my brother's son, and his poor son... 
And the children! 
Even the little children. 
Who are you? 
My father was Maekar, the first of his name. 
My brother Aegon reigned after him when I had refused the Throne. 
And he was followed by his son Aerys, whom they called the Mad King. 
You're Aemon Targaryen. 
I'm a Maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and The Night's Watch. 
I will not tell you to stay or go. 
You must make that choice yourself, and live with it for the rest of your days. 
As I have. 
Drogo. 
Sajo anni. 
Hyah hyah. 
Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey's levies in tow. 
They're a day's march north. 
The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless  provincial courage. 
 Ah. 
Oh, do continue. 
Didn't mean to interrupt. 
I do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them. 
The great hairy one insisted he must have two battle axes heavy black steel, double-sided. 
Shagga likes axes. 
When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard. 
 The vanguard? 
 Mmhmm. 
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines? 
They do seem rather ferocious. 
Ferocious? 
Last night a Moon brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. 
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon brother and opened his throat. 
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay. 
When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander. 
Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort. 
There'll be no more discussion on the matter. 
It appears I'm not hungry after all. 
Excuse me, My Lords. 
Where did you find one so pretty at this hour? 
 I took her. 
 Took her? 
 From whom? 
 From, uh... 
Ser-- what's his name? 
I don't know. 
Ginger cunt three tents down. 
And he didn't have anything to say about it? 
He said something. 
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate just dropped drastically. 
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow. 
Oh well. 
I... think I'll go 
and find myself one. 
Who are you? 
Who would you like me to be? 
What did your mother call you? 
Shae. 
What did your mother call you? 
My mother died giving birth to me. 
Is that why I'm here? 
So we can talk about our mothers? 
 What sort of accent is that? 
 Foreign. 
For What do you want from me? 
What do I want from you? 
I want you to share my tent. 
I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. 
I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. 
And I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world which it may well be. 
And what do I get? 
Safety. 
No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. 
The pleasure of my company, which I have heard is spectacular. 
Who told you this? 
Women you paid? 
And three: More gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. 
Do you accept my proposal? 
Let's start with your last night in this world. 
Doth-- Dothrae... 
Ki ha-- hammi... 
Ish nokitta... 
Qana'th... 
Khaleesi. 
Come. 
He's very strong. 
No one understands how strong he is. 
 He will die tonight, Khaleesi. 
 He can't. 
He can't. 
I won't let him. 
Even a Queen doesn't have that power. 
We must go quickly. I've heard 
there's a good port in Asshai  I won't leave him. 
 He's already gone, Khaleesi. 
Doth Even if Even if he dies, why would I run? 
I am Khaleesi and my-- my son will be Khal after Drogo. 
This isn't Westeros where men honor blood. 
Here they only honor strength. 
There will be fighting after Drogo dies. 
Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal. 
He won't want any rivals. 
Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs. 
I won't leave him. 
The wound has festered. 
I think you should wear your armor tonight, Ser. 
I think you're right. 
You've saved me once more. 
And now you must save him. 
He's beyond the healer's skills. 
All I can do is ease his path. 
Save him and I will free you. 
I swear it. 
You must know a way... 
Some... 
Some magic. 
There is a spell. 
Some would say death is cleaner. 
Do it. 
Save him. 
There is a price. 
You'll have gold whatever you want. 
It's not a matter of gold. 
This is Bloodmagic. 
Only death pays for life. 
My death? 
No. 
Not your death, Khaleesi. 
Bring me his horse. 
Khaleesi, do not do this thing. 
 Let me kill this witch. 
 Kill her and you kill your Khal. 
This is Bloodmagic. 
It is forbidden. 
I am your Khaleesi. 
I tell you what is forbidden. 
Go now! 
 Take her and leave. 
 Huhuh. 
Take her! 
Irriya? 
You must go also, lady. 
Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent. 
The dead will dance here tonight. 
No one will enter. 
Bring him back to me. 
What have you done? 
I have to save him. 
We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai. 
You would have been safe. 
Jíni'th vos eo. 
Mra qothoon vosaan Khaleesi! 
Are you hurt? 
 The baby... 
 Hmm? 
...Is coming. 
 Fetch the midwives. 
 They will not come. 
They say she is cursed. 
They'll come or I'll have their heads. 
The witch she can bring baby. 
I hear her say so. 
Are you in agony, my lion? 
 No. 
 You look like you're in agony. 
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin. 
Ahhh. 
Damn you, woman. 
Are you immune to pain? 
 Just used to it. 
 Drink. 
Let's play a new game. 
There's a Braavosi knife game I could teach you Does it involve the potential for losing fingers? 
 Not if you win. 
 No! 
No more fire games, no knife games. 
Let's do something I'm good at. 
What are you good at? 
I happen to be a great judge of character. 
 This sounds like a boring game. 
 It's not. 
Here's how it works: I make a statement about your past. 
If I'm right, you drink. 
If I'm wrong, I drink. 
And no lying. 
I'll know if you're lying. 
I don't want to play this game. 
Fine. 
Bronn first. 
Your father beat you. 
But my mother hit harder. 
You killed your first man before you were 12. 
It was a woman. 
She swung an axe at me. 
You've been North of the Wall. 
What brought you up there? 
Work. 
And... 
You once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. 
Oh wait, that's me. 
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty. 
I don't want to play. 
It's fun! 
Look at the fun we're having. 
Your mother was a whore. 
Drink. 
All right. 
Your father left the family when you were very young,  never to return. 
 Drink. 
And we've established the rules about lying? 
Drink! 
Mmmm. 
You wanted a different life. 
You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere. 
The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one. 
So specifics you wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? 
I don't believe the life of the silent sisters is for you. 
So what's a lowborn girl to do? 
Drink. 
 Are you sure  drink! 
And don't talk about my mother and father ever or I will carve your eyes from your head. 
My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologize. 
My turn. 
Fine fine. 
Ask away. 
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me. 
 Who were you in love with? 
 That's not how the game works. 
I don't care the way the game works. 
Our Lord here used to be married. 
 Married? 
 How did you hear that? 
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers. 
Another night, perhaps. 
Not another night. 
This night. 
It's not a pleasant story. 
 Or maybe I will cry. 
 I'm guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your Lordship. 
So... 
I was 16. My brother Jaime 
and I were riding when we heard a scream. 
She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off with two men on her heels. 
Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak. 
She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her. 
Her name was Tysha. 
She was a wheelwright's orphan. 
And she was hungry together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. 
Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine. 
I forgot how afraid I was around girls, how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother. 
I forgot about everything but Tysha. 
And somehow I found myself in her bed. 
For three chickens, I should hope so. 
It didn't last long. I didn't know 
what the hell I was doing. 
But she was good to me. 
She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. 
And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. 
A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken Septon and there you have it man and wife. 
For a fortnight anyway, until the Septon sobered up and told my father. 
I imagine that was the end of all that. 
Not quite. 
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. 
The girl was a whore, you see. 
Jaime had arranged the whole thing, the road, the rapers all of it. 
He thought it was time I had a woman. 
After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. 
He paid her well a silver for each man. 
How many whores command that kind of price? 
He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. 
By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling onto the floor. 
I would have killed the man who did that to me. 
You should have known she was a whore. 
Really? 
I was 16, drunk and in love A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later. 
As I said, I was young and stupid. 
You are still young and stupid. 
Hyah! 
What is it? 
What do you want? 
You're sleeping through the war. 
 What? 
 They stole a night's march on us. 
They're a mile north. 
 Get my squire! 
 You don't have a squire. 
If I die, weep for me. 
You'll be dead. 
How will you know? 
I'll know. 
Watch out! 
Move! 
Out of the way! 
 Move aside! 
 ( Neighs stay low. 
Stay low? 
If you're lucky, no one will notice you. 
I was born lucky. 
Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! 
Stone Crows! 
Black Ears! 
Burned Men! 
 Moon brothers! 
 Man: And painted dogs! 
And painted dogs! 
Your dominion over the Vale begins now! 
Onward to claim what is yours! 
Half man! Half man! 
Half man! 
Half man! 
Half man! Half man! 
To battle. 
You're a shit warrior. 
I'm alive? 
You're alive. 
Did we win? 
We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't. 
How did our tribesmen do? 
Yeah, good. 
It's nice to see them getting along. 
You're wounded. 
Good of you to notice. 
I hear we won. 
Hmph. 
The scouts were wrong. 
There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20,000. 
Did we get the Stark boy, at least? 
He wasn't here. 
Where was he? 
With his other 18,000 men. 
And where are they? 
 We should go, My Lady. 
 No! 
My Lady! 
Hyah hyah! 
By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened. 
Lady Stark. 
I'd offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it. 
It's not your sword I want. 
Give me my daughters back. 
Give me my husband. 
I've lost them too, I'm afraid. 
Kill him, Robb. 
Send his head to his father. 
He cut down 10 of our men you saw him. 
He's more use to us alive than dead. 
Take him away and put him in irons. 
We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. 
You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters. 
Swords or lances, teeth, nails choose your weapons and let's end this here and now. 
If we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. 
We're not doing it your way. 
Come on, pretty man. 
I sent 2,000 men to their graves today. 
The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice. 
Aye. But the dead 
won't hear them. 
One victory does not make us conquerors. 
Did we free my father? 
Did we rescue my sisters from the Queen? 
Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? 
This war is far from over. 
Could I have one? 
A lemon one or any of them. 
Three coppers. 
How about a nice fat pigeon? 
Piss off now. 
Go on. 
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? 
 Or any burnt ones? 
 Piss off! 
Hey, where's everyone going? 
What's happening? 
They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor. 
Who? 
The Hand of the King. 
 Traitor! 
 Coward! 
Baelor. 
Baelor! 
Traitor! 
Traitor! 
I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. 
I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. 
I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. 
I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son... 
And seize the Throne for myself. 
Traitor! 
Let the high Septon and Baelor the blessed bear witness to what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the Grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. 
As we sin, so do we suffer. 
This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. 
The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. 
What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace? 
My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. 
Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. 
And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. 
But they have the soft hearts of women. 
So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. 
Ser Ilyn, bring me his head! 
No! Stop! 
Daddy! 
Someone stop him! 
My son, this is madness. 
Put him down! 
 Don't look! 
 Let me go. 
 Let me go! 
 Shut your mouth. Look at me. 
 Look at me! 
 Stop! Daddy! 
 Stop! No no! 
 Crowd: Traitor! 
Stop! 
Stop him, stop! 
﻿1  Game of Thrones 01x10  
Fire and Blood Look at me. 
Look at me! 
Do you remember me now, boy, eh? 
Remember me? 
There's a bright boy. 
You'll be coming with me, boy, and you'll be keeping your mouth shut. 
 Keep your mouth shut, boy. 
 I'm not a boy! 
You're not a smart boy, is that what you're trying to say? 
Do you want to live, boy?! 
North, boy, we're going north. 
It had three eyes. 
It told me to come with him, so I did. 
We went down into the crypts and my father was there. 
Your father's not down there, little lord. 
Not for many years yet. 
You're afraid just like Hodor. 
I'm not afraid of some hole in the ground. 
You've lived beyond the Wall. 
What are you scared of? 
I'm a crippled boy and I'm willing to go. 
That's my grandfather Lord Rickard. 
He was burned alive by the Mad King Aerys. 
That's Lyanna, my father's sister. 
King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her. 
Robert started a war to win her back. 
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway. 
That's where I saw father. 
You see? 
He's not here. 
Here, Shaggydog. 
Rickon! 
That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels! 
 He doesn't like chains. 
 What are you doing down here? 
 Come back up with us. 
 No, I came to see father. 
How many times have I told you? 
He's in King's Landing with Sansa and Arya. 
He was down here. 
I saw him. 
Saw him when? 
Last night, when I was sleeping. 
Here, Shaggydog. 
You both miss him. 
It's only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn't mean that Bran... 
 My Lady. 
 My Lady. 
 My Lady. 
 My Lady. 
 My Lady. 
 My Lady. 
My Lady. 
Robb. 
Robb. 
Robb! 
You've ruined your sword. 
Shh shh. 
 Shh. 
 I'll kill them all Every one of them. 
I will kill them all. 
My boy. 
They have your sisters. 
We have to get the girls back. 
And then we will kill them all. 
 the boar's great tusks, they boded ill   for good King Robert's health   and the beast was every bit as fat   as Robert was himself   but our brave King cried, "Do your worst! 
 I'll have your ugly head!  
 you're nowhere near as murd'rous as   the lion in my bed"   King Robert lost his battle and   he failed his final test   the lion ripped his balls off   and   the boar did all the rest.  
Very amusing. 
Isn't it a funny song? 
Thank you for your rendition. 
I imagine it was even better received at that tavern. 
I'm so sorry, Your Grace. 
I'll never sing it again, I swear. 
Tell me, which do you favor: Your fingers or your tongue? 
Your Grace? 
Fingers or your tongue? 
If you got to keep one, which would it be? 
I I or I could just cut your throat. 
Every man needs hands, Your Grace. 
Good. 
 Tongue it is. 
 Your Grace, please. 
I won't sing Your Grace. 
Ser Ilyn, who better than you  to carry out the sentence? 
 I beg you! 
Please no. 
No! 
Your Grace, please. 
I beg you, I will never sing again! 
 I'm done for the day. 
 Nooooo! 
I'll leave the rest of the matters to you, mother. 
Your Grace, please! 
You look quite nice. 
Thank you, My Lord. 
"Your Grace." 
I'm King now. 
Stop-ppp! 
No! 
Walk with me. 
I want to show you something. 
Do as you're bid, child. 
...And as soon as you've had 
your blood, I'll put a son in you. 
Mother says that shouldn't be long. 
No, please no! 
This one's your father. 
This one here. 
Look at it and see what happens to traitors. 
 You promised to be merciful. 
 I was. 
I gave him a clean death. 
Look at him. 
Please let me go home. 
I won't do any treason, I swear. 
Mother says I'm still to marry you. 
So you'll stay here and obey. 
Look at him! 
Well? 
How long do I have to look? 
As long as it pleases me. 
Do you want to see the rest? 
If it please Your Grace. 
That's your Septa there. 
I'll tell you what: I'm going to give you a present. 
After I raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, I'm going to give you his head as well. 
Or maybe he'll give me yours. 
My mother tells me a King should never strike his lady. 
Ser Meryn. 
Here, girl. 
Will you obey now? 
Or do you need another lesson? 
I'll look for you in court. 
Save yourself some pain, girl. 
Give him what he wants. 
You'll be needing that again. 
The proper course is clear: Pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his. 
Renly is not the King. 
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, My Lord. 
He put your father to death. 
That doesn't make Renly King. 
He's Robert's youngest brother. 
If Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be King before Stannis. 
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis? 
 Renly is not right! 
 My Lords. 
If we put ourselves behind Stannis My Lords! 
Here is what I say to these two Kings Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. 
Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South? 
What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood? 
Even their Gods are wrong! 
Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? 
It was the Dragons we bowed to and now the Dragons are dead! 
There sits the only King I mean to bend my knee to the King in the North! 
I'll have peace on those terms. 
They can keep their Red Castle and their Iron Chair too. 
The King in the North! 
Am I your brother, now and always? 
Now and always. 
My sword is yours, in victory and defeat from this day until my last day. 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
The King in the North! 
 Lady Stark. 
 I want to see him. 
Now! 
Leave us. 
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. 
Widowhood becomes you. 
Your bed must be lonely. 
Is that why you came? 
I'm not at my best, but I think I could be of service. 
You slip out of that gown and we'll see if I'm up to it. 
Oh, I do like a violent woman. 
I will kill you tonight, Ser, pack your head in a box and send it to your sister. 
Let me show you how hit me again, over the ear. 
And again and again. 
You're stronger than you look it shouldn't take long. 
That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? 
That you don't fear death. 
But I don't, My Lady. 
The dark is coming for all of us. 
Why cry about it? 
Because you are going to the deepest of the Seven Hells, if the Gods are just. 
What Gods are those? 
The trees your husband prayed to? 
Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? 
If your Gods are real and if they are just, why is the world so full of injustice? 
Because of men like you. 
There are no men like me. 
Only me. 
My son Bran. 
How did he come to fall from that tower? 
I pushed him out the window. 
Why? 
I hoped the fall would kill him. 
Why? 
You should get some sleep. 
It's going to be a long war. 
I can't believe we're actually at war. 
Was it this exciting last time, when you were young? 
What does it say? 
Have we captured Robb Stark yet? 
 What's our next move? 
 Stop talking. 
Get back into bed. 
They have my son. 
The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped. 
I've heard his wolf killed a doze men and as many horses. 
Is it true about Stannis and Renly? 
Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us. 
Jaime captured, his armies scattered... 
It's a catastrophe. 
Perhaps we should sue for peace. 
There's your peace. 
Joffrey saw to that when h decided to remove Ned Stark's head. 
You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. 
He's winning... 
in case you hadn't noticed. 
I'm told we still have his sisters. 
The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime. 
No truces. 
We can't afford to look weak. 
We should march on them at once. 
First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise They have my son! 
Get out, all of you. 
Not you. 
You were right about Eddard Stark. 
If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. 
But now... 
Madness madness and stupidity. 
I always thought you were a stunted fool. 
Perhaps I was wrong. 
Half wrong. 
I'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here. 
No one will stay here. 
Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. 
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. 
And you will go to King's Landing. 
And do what? 
Rule! 
You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. 
You will bring that boy King to heel and his mother too, if needs be. 
And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest:  Baelish, Varys, Pycelle  Heads, spikes, walls. 
Why not my Uncle? 
Why not anyone? 
Why me? 
You're my son. 
Oh, one more thing: You will not take the whore to court. 
Do you understand? 
Ser Jorah? 
Gently gently. 
My son... 
Where is he? 
I want him. 
Where is he? 
The boy did not live. 
 Tell me. 
 What is there to tell? 
How did my son die?! 
He never lived, My Princess. 
The women say... 
What do the women say? 
 They say the child was  Monstrous, twisted. 
I pulled him out myself. 
He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat. 
When I touched him the skin fell from his bones. 
Inside he was full of graveworms. 
I warned you that only death can pay for life. 
You knew the price. 
Where is Khal Drogo? 
Show him to me. 
Show me what I bought with my son's life. 
As you command, lady. 
Come. 
I will take you to him. 
 Time enough for that later  I want to see him now. 
The Khalasar is gone. 
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal. 
The Dothraki follow only the strong. 
I'm sorry, My Princess. 
Drogo! 
Why is he out here alone? 
He seems to like the warmth, Princess. 
He lives. 
You asked for life, you paid for life. 
This is not life. 
When will he be as he was? 
When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east when the seas go dry. 
When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. 
Leave us. 
I don't want you alone with this sorceress. 
I have nothing more to fear from this woman. 
Go. 
You knew what I was buying and you knew the price. 
It was wrong of them to burn my temple. 
 It angered the Great Shepherd. 
 This is not God's work. 
 My child was innocent. 
 Innocent? 
He would have been the stallion who mounts the world. 
Now he will burn no cities. 
Now his Khalasar will trample no nations into dust. 
I spoke for you. 
I saved you. 
Saved me? 
Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. 
I saw my God's house burn, there where I had healed men and women beyond counting. 
In the streets I saw piles of heads the head of the Baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that I had cured of fever just three moons past. 
So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved. 
Your life. 
Hmph. 
Why don't you take a look at your Khal... 
Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone. 
You can't! 
Get out of my way, Sam. 
They'll put out the word. 
They'll send out ravens. 
People will come after you. 
Do you know what happens to deserters? 
Better than you do. 
What are you going to do? 
I'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat. 
You can't leave us now. 
We need you here. 
 Move. 
 I won't let you go. 
 Move. 
 No. 
Hyah! 
Hand of the King? 
So it would seem. 
And your father said you couldn't take anyone with you to King's Landing. 
No, he said I couldn't take you with me to King's Landing. 
He was very specific on that point. 
He knew my name? 
What? 
He said, "Don't bring Shae with you to King's Landing"? 
I believe he used the word "whore." 
Are you ashamed of me? 
Are you afraid that I'm dancing around the court with my tits out? 
I'm funny now? 
I'm Shae the funny whore. 
My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. 
Certainly the richest. 
He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. 
Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. 
He's always been a cunt. 
I believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. 
Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? 
Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand I know what a Hand needs. 
 Ghost? 
 Hyah! 
 Hyah. 
 Hyah! 
Hyah. 
Samwell! 
 Is he dead? 
 No, he's not dead. 
Did we get him? 
Come on, help me get him up. 
Lucky you've got plenty of padding. 
We're taking you back to where you belong. 
 I belong with my brother. 
 But we're your brothers now. 
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone. 
They'll kill you if they know you came after me. 
 Go back. 
 Sam told us everything. 
 We're sorry about your father. 
 But it doesn't matter. 
You took the oath. 
You can't leave. 
 I have to. 
 You can't. 
 You said the words. 
 I don't care about "Hear my words and bear witness to my vow..." 
To hell with all of you. 
"Night gathers and now my Watch begins. 
It shall not end until my death. 
I shall live and die at my post." 
"I am the sword in the darkness..." 
"...The Watcher on the Walls, 
the shield that guards the realms of men. 
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come." 
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east... 
Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars. 
Kings? 
Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about Kings. 
The thing you need to understand about Kings is... 
For the past 67 years, I've known truly known more Kings than any man alive. 
They're complicated men, but I know how to serve them. 
Yes. 
And keep on serving them. 
Aerys Targaryen... 
of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us, madness is the worst. 
He was a good man, such a charmer. 
To watch him melt away before my eyes, consumed by dreams of fire and blood... 
Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal powerful man, a great warrior but alas, winning a Kingdom and ruling a Kingdom are rather different things. 
They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side. 
Now I serve his son King Joffrey, may the Gods bless his reign. 
He is a capable young man strong military mind. 
Stern... 
But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice. 
It's far too soon to know what manner of King he will be, but I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King. 
True greatness. 
So what's the thing? 
What thing? 
About Kings. 
You said, "the thing you need to understand about Kings..." 
What? Things? 
What? 
When you started, you never mind. 
Let me see you out, my dear. 
 It's all right. No need. 
 Yes yes. 
Till the next time. 
Right. 
When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? 
Does the crown fit? 
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years? 
It's hard for them to simper and bow without heads. 
A man with great ambition and no morals I wouldn't bet against you. 
And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there? 
I must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King. 
You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man. 
Oh, you can do better than that. 
When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? 
 I've always wondered. 
 Have you? 
Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs? 
I picture a gash like a woman's. 
Is that about right? 
I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all. 
Must be strange for you, even after all these years a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all am I? 
That is good to know. 
Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash? 
But you carry on, whispering in one King's ear and then the next. 
I admire you. 
And I admire you, Lord Baelish. 
A grasper from a minor house with a major talent for befriending powerful men and women. 
A useful talent, I'm sure you'd agree. 
So here we stand... 
In mutual admiration and respect. 
Playing our roles. 
Serving a new King. 
Long may he reign. 
 My King. 
 My King. 
My Lords. 
Shall we begin? 
You're Arry now, hear me? 
Arry the orphan boy. 
No one asks an orphan too many questions 'cause nobody gives three shits. 
What's your name? 
 Arry. 
 Ah. 
We have a long way to travel and in bad company. 
I have 20 this time, men and boys all bound for the Wall. 
Your Lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons and I didn't find no little lordlings down there. 
This lot, half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. 
And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. 
So keep to yourself and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. 
You stay with this lot, boy. 
And stay or I'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three. 
Watch yourself, midget. 
He's got a sword, this one. 
What's a gutter rat like you doing with a sword? 
 Maybe he's a little squire. 
 He ain't no squire. Look at him. 
He looks like a girl. 
I bet he stole that sword. 
Let's have a look. 
I could use me a sword like that. 
 Take it off him. 
 Give it here, midget. 
Look at him! 
You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. 
I've seen him kick a boy to death. 
I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls and I kept kicking him until he was dead. 
I kicked him all to pieces. 
 You better give me that sword! 
 You want it? 
I'll give it to you. 
I already killed one fat boy. 
I bet you never killed anyone. 
I bet you're a liar. 
But I'm not. 
I'm good at killing fat boys. 
I like killing fat boys. 
Oh, you like picking on the little ones, do you? 
You know, I've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years. 
When I hit that steel, it sings. 
Are you gonna sing when I hit you? 
This is castle-forged steel. 
Where'd you steal it? 
 It was a gift. 
 It don't matter now. 
Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. 
They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen murderers. 
 Which are you? 
 Armorer's apprentice. 
But my master got sick of me, so here I am. 
Come on, you sorry sons of whores! 
It's a thousand leagues from here to the Wall and winter is coming! 
Ham. 
How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? 
Bring me some beer at least. 
You look exhausted. 
Was your moonlight ride that tiring? 
Don't look so terrified. 
If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. 
At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. 
Honor made you leave, honor brought you back. 
My friends brought me back. 
I didn't say it was your honor. 
They killed my father. 
And you're going to bring him back to life, are you? 
No? Good. 
We've had enough of that sort of thing. 
Beyond the Wall, the rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. 
At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. 
A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the Gods only know. 
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. 
Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. 
Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours? 
 No. 
 When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne? 
 No. 
 Good. 
Because I want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow. 
Beyond the Wall? 
I'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. 
I mean to find out what's happening. 
The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. 
And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. 
I will command them myself. 
So I'll only ask you once, Lord Snow... 
Move out! 
...Are you a brother 
of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war? 
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. 
Sell them. You can return 
to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days. 
They were not given to me to sell. 
Khaleesi, My Queen, I vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. 
I know what you intend. 
Do not. 
I must. 
You don't understand don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. 
I won't watch you burn. 
Is that what you fear? 
You will be my Khalasar. 
I see the faces of slaves. 
I free you. 
Take off your collars. Go if yo 
wish, no one will stop you. 
But if you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives. 
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. 
You swore to obey me. 
I am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of Old Valyria. 
I am the Dragon's daughter. 
And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming. 
You will not hear me scream. 
I will. 
But it is not your screams I want. 
Only your life. 
Blood of my blood.
