1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,921
Come on, put it...
Excuse me.

2
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:09,438
Out of the way, please.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,328
Hey!

4
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:11,922
Chill out, <i>mamacita.</i>

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,391
What's with the, uh,
weekday vibe.

6
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:16,640
- It is a Tuesday, sir.
- Hey, hey.

7
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:18,081
You work on that show?

8
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:20,079
Yeah, I work on <i>that</i> show.

9
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:22,278
Just like your mom works
<i>that</i> street corner.

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,480
I'm sorry, that's too much.

11
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:26,314
No sweat.
My mom <i>is</i> a prostitute.

12
00:00:26,423 --> 00:00:29,058
Hey! This chick knows
Jenna Maroney!

13
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:33,228
Hey! New drinking game!

14
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:35,112
Drink when
someone says something!

15
00:00:35,158 --> 00:00:37,025
Whoo!

16
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,325
Who are you people?

17
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:40,814
We're "Crabcatchers."

18
00:00:40,882 --> 00:00:43,908
You know, from Jenna's song
<i>Catchin' crabs in paradise?</i>

19
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:47,237
♪ I caught crabs in paradise

20
00:00:47,288 --> 00:00:49,619
♪ and, yes, I mean
both kinds of crabs ♪

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,481
Oh, I thought that was
at least gonna be innuendo.

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,029
Jenna is playing the <i>Tod</i> show,

23
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,236
in a couple of days,

24
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:58,373
so we're just camping out
and "unwindulaxing."

25
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:01,086
Wait, so Jenna's
Jimmy Buffett rip-off

26
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:02,464
is actually a thing?

27
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:03,888
See, you people from New York,

28
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:05,990
you don't know all the stuff
that's going on

29
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:07,291
in the rest of the country.

30
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:09,642
Truck races, swamp parties,

31
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:11,377
mall fires.

32
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,570
I can't believe
she's pulling this off.

33
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:16,412
And I can't believe
I'm pulling <i>this</i> off!

34
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:19,185
Whoo!

35
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:21,321
Why do you have
a tattoo of a seatbelt?

36
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:25,282
So I don't get pulled over
when I'm driving shirtless!

37
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:30,949
Whoo!

38
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:32,133
You wanted to see me?

39
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:33,612
Have I mentioned marisol,

40
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,165
the Mexican sideline reporter
I've been seeing?

41
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:37,778
Well, since our weekend
in Aspen,

42
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,362
she's been put on pelvic rest.

43
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:40,972
Fast-forward noise.

44
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,140
Marisol was supposed
to attend a fundraiser luncheon

45
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:43,960
with me today.

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,363
It's $10,000 a plate.

47
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:46,873
And I'll have
to eat the ticket unless...

48
00:01:46,897 --> 00:01:48,161
Unless I eat the ticket.

49
00:01:48,217 --> 00:01:49,885
Fancy luncheon, seafood bar.

50
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:51,968
I'm thinking 75 cents a shrimp,

51
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:53,019
over three hours,

52
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:54,637
and split...
Carry 3.75...

53
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:57,133
By the time I'm done,
you'll be making money.

54
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:58,538
Good. I should warn you,
though,

55
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:00,266
that it's
a Republican fundraiser.

56
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,065
So if you're coming,
it won't be

57
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,064
as Liz Lemon, <i>huffpo</i> superuser
and gun-control lunatic.

58
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:07,233
You'll come as Liz Lemon,
my chum.

59
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,006
Chum.
Okay, I like that.

60
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:12,651
And you'll be able to keep
your opinions to yourself?

61
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:15,241
Oh, good Lord, Lemon.

62
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,788
You just locked your mouth
and <i>then</i> swallowed the key.

63
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:18,856
It makes no earthly sense.

64
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,671
Shrimp.

Jenna's crab idiots
won't shut up.

69
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:50,890
Why couldn't she have died
when that rabid dog bit her?

70
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:52,393
Oh, it wasn't rabid.

71
00:02:52,523 --> 00:02:54,223
I just said that
so they'd have to put it down,

72
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,788
and then I'd be the star
of that dog-food commercial.

73
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:58,074
I had to walk an extra block

74
00:02:58,098 --> 00:02:59,813
to get around
your stupid crabcatchers.

75
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,211
My doctor's have been very clear
about this, Jenna.

76
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:04,710
If I get moderate exercise,
I'm gonna die!

77
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:06,439
And I'm mad at your success,

78
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:08,167
but pretending
it's something else!

79
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:10,001
Okay, speaking of me,

80
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:13,415
how many crabcatchers
fiesta crab hats

81
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,879
would each of you like to buy,

82
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,456
at the unbelievable price
of 49.95?

83
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:22,288
Please. I've had a crab
on my head for free!

84
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:23,667
I'm lying.

85
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:27,255
The claws hold your cigarette
while you uncork a "brew-skye."

86
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:29,093
"Uncork a 'brew-skye'"?

87
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,122
Yeah, you know.

88
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:32,503
Ka-zap.
Blinky, blinky, blinky, blinky.

89
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,027
Those aren't even
the right noises.

90
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:35,800
Everyone knows you hate stuff
like this.

91
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:37,283
You're maybe the most
high-maintenance bitch

92
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:37,902
in Hollywood.

93
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,639
Maybe? Who's more?
Who is she?

94
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,274
Okay, cut this crap out,

95
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:44,060
and get those sunburned "D" -bags
out of the plaza.

96
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,562
Hey, no can will, Pete.

97
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,899
But have
an unwindulaxing day...

98
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,152
You medical office
before-pictures.

99
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:55,846
I've never even seen a crab.

100
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:57,924
I'm sorry.

101
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,446
I don't need some
Kenyan-born college professor

102
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,994
telling <i>m
i didn't build my company.</i>

103
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,579
Because I earned my trust fund

104
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,698
by always being polite
to grandfather.

105
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,144
Now, Donaghy, still over at NBC,

106
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:10,152
with all those communists
and homosexuals?

107
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:11,941
Reginald, I believe you're
thinking of the White House.

108
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:13,959
But not for long.

109
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,520
In two weeks,
we take this country back.

110
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,009
And no bureaucrat can force me

111
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:20,229
to subsidize female promiscuity
in the name of health care.

112
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,329
Are you okay, chum?

113
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,073
Michelle Obama's on steroids.

114
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,025
And this is studio 6-H,

115
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:36,350
home to <i>TGS,</i>
starring Tracy Jordan.

116
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,716
Oh, my God, it's Jenna.

117
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,725
Visor lady,
get a picture of me.

118
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,534
What do I...
Press a button?

119
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:45,940
No, it's different from every
other camera in the world.

120
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,698
God, I can't escape you people.

121
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,627
Whoa, chill out, brother.

122
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:52,579
It's beer o'clock somewhere.

123
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,748
You're a fraud!

124
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:54,899
And you look like a condom

125
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,727
that's been dropped
on the floor of a barbershop.

126
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:59,821
Are you all unwindulaxing?

127
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:03,356
This guy looks like he could use
a little "latitude" adjustment.

128
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,142
Will you sign my Cesarean scar?

129
00:05:06,193 --> 00:05:07,143
Oh, ahh!

130
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:09,797
You moron!

131
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:18,583
Hey, just a party foul.

132
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:20,194
Exactly.

133
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,345
That's why I said,
"you <i>more on."</i>

134
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:26,687
Like, "pour more on me!"

135
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,362
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah.

136
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,278
Whoo!

137
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:32,641
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah!

138
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,646
She can't be herself
in front of these losers.

139
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,483
She has to be "Island Jenna,"

140
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,772
which means...

141
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:39,250
We can mess with her.

142
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,002
We should go
to a pumpkin patch?

143
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,954
Pranksmen, activate.

144
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:46,733
Obama's bailout
would never have worked

145
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,811
if big business hadn't
heroically taken it.

146
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,832
But where's <i>our</i> parade?

147
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,251
That's idiotic.

148
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,210
- Lemon!
- No, sir.

149
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,311
You don't have enough shrimp
to buy my silence.

150
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,920
Also, you are out of shrimp.

151
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,280
You know better, Jack.

152
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,004
You all know better.

153
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:02,548
Except for maybe
the really inbred wasps.

154
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:05,750
You thank for mention gordeau!

155
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,798
You're hypocrites.

156
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:08,227
You believe
in the death penalty,

157
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:11,096
but it's okay
to kill animals for food?

158
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,416
I don't know
where I'm going with this yet.

159
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,476
Hang on.
Hang on!

160
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,437
My boyfriend and I
aren't married.

161
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:18,641
But we might have
a baby together anyway.

162
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:20,977
And I hope it's gay...
Male gay.

163
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:22,759
Because with the ladies,
it's too much hiking.

164
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:25,667
But homosexuality is
unnatural, right?

165
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,955
Then why are there
gay dolphins, people?

166
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,937
You heard me.

167
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,044
They make love
to their husband's blowholes.

168
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:37,251
Let's see <i>that</i>
in some science textbooks.

169
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,630
Oh, that's right.

170
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:40,897
The whole Texas board
of education thing

171
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,514
that I don't fully remember.

172
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:45,262
Teachers should get paid
a million dollars a year.

173
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:47,146
If birth control pills
fixed boners,

174
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,702
you would get them free
with your driver's license.

175
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,756
How do we know
that God isn't a tree?

176
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,031
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Elizabeth Lemon.

177
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,941
And, uh, this is
what we're up against.

178
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,791
Four more years of a president

179
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:02,129
chosen by people like her.

180
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,544
She has an iPad subscription
to <i>The New Yorker.</i>

181
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,468
She vehemently opposes
the Ivory Trade,

182
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,056
despite the jobs it creates.

183
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,183
And in her apartment there is
a black-and-white photograph

184
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:11,346
where you can
almost see a breast.

185
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:14,503
It's an original Leonard Nimoy.

186
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,635
If we do not defeat Obama,

187
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,484
then people
like my little friend here

188
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,077
will destroy this country.

189
00:07:20,114 --> 00:07:23,103
So add a zero to whatever
you were planning to give.

190
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:25,338
For Romney, for America.

191
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:28,234
For anyone but her.

192
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:30,536
What the hell, Jack?

193
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:31,948
I thought you said
I was your chum.

194
00:07:32,042 --> 00:07:33,242
You are my chum.

195
00:07:33,514 --> 00:07:35,071
The bait I throw in the water

196
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,365
to attract the big fish.

197
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,081
Damn it!
Second meaning.

198
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:45,384
♪ Pour margaritas
sunburn's starting to scab... ♪

199
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,830
Yeah.

200
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,188
Whoa.

201
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,092
What are you douche-compadres
doing here?

202
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:55,827
Well, Jenna, everyone knows

203
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:57,865
how you're always so chill.

204
00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,535
So, of course,
you won't freak out

205
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:02,936
when you see that Cerie is
wearing that exact same shirt

206
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,171
as a dress.

207
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,641
The belt is a baby's necktie.

208
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:11,148
Also, I found a bunch
of your pre-nosejob headshots.

209
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,325
You'll sign them so
I can sell them online, right?

210
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,128
Of course.

211
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:20,403
'Cause who cares
what you look like.

212
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:23,538
All that counts
is what's inside...

213
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:25,540
Your blender.

214
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:27,075
I'm glad you feel that way.

215
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:29,961
'Cause I've always wanted
to give you a haircut.

216
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:30,995
Mm.

217
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,547
Yeah!

218
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,939
You... virgins, have no idea
who you're messing with.

219
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:39,156
Whoa, Jenna.

220
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:40,884
Unwindulax.

221
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,559
Oh, I'm not just Jenna anymore.

222
00:08:43,726 --> 00:08:46,311
I am a God
to those crabcatchers,

223
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:48,265
and they will do whatever I say.

224
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,008
So what?

225
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,526
Oh, I'll tell you so what.

226
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:52,949
For one thing,
if you cross me or my army,

227
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,313
you will never set foot
in Florida again.

228
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:56,890
Because that's our capital.

229
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,768
But I'm judging Spike TV's
<i>Miss Nude divorcee</i>

230
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,383
in Tampa on Christmas Eve.

231
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,102
Oh.

232
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:03,902
And I was gonna visit
MGM studios.

233
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:05,430
The rides there capture

234
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,236
the thrills and chills
of the movies.

235
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,360
And it doesn't end there,

236
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,717
because my people
are everywhere.

237
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,436
If you ever want
to pick your ball color

238
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,637
at a putt-putt course,

239
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,473
or have your alligator
euthanized humanely,

240
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:17,217
or fly on delta,

241
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:18,451
you will back off,

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,029
or the crabcatchers will come
for you.

243
00:09:22,097 --> 00:09:25,099
Just as soon as it's cool
for them to drive.

244
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,096
It's a gray hoodie.

245
00:09:29,114 --> 00:09:30,929
It say's "who farted?"
On the back.

246
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,723
It's got a bunch of tampons
in the pocket.

247
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,073
I don't know what else
to tell you.

248
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,443
Lemon, there you are.

249
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:36,685
Did your girlfriend
even cancel?

250
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,588
Or was this more
Karl Rove trickery?

251
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:40,427
Sorry, but I needed you
to come, Lemon.

252
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:41,954
This luncheon is a fundraiser

253
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:43,167
for my personal super pac

254
00:09:43,202 --> 00:09:45,152
"Americans
for an American America."

255
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,631
I needed to unite the room
around a common enemy.

256
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:49,272
And Ed Begley Jr.
wasn't available,

257
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:50,943
because the sail
on his car broke.

258
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:54,099
See, this is why 50.1%
of Americans hate Republicans.

259
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:55,656
Because you're
sneaky and cynical.

260
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:57,704
Cynical? I think I'm
the very opposite of cynical.

261
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,511
I'm doing everything I can
for my beliefs.

262
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,934
And I truly believe
that one rich person

263
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,228
can make a difference
in this country,

264
00:10:03,272 --> 00:10:06,497
and a roomful of rich people
can... change the world.

265
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:08,849
Well, I also believe that one
person can make a difference.

266
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:09,819
With ideas.

267
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:11,750
That really is wonderful.

268
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:13,838
Harold, you have to hear this.
Lemon, say that again.

269
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:15,882
Ideas are more powerful
than money.

270
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,048
So what are you gonna do
with all this money, Jack?

271
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:20,290
Buy ad time?

272
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:21,963
'Cause I'm already
on TV every night,

273
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:24,042
with a little something
called <i>TGS.</i>

274
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:27,078
And we just got nominated for
a stage managers' guild award.

275
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,798
So you may have millions
of dollars, sir,

276
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:32,065
but America <i>will</i> hear
my two cents.

277
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:34,761
That's not what people want,
Lemon.

278
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,151
Least of all,
from their televisions.

279
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,667
They want their honeys boo boo

280
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:39,874
and their Sunday night feetball,

281
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:41,168
which is the plural of football.

282
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:42,477
Americans don't want to think.

283
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:43,670
That's why they need
men like me

284
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:45,820
to pick their presidents
for them.

285
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:47,065
Wow. Okay.

286
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:50,018
So, I guess, it's my words
versus your money.

287
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:51,699
And we'll see who can really
make a difference

288
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,535
in this election.

289
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:54,155
It's on, Donaghy.

290
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:57,522
May the best
gender non-specific person win.

291
00:10:57,553 --> 00:11:00,188
Just leave the amount blank,
Harold.

292
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:03,362
Those are tampons.

293
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:04,971
Deal with it.

294
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:12,455
For God's sake,
some of us have jobs!

295
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:15,042
I've got a pile
of 1020-Gs up he

296
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,044
with no travel times on them,

297
00:11:17,062 --> 00:11:19,514
and if I don't...

298
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,711
Listen up, nerds!

299
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,340
Tonight, <i>TGS</i> is
about to get real.

300
00:11:24,373 --> 00:11:25,815
We've got 38 minutes
of air time...

301
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,072
An hour, if the bowling
tournament ends early...

302
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:30,792
And we are gonna use it
to get the message out there.

303
00:11:30,842 --> 00:11:31,497
I don't know.

304
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:33,435
I think we've been
hitting Romney pretty hard.

305
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,609
I guess that's why
they call me Mitt.

306
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:38,989
"Baseball Mitt Romney"
and "Barack a llama"

307
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,281
aren't saying anything.

308
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:41,537
I want to make a difference.

309
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:43,906
We got to do something big,
something that'll go viral.

310
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:47,207
Like that otter
that looked just like Tracy.

311
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,826
Look, we've got the greatest
resource in the world

312
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:52,486
American celebrity.

313
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,651
We get some hot young actor...

314
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,996
Oh, my grandnephew Kellan lutz,

315
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,198
from <i>Twilight,</i> is visiting me.

316
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:57,932
He's in my office.

317
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,733
I have tolerated
your pathological lying

318
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:01,781
for six years.

319
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:05,499
If you speak again,
I will kill you.

320
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,318
Great-uncle?

321
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:10,753
Momma's baby is
out of "marsh-mal-lows."

322
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:12,222
Sweet grandnephew,

323
00:12:12,247 --> 00:12:14,211
I've been warming
more "marsh-mal-lows" for you

324
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:16,142
in the pocket of my dungarees.

325
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:24,512
Okay, good job, lutz.

326
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:28,134
Gentlemen, token silent lady,

327
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,429
we have to spend
all of our wonderful money,

328
00:12:31,454 --> 00:12:33,989
and help my hair-mentor,
Mitt Romney,

329
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,316
become the 11th legitimate
President of the United States.

330
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:39,730
Garrett, what does
the campaign need?

331
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:41,056
Well, as you know,

332
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,894
with pacs like this,
we're not allowed

333
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:45,584
to have direct contact
with candidates.

334
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:47,655
I'm kidding.

335
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,487
I'm Garrett Romney,
Mitt's my dad.

336
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,434
But here's the thing, Jack.

337
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,991
My brother-dad,
which is mormon for "dad,"

338
00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,833
has more money
than he knows what to do with.

339
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:57,474
With all due respect, Garrett,

340
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:58,858
I don't think that's a thing.

341
00:12:58,893 --> 00:13:01,362
Well, it's just,
at this point in the campaign,

342
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:04,230
for us, it's more
about ideas than cash.

343
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:05,595
Garrett, I would slap you

344
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:07,749
if I didn't know you were going
to get your own planet

345
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:08,668
when you die.

346
00:13:08,707 --> 00:13:11,961
And until your father has
100% of the vote,

347
00:13:11,986 --> 00:13:13,305
I think we can still make
a difference.

348
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,043
I mean, look how poorly we're
polling with African-Americans.

349
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:17,832
Jack, there's no amount
of money that could...

350
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,799
How dare you talk that way
in front of the pile.

351
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,780
Aw, thanks, Jack.

352
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:22,312
There is no problem
in the world

353
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,288
that can't be solved
by throwing money at it.

354
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,259
Now, let's change
some black minds.

355
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,264
Look what Jenna's goons
have done.

356
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:34,626
Pete's going insane.

357
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,147
The pranksmen are neutered.

358
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:37,983
We can't let her get away
with this.

359
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,240
Well, what can we do?

360
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:40,861
We're just
three nerdy white guys,

361
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,113
and she's got a whole army.

362
00:13:43,703 --> 00:13:46,041
But what if she didn't?

363
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,284
I know what we should do.

364
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,584
Pumpkin patch?

365
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,539
Hi, I'm Hollywood liberal
Don Cheadle,

366
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:57,195
and I supp...

367
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,890
I support Mitt Romney.

368
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,373
Good, continue.

369
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:03,177
Barack Obama would
have you believe

370
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,897
that African-Americans are
better off under his leadership.

371
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:07,882
But I just got $10 million

372
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,517
for appearing in an ad
for Mitt Romney.

373
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,450
So ask yourselves,
brothers and sisters,

374
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,999
who's really got your back?

375
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:14,355
'Cause from where I'm standing,

376
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:15,857
Mitt Romney is a...

377
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:18,279
Oh, my dear...

378
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,695
Mitt Romney is a layup.

379
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,413
But don't just take it from me.

380
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,703
Take it from my good friend
the black transformer, jazz.

381
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,949
What's crackin', my homies?

382
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:28,886
Jazz gets down
with the rom-nizzle.

383
00:14:28,921 --> 00:14:30,665
Oh, my God, does he really
talk like that in the movie?

384
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:32,797
Paid for by Americans
for an American America.

385
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:33,925
"Dy-no-mite."

386
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,409
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

387
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:36,959
That is garbage.

388
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:38,620
What are you talking about?

389
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:41,980
That was don cheadle and jazz,
your heroes.

390
00:14:42,308 --> 00:14:45,122
Do you know
how expensive that was?

391
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:48,157
Okay, I get it.

392
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:51,681
Let me do some,
uh, community organizing.

393
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,316
Sir, I am
a deputized election monitor,

394
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:57,180
and when my supervisor Barbara
gets out of her aquarobics class,

395
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,783
she <i>will</i> be hearing about this,

396
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:01,786
if she's found the hearing aid
she thinks her roommate stole.

397
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,509
In five, four, three, two.

398
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,161
Listen up, America.

399
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:14,165
Thomas Jefferson once wrote...

400
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:29,563
The greatest danger
to American freedom...

401
00:15:29,598 --> 00:15:32,016
Shut up!
Listen to the words!

402
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:36,988
Is a government
that ignores the constitution.

403
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:39,190
Take it off!

404
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:40,274
No.

405
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,075
Whoo!

406
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:49,024
This is so demoralizing!

407
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:50,341
In the past 24 hours,

408
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,359
I've spent millions of dollars.

409
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:55,029
I got B.E.T.
to let Mike Huckabee present

410
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:57,313
"Best Club Banger"
at the <i>Hip-Hop Awards.</i>

411
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:00,544
And yet we're still polling
at 0% among African-Americans.

412
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:02,203
If my money can't make
a difference,

413
00:16:02,237 --> 00:16:03,370
I'm moving to Monaco.

414
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,539
- Jack, don't say that.
- I'm serious.

415
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:07,508
Over there, they solve
all their problems with money.

416
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,243
They use it to put out fires.

417
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,622
<i>Ce feu m'ennuie.</i>

418
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,548
Why should I even bother
to vote?

419
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,552
New York will go for Obama
even if I voted a hundred times.

420
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,742
Instead of my usual five.

421
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:19,852
Maybe you can make a difference

422
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:20,977
in a battleground state.

423
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:22,796
Oh, what's the point, Garrett?
You know what?

424
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:26,043
I'll tell you exactly how this
election is going to play out.

425
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:32,825
Hey. I just came in
to see how my friend's doing,

426
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:37,051
but obviously he went back into
his mouse hole, so, uh...

427
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:38,388
How are you?

428
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:40,682
Jack was right.

429
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,795
People don't want
an idea bomb dropped on them.

430
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,078
Don't give up.

431
00:16:44,281 --> 00:16:46,843
That is not
the Lisa Loeb I know.

432
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,398
Why do I even vote?

433
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,882
New York's gonna go
for Obama anyway.

434
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:51,938
Maybe if I lived in Ohio,
I could make a difference.

435
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,020
Actually, no.

436
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,753
Ohio's definitely going
for Romney.

437
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:56,802
Yeah, you don't know
which way Ohio's going.

438
00:16:56,839 --> 00:16:57,778
But I do.

439
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,238
Liz Lemon,
I've done stand-up

440
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,652
in every state in this country.

441
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:02,960
I know the people of America.

442
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:05,253
I know how they think.

443
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:09,354
I can tell you exactly how
this election is gonna play out.

444
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,415
Everyone knows Romney has

445
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:13,607
a vacation home
in New Hampshire.

446
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:14,786
What they don't know

447
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,328
is that he hunts humans
on that property.

448
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:19,174
New Hampshire goes to Obama.

449
00:17:19,757 --> 00:17:22,649
Now, North Carolina goes
to Romney.

450
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,857
I worked there this summer,

451
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:26,628
and they are not on board with
a black man lecturing them.

452
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:29,273
I don't care if it's Obama
talking about health care

453
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:31,292
or me
talking about white butts.

454
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:34,132
They are different
than black butts.

455
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:36,662
Pennsylvania is Obama's.

456
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:39,350
The voting machines there
have become sentient.

457
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:40,759
And, for some reason,

458
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:43,057
they are strongly in favor
of gay marriage.

459
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:44,922
But we're not gonna win
Wisconsin.

460
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,481
I don't know why.

461
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,457
Ever since Tracy set fire
to Lambeau Field,

462
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:52,299
Wisconsinites are coming around
on the death penalty.

463
00:17:52,326 --> 00:17:55,328
Wisconsin goes for Romney.

464
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,001
That just leaves...

465
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,373
Florida, the penis of America!

466
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:01,925
Florida...

467
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,092
The penis of America.

468
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,432
Pete!

469
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,507
We have a scheme
to destroy Jenna

470
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:09,824
and her army of cretins.

471
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:11,215
For the past seven years,

472
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:12,750
I've been compiling a supercut

473
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,935
of all of Jenna Maroney's
worst moments.

474
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:17,938
Security footage,
cell phone videos, rehearsals...

475
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:21,584
All her biggest diva freak-outs
are on this DVD.

476
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,467
When we put this online,

477
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:27,253
the crabcatchers will see
what a fraud Jenna is.

478
00:18:29,384 --> 00:18:31,685
Someone get a P.A.
to feed me baby food.

479
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,783
Or I will drop a "D"
in the greenroom.

480
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,240
No, Pete! Why?

481
00:18:37,296 --> 00:18:39,446
Last night, after the show...

482
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,686
I went to give them
a piece of my mind.

483
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,309
Enjoy, bro.

484
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:48,619
But before I could...

485
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:49,620
♪ Slow down

486
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:52,189
they gave <i>me</i> peace.

487
00:18:52,207 --> 00:18:54,024
♪ Way down

488
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:57,578
♪ go down to the water

489
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,511
there were no 1020-Gs
down there.

490
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:02,132
No neck pain.

491
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,885
No fear.

492
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:07,537
Just easy livin'.

493
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:09,556
Something you mainlanders
wouldn't understand.

494
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:12,375
Pete, come on.

495
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:14,242
Pete's dead.

496
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:17,745
I'm Panama, now.

497
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:20,726
Now, like any penis,

498
00:19:20,757 --> 00:19:23,008
Florida is very complicated.

499
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:25,502
The Cubans in the South...
Very conservative.

500
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,941
I had a lot of expensive cigars
put out on me

501
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,693
in Miami comedy clubs.

502
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:32,302
But central Florida
is dominated

503
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:34,789
by Jewish retirees,
serial killers,

504
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:37,547
and secretly gay
Disney princes,

505
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,620
all of whom love Obama.

506
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:41,514
Meanwhile...

507
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,635
In Northern Florida...

508
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:45,524
Huh.

509
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:48,000
The only crowds
I could never figure out

510
00:19:48,018 --> 00:19:50,168
were in Northern Florida.

511
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:51,782
One week they're laughing at me,

512
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:53,795
the next week,
they're laughing at me.

513
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,826
According to this,
the electorate there

514
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:57,595
is impossible to predict.

515
00:19:57,682 --> 00:20:00,233
It's a combination
of elderly shut-ins,

516
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:01,015
beach bums...

517
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,546
Bus passengers
who ran out of money...

518
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:06,406
Swamp people and pirates.

519
00:20:06,441 --> 00:20:08,919
These people don't like
to be told what to do.

520
00:20:08,956 --> 00:20:11,407
They just want
to sit on the beach and drink.

521
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:14,383
There motto is "unwindulax."

522
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,129
Unwindulax.

523
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,488
Oh, my God.

524
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:23,206
Morning, <i>Crabcatchers</i>.

525
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:28,220
You all unwindulaxing?

526
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,361
One person <i>can</i> make
a difference.

527
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:35,011
And that person is Jenna!

528
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:37,553
The next president
of the United States

529
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:40,160
will be chosen by...

530
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:42,802
Jenna Maroney.

531
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,063
To be continued...

532
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,575
Mr. Spider.

533
00:20:48,722 --> 00:20:50,273
Ew, web in my mouth!

534
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:52,514
<i>Next week, on 30 Rock...</i>

535
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,151

536

542
00:21:04,883 --> 00:21:06,834
<i>Spoiler alert...

543
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:08,819
