163
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,371
If she wants to have a dinner party,

164
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,573
you go fry up some dolphins.

165
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,825
She does say we never entertain.

166
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:18,244
You're losing her.
Go get her!

167
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,629
Go get your woman!

168
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,197
And speaking of which,

169
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,416
Angie's been in the hospital for a week.

170
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,700
Could you go find out why?

171
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,420
- Ooh.
- Thank you.

172
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,008
Frank, you do stand-up.

173
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:34,093
How would you like
to have your own sitcom?

174
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,094
Can I have a hot wife?

175
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,679
- If you gain 50 pounds.
- Yeah.

176
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,264
Hey, I have an idea for a show.

177
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,235
It's about a boy
who befriends a talking panda,

178
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:42,076
and they're allowed
to sleep in the same bed.

179
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,217
Have it on my desk tomorrow.

180
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:46,823
Okay.
[Coughs]

181
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:51,160
Look, Jack, I know you think fixing NBC

182
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:55,164
is just another negative
synergy dynamics matrix.

183
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,565
I wish.

184
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,863
Then I could just solve it
with a Schwarzfeld tesseract.

185
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:01,587
No, this is the nadir of my career, Lemon.

186
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,923
No room for advancement,
a boss who doesn't get it.

187
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,926
Every day, I wish some other
company had bought NBC.

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,095
Xerox, Alcoa, Paas.

189
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,680
The Easter Egg company?

190
00:07:10,714 --> 00:07:11,681
They own their market.

191
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,035
When was the last time you bought

192
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,767
a non-Paas egg-dyeing kit?

193
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,552
Try never.
Paas is the best.

194
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,554
Their wire egg dipper
is tops in the industry

195
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,606
with the thinnest egg loop
to reduce dye lines.

196
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,974
Exactly.

197
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,426
Only I don't work for Paas.
I work for Kabletown.

198
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,896
But I have a plan
that will fix everything.

199
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,448
Okay, here's the thing, Jack.

200
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:31,818
Your plan isn't gonna work.
Your shows are terrible.

201
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,787
I mean, have you seen
that new game show <i>Homonym?</i>

202
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,824
Your next word is "meat."

203
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,158
Oh, boy. Um...

204
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,043
Like when two people run into each other.

205
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,495
Uh, sorry, it's the other one.

206
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,831
- Your next word is "stare."
- Okay.

207
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,499
Um, the things you climb to get...

208
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,884
No, no, it's the other one.

209
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,838
It's always the other one.
Let me see the card.

210
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,287
No! Never!

211
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,005
- Your shows stink, Jack.
- Really?

212
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,223
So you don't peacock them?

213
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,092
I don't... think so.

214
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,643
But look, I get it.

215
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:00,038
The clock's ticking, and you
feel like time's running out.

216
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,564
It's like me and everything.

217
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,015
How long is this show gonna last?

218
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,400
How many eggs do I have left?

219
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:06,635
Will I ever finish reading
<i>the corrections?</i>

220
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,938
But you can't let that panic
get into your head.

221
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:10,612
Well, thank you for your feedback, Lemon,

222
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:12,773
but I'm not panicking,
I know exactly what I'm doing,

223
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,911
so good peacock to you.

224
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:19,615
- But, Jack...
- I said good peacock.

225
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:20,816
[Sighs]

226
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,503
Mr. Jordan.

227
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,505
I mentioned your
dinner party idea to Hazel.

228
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,956
Yes.

229
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,127
And I thought we'd have a little
<i>fete Chez nous ce soir.</i>

230
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,281
Oh, how nice to meet a woman
who speaks the language

231
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:35,848
of the Nazis'
most enthusiastic collaborators.

232
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,466
What a kind invitation.

233
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,719
I do enjoy seeing
the homes of poor whites.

234
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,770
What should I bring?

235
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,389
Just bring your fascinating self.

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
Kenneth tells me that you started

237
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,442
your own movie studio this summer.

238
00:08:46,476 --> 00:08:49,228
Yes. I'm sort of
the black Tyler Perry.

239
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,519
Oh, and I'm an aspiring actress

240
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,840
whose most recent credits include

241
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,150
running onstage during <i>Sister act.</i>

242
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,735
This is wonderful.

243
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,204
Tracy Jordan is coming to dinner.

244
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,239
Just like in that episode
of <i>Family matters</i>

245
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,375
when Tracy Jordan came to dinner.

246
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,127
You know I wasn't scripted
to be in that episode.

247
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:09,365
I just wandered onto set because
Reginald Veljohnson owed me $40.

248
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,133
Oh.
[Chuckles]

249
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,336
I'm thinking about Vegas
for the bachelorette party.

250
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,703
We can't stay at the Palms.

251
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,055
One of the Maloofs wants me dead,

252
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,139
and the other one loves me.

253
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:18,454
I don't remember which is which.

254
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:19,842
Okay, great.

255
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,143
Tracy, I need your advice.

256
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:22,261
You like to throw parties.

257
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,146
Why is everyone asking me for advice?

258
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,848
I'm Tracy Jordan.

259
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:28,050
Father of 3, married 22 years.

260
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,152
I run my own business.

261
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:33,656
Oh, my God.
I'm the most stable adult here.

262
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,908
Oh, God, I don't want to be
Jenna's maid of honor.

263
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,559
She wants her "something borrowed"

264
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,445
to be Jessica Biel's youth.

265
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,447
I don't know how to get that.

266
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,498
If you don't want to do this,
you should tank it.

267
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,652
That's what I do when
I want to get out of something

268
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,493
like a schedule,
a parent-teacher conference,

269
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:49,121
or this boring conversation.

270
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,289
Tank it?
Wow, no.

271
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,674
That's not "how I roll."

272
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,588
Thank you for saying that
in dated urban slang

273
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,177
so that I'll understand you.

274
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:56,429
Word.

275
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,015
And I would certainly never tank
on my friend Jenna.

276
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,383
Because you're terrified of her,

277
00:10:00,402 --> 00:10:02,602
the way most white ladies are
with their best friends?

278
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,437
That is racist, and only part true.

279
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,857
A good person doesn't
intentionally do a bad job.

280
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,525
I mean, look at Jack.

281
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,119
He's in this terrible position at work,

282
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,440
he wishes he were somewhere else.

283
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:13,195
Is he tanking it?

284
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,265
No. In fact,
he's trying even harder.

285
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,619
Tonight on NBC, Joe Rogan is <i>Mandela.</i>

286
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:22,405
And if it's Wednesday, it must
be cricket night in America.

287
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,658
Then on Jay, a full hour
of Gary Sinise's band.

288
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:30,162
Oh, my God.
Jack's tanking NBC!

289
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,120
Turn your round.
God cop scene 24.

290
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,568
I know what you're doing, Jack.

291
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,737
You are purposely tanking the network.

292
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:40,851
Good God, Lemon, what is it

293
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,772
with you liberals
and your conspiracy theories?

294
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:43,941
I've got bad news for you.

295
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,293
The CIA did not invent crack cocaine,

296
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,245
the Levees blew themselves up
in New Orleans,

297
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,265
and no one is trying to destroy NBC.

298
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:53,250
Hang on, did you cast yourself
in this show?

299
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,251
What can I say?

300
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,037
We saw hundreds of actors for God.

301
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,448
Finally, the network executive
said I should just play it.

302
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,757
You're the network executive.

303
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:04,512
Uh, could we have a moment, please?

304
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:06,514
Fine.
You got me.

305
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:09,467
I'm steering the <i>Titanic</i> into the iceberg.

306
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:10,851
Why?
Are you trying to get fired?

307
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,646
I'm trying to get Hank
to sell the network,

308
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:14,087
and the only way to make him do that

309
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:16,107
is to turn it into
a money-losing embarrassment.

310
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,609
[Gasps] This explains everything.

311
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,010
How long has this been going on?

312
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,612
Seven years, eight?

313
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:22,730
Six weeks.

314
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:24,348
I have an investor lined up

315
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,784
who'll buy the network
and keep me in charge.

316
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:28,152
I can't tell you who it is,

317
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,370
but his word is as good

318
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,455
as the color consistency
on one of his Easter Eggs.

319
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,523
Adolph Paas?

320
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,959
This is wrong, Jack.

321
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,745
Lemon, I cannot go to another
business school reunion

322
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,998
and sit at the non-CEO table
with the...

323
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,716
Women and nice men.

324
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:45,071
You're right, Lemon, the clock
is ticking for both of us,

325
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,588
but if I pull this off,
it's good for you too.

326
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,874
You've never worked at a
properly-managed company before.

327
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:52,176
That's true.

328
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,250
Before this, I ran
an all-women's theater company.

329
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,691
- Everyone was vice-president.
- Think of the job stability.

330
00:11:56,692 --> 00:12:00,217
Less stress, a commissary
that has taco Tuesdays again.

331
00:12:00,235 --> 00:12:03,270
After seven years,
you'll finally have a life.

332
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:04,721
And what if your plan doesn't work?

333
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:05,940
Of course, it's a risk,

334
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,409
but sometimes your only choice
is to blow everything up

335
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:11,195
and build something better
out of the rubble.

336
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,948
Look at Sherman's march to the sea.

337
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,617
Or what my good friend bane
tried to do to Gotham.

338
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:17,701
Join me, Lemon.

339
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,170
Help me tank NBC.

340
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:22,957
Never. You're playing
with peoples' lives here.

341
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,074
Who do you think you are?

342
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:26,410
God, we're ready for you.

343
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:34,351
If there is one thing
I have realized from being God,

344
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,936
it's that the more you know,

345
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,556
the more you realize you do not...

346
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,557
Know.

347
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,858
Why is he learning anything?

348
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,726
He's supposed to be God.
[Knock on door]

349
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,479
[Gasps, turns off TV]

350
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,698
Now, don't embarrass me.

351
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,438
Tracy!
Welcome to our home.

352
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:55,823
Well, it's not technically a home,

353
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,941
because no one's
supposed to be living here,

354
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,412
but welcome to our condemned
site of the Candyman murders.

355
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:04,465
Will you put this in the oven
at about 200 degrees?

356
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:06,133
My snake should be very comfortable

357
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:07,451
while she gives birth.

358
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,720
Oh.

359
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:14,141
Mr. Jordan, please help
yourself to some appetizers.

360
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:19,096
Thank you.
Your home is terrible.

361
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,131
Shall we conversation?

362
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:23,234
- Yes. We're having weather.
- Much weather.

363
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,802
So speaking of your movie studio...

364
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,138
This conversation has a real flow to it.

365
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:30,608
Do you ever have any roles for white women

366
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,010
who've been described
by the <i>Hollywood reporter</i>

367
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:36,847
as "some lady" who ruined
the premiere of <i>Paranorman?</i>

368
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,516
Oh, I always have one white
person in all of my movies.

369
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:40,784
We have to have a villain.

370
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,620
Oh, and who's worse than us whites, right?

371
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:46,123
I mean, look at slavery.
That was bananas.

372
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,958
[Laughter] [Clattering]

373
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,361
Oh, that sturgeon just will not die.

374
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:54,298
Excuse me a moment.

375
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,166
Oh, I also do accents.

376
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,503
[Asian accent] Oh, me a cockney person.

377
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:02,006
This is your Uncle Bob?

378
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,208
[Laughs]

379
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,730
Oh, Liz.
F.Y.I.

380
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:11,815
Paul's family dog
is gonna be the ring bearer.

381
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,185
Zoltan is an 18-year-old
German Shepherd who cannot walk.

382
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,659
So you're gonna be in charge of him.

383
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:17,973
No, Jenna, I'm allergic to dogs.

384
00:14:17,974 --> 00:14:18,889
Oh, don't worry.

385
00:14:18,907 --> 00:14:21,358
He's hairless because
of his insanity medication.

386
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:25,075
Also, since this is a surprise wedding,

387
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,396
you're gonna want to carry around

388
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:28,277
your bridesmaid's dress
with you at all times.

389
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:31,068
Look how great this is
gonna look next to me.

390
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,486
You know I can't wear green, Jenna.

391
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:35,623
The clinique lady says
I have witch undertones.

392
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,924
Liz, this isn't about you.

393
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,009
Now, tonight, we have
a tasting with the caterer.

394
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,444
It's gonna be molecular gastronomy.

395
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:43,013
The cake is a tasteless foam.

396
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,515
[Deep voice] There's no cake?

397
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,849
Tonight on NBC...

398
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,051
<i>Tank it,</i>

399
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,526
the reality event of the year

400
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:50,087
where we make grandpas put on tank tops

401
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:52,189
and then laugh at them.

402
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:53,641
<i>Tank it.</i>

403
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,527
You know what?
I can't do anything tonight.

404
00:14:56,561 --> 00:15:01,264
Because tonight is your surprise
bachelorette party! Aah!

405
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,600
Aah! No way!
You planned it already?

406
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:06,570
Sure. And you should
get your hopes way up.

407
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:08,238
See you at my apartment
at 8:00.

408
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:10,157
Your apartment?
Why?

409
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,275
It's a surprise.

410
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:14,828
And there's nothing worse
than a surprise Lemon party.

411
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,543
Kenneth, darling,

412
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,691
why don't you run out and get dessert?

413
00:15:28,697 --> 00:15:31,666
Oh, but we have government ice cream.

414
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,202
And that's what you're
gonna serve to Tracy Jordan?

415
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,137
I'm as shocked as anybody.

416
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,757
Oh, uh, okay.

417
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:40,168
Oh, maybe the nice vending machine

418
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,594
at the prison is working again.

419
00:15:45,881 --> 00:15:47,161
You're a real man, Tracy Jordan,

420
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:48,316
playing it cool all night

421
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:50,485
while I rubbed your foot under the table.

422
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,987
My foot?

423
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:54,072
No.
That's shoe stuffing.

424
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:56,441
It helps keep the shape of my shoes.

425
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:59,194
Why was you rubbing my foot anyway?

426
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:03,031
Please.

427
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:05,000
You know what's happening here.

428
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:08,119
I never know what's happening anywhere.

429
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,838
[Giggling]

430
00:16:09,872 --> 00:16:13,041
Okay, let's get this party started!

431
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:16,928
Ooh, I smell Italian guys.

432
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,714
What is this?

433
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:21,082
It's your bachelorette party.

434
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,340
Bethany from work is here,
and a bunch of my neighbors,

435
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:24,636
a clown.

436
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:27,255
And there's a <i>God cop</i> marathon on NBC.

437
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:28,440
I think Esposito lied to us.

438
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,976
What do you mean "you think"?
You're God!

439
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,811
I don't understand the rules of this.

440
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,529
Let us pray.

441
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,398
To whom?

442
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:37,482
Before you say anything,

443
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,484
I have one more surprise for you.

444
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:42,404
Officer, we're ready!

445
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:45,440
Oh, thank God.

446
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,909
Listen up, ladies.
You're all in a lot of trouble

447
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:51,112
if you don't protect yourselves
against identity theft.

448
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,281
Please take a pamphlet, pass them along.

449
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:55,583
Okay, you're upset.

450
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:56,835
But this is what you get

451
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:59,054
when you choose Liz Lemon
as your maid of honor.

452
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:00,839
Oh, so let's get this over with.

453
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,791
I mean, what's the worst
you could possibly...

454
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:06,511
- Aah!
- [Screams]

455
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:08,930
Tracy, I will do anything

456
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:11,850
to play a villain in one of your movies.

457
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:13,601
The camera loves me.

458
00:17:13,635 --> 00:17:16,855
Especially when I flash my baby blues.

459
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,639
Why are they blue?

460
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,075
- Yeah.
- No.

461
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,609
I'm married, Hazel.

462
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:22,977
So am I.

463
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,447
And if he ever wakes up
from that coma, I'm dead!

464
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:27,815
That's why I live for today.

465
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,785
You're just using Kenneth,
and I'm telling him everything!

466
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:33,588
Whatever.
Go ahead and try.

467
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,340
I'm gonna have to try?

468
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:38,593
Worst night ever!

469
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:39,048
[Crash]

470
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,329
Just ask one of your famous
friends to be maid of honor!

471
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:43,598
Why do you think I asked you
in the first place?

472
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,666
Because you're not famous!

473
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,719
You think I want someone up there with me

474
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,054
that other people are looking at?

475
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:50,545
I wanted you because you're nothing!

476
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:51,606
[Glass breaks] [Screams]

477
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,840
Yeah, I get it.

478
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:54,418
You didn't want to get Pippa Middleton.

479
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,811
Why would you even mention her?

480
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:58,980
[Crash]

481
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:02,517
Who's gonna be my maid of honor now, Liz?

482
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:03,568
Nobody.

483
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,287
From the rubble, I will build.

484
00:18:06,322 --> 00:18:08,656
Are you talking about me
underneath your breath?

485
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,024
Jenna, that's it.

486
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:11,734
Nobody will be your maid of honor

487
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:13,495
because there's only
one person who can be.

488
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:14,695
You.

489
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:17,165
- What? That's crazy.
- Think about it.

490
00:18:17,199 --> 00:18:19,167
There would be nobody
to steal your spotlight.

491
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,754
In fact, you would have two spotlights.

492
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:26,307
I think the maid of honor
should sing at my wedding.

493
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:27,283
Sure.

494
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,524
And she could do a fashion
show that takes the audience

495
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,045
all the way through the wedding night.

496
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:32,663
And what if she came in in a wheelchair,

497
00:18:32,664 --> 00:18:37,102
and then stood up, and everyone
applauded and cried?

498
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:40,021
I know you doubted me, but now
you see my plan could work.

499
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:42,824
So what do you say?

500
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,225
Are you on board, Liz?

501
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:45,660
You just called me Liz!

502
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:47,294
Oh, we can fix that in the cutting room.

503
00:18:47,295 --> 00:18:48,696
Uh, Jonathan...

504
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,865
Where's my car?

505
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:59,841
Kenneth, I have something
I need to tell you.

506
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,948
Last night when you left,
Hazel came on to me

507
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:04,629
'cause she wants me to put her in a movie.

508
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,747
Hazel, is this true?

509
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,467
Yeah, it is true.

510
00:19:09,518 --> 00:19:10,585
Not!

511
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:11,919
What I said was

512
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:14,522
I would never sleep with Tracy
for a part in a movie.

513
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:17,308
Oh, please, you would love for
me to fall asleep on top of you.

514
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,893
Come on, Kenmore washers and dryers,

515
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,695
who you gonna believe here?

516
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:23,264
- My best friend.
- Not really.

517
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,766
- And my girlfriend.
- You wish.

518
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:27,768
Well, I always believe you, sir,

519
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:29,320
because you're on television.

520
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:31,706
And webisodes.

521
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,708
But yesterday you told me
our women are queens,

522
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:34,942
and they're always right,

523
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,213
which means I should believe Hazel.

524
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:40,782
But that would make you wrong,
Mr. Jordan.

525
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:43,418
And you've never been wrong
about anything before.

526
00:19:43,452 --> 00:19:45,253
It's a blessing and a purse.

527
00:19:45,287 --> 00:19:48,640
You can't both be right.

528
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:55,230
Unless Hazel is always right.

529
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:58,299
But only because you said so,
Mr. Jordan,

530
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:01,603
which means you're right too.

531
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:05,273
And both sides being right
is like kissing your sister.

532
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:08,276
A wonderful treat!

533
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,744
[Laughs]

534
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:11,246
Bad move, Jordan.

535
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,481
We'll see who's still
working here in six months.

536
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:16,034
My hearing is bad because of firecrackers,

537
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:19,037
but we'll see who's still
working here in six months.

538
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:21,489
- That's what I just said.
- What?

539
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:22,874
Okay, I get it.

540
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:24,659
Sometimes tanking it is the only option.

541
00:20:24,677 --> 00:20:26,094
What did you do?

542
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:29,597
Fake a sprained ankle to get
out of that breast health 5k?

543
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:30,831
No, I did that.

544
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,500
I forgot my sports bra, so ironically...

545
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:33,801
Uh, it doesn't matter, Lemon.

546
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:36,521
I'm just glad that you've seen the light.

547
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:40,975
Now, help me tank NBC,
and you'll be helping yourself.

548
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:42,227
You'll have it all.

549
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:44,395
Jack, it's 9:30
in the morning.

550
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:46,981
We're not trying to do
a good job here, Lemon.

551
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:48,116
Now, what do you say?

552
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,686
Are you in?

553
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:53,621
Let's take this mother down.

554
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:02,742
- Next word, "sent."
- I don't care.

555
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,282
Okay, "cent" like a penny.
Whatever.

556
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,733
No! Sorry, no.

557
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:09,502
Oh, it's a homonym double down.

558
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:10,754
Means you get to guess again.

559
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:11,788
- "Sent."
- Okay, um...

560
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,125
Then "scent" like a smell or an odor.

561
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:17,010
No. It's the third one.

562
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,578
[Bleep] Yourself!

563
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:20,413
Next word is "au pere."

564
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:21,965
What? There is only
one definition.

565
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,583
It's like a nanny, a foreign nanny.

566
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:24,751
No! You forgot.

567
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,649
It could also be an exclamation
about a fruit,

568
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,305
as in, "oh, pear!"

569
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:30,190
What you are doing here is not right!

570
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:32,525
I'm... I'm leaving.
