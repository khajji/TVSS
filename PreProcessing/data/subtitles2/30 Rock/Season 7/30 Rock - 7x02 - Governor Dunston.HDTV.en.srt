00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:24,985
We...
Oh, my...

317
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,655
Uh-oh.

318
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,576
You got married?
When?

319
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,894
Seven years ago.

320
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:38,398
Look, Ken, I'm just trying
to replace your dad...

321
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,117
Oh, dang it.

322
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:43,236
That's the wrong thing
to say, isn't it?

323
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:46,707
If you will excuse me,
I have to get back to work.

324
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:54,047
This is terrible.

325
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:56,299
I've never gone this long
without talking.

326
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,385
Okay, if we're
doing a show tonight,

327
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:00,637
Tracy needs to do a run-through
with the vomit rig.

328
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:02,022
Props can do 4:00...

329
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:04,591
Oh, no, I promised Criss
I would be home this afternoon.

330
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:05,942
Yeah, for that.

331
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:08,428
And get this.
Criss wants to make it fun.

332
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:10,397
How do you make sex fun?

333
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:11,815
Well, Paula never
opens her eyes.

334
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,900
So what I do is look
at a nursing school catalog

335
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:14,901
I keep under my pillow.

336
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,820
Ugh.

337
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,822
This five shows a week thing
is bonkers.

338
00:13:18,873 --> 00:13:21,775
So, great, let's all
figure out when I can have sex.

339
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:24,961
Okay, what if Jenna
did her DVD commentary

340
00:13:24,996 --> 00:13:26,830
while she was getting
vajazzled?

341
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:28,615
Then we could move
the prop meeting up.

342
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,500
You know what, we have to look
at the whole month.

343
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,390
Ooh, yeah.
There it is.

344
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:41,261
I need to cross-reference this
with my menstruations.

345
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,099
Ooh, this is complicated.

346
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,901
I'm going to have to color code
all of this.

347
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:50,654
Tracy will be red,
Jenna is blue,

348
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:53,073
and I will be green.

349
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,310
Ooh, yeah.
That's nice.

350
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,863
This is, um...

351
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:02,315
Mm, it's getting
hot in here.

352
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,536
If I had a column
for my basal body temperature,

353
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:10,791
then I could schedule around
peak ovulation.

354
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:13,794
Right there.
Yes, that is the spot.

355
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,095
Oh, God.

356
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,097
This whole thing
could be a spreadsheet.

357
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:19,999
If we print it in landscape,
the page will take it all.

358
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:22,602
Oh, yeah.
It'll take it all.

359

[Giggles]
Oh, my God.

Hi.

361
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:29,676
Hey!
That was ten dollars.

362
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:32,145
I think I figured out what's
been missing from my sex life.

363
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,513
Organizing it.

364
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,452
Cooter?
Cooter Berger?

365
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:40,654
Hi, Jack.

366
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:43,073
I took the liberty
of making myself a drink.

367
00:14:43,124 --> 00:14:46,293
Is that red wine with
tonic water and olives in it?

368
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:49,296
Yep.
It's an old Spanish.

369
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,865
Is that not a thing?

370
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:54,167
Oh, the guys at the office told
me it was a cool drink.

371
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:56,336
I'm always getting pranked.

372
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,538
Anyway.

373
00:14:58,556 --> 00:14:59,539
Ow.

374
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:01,541
So, uh, what have you
been up to?

375
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,594
Well, after 2008,
I went back to being a lobbyist.

376
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:06,730
You know, just hanging out
in hotel lobbies.

377
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:08,815
If you wear a red vest,
sometimes people think

378
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,101
you're a valet and you can
take a nap in their car.

379
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:12,402
Right.

380
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,771
Well, it looks like
you're back on your feet.

381
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:15,906
And how.
You're looking at

382
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,724
the deputy chief
of media relations,

383
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,693
Romney-Dunston 2012.

384
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:21,111
Here, have a sticker.

385
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:24,397
Cooter, this is a puffy frog
with googly eyes.

386
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,732
Oh, no.

387
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,568
I've been handing those out
all day.

388
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:31,454
Listen, Jack,
the reason I'm here...

389
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:34,257
We need to talk about this whole
Bob Dunston <i>TGS</i> thing.

390
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,127
Yes, I'm taking care of that,
I assure you.

391
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:39,930
There will be no more
Bob Dunston sketches on <i>TGS.</i>

392
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:41,932
No, no, no.
That's not what we want.

393
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:44,751
We need you to make fun
of Dunston as much as possible.

394
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,353
What? Why?

395
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:47,888
Because it's making him
likeable.

396
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:49,189
He's actually very mean.

397
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:50,690
But with Tracy Jordan
playing him...

398
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,392
He's a lovable buffoon.

399
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:53,393
Exactly.

His re-segregation
of the Alabama schools.

402
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:58,598
His long-time sexual
relationship

403
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:01,368
with the Hank Williams statue
outside Montgomery city hall.

404
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,203
They're just talking
about how funny Tracy is.

405
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:04,287
It's a win-win.

406
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:06,206
You help us
take back the White House.

407
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,707
And you goose NBC's ratings.

408
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:10,377
Yes, and I do want NBC
to get good ratings.

409
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:11,544
Yeah, I know.

Can we trouble you
for some advice?

415
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:25,415
Yes.
If you're only in New York

416
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,585
for a few days, find a way to
see Amar'e Stoudemire's penis.

417
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:30,003
It's worth it.

All right, but we'd like
to talk to you about Kenny.

Wait.
You said you write songs.

Yes, I do, but I'm not
a professional like you,

Hey!

485
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,424
Where you think you are,
officemax?

486
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:26,012
Get out of here,
you perverts.

487
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:27,931
Two minutes.
Two minutes to air.

488
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:29,015
Lemon, where have you been?

489
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,466
You have a show to do.

490
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:33,403
Don't worry about the show.
It's all scheduled.

491
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:36,139
Look at this.
Oh, yeah, mommy like.

492
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:37,741
What's wrong with you?

493
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,576
I've solved
my intimacy issues, Jack.

494
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,278
Now that the show is on
every night,

495
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,146
everything
has to be organized...

496

[Speaking German]

497
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,750
Well, congratulations.

498
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:47,918
I just want to make sure that

499
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,920
you're doing a Bob Dunston
sketch tonight.

500
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,621
Why?

501
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,123
Because of the, uh,
first amendment.

502
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:54,124
Which I love.

503
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:55,158
And what you told me earlier.

504
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:56,927
You convinced me.
You win.

505
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,211
You think I'm an idiot?

506
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:00,496
I didn't win that argument.
I'm an idiot.

507
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:04,434
Lemon, what do you
want me to say?

508
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:07,304
You're helping
the Romney-Dunston ticket, okay?

509
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:08,722
People like Dunston
because they like Tracy.

510
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:09,839
What?
No.

511
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:11,391
If these sketches
are helping Romney,

512
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,508
we're not doing them.

513
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:13,944
Yes, maybe that's
for the best.

514
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:15,228
The success of your show
is the only thing

515
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,646
keeping Hank
from selling NBC.

516
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,065
And if he doesn't sell,
I'll spend the rest of my career

517
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:21,034
in corporate obscurity,
like a woman with children.

518
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,485
Damn it.

519
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,204
But if I don't help Romney,
it's four more years

520
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:26,740
of socialism and corporations
not being people

521
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,358
and a basketball court
at the White House.

522
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:30,526
Let me make your choice easy.
Jack, it's over.

523
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:32,412
Yes, but is it that easy?

524
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:35,916
You stop doing Dunston's <i>TGS</i> 
goes back to one night a week,

525
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,635
you can kiss goodbye your
Dusseldorf bus schedule sex.

526
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:40,804
You'll be having
Paris Metro sex.

527
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:44,040
Long sessions of afternoon
love-making, followed by talking

528
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:46,643
and making circles with your
finger in Criss' chest hair.

529
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:47,928
No.
You can't make me.

530
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:51,047
Do the sketch, I help Romney,
but I ruin my career.

531
00:20:51,065 --> 00:20:55,685
Cut the sketch, you help Obama,
but you screw up your life plan.

532
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,987
It's a win-lose.

533
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:59,055
Tracy to the floor
for the cold open.

534
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:00,156
So what are we
going to do?

535
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,027
Break a leg, tray.

536
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:05,061
That shouldn't be hard.

537
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,747
I have a severe
calcium deficiency.

538

541

Gwen, I'm glad
you brought up my record.

542
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:31,198
It's called
<i>Sounds of seduction.</i>

543
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
And it's available
on iTunes.

544
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:36,304
There are nine types
of legitimate rape.

545
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:38,539
One... a Halloween party.

546
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,309
Let me ask you a question, sir.

547
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:44,712
Do you know if this auditorium
validates parking?

548
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:47,381
Our opponent would like you
to believe

549
00:21:47,383 --> 00:21:49,484
that Mitt Romney
is a merman.

550
00:21:49,486 --> 00:21:53,070
Now, I know Mitt Romney
does not live in the sea.

551
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:55,356
A mormon, governor.

552
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:57,391
A mormon?
Now, that's crazy.
