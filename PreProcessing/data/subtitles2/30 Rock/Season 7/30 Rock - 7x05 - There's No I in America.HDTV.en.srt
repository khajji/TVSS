00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:25,292
No, Tracy, Jenna Maroney.

475
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:27,177
- Cool.
- Okay.

476
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:29,263
All I have to do is figure out
Jenna's password.

477
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,799
How 'bout "me69"?

478
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,835
Yep.

479
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,419
Oh, Tracy, no.

480
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:38,088
No, I can say that word.
I'm black.

481
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:41,424
But Dick Clark wasn't.

482
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,779
Hey! You're not
really leaving, are ya?

483
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:47,030
I know it's the second time,

484
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:49,149
but it's our last shot
at feeling...

485
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
This.

486
00:18:50,434 --> 00:18:52,269
Then what? Someday maybe
we elect a wheelchair guy?

487
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,823
Okay, great, but not fun.

488
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,741
Look, Pete,
this isn't 2008.

489
00:18:57,775 --> 00:19:01,444
I don't know, maybe if
more stuff really had changed.

490
00:19:01,463 --> 00:19:02,629
Hey, sugar lips.

491
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:05,966
Let's make like
a black magazine and <i>Jet.</i>

492
00:19:11,556 --> 00:19:12,506
What's up, guy?

493
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:13,757
Thanks for keeping
my lady warm

494
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,792
while I turn on my hot tub
with my phone.

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,844
Come on, baby.

496

My 2012 corvette's
parked outside.

497
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,149
'Cause I always
find a parking spot.

498
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:25,302
- You're him.
- That's right, pops.

499

I'm Peter horn.

All day...

501
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:31,608
And all night.

502

Well, well,

well, well,
well, well, well,

504
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:44,988
well...
Nope, that's too many "Wells."

505
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:46,656
I'm gonna reenter.

506
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:48,175
Just spit it out, Lemon.

507
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,593
I stole a page
from your playbook, Jack.

508
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:52,262
I used Tracy,
I committed cyber crime,

509
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:56,099
I got Jenna kicked off Twitter
before she could endorse Romney.

510
00:19:56,134 --> 00:19:58,769
Deviousness? I guess two
can play at that game.

511
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,721
Just like most games.

512
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:02,022
And now you're smiling

513
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:03,023
because you're gonna
try to tell me

514
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,441
that this was your plan
all along.

515
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:05,809
"Oh, I turned you
into me, Lemon.

516
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:07,561
It was my plan all along."

517
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:09,229
No, I'm smiling because
I ended up telling Jenna

518
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,647
not to do anything at all.

519
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,016
I didn't want her
choosing our president.

520
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:16,203
No one should grow up
in Jenna Maroney's America.

521
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:17,654
'Cause of the children?

522
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:20,290
Did my one-woman show
actually change your mind?

523
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:21,959
Should I workshop it
at the fringe festival?

524
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:24,378
- Sure.
- Typical Donaghy.

525
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:28,665
You sentimental, self-righteous,
badger-faced shrew.

526
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:30,000
Typical Lemon.

527
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:33,536
You cynical, manipulative,
cold-blooded adonis.

528
00:20:33,555 --> 00:20:37,140
So maybe we rubbed off
on each other after all.

Mm...

531
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:42,646
Oh, yours dripped on me
and now I'm drunk.

532
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,899
Good Lord in heaven.

Mr. Hornberger,

537
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:06,486
I just voted!

538
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:08,038
Doesn't it just
fill you with hope?

539
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:11,024
Like anything can happen?

540
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:13,927
All day, all night, baby.

541
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:16,513
Mmm! Hmm?
