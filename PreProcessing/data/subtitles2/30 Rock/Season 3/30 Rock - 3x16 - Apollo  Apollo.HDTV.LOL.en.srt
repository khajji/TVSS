00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,360
- Hello?
- Lemon. Good morning.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,840
What... what is that sound?
Are you frying bacon?

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,110
No,it's my new running shoes.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,820
Come on. Lemon,I'm going over the guest
list for my fiftieth birthday party.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,950
and you haven't gotten RSVPed.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,370
Oh,right. Sorry. My
mail's been piling up.

7
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,070
And I keep forgetting
to buy toilet paper. So.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,180
What is that supposed to mean?

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,310
Nothing,i'm coming.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,060
Good. And don't wear
that thing with a belt.

11
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,800
What thing with a belt? Don't hang
up. I have a lot of belts that...

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,670
Ugh,what is this idiot doing?

13
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,220
I will be brief. I have decided to
fulfill my dream of going into space.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,950
If you have a spaceship and are
looking for a hillarious astronaut

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,820
with an irregular heartbeat
and thirty million dollars.

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,230
I'm prepared to leave
as soon as tomorrow.

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,000
I wrote that yesterday. I
will not be taking questions.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,720
- Hello,dummy.
- No!

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,970
Nope,not interested. Have a good life.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,280
It's important. It's about my mom.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,010
That was a lie.

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,570
But listen,Elizabeth. I recently
discovered that I'm a sex addict.

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,300
- No,you're not.
- Yeah,yeah.

24
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,090
I'd be an even worse sex addict if I wasn't
so consumed by my latest business adventure.

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,690
I don't wanna hear
about your job,Dennis.

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,770
One word. Coffee. One
problem. What do you get it?

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,110
Anywhere,you get it anywhere.

28
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,940
Wrong. You get it at my
coffee vending machine.

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,180
38 and 6th in the basement at K-mart.

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,510
You just go downstairs.
You get the key from David.

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,700
- And boom,you plug into a machine.
- You're done.

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,190
But the point is I'm
Dennis. And I'm a sex addict.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,440
And one of my steps towards
recovery is atonement.

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,420
Please,stop talking.

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,200
Or my sex partner.

36
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,750
I'm sorry that my disease has made
you my victim of my sexual chrisma.

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,410
I'm sorry that I've
ruined you for other men.

38
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,350
Apology accepted. Now
get out of my apartment.

39
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,520
You know,my sponsor said you were gonna try
to pick a fight to lure me in and hit sex.

40
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,660
It's not gonna work,Elizabeth. My
support group is lousy with infos.

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,460
Have you seen this tracy thing?

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,560
I am aware of it.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,660
I have a google news
alert for the phrase

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,860
"tracy jordan ridiculous disaster."

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,860
Have you spoken to him?

49
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,260
We're on the phone with his assistant

50
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,860
Setting up a time for us to talk.

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
Well,when do you expect him?

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,560
I think he has stuff all morning.

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,660
You think or you know?

54
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,460
Hang on. I'm going into a tunnel.

55
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,560
What is this?

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,760
My mother sent me a box
of old donaghy home movies.

57
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,360
For your birthday? That's sweet.

58
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,260
No,not really.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,460
This is the card that came with it.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360
"jackie,here is some of your junk.

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,460
"it was taking up the space

62
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,760
"my new boyfriend
needed for his golf bags.

63
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,960
His name is paul and he
doesn't want to meet you."

64
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,060
- mm.
- at any rate,

65
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,160
I had jonathan convert
the movies to dvd,

66
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,460
Preserve these memories forever.

67
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,960
Oh,my god.is that you?

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,360
I like your little sweater vest.

69
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,360
Oh! Hi-yo!

70
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
- you threw up?
- what?

71
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,760
As a kid you never got
so excited you vomited?

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,960
No. No one does that.

73
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,660
I mean,i've peed a little.

74
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,560
Help me!

75
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,960
His tie caught in the shredder!

76
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,960
I'm lizzing! I'm lizzing!

77
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,160
"lizzing" is a combination
of laughing and whizzing.

78
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,860
Uh,well if you want
a good lizz,read this.

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,110
- What is it?
- A list i made in the fifth grade...

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,360
Of the things i wanted to have done

81
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,460
By the time i turned 50.

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,860
Oh,my god. This is adorable.

83
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,760
"go to disneyland. Ride in an airplane.

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,160
Kiss peggy fleming."

85
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,060
Done,done,and oh,boy. Done.

86
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,360
"live in a house with stairs.

87
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,460
"beat up a russian.

88
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,060
Hit mom with a car."

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,260
I wonder what that ten
year old would think

90
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,660
If he could see himself now.

91
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,160
"fly on a plane." i've
flown on air force one.

92
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,660
"go to disneyland."

93
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,960
Lemon,i've held walt disney's
frozen head in my hands.

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
That's awesome.

95
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,760
I've danced with queen noor.

96
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,760
I've hunted the world's
most dangerous game.

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,860
Man.

98
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
Excuse me. Manatee.

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
I once shot a manatee.

100
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Well,if that kid could
see himself today,

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,260
He would throw up.

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
Thank you,lemon.

103
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,260
There's only one left.

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,960
"be friends with batman."

105
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,160
There's still a couple of hours.

106
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,060
Jonathan.

107
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,860
Could you get adam west's
agent on the phone please.

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,960
Griswald talent management.
Representing excellence.

109
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,060
It's funny.

110
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,460
I actually played peter pan on broadway.

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Did you know there's a
broadway street in tampa?

112
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Now this is important.

113
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,160
This needs to be threaded all the way up

114
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
In order to lock.

115
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,460
Otherwise you could fall.

116
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,760
- in bed.
- pay attention.

117
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,160
Also,you can't have
anything in your pockets.

118
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,360
Oh,my phone.

119
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,160
Will you hold that? Thanks.

120
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,860
Ready.

121
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,260
I'm flying!

122
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,960
Oh,my god.why are there
so many dead doves up here?

123
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,560
Jenna's phone.

124
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
Hey,jenna. This is dennis duffy.

125
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,460
Yes,hello,this is jenna.

126
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,460
I bet you never thought

127
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,860
You'd be hearing from me again now,huh?

128
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,660
Yes,really.why so ever
would you be phoning me?

129
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,060
With the help of webmd

130
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,760
I was recently self-diagnosed
as a sex addict.

131
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,260
So former sex partner,i'm
sorry that my disease

132
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,260
Made you a victim of my sexual charisma.

133
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,260
I'm sorry that i ruined
you for other men.

134
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,960
Look,i would've come down
there and done this in person

135
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,160
But it's complicated because
of the whole liz thing you know.

136
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,760
Naturally.liz. Always.

137
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,460
If she found out about
this she couldn't handle it.

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
And it would ruin your friendship.

139
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,760
You know,i was the love of liz's life.

140
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,460
I'm not sure you were
but apology accepted.

141
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Oh,no. i totally was.

142
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,360
Peace.

143
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Forget it,tracy.

144
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,760
Tracy,listen. You cannot go into space.

145
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,660
Your contract expressly
prohibits dangerous activities

146
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,660
Like extreme sports or riding
the subway on st. Patrick's day.

147
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,260
What is this? Horseville?

148
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,560
'Cause i am surrounded by naysayers!

149
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
- wordplay.
- that is solid.

150
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,460
Look,when i was a kid
growing up in the projects,

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,960
I would look up at the stars

152
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,760
And dream of going into
space. Of escaping the slums.

153
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,260
Of killing an ewok!

154
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,060
Now the man that that kid has become

155
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,160
Can make those dreams come true.

156
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,860
Do you know what that's like?

157
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,960
I do,tracy.

158
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
Then you know why i have to do this.

159
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
As robert browning once wrote,

160
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
"oh,but a man's reach
should exceed his grasp.

161
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,760
Or what is a heaven for?"

162
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,560
I was prepared for the
possibility of this meeting.

163
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,260
Tracy,i'll call up my friends at nasa

164
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,260
And i'll set up a flight for you.

165
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,060
Thank you,jackie d.

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,560
Jack,what the hell?

167
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm not taking his childhood
dream away from him.

168
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,060
Not on my birthday.

169
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,860
So you're just gonna let him do this?

170
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,360
Of course not.

171
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,860
I don't have friends at nasa.

172
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Bunch of nerds.

173
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,160
You're gonna have to use your tv magic

174
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,860
And fake a space launch for tracy.

175
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,460
Aw,i was gonna go for a run today!

176
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,060
Oh.ha ha.

177
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,060
You missed a call.

178
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,860
Was it my doctor/trainer?

179
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,560
No,it was dennis. Dennis duffy.

180
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Calling me? Why?

181
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,860
Well jenna,dennis has been going around

182
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,060
Calling all the women
he's ever had sex with.

183
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,960
- did you speak to him?
- yes.

184
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,160
- did you pretend to be me?
- i did.

185
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,760
Did you do an impression of me?

186
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,660
- of course.
- was it british?

187
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,260
- it was.
- oh,my god,liz.

188
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,860
First of all,the reason i
have some english inflection

189
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,660
In my speech is because
i lost my virginity

190
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,360
- to the my fair lady
soundtrack. - jenna--

191
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,060
Second,you guys had broken up

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,660
And dennis and i were
in a very emotional place

193
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,760
- because of hurricane katrina.
- jenna,stop.

194
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,060
Yes,what you did was disgusting.

195
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
But how long have we known each other?

196
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,360
15 years.

197
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,060
We met at that car dealership
audition in chicago.

198
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,860
You were trying to be an actress then,

199
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,560
- despite your neck
- right. Yes.

200
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,260
Well we have both seen
this happen too many times.

201
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,560
A strong female friendship
torn apart by some guy.

202
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,260
But that's not what's
gonna happen this time.

203
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,960
Dennis duffy said he didn't want this

204
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,560
To hurt our friendship.

205
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,960
As if someone like him ever could.

206
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,860
Oh,thank you,liz.

207
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,260
I mean,the idea that
that guy is walking around

208
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,860
Thinking he means anything
to me--to either of us--

209
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,760
It's ridiculous.

210
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,060
It's unacceptable.

211
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,360
We shouldn't let him get away with it.

212
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,160
Are you thinking what i'm thinking?

213
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,660
- yeah,let's stab him.
- let's give him a piece of our mind.

214
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,160
Yeah,your thing.

215
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,460
More gifts,mr. Donaghy.

216
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,760
Oh,you got a new tuxedo for your party.

217
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,260
You know i wore nothing
but hand-me-downs

218
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
Until i was 12 years old.

219
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,160
But i thought you were the oldest,sir.

220
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,060
Oldest boy.

221
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
- now look at me.
- i already did.

222
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,560
Wow. That's a lot of loot.

223
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,960
My last birthday,i cleaned up.

224
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,960
Look at this keychain i got.

225
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,860
Every time you move
his head,his head moves!

226
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,560
Look!

227
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,560
Kenneth,i wonder what it's like

228
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,760
Seeing the world through your eyes.

229
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,160
I don't know,mr. Donaghy.

230
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,960
I think i see the world
pretty much the same

231
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,860
As everyone else.

232
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,960
Really?

233
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,760
* 'cause i think you're
very special,kenneth *

234
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,460
Pardon me.

235
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,960
* to be able to get so much joy *

236
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,260
- * from simple things *
- * simple things *

237
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,360
* simple * things.

238
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
But most of us grow up

239
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,860
And lose our sense of wonder.

240
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,960
- oh,that's sad.
- not really. No.

241
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,260
I've surpassed my wildest dreams.

242
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,660
I'm--i'm happier
than i've ever been.

243
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,360
Of course you are.

244
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,460
You've got all these fancy presents

245
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,760
From business associates

246
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,460
And this big empty
house to store them in.

247
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,960
Happy birthday,mr. Donaghy.

248
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,560
Hello,dummy.

249
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,760
Hey.

250
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,760
What's up?

251
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,660
I know about you and jenna,dennis.

252
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,560
Oh.

253
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,460
I--i get why
you're here.

254
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
You want me to rank you.

255
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,260
- apples and oranges,ladies.
- no. Stop. Shut up.

256
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,060
I'm here because i want you to know

257
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,460
That i am not mad at jenna about this.

258
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,260
Well,you can't be mad at me either,liz.

259
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,560
I mean,i went to your apartment
that night looking for you.

260
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,660
To be with you.

261
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,560
Wait a minute,hang on. My apartment?

262
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,860
Okay,i can explain that.

263
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,760
You had gone on that over 30
outward bound trip to arizona.

264
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,860
And you had asked me to housesit.

265
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,160
Well,dennis came over.

266
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,260
And as i mentioned,

267
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,860
We were both pretty torn
up about hurricane katrina.

268
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,160
What those people were
doing to the superdome.

269
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,560
Fine. All right.

270
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,360
You know what,it happened.
What do you want from me?

271
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,560
This is what i want from you.

272
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,060
I want you to understand
exactly how unimportant you are.

273
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,860
You are not the love of my life.

274
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
You are not capable of hurting me.

275
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,860
And you could never do anything
to damage this friendship.

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,060
It was in your bed.

277
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,460
Aw,guys,come on! i eat in there.

278
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,260
No,i'm gonna take the high road.

279
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,260
So good luck with your fake addiction

280
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
And your inconveniently-located
vending machine.

281
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,960
No,not okay,liz.

282
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,460
Not okay.

283
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,960
All right,fine. You know what?

284
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,660
I'm ranking you now.

285
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,260
Hey,blondie. You're number one.

286
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,760
- thank you,dennis.
- i don't care.

287
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,280
You got it.

288
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,360
Ladies and gentlemen,i can't stay long.

289
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm on a case.

290
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,860
The penguin's in town.

291
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,460
But i would like to
introduce my good friend.

292
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,060
The man of the hour.

293
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,660
Jake delahey!

294
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,660
Jake.

295
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,260
This is wrong.

296
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,260
It's all wrong.

297
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,460
Everyone go home now.

298
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
The party's over.

299
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,960
I was told i'd get a meal.

300
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,860
Fine. Why don't you just,uh...

301
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,560
Jack,am i the first one here?

302
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,960
Ugh! i waited. This always happens.

303
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,260
Lemon,what's inside that box?

304
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,660
I don't know. A toy?

305
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,160
Tonight was supposed to be special.

306
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,060
And all i could think
about was that kid.

307
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,460
So happy,he threw up.

308
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,860
The closest i came to vomiting tonight

309
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Was when i saw ann
coulter's shoulder blades.

310
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,560
What happens to us?

311
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,460
We grow up.

312
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,660
I have a good life,

313
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,160
But i'll never be that happy again.

314
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,960
I want that back.

315
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,860
Well,there's nothing
you can do about that.

316
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,160
I disagree.

317
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm going to find out
what was inside that box.

318
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm going to buy it with money.

319
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,360
And it's going to make me happy.

320
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,360
If that doesn't work,

321
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm going to benjamin button myself.

322
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,860
We're not meeting in the middle.

323
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,560
Oh,hey.

324
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,060
I just wanted to get you to approve

325
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
The other astronauts we hired.

326
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,160
Looks good. Where's tracy?

327
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,160
In cape canaveral.

328
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,660
By which i mean through that door.

329
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,960
We told him he had to be
blindfolded before launch

330
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,960
- to prevent space madness.
- sure.

331
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,560
And then we put him on the channel four

332
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,760
Traffic copter for a couple hours.

333
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,860
And now he's landed
here in sunny florida.

334
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,860
- well done,hornberger.
- yeah.

335
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,660
As a child,i dreamed
of being a congressman

336
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,560
Like my father.

337
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,560
Now i do this.

338
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,860
One dui in high school.

339
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,360
At least it's dry heat here in florida.

340
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
Good work astronaut jordan.

341
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,360
Now do 20 space sit-ups.

342
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,360
Computer,when do i get some tang?

343
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,960
Also,i'm thirsty.

344
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,160
Wordplay.

345
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,460
Morning,jenna.

346
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,660
Hey,you.

347
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,860
God,telling dennis off
together was so empowering.

348
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,560
I felt so jacked up on the way home

349
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,960
That i threw a brick through the window

350
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,260
Of a banana republic.

351
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,860
Yeah,it was something.

352
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I can't believe dennis
tried to do that to us.

353
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,960
But he got his,right? Sisterhood.

354
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,260
Sure. Sisterhood!

355
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,060
- oh.
- what?

356
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,660
Nothing.

357
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,760
Ah! Ah!

358
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
Be careful,'cause that thing is open.

359
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,860
I'll go get the
emergency floor marshall.

360
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,960
Floor marshall!

361
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,260
Hey,you called tech support?

362
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,560
I need to see what's inside that box.

363
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,460
If i learned anything from watching 24,

364
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,660
You're gonna want to
zoom in and enhance.

365
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,260
Why don't you ask jimmy what's in there?

366
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,960
It says "from jimmy" on it.

367
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Jimmy flaherty.

368
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,060
Jimmy,what did you get
me for my tenth birthday?

369
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,560
Uh,i thought this was a job interview.

370
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,860
I flew down from boston.

371
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,760
I have to know,jimmy.

372
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,960
I need to know what you
got me that made that happy.

373
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,360
I don't remember,jack.

374
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,960
Doesn't this thing have any sound on it?

375
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,160
You're clearly saying something.

376
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,560
Jonathan,get me a deaf person.

377
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,560
I was told this was a job interview.

378
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,660
Tell me,wendy. What am i saying?

379
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,360
You're saying,

380
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,860
"apollo,apollo,apollo--"

381
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,960
Oh,my god! You puked!

382
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,960
Why wouldn't you warn me?

383
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,760
I'm staring at your mouth!

384
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,560
Apollo.

385
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,260
I know what it is!

386
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,560
Liz lemon.

387
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,360
Hey,sista! How's the leg?

388
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
You are a piece of work.

389
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,960
These crutches are real,everyone.

390
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,460
- liz tried to kill me.
- what are you talking about?

391
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Oh,please,you saw the harness
and you didn't do anything.

392
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,560
T-minus ten minutes.

393
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,960
- be quiet. Tracy's coming.
- all systems are go for launch.

394
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Star wars.

395
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,960
All that stuff about
our friendship was a lie.

396
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,760
You would've let me die,liz!

397
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,560
- over dennis duffy.
- so okay,i did a bad thing.

398
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,460
But you slept with dennis.

399
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,360
And now we're...even?

400
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,460
Even? i can't even look at you.

401
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,460
You know what?

402
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,560
You're no long my plus one
to the canadian grammys.

403
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,460
Two,one,zero.

404
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,860
- lift off,we have a lift off.
- i'm scared

405
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,260
But i'm also excited!

406
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,360
Whoo!I'm lizzing!

407
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,460
Ah ha ha ha! Lizzing!

408
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm lizzing!

409
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,160
Yeah! Ha ha!

410
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,860
Oh,what is that,sir?

411
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,060
This is an apollo
command and lunar module

412
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,060
That i just paid $7,000
for at a vintage toy store

413
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,860
Where a morbidly obese
gentleman called me "pal."

414
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,960
Whoa.

415
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,060
Tracy to earth. Come in,earth!

416
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,260
Mr. Jordan.

417
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,860
How is space?

418
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,560
Great wink,kenneth.

419
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,960
Space is very cold but very beautiful.

420
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,760
And sometimes it sounds like
jenna yelling in the distance.

421
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,760
I think i--
oh,my god.

422
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,260
Where did you get that rocket?

423
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,260
Mr. Donaghy's letting me hold it.

424
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,560
It's awesome.

425
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
You know,i actually envy you two.

426
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,560
Sometimes i wish i could see the world

427
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,160
Through your eyes instead of mine.

428
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Hey,jackie d.

429
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,760
If everyone could see the
world the way i see it,

430
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,460
It would be a better place to live.

431
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,160
I bet that's true,tracy.

432
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,160
But that part of me is gone forever.

433
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,960
I guess i just see the
world the way i see it.

434
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,560
Is he letting me keep this?

435
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,660
I think so.

436
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,460
I wish i was there so
i could play with it.

437
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,760
Hi,miss lemon.

438
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
What do you want?

439
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
I want to make it up to you,jenna.

440
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,060
What can i do?

441
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,360
How about on the next
show you could do that song

442
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,160
That they wouldn't let you
sing at the inauguration?

443
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:14,960
No.

444
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,260
Chocolate rainbow is too good for tgs.

445
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,660
You can tell them.

446
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,460
You can tell the writers.

447
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,460
Tell them what?

448
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
About my commercial.

449
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,560
The one i was in back in chicago. Ugh

450
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,960
Everyone,listen to me.

451
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,760
No,it's a real thing this time.

452
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,560
When we were both living back in chicago

453
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,060
And liz was still
trying to be an actress,

454
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,760
The only job she ever booke

455
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,160
- was for a local phone sex line.
- what?

456
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,160
It was a chat line for urban singles.

457
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:44,960
And they only hired her

458
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,560
Because their first choice was deported.

459
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,860
Okay,we're even.

460
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,760
So you will
not find it--

461
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,560
I found it. It's on youtube.

462
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,660
What?
No--

463
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,560
I have a cable to hook
the computer up to the tv.

464
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,060
Then shut your wet
mouth and get that cable.

465
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,360
- get it!
- come on,guys.

466
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,760
Let's all be cool.
That's not gonna--

467
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,760
Don't wait.

468
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,460
How did you do that so fast?

469
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,660
Hi,i'm bijou.

470
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
- bijou!
- call me.

471
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,460
Oh,my god!

472
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,260
I have since had invisalign.

473
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,860
That is not attractive.

474
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,060
Call us. In english,german,or polish.

475
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,660
That's not even enough numbers.

476
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,460
21 hours a day.

477
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,860
What is this?

478
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
It's a commercial that
liz did back in chicago.

479
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,860
That's liz.

480
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,760
No.

481
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,660
Call us. We love to party.

482
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
I remember that girl.

483
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,860
She cried all day.

484
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,260
