1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,180
Ms.Lemon, here's the research you
wanted for that white house skit.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,020
Oh,okay,thanks.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,230
You know it, lady broseph!

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,100
- What!
- Those are your new interns.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,670
Aren't they a little
old, and over-dressed?

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,830
They're all former investment bankers who
were laid off after that economic crash

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,470
that nancy pelosi caused.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,150
They've had zero real-world
skills, but god, they work hard.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,550
Gentlemen, I need you to run
out and pick up some flowers,

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,430
A collection of bath soaps, and some
spanish-language gossip magazines.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,200
Soap and spanish magazines?

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,790
What,are you expecting a
visit from the,uh-- um--

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,040
- Oh,lemon,don't start unless you've got something.
- Okay.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,420
Elisa's grandmother's coming to visit.

15
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,230
I don't think she likes me.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,760
*******

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,190
*********

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,460
I don't understand it.

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,780
Well,as long as elisa likes you,
that's all that matters,right?

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,310
Oh,no. I need concepcion on board.
She's the matriarch of this family.

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,590
And in puerto rico, elderly women
are held in very high esteem.

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,210
You should go there,lemon.
They'd love you.

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,120
None of this is mine.

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,220
I live in 3-b, this is 13-b.
You know what, i'm gonnsay it.

25
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,030
Women should not deliver the mail.

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,270
Dr. Andrew baird? Do you know this guy?

27
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,400
I don't think so.

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,730
Well,he's a pediatrician,
so you know he likes kids.

29
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,350
Or feet. No,no,kids.

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,220
He has a bill from a divorce
lawyer, so you know he's single.

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,870
And he has a golf magazine,so
you know he's not gay or poor.

32
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,960
Jenna,come on.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,660
Now let's see what
kind of movies he likes.

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,290
What are you doing?
That's a federal offense.

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,240
And you already have two strikes.

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,900
I do not support this!

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,130
Muppets take manhattan.

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,670
Caddyshack.

39
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,470
And a documentary
about how pies are made.

40
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,260
Hello,dr. Baird.

41
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,930
Wasn't that a treat?

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,410
Only the special tours get
to see conan without his wig.

43
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,520
Mi programa esta empezando ahora.

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,440
Oh,i'm sorr but her show's on now.

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,240
Do you think
we could--

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,490
uh,yes,yes.Jonathan,would you
come and help mrs. Padriera?

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,810
I think your grandmother hates me.

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,910
I don't understand.

49
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,050
She's usually a very loving person.

50
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,940
- Is it because i'm white?
- No.

51
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,810
I've had white
boyfriends. Black,cuban...

52
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,880
- Brazilian guys with
german heritage-- - I get it.

53
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,630
You've been with other
men. Congratulations.

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,210
- Thank you.
- What is she watching?

55
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,130
Los amantes clandestinos.

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,800
It's a mexicantelenovela.

57
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,800
But who is that?

58
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,520
That isel generalissimo. He's
the villain of los amantes.

59
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,500
Pa!

60
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,960
The name of the actor is hector moreda.

61
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,680
Dime donde estan los diamantes.

62
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,630
Nunca!

63
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,580
Dime.

64
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,180
He looks exactly like me.

65
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,290
He does look like you.

70
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,580
What's up,brian?

71
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,000
We love you."this honky
grandma be trippin'"

72
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,540
hey,when I quote lines from your
movie, that's not racist,right?

73
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,930
Of course not. I transcend race.

74
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,090
Hey,look,we're all going out after
work, and I know you like to party.

75
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,440
We'd be hore rdoc k if you come with.

76
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,130
You shouldn't end a sentence
with a preposition at.

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,680
But yeah,i'm in.

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,170
We'll start off at
mcmanus-mcminnigan's.

79
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,010
Have you ever drunk a yard of beer?

80
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,260
A yard,like a lawn? Yes,i have.

81
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,490
Tracy jordan!

82
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,280
He has an ice cream maker? Come on!

83
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,610
Don't be weird-looking,
don't be weird-looking.

84
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,340
Ah,girl!

85
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,340
Oh,god!

86
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,520
Dr. Baird,tre's someone at your door.

87
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,350
Oh,thanks,oswald.

88
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,160
Oswald was just helping
me hang some pictures.

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,890
I live in the basement,
so I have all the nails.

90
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm drew. Sorry I smell like
frosting. I just love to bake.

91
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,330
I want to go to there.

92
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,430
So will I see you before saturday?

93
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,330
Jack,about this weekend...

94
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,910
I don't think you should come to my
cousin's police academy graduation,

95
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,060
or my other cousin's parole party.

96
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,510
Boy,i hope those two n' rtoc k eventually have
a showdown that pits family against justice.

97
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,800
Hang on,you mean you
don't want me to come?

98
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,990
It's not me.

99
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,130
Abuelathought it should just be family.

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,660
Is this about the generalissimo?

101
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,550
Jack.

102
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,590
As a child,my grandmother worked in a
silver mine without proper ventilation.

103
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,080
Now her mi is squishy like a hacky sack.

104
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,640
But no matter what,
she's still myabuelita.

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,260
Even though sometimes she comes at me
with a knife because of a silver frenzy.

106
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,200
I'll call you tomorrow,okay?

107
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,450
Okay,good night, querida.

108
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,930
Generalissimo.

109
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,340
Look at dr. Baird. How did
you get a picture of him?

110
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,940
I told him his haircut was exactly what
i've been trying to describe to my barber.

111
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,740
Yeah,smooth,i know. I'm
way out of my league here.

112
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,390
Okay,don't get intimidad.
You know he can't be perfect.

113
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,990
No,he might be.

114
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,840
I got some more of his mail.

115
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,240
And I opened it.

116
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,800
Uh-huh,yeah, i'm the worst.

117
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,830
It just proves that I
don't deserve this guy.

118
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,420
He went to medical school at
columbia, all kinds of charity baloney.

119
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,120
He gets l of the movie
channels, including starz.

120
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,740
And he trains seeing eye dogs at home.

121
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,730
Oh,well, that's no good for
you. You're allergic to dogs.

122
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,780
- I guess i'll have to step in then.
- Shut up. Just let me think!

123
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,400
Please keep your voices down.

124
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,540
Mr. Jordan is a little hung over.

125
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,200
He pulled an uncle
harland parcell last night.

126
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,910
Minus the wistful jug blowing.

127
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,480
I went out with the interns.

128
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,670
Those white boys are not kidding around.

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,540
Have you ever tasted scotch?

130
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,620
It's terrible!

131
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:22,100
And this thing they call "box seats
at the rangers game," it's so cold!

132
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,770
And what is rohypnol?

133
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,660
Tracy,those are roofies!

134
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,010
So I shouldn't have taken
two of them for my headache?

135
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,700
There he is!

136
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,390
Tonight,shooters at blockheads, lay a base, at
meet up with my bro-hams at the cornell club?

137
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,990
Hey,you know it,bri-man! A'ight!

138
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,450
I have no idea what
either one of us just said.

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,610
He thinks you're going out again.
You gotta tell him you can't.

140
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,250
I have a rep to maintain.

141
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,450
If I can't keep up with a
bunch of wall street frat boys--

142
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,250
Uh-oh, here come the roofies.

143
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,580
You can do whatever you want to me.

144
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,190
Uno,dos

145
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,550
- you wanted to see me?
- Lemon,this is elisa.

146
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,680
What? Come on,you're a nurse?

147
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,400
Yeah,some of us are hot.

148
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,040
Lemon,we have a problem... With him.

149
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,840
Boy,that guys looks a lot like you.

150
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,780
Precisely.

151
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,190
Two hours a day, five
days a week, hector moreda

152
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,920
And the generalissimo are poisoning
elisa's grandmother against me.

153
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,050
Oh,he just blew up that kid!

154
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,710
Elisa and I have enough obstacles.

155
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,400
Our work schedules, our cultures,
her adorably broken english.

156
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,500
Metrocards are a real thing,jack.

157
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,520
You use them on the subway.

158
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,480
Anyway,this morning, telemundo, which
is owned by sheinhardt-universal,

159
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,400
- purchasedlos
amantes,uh-- - Clandestinos.

160
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,030
And now,i own it.

161
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,490
Isn't that romantic?

162
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,900
Now,all I have to do is kill off the
generalissimo, and clear a path to elisa'sabuela.

163
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,230
Lemon,the director needs a script by this afternoon,
and elisa here will help you with the spanish.

164
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,700
No,no,no, don't drag me into
this. I have my own problems.

165
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,080
And i've never even watched that show.

166
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,560
All you need to know is thatel
geralissimo is pure evil, look at him.

167
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,220
He stole that girl's love
letters and opened them.

168
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,210
Opened her mail? That is
just shocking. He's a monster.

169
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,730
Or he has a really good reason to do it.

170
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,120
Oh,no, his only reason was to trick
her into giving up her honor to him.

171
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,640
Uh-huh,and how did he use
her mail to do that,exactly?

172
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,260
He read her most intimate secrets, and
turned himself into that which she desired.

173
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,170
What she loved, he pretended to
love too, until it was too late.

174
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,500
My dog ran away!

175
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,560
Oh,my god. Let me get my coat.

176
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,950
- Buster.
- Buster!

177
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,080
- Come here,boy!Buster!
- If see the dog,give us a shout.Thank you.

178
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,050
The funny thing is this
is what I love about him.

179
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,730
Don'worry,liz. We're gonna find him.

180
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,330
If we don't, I don't think I
could ever be around dogs again.

181
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,800
You know, i'm actually on the board of the
pediatric restless leg syndrome association.

182
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,120
Oh,i forgot I even had this on.
I have so many charity t-shirts.

183
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,780
We have so much in common.

184
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,990
Well,buster's probably dead.

185
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,710
Do you want to go to the wine bar around the
corner, deal with these emotions, get some dinner?

186
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,330
Uh,i would love to, liz,i really would.

187
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,610
But,i just got divorced
not that long ago.

188
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,420
I'm really not ready for
this kind of thingust yet.

189
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,370
Plus,i have not given up
on that dog. He's a fighter.

190
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,060
Buster!

191
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,920
Yeah,buster!

192
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,190
Shoot it,dog!

193
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,370
I'm going to! I'm tracy jordan.

194
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,000
Why would I be afraid
of fire next to my mouth?

195
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,290
Drink,drink,drink!

196
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,320
- Is she watching?
- Yes.

197
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,090
I told her it was a
very special episode.

198
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,990
Good-bye,general.

199
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,410
Esto es por mi padre!

200
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,890
Fallaste!

201
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,980
Wait,wait,wait. What did he just
say? That wasn't in the script.

202
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,390
He said "you missed."

203
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,790
Fallaste otra vez!

204
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,320
He said "you missed again."

205
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,130
Y ahora,esta pocion me
dejara vir por siempre!

206
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,310
"and now,this potion's
gonna make me live forever."

207
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,140
What's happening,jack?

208
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,900
El generalissimo was supposed to die!

209
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,390
Morena has gone broken arrow. Jonathan!

210
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,640
We really should have had somebody
on the set who speaks spanish.

211
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,270
I'll call you back.

212
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,180
Moreda.

213
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,080
Moreda!

214
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,730
Welcome,jack.

215
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,430
Cigar,brandy?

216
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,030
What happened,hector?

217
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,470
- The general was supposed to die.
- Ay.

218
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,140
Do n t ry to
out-generalissimo me,my friend.

219
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,390
This role has made me
rich, famous and respected.

220
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,090
I get to cut the line at
disneyland, if I come mid-week.

221
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,420
I have a lucrative endorsement
deal with sabor de soledad!

222
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,850
Ahora con mas semen del toro.

223
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,460
I am not going to let you
ke all that away from me.

224
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,790
I know where you came from,hector.

225
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,250
Play ball,or you'll be back doing r-rated
hypnotism at the bull fights so fast,

226
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,340
you won't know what hit you.

227
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,860
You come over here and
say that to my face.

228
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,090
- No,you come over here.
- Nunca!

229
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,670
If you refuse to be reasonable, I
must call the presidente of telemundo.

230
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,970
La oficina de jack donaghy.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,740
Hola?

232
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,880
Well-played,jack.

233
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,610
I see that we are not
so different,you and i.

234
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,020
- We laugh alike.
- We think ali.

235
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,230
At times,we even drink alike.

236
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,790
You can lose your mind.

237
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,490
Look,you should know, i'm
doing this for a woman.

238
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,790
This woman.

239
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,110
Wow,i am super gay, and I
would totally switch for her.

240
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,810
She's amazing.

241
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,270
But her grandmother hates me, because she
hates the generalissimo, so he's gotta go.

242
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,060
El generalissimo does not have to
die to clear the way to theabuela.

243
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,560
Not if theabuela comes to love him.

244
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,320
But that's impossible.

245
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,590
Seduction ner impossible
forel generalissimo.

246
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,030
I will become everything that
old hispanic women desire.

247
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,300
I will make her love me.

248
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,720
You really think you can pull that off?

249
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
It will be the
performance of a lifetime.

250
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,510
Like julie harris
inthe belle of amherst.

251
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,660
Wow,you are surprisingly gay.

252
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,740
Okay,so?

253
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,330
So did you ever find buster?

254
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,010
What did youerstan that
picture is from a dog food ad.

255
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,050
Hi,lemon. Here's today's script.

256
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,580
I translated it,and took
out thestar warsreferences.

257
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,100
Are you an actress?

258
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,560
No,i'm a nurse.

259
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,820
Oh,good.

260
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,770
Don't listen to anyone who says
you should become an actress.

261
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,330
Okay.

262
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,250
Uh,i also cut the scene between
the general and tia maria.

263
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,620
They cannot be together.

264
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,630
Not after what he did
to maria's daughter.

265
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,800
Why? What did he do?

266
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,820
Oh,it was despicable.

267
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,760
Even worse than his misuse of the mails.

268
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,900
The generalissimo tricked her to the
villa by inviting her to a fancy party.

269
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,930
But when she got there, it
was just the two of them.

270
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,120
He drugged her champagne
and had his way with her.

271
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,860
Later,she gave birth to the
devil. You know,sweeps week.

272
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,510
That's what I could do to drew.

273
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,540
Drug him? Liz,no.

274
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,230
Having been on both sides of that, I
could tell you it's not a good idea.

275
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,130
No,i'm going to tell drew
that i'm having a little

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,370
"wcome to the building" party
for him, but there is no party.

277
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,430
And then,when he shows up, i'll laugh
and say "oh,it's the wrong night."

278
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,280
And then he'll laugh, and say
"oh,well, one glass couldn't hurt."

279
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,780
And then I will put
my mouth on his mouth.

280
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,910
No,lemon, do not do this.

281
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,660
The trickery, the deceit
is a slippery slope.

282
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,810
Yeah,but you haven't seen dr.
Baird. He lks like a cartoon pilot.

283
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,050
Be very careful.

284
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,840
El generalissimo was once a good man.

285
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,040
But the years of
loneliness drove him insane.

286
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,270
I am not the generalissimo, elisa.

287
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,360
Mr. Jordan, I called my clharland,
and I got his hangover cure.

288
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,900
"mix two cups boiled possum meat with
one messload ragweed, stir in alcohol-- "

289
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,770
Ken. These interns are wearing me out.

290
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:01,840
It's like I said in my not-hit comedy cruise
boat, "i'm gettin' too old for this ship."

291
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,590
Well,you are getting older,sir.

292
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,020
There's no reason you have
to keep acting like you're 20.

293
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,760
Yes,there is.

294
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,860
Do you know what happens to a comedian
when he gets old and loses his audience?

295
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,440
He starts to get offered serious roles.

296
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,090
And do you really want to
see me play arthur ashe?

297
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,380
,that would be terrible.

298
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,520
You leave him alone!

299
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,870
Exactly.

300
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,660
So if i'm gonna keep my hilarious
reputation, these interns gotta go!

301
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,120
But where?They don't
know how to do anything,

302
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,910
and there are no jobs
left on wall street.

303
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,610
Then i'll find something for them to do.

304
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,470
Drew.

305
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,930
Oh,uh, am I the first one here?

306
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,230
What?

307
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,510
No,the party's tomorrow night.

308
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,970
Tonight, i'm just hanging out,
eating fondue by candlelight.

309
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,290
Bucome in, I was just opening
a bottle of wine to drink alone.

310
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,490
Okay,i guess one glass couldn't hurt.

311
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,830
- I found your dog!
- What?

312
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,660
He lost his collar, but I
recognize him from the poster.

313
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,400
That's not possible.

314
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,650
Of course it's possible.

315
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,620
How could he not want to come
back to this beautiful lady?

316
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,820
My dog is back!

317
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,190
I'll open the wine.

318
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,020
Just put him down.

319
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,890

Oh,you need more.

331
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,530
Buster,you wang!

332
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,600
Let's get you back in your
special kitchen cabinet.

333
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,420
Man,that dog is giving me a headache.

334
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,890
I have some aspirin in my
white bag there if you need any.

335
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,440
Everything okay in there?

336
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,350
Yeah,it's okay, he's just playing along.

337
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,910
Or he bites me.

338
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,500
Alone at last.

339
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,990
Are you okay?

340
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,420

342
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,950
You did what?

343
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,750
No,no,not me. The pills!

344
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,880
Is this my mail?

345
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,010
Okay,no, you're not thinking clearly.

346
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,120
Why is it all open?

347
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,900
That's not your dog.

348
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,860
I can explain. Just relax.

349
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,630
Help!

350
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,870
I am the generalissimo!

351
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,350
I don't know what that means.

352
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,060
Abuelamade you breaded calf's brains.

353
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,930

made inlos amantes clandestinos.

355
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,280
She's very proud that I am dating
such an important television man.

356
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,040
Oh,well--

357
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,830
What are you going to
do about the nbc news?

358
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,380
It's too sad.

359
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,740
I'll look into it, uh,abuela.

360
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,360

Again,i am so sorry
about everhing--

362
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,350
I actually got some of your mail.

363
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,870
Oh,okay. Hope you didn't open it.

364
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,490

hollywood bowl. Classic.

368
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,790
Also a response to your complaint
about bad grammar in subway ads.

369
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,460
The word "whom" deserves a defender.

370
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm just saying that based on your mail,

371
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,170
I actually would have wanted to
meet this elizabeth lemon in 3-b.

372
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,420
Really?

373
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,220
Do you want to try this again?

374
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,040
I know that I lied to you,
and I accidentally roofied you,

375
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,820
But weirder things have happened,right?

376
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,320
Isn't that tracy jordan?

377

The lehman brothers investment bank will reopen
under the direction of comedian tracy jordan.

378
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,430
I'm doing this so no one
will know i'm getting old.

379
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,940
But you just told us you're old.

380
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,430
This interview is over.

381
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,930
Yeah,i guess weirder
things have happened.

382
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,140
And now to lighten things up, some
pictures of beautiful latin babies,

383
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,050
and the music of tito puente.

384
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,580
Jackthis is ridiculous.

385
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,490
Okay,it's a date.

386
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,180
Okay.
