Len was only able to narrow
my father's identity

Don't push it, Liz.

They could come to you.

174
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:58,831
We could trick them
into coming here,

175

And then we'll sing on the dock!

Based on the jukebox musical?
The songs of Abba?

It's a movie, Jack!

00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,776
Should we just watch it
real quick?

182
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,579
This was too much trouble
when it was just one person.

is your dad,

You walk away.

You get them here.

I'll meet with them.
But that's all I'm promising.

To look into getting a copy

No. You can't get someone
else's birth certificate.

301
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,173
I know, because I've been

Because sometimes

And maybe daddy just needs
to get in the car and drive.

to know karate.

That's gotta be bogus.

00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:30,705
How 'bout you, Milton?

316
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,573
No, no, the Greenes
are sharp as a tack,

317
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,108
Right to the end.

318
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:36,243
Which makes the end
all that much more terrifying.

319
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,878
My father died screaming.

320
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:41,114
oh. Greene--
that's sort of a vague name.

321
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:46,020
You meet a lot of other Greenes
at your...Church?

322
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:47,187
Christmas?

323
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:48,956
We're agnostic
secular humanists.

324
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,357
Sure, but if you
had to pick...

325
00:12:50,426 --> 00:12:52,526
Is that you and Tom Delay?

326
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:55,196
Uh, yes.
"The Hammer" is a hero of mine.

327
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:56,764
- [snorts]
- I-I'm sorry.

328
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,599
Did you just snort at our former
house majority leader?

329
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,700
He was never my house
majority leader.

330
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:03,235
You've got to be
kidding me.

331
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:06,272
Here's Tom Delay's legacy
to the United States:

332
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:09,307
Raping the environment,
waging an illegal war--

333
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:12,111
History will validate
the liberation of Iraq.

334
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,713
I was talking about
the war on drugs.

335
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,817
Not to mention the hypocrisy
of espousing family values

336
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,951
While demonizing single mothers.

337
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,653
What would you know
about single mothers?

338
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:23,155
What would you know
about families?

339
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,357
I will not be spoken to
this way.

340
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,493
I'm a contest winner.

341
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,261
And a professor
at Bennington College.

342
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,564
[laughing]
Oh...Bennington!

343
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:32,965
How's that going,
teaching all those kids

344
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:34,400
That couldn't
get into Middlebury?

345
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,934
- How dare you!
- How dare you.

346
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,768
You are a huge
disappointment to me.

347
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:40,604
I do not understand why
we're yelling at each other,

348
00:13:40,672 --> 00:13:42,972
But I am not accustomed
to losing an argument.

349
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,908
So you know what?
Screw you.

350
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:48,376
And your <i>fakakte</i> contest.

351
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:49,505
[door slams]

352
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,969
Oh God no!

353
00:13:51,478 --> 00:13:51,986
{ Advertisement }

354
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,470
Looking beautiful.

355
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,704
Uh...I'm gonna
get some tape.

356
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,873
Oh, my God, Liz.

357
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,242
I'm so glad that
you've insisted on doing this.

358
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,479
Yay! Well, thank you
for so graciously including me.

359
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,114
I know this kind of thing is
all that you have in your life.

360
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,415
Aw!

361
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,651
Wait--what is that?

362
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,019
Bellafonte,
what is that stuff?

363
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,588
I just thought
that for some of the pictures,

364
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,790
It'd be fun
if we got a little wacky.

365
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,091
[giggles]
Okay, look.

366
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,859
I know you've never
done this before,

367
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,996
But I had to learn the hard
way--don't use the props.

368
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:26,363
They always try to get you
to take one funny photo.

369
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,932
That's always the one they use,
and you look like an idiot.

370
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:30,799
That's always
the one they use, huh?

371
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:31,800
Don't do it.

372
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:33,268
Just open your mouth a little

373
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:35,004
And try to look like
Lindsay Lohan.

374
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,638
Great.
Fabulous, ladies.

375
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:38,006
You look beautiful.

376
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:40,608
Now, Jenna, catch the chicken.

377
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:42,378
Nice try, pal.

378
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,480
Not my first time
on the merry-go-round, chief.

379
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,648
Not gonna do it.

380
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,149
Staying like this--
serious and horny.

381
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:48,384
I don't know.

382
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:52,219
With the chicken,
it could make a great cover.

383
00:14:52,286 --> 00:14:54,755
I'll hold the chicken.

384
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:58,893
[laughing] Great.
That's great.

385
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,294
That's so great.

386
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:02,563
Now act like
the chicken farted.

387
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,965
Yes, yes.
You're the funny one.

388
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:08,403
Great!
That's so great.

389
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:12,839
I am Lutz.

390
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,508
I understand you study
the art of the empty hand.

391
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:19,146
I challenge you to <i>kumite!</i>

392
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:21,213
Hah! Whhhh! Eeee! Whooo.

00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,084

Front kick!

394
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,986
Uh, uh, escape kata!

395
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,688
Ow!

396
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:31,855
Pete, Liz, I see you!

397
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:32,890
Help mommy's baby!

398
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:36,095
[sobbing]
help mommy's baby!

399
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:39,397
Jack, what did you
say to Milton?

400
00:15:39,465 --> 00:15:42,001
If Cornel West weren't speaking
at the new school tonight,

401
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,336
I think he would have left.

402
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:44,971
He should leave.

403
00:15:45,038 --> 00:15:46,306
It's exactly what
I was afraid of.

404
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:47,941
More family,
more aggravation.

405
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:50,509
- I'm walking away.
- Why? He's just like you.

406
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:52,311
He's smart and worldly,

407
00:15:52,378 --> 00:15:55,179
And he's really good
at making fun of my shoes.

408
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,848
When he saw these,

409
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,950
He asked me when my cult
was committing suicide.

410
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:00,250
Okay, that's pretty good.

411
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:02,019
But Milton Greene and I
are nothing alike.

412
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,754
I have one scotch
with the guy,

413
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:06,290
And it devolves into a screaming
match about tom Delay.

414
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:08,626
So you have a couple drinks,
fight about politics,

415
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:11,195
And then you take it personally
when he doesn't agree with you?

416
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,563
That's called
having a dad, Jack.

417
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:14,699
Don't walk away.

418
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,199
I think you'll regret it
if you do.

419
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,569
Or I could regret
telling him.

420
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,471
Why would a man like that
want <i>me</i> as a son?

421
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,105
Maybe he won't.
I don't know.

422
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:24,273
But so what?

423
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,642
Yeah, it'd hurt,

424
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,611
But then you'd just go back
to being Jack Donaghy,

425
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,811
Which is pretty cool.

426
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,780
Thank you.
My hair just dries like this.

427
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:35,751
Exactly. Or you tell him,
and he starts crying

428
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,988
And you hug,
and then you have a dad.

429
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:39,588
Which is pretty cool too.

430
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:40,922
- Maybe you're right.
- I am right.

431
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:42,959
Either way,
you're gonna be okay.

432
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,264
One of those two things
is gonna happen.

433
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,998
There's no weird third thing.

434
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:49,998
Thank you, Liz.

435
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:52,200
By the way,
did the medical supply store

436
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,504
Where you bought those shoes
have any...Women's stuff?

437
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:58,508
[chuckles]

438
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:05,280
Well, Donald obviously
knows karate.

439
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,248
We still don't know how old
any African-Americans are.

440
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,151
Oh, that reminds me.

441
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,488
I got the birth certificate
that you asked for.

442
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,689
You did? How?

443
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,290
The guy at the place
just gave it to me.

444
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,361
You will get old someday.

445
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,496
[gasps]

446
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:23,163
Tracy, stop writing
that check.

447
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:25,833
He's 40.
Don't sign that.

448
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,837
Okay. That was to put
in Dotcom's birthday card.

449
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:33,473
But you're right...
The card is enough.

450
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:37,310
Tracy...
Donald is older than you are.

451
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:40,179
He's scamming you!

452
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,348
I know.

453
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,883
I'm sorry, what?

454
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,585
Liz Lemon,
I may hug people too hard

455
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:48,688
And get lost at malls...
But I'm not an idiot.

456
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:50,357
Then why are you giving him
all this money?

457
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:51,358
When Donald came to me,

458
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:53,026
He was a fast-talking charmer

459
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:54,727
From the wrong side
of the track.

460
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:56,297
He reminded me of someone,
Liz Lemon--

461
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:59,533
John Travolta's character
from <i>Grease!</i>

462
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:00,800
And me.

463
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:03,336
So giving Donald money
is what--charity?

464
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:04,871
Call it what you want.

465
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,075
But in the last three years,

466
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,108
Donald has gone
from scamming celebrities

467
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:11,143
To being a small business
owner.

468
00:18:11,211 --> 00:18:13,046
The dojo is real?

469
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:15,215
And the community center
is thriving.

470
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:17,682
You know Kenneth's $80
bought a chess set

471
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,251
<i>And</i> a crate of condoms?

472
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,220
Those kids are really lucky.

473
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:22,255
[knocking]

00:18:22,322 --> 00:18:23,856
Hey.

475
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:27,226
Daddy, do you wanna
go uptown and see the dojo?

476
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:30,396
Or should I say the Tracy Jordan
institute for black karate?

477
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:31,729
[whimpers]

478
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:34,567
That's what y'all namin' it?

479
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,238
Thank you, son.

480
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:41,907
Thank you.

481
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:51,384
Well, I hope you're
happy with your cover.

482
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:52,617
Oh, boy.

483
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,819
They went with birthing
the chicken on the toilet.

484
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:56,722
Why didn't you
listen to me?

485
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,056
Because I thought
you were just trying

486
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,625
to keep me from being
in the magazine.

487
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:01,795
I was just trying to keep you
from embarrassing both of us.

488
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:04,129
Well, you wanted attention.
You got it.

489
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:07,098
I hope you're happy.

490
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,103
I'm on the cover!

491
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:14,138
And this is
the backstage area.

492
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,440
Kenneth, I'd like to speak
with Mr. Greene for a moment.

493
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:19,409
And as head of this tour,
I'm going to deny your request.

494
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:21,545
Uh, Milton...

495
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:24,313
Do you remember a woman
named Colleen Donaghy?

496
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:26,415
Sure.

497
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:28,616
[laughs] That takes me
back a few years.

498
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:32,354
- 1958?
- Yeah, right.

499
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,991
She rented me a room
when I was a graduate student.

500
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:37,659
One month I couldn't pay,

501
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:41,896
So she said maybe there was
something else I could give her.

502
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,499
- So I gave her my radio.
- [softly] Oh.

503
00:19:44,566 --> 00:19:47,735
And a couple of weeks later,
we got drunk and had sex.

504
00:19:47,803 --> 00:19:49,237
Uh...Okay.

505
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:53,007
I'm Jack Donaghy,
colleen's son.

506
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:55,743
I was born around
nine months after that.

507
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,278
Oh, my God.
Wha--wait a minute.

508
00:19:57,345 --> 00:20:00,349
I-is this contest
some <i>Mamma Mia</i> thing?

509
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,152
Milton...

510
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:07,021
I'm your son.

511
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,961
Oh...Of course you are.

512
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:16,432
I should have known
the minute I saw you.

513
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,333
I have a son!

514
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:20,168
A beautiful son!

515
00:20:20,236 --> 00:20:21,803
And I have a dad!

516
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:23,638
Fate has brought us
together, Jack.

517
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:26,608
You opened a whole new
chapter in my life!

518
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,443
Yeah. Isn't it amazing?

519
00:20:28,512 --> 00:20:30,479
Oh, you don't know
the half of it!

520
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:33,549
I need a kidney!

521
00:20:33,617 --> 00:20:35,852
[laughing]
Oh, God!

522
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,684
This is so great!
[laughing]
