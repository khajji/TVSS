1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,120
Thanks for coming out.
Thanks for watching.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,670
Love,peace, and hair grease.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,970
Hey,liz me,lutz,toofer,and josh are gonna go to
that bar where the waiters are dressed like ninjas.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,920
You in?

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,070
No,I'm just gonna go to the
24-hour donut place and go home.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,380
All right.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,640
Donuts and then bed.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,960
What are you depressed
about or celebrating?

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,080
It's this endless adoption
process.It took me three months--

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,410
liz. I am totally humiliated.

11
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,390
How could you cut diaper chicken?

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,660
Wait,i know. Because tracy's the star.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,470
Oh,brother, she's feeling neglected.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,390
How's she gonna act out th te?

15
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,040
My ankle!

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,100
Oh,imaginary injury.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,140
I would have said
death of a voice coach.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,320
Her birthday's on tuesday.

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,570
Maybe all that attention will
make her ankle feel better.

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,080
Hey,jack! What are you still doing here?

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,460
It's friday night. I
need something to do.

22
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:00,060
Don't you have some gallery opening or a
fundraiser to give bowties to inner city youths?

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,760
Of course. But I'm committed to elisa.

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,870
While she's away I'm
trying to avoid temptation.

25
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,430
I just need somewhere I can
socialize where women aren't an issue.

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,360
Finally!

27
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,790
Hey,now.

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,400
Excuse me?

32
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,770
Can we get a little
service over here-- okay.

33
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,440
Dude,i know you're getting these messages
because I know how to check your voicemail.

34
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,590
You are officially a d-bag,tim.

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,500
I hope you lose your indoo

36
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,590
sorry,what n I get you?

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,750
A dozen assorted for me
to take home to my family.

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,500
And the lady will have...

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,950
A dozen assorted.

40
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,500
Adoption brochure.

41
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,100
Should you be working the
night shift alone like this?

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,890
It's fine. They gave me a gun.

43
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,820
That's $6.80

44
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,870
I will have mine to stay, please.

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,370
You want a dozen donuts to stay?

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,600
And a skim milk.

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,400
- What are you doing,liz?
- Making a new friend.

48
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,750
I don't like this. You have crazy eyes.

49
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,690
You have shut-up mouth.

50
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,110
- I don't want any part of this.
- Enet out of here.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,920
Boy,that creative thing you guys do, writing
jokes for a living, making the world laugh.

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,980
What do your dads tell
their friends you do?

53
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,270
Surgeon.

54
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,440
Optometrist.

55
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,950
Died.

56
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,820
I never really knew my dad. So I
just lie to myself. Space assassin.

57
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,900
I grew up without a father too,frank.

58
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,730
Good ol' billy donaghy
left when I was two.

59
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,800
He'd show up every now and then to impregnate
my mom, punch out umpires in my little league.

60
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,060
Last time I saw my dad, he went out to get
the candles for my fourth-birthday lasagna

61
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,570
and never came back.

62
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,660
My whole life I said I
was gonna be something.

63
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,850
Restore the glory of the rossitano name.

64
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,560
In sicilian dialect, it
means "well poisoner."

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,420
In gaelic,donaghy means "dung basket."

66
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,640
So I worked my ass off at
s.u.n.y. Got into fordham law.

67
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,890
No. You went to law school?

68
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,520
Yeah. But I had to drop out after
a semester 'cause my mom got sick.

69
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,560
Mothers.

70
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,690
So what are we doing next,fellas? Don't
tell me we're calling it a night already.

71
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,820
How lame do you think
the night is young.

72
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,600
We're going to lutz's to watch movies.

73
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,850
Tonight,a classic.

74
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,100
Harry and the hendersons. You in,jack?

75
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,900
Uh,yes,but I don't wanna
go to lutz's apartment.

76
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,850
His contract is up and I
don't wanna feel sorry for him.

77
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,490
What do you say we go to my place?

78
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,910
- I cado it.
- Sounds good.

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,200
And when I told tim I was pregnant, he just
freaked out and didn't call me for a week.

80
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,390
Then he texted me and he
was like, "oh,i love you.

81
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,300
No,I'm mad at you. You did
this on purpose." As if.

82
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,780
Meanwhile,his myface page horny."

83
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,280
And I'm,like, if you ce out me at all, at
least have the decency to skype me face to face.

84
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:08,080
Man,there are just so many different
devices for guys to not call you on now.

85
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,700
When I was your age,
you could just be like,

86
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,550
"oh,he probably tried to
call me but my line was busy."

87
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,370
And then just watchfalcon
crest and cry yourself to slee

88
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,900
thanks for listening to me blab.

89
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,870
So what's your plan when the baby comes?

90
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,650
I don't know.

91
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,200
I've been talking to an adoption lady, but I just
don't feel comfortable with any of the people.

92
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,940
They all just seem really old and wei.

93
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,480
Not one of them even knew who neo is.

94
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,660
* I need you *

95
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,280
finally,thank you.
Somebody cool for once.

96
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,420
Geouof here!

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,250
Can't you see we don't want you anymore?

98
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,040
Why can't you go back
where you came from?

99
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,440
And leave us alone!

100
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,890
Go.

101
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,730
Go!

102
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,750
Good-bye,my friend.

103
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,090
He had to be mean to save him.

104
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,520
Hay belonged in the woods.

105
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,070
It gets me every time.

106
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,630
This reminds me of my favorite movie.

107
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,400
Shane.

108
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,830
Aww,when joey wants to go with
shane and shane makes him stay?

109
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,440
Maybe it's because we
didn't have fathers.

110
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,950
Maybe at why we're drawn to
movies where the father-figure

111
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,790
pushes away the child/legendary
north-american forest ape.

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,980
Yeah,but in the movies,
it's a good thing.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,150
Harry went back to the woods.

114
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,770
It works out in real life too.

115
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,540
We're both doing all right.

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,260
Yeah.

117
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,100
Excuse me,Mr. Jordan.

118
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,310
I was just updating my staff birthday
list and I discovered I don't have yours.

119
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,090
That's because I don't
have a birthday,ken.

120
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,730
What?

121
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,450
I don't have a birth certificate 'cause
I was born inside of yankee stadium.

122
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,450
I bound around foster families so much,
no one ever bothered to throw me a party.

123
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,150
Oh,but even prisoners
have birthday parties.

124
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,790
I saw one onoz.

125
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,860
It was... Interesting.

126
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,250
I don't need a birthday.

127
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,860
'Cause I buy myself
all the presents I need.

128
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,510
And because of my drinking,
they're often a surprise.

129
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,820
Oh,but birthdays aren't about presents.

130
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,150
They're about being surrounded
by people who love you

131
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,030
And eating a cake with your
name on it and making a wish.

132
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,540
I'm sad you never had that.

133
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,980
My birthday's september
21st, not that anyone asked.

134
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,510
Hi,frank.

135
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,440
Oh,hey,jack.

136
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,350
This morning it hit me in the shower why
the hendersons named their guest harry.

137
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,320
Yeah.

138
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,580
That film has layers.

139
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,710
I was also thinking about what you told
me about your family and law school.

140
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,620
Yeah,sorry. I was drunk. I
shouldn't have told you that stuff.

141
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,090
No,no,no. I'm glad you did.
We have a lot in common.

142
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,300
We both have recurring dreams about
being overpowered by a female bodybuilder.

143
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,780
Okay,we were both drunk.

144
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,390
But I wanna help you.

145
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,720
So I made some phone calls and if you want,
you can resume your law studies at columbia,

146
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,730
This semester,full schorsp,
no strings attached.

147
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,300
Are you serious?

148
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,090
Make your mother proud, frank.

149
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,380
Make your father hate any
new children he might have.

150
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,000
But... I've got a whole other life now.

151
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,940
I guess.

152
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,110
But we both know you shouldn't
be wki at a desk with...

153
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,740
Fake vomit on it.

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,400
Right. Fake.

155
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,940
Excuse me.

156
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,110
Oh,god,please don't be a
daughter I didn't know about.

157
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,860
Becca!

158
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,680
Congratulations.

159
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,250
What is she doing here?

160
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,910
She is the show's new youth consultant.

161
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,100
It's a thing. The cw has them.

162
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,530
Oh,my god.

163
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,370
I can't believe you're
in charge of all of this.

164
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,430
It is challenging and satisfying
but it can't fulfill all of me.

165
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,440
I've got so much more to give.

166
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,080
Welcome.

167
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,870
Um,so do you want me to
start youth consulting now?

168
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,050
Because kids would not be into that.

169
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
Oh,lutz? Yeah,that guy's the worst.

170
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,460
Kenneth,this is the dress i'll
be wearing to my birthday party.

171
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,830
Please maksure no one else
plans to wear the same thing.

172
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,930
Yes,ma'am.

173
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,340
Did you know Mr. Jordan has
never had a birthday party?

174
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,940
He was too poor growing up.

175
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,310
Oh,that's horrible.

176
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,850
My heart goes out to
all the inner city kids.

177
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,290
Especially those too fat
to dance their way out.

178
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,560
I'm glad you feel that way, 'cause
we have ts g party planned for you.

179
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,280
I know.

180
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,980
Oc and we thought you could
share it with Mr. Jordan.

181
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,420
The party, the attention,everything.

182
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,300
Isn't that a great idea?

183
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,260
That's so great.

184
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,320
I can't believe tim hasn't called.

185
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,970
I guess I don't even
care about us anymore.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,140
But this is his baby.

187
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,220
I mean,him not even being there
for the kid is totally washed.

188
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,380
Typical tim.

189
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,390
Anyway. I guess I have two choices.

190
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,030
Go back home, try to get back
with tim and keep the baby,

191
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,810
Or give up the baby
and focus on my music.

192
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,890
So,tim,keep baby.

193
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,560
Music,give up baby.

194
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,370
Can I play you one of my songs?

195
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,270
* Now we are joined in
a cobweb of rainbows *

196
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,780
stop.Stop right there. Tears.

197
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,240
The world needs to hear your music.

198
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,300
You have crossed a line, liz lemon.

199
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,090
Becca's never gonna
make it with those songs.

200
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,650
Says who? Being terrible has never
prevented success in the music business.

201
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,630
Look at biz markie or the doors.

202
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,460
Look,before we were happily married with
five kids, paula and I were tim and becca.

203
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,420
30an she is confused
and he is terrified.

204
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,820
- He ran away,pete.
- So did i.

205
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,930
Five times. But I came back.

206
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,850
And when my caveman brain saw those babies
with their little hornberger foreheads,

207
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,910
it clicked.

208
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,510
You gotta give tim and
becca the same chance.

209
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,720
Hey,what are you doing?

210
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,050
My pregnant teen message board says the
baby gets all its food from the mother,

211
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,180
So you have to give it stuff it likes.

212
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,260
No,the baby can't taste anythi
it just gets nutrients from you.

213
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,180
I'm gonna post a reply to juno32
and tell her she's a giant asswipe.

214
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,420
I can't believe you don't have kids.

215
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,200
What's that?

216
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,490
Well,you'd make such a great mom.

217
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,010
You're smart,succesul, grounded.

218
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,030
Aw,go on.

219
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,870
- You already dress like a mom.
- And stop.

220
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,730
It's not the right time
for me to have a family.

221
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,740
But is that something you'd want?

222
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,300
Yeah,becca. It is.

223
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,550
- Will you sing with
me,liz? - Oh,i'd ra--

224
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,860
* mothers and fathers hm
and jugglers and judges *

225
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,310
* now we are joined in
a cobweb of rainbows *

226
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,380
he's coming! The plan is
working! I bit my tongue!

227
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,190
Surprise

228
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,230
Oh,what a schmo, entering first.

229
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,260
Now I'm the headliner and
he's just the warm-up act.

230
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,020
I'm Mr. Don rickles and he's just me.

231
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,530
But I don't have a birthday!

232
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,510
You do now 'cause we all love
you and wanted you to feel isoy.

233
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,390
I do feel it.

234
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,030
You're all so amazing.

235
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,090
And to think I was just calling
y'all a bunch of racists.

236
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,400
Stop. Jenna time.

237
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,560
- Friends.
- Frank?

238
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,990
I am leaving tgs for columbia
law school to pursue my dream

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,740
of becoming a lawyer.

240
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,800
Did you know that if you sing happy
birthday on a tv show you have to pay for it?

241
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,060
I did not know that.

242
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,860
my dad got us all seats for opening
day at the new yankee stadium!

243
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,940
Cerie,cerie,cerie, cerie,cerie!

244
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,360
No one ask me about my back brace.

245
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,500
Make a wish,Mr. Jordan.

246
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,800
Blow out the candles.

247
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,360
Cerie,frank,and tracy!
Cerie,frank,and tracy!

248
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,960
No one ask me about my back brace!

249
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,400
- Hey,jack.
- Frank.

250
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,100
Is that you?

251
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,750
I decided to take you up on your offer.

252
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,060
Good man,and you went to my tailor.

253
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,850
That's the same cut reagan
wore the day he got shot.

254
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,120
My mom is going nuts.

255
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,500
She's insisting you come over
and let her cook you dinner.

256
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,600
Home cooked italian? I'm there.

257
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,700
Now let me hear you say the seven most
important words in the american judicial system.

258
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,510
My client has no memory of that.

259
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,500
I also would have accepted, "you can't
prove that's the governor's semen."

260
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,680
- Okay.
- Yes!

261
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,430
What's the matter, Mr. Jordan?

262
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,000
I know you only make cheese friends
when something's bothering you.

263
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,760
You were right,ken.
Birthdays are special.

264
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,880
And now mine's over. And who knows
when february 24th will come again?

265
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,590
Now that warm, happy feeling is
gone, there's no cake in my mouth,

266
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,820
and that birthday wish is malarkey.

267
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,980
Malarkey!

268
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,530
Come on,daniel.

269
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,610
I am so proud of you. A lawyer.

270
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,430
Someday you'll have and on the
subway in english and spanish.

271
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,400
Yeah.

272
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,930
And this man.

273
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,880
What you have done for my boy.

274
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,470
Frankie,go open up some more wine.

275
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,490
You got it,mom.

276
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,680
What do you think
you're doing to my boy?

277
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,090
I'm trying to help him.

278
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,490
I see myself in frank.

279
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,330
I mean,we both have
fathers that abandoned us.

280
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,100
What do you know about his father?

281
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,500
You want frank to be a lawyer
so he won't be like his father?

282
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,950
His father was a lawyer!

283
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,470
And his father's father.

284
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,060
All the rossitano men are lawyers.

285
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,690
It's in their blood to be lawyers!

286
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,910
- Then what's
the-- - for the mob!

287
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,660
What?

288
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,400
Frankie's father didn't abandon him.

289
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,600
He's in hiding in phoenix.

290
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,170
Every rossitano man is either
in hiding or six feet under.

291
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,630
You want me to paint you a picture?

292
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,870
'Cause I did!

293
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,600
It's part of a
therapy-through-painting thing.

294
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,700
I had no idea.

295
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,520
Well,you shoulda guessed.

296
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,770
I don't think I should have.

297
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,430
Whatever.

298
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,590
I am not gonna take my
kid's dream away from him.

299
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,700
You made this mess, you
clean it up. I don't care how.

300
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,780
But francis rossitano
cannot become a lawyer.

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,330
Yeah,hold on a second.
Liz. Do you know a tim?

302
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,250
What? Why?

303
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,670
Security says that there's
a tim baker downstairs.

304
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,260
Here? Heame here? That's
becca's ex-boyfriend.

305
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,260
Tell them to send him to 15.

306
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,220
He's coming to steal my baby.

307
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,530
- Don't even ask about the wheelchair.
- Okay.

308
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,700
Also, my old vocal coach died!

309
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,130
Come on,come on, come on,come on.

310
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,560
Lemon,are you okay?

311
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,490
That pregnant girl, she was
going to give me her baby.

312
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,050
But now that dad is here, he's g

313
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,110
what are you about to do?

314
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,620
I'm the one who's been there
for becca for almost two days.

315
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,310
This tim guy is totally washed!

316
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,630
Lemon,there was once a great
american named george henderson.

317
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,680
He met a woodland ape, or sasquatch, and despite its
dangerous message of environmentalism, became his friend.

318
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,110
When the time came to do the hard thing and
send it back into the forest Where it belonged

319
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,910
and birds could perch on its
shoulder because it was gentle,

320
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,300
George henderson summoned the
strength and by god,he did it.

321
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,220
Did it hurt? You bet
it hurt. Like a bastard.

322
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,580
But he did it because it
was the right thing to do...

323
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,360
For the woodland ape.

324
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,250
You think about that.

325
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,070
What?

326
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,460
Is that harry and the hendersons?

327
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,530
You've seen it?

328
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,830
This is my life,jack.

329
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,110
Oh,my! Miss maroney, are you okay?

330
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,930
Well,i think i'll be okay
in time for tomorrow's show.

331
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,210
But then I have to go in forore tests.

332
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,870
I'm so brave.

333
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,280
Oh,i wish you felt better so
you could help us figure out

334
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,010
what Mr. Jordan's
birthday wish coulda been.

335
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,240
What? Why?

336
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,260
So we can make it come true and
his birthday can go on and on.

337
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,450
We've narrowed it down to wn a robocop,

338
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,370
"hunt that elephant that
paints, or breakfast in bed."

339
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,840
But it wasn't his birthday.
It was my birthday.

340
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,250
Oh,forget it.

341
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,110
I'm tired of making you
people try to care for me.

342
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,270
You don't care for me,
clearly. Nobody does.

343
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,440
- My birthday wish came true!
- What?

344
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,080
I wished for you to get better.

345
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,200
I was gonna wish for breakfast in bed
with robocop while a elephant paints us.

346
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,210
We were close.

347
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,700
But then I saw you with that back brace
on right before I blew out my candles.

348
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,410
It's a birthday miracle!

349
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,890
Tracy, that's the kindest
thing anyone's ever done for me.

350
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,500
Now let's make miss maroney's
birthday wish come true.

351
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,880
Oh,that's so sweet.

352
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,070
But who would I celebrate with
if y'all were in a car accident?

353
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,390
Are you tim? Becca's tim?

354
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,640
I'm her friend,jenna. And
she does not wanna see you.

355
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,340
She's very mad and
she wants you to leave.

356
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,500
Okay. That's,uh...
That's for the best. Yeah.

357
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,600
Excuse me. What floor
is the sci-fi channel on?

358
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,520
Fine,lithgow. I'll do
the right thing. God!

359
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,690
I guess someone's been watching
the world according to garp.

360
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,280
Damn it,tim,wait. Becca
does wanna see you.

361
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,040
She wants more than anything,okay?

362
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,160
No,when you said she didn't wanna
see me, it was such a relief.

363
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,000
This baby thing is freaking me out.

364
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,940
You know how many people want
what just got dropped in your lap?

365
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,430
"oh,now's not a good time.
I wanna go to burning man."

366
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,620
Shut up,tim! Do you love becca?

367
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,820
She's,like,my soul mate.

368
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,660
- I mean,in another life--
- you're not listening,dummy!

369
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,050
Nut up right now, get a
job, and help raise that kid.

370
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,180
Love it because it has your
goony face and get married

371
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,650
And have disposable cameras at the wedding
because it's fun and people like it.

372
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,310
Where are we going? I
already cleaned out my office.

373
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,760
You've gotta go back where you belong.

374
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,900
You've gotta go.

375
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,490
No,I'm gonna be a lawyer.
I'm going to be like you.

376
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,550
Get outta here! Go to the writer's
room! There is no scholarship!

377
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,570
Can't you see we don't want you anymore?

378
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,270
Think about it,tim.

379
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,550
Do you really want your kid
to grow up without a father?

380
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,750
Jack,i don't understand.

381
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,040
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

382
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,860
Leave me alone!

383
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,170
Good-bye,my friend.

384
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,650
Those two,they both
grew up without fathers.

385
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,750
Hey,baby.

386
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,490
My god. Look at your boobs.

387
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,230
Kiss or something. Go on.

388
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,400
* Rainbows and the cobwebs and
the cobwebs of the rainbows *

389
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,480
and stop.

390
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,300
I guess,in a way, we
both lost children today.

391
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,920
Yeah,but mine was real,
jack. Yours was frank.

392
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,040
Don't worry,lemon.

393
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,580
I'm confident that someday
you'll have everything you want.

394
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,390
Can someone please tell me
how to g out of this building?

395
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,230
It-- it's
like a maze!

396
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,330
I keep walking past
the same... Sbarro's!

397
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,310
Yeah.

398
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,540
I'm a celebrity! Please!

399
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,560
Sad.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
