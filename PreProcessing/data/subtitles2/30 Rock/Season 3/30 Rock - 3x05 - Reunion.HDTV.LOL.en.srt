00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,800
miss lemon, You have several messages.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,700
Let's see, that company running
the bike tour In south carolina says,

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,000
- "no singles."
- Okay.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
your credit card called.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
They wanna make sure you're
the one Buying cream soda in bulk.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,600
I sure am.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,100
And your landlord called.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,100
And he said it is not the toilet, it's you.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,300
That's his opinion.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
and jean From your high school
reunion committee called.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
They want to know
if you're coming this weekend.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No. No way.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Oh, you have to go.

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,900
My high school reunion was so much fun.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey there, michael.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Oh, my god, phil barror.

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,600
Hello, teniqua.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,900
You gotta go to your reunion.

19
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,800
You get to get back at everybody
Who ever messed with you.

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,000
You said i'd never amount to anything!

21
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,400
Look at me now!

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,900
Look at this necklace!

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,700
Sir, this is a school for deaf girls.

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,300
<i>And i definitely would
have gone to my reunion.</i>

25
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,400
But the boat i was educated on sank.

26
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,900
Well, i wouldn't have fun,
so i'm not going.

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Kathy...

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,600
over here.

29
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,600
<i>Kathy.</i>

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,300
<i>We shouldn't have to
go through this, sir.</i>

31
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,000
You are doing the job of the ceo.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,100
It should be you On the cover
of the quarterly report.

33
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,100
It will be.

34
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,100
If kathy's father ever
comes out of his coma.

35
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,900
Until then, the board has put her
in charge, And we need to respect that.

36
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,300
What if something happened to her?

37
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,700
Something bad!

38
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,800
Then we would have a secret
that bound us together.

39
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,700
What is she doing?

40
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,300
I don't know.

41
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,100
<i>Either a weather event is approaching,</i>

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Or...

43
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,000
Get me jack donaghy.

<i>How come there ain't no
puerto ricans on star trek?!</i>

48
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,700
They got every race
and life-Form in the galaxy,

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,100
Except for puerto ricans.

50
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,300
What's up with that?

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,800
What is this, the local?

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,300
<i>He woke up!</i>

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Geiss woke up.

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
What?!

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,100
??Yes!

56
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,500
What's that flavor?

57
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,900
It's dove age-Fighting acne cream.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,900
Geiss is awake?

59
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,200
- You're gonna be ceo.
- Yes!

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,400
I was the first person he called.

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,300
Well, his french-Canadian
mistress, and then me.

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm meeting him in one hour
on the edison terrace.

63
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
<i>I did it, lemon.</i>

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
I got the brass ring.

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,100
And i couldn't have done it without...

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,300
my lucky coin.

67
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,300
Well... I'm happy for you.

68
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
You're having your reunion
this weekend?

69
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,100
I wish i had a princeton
reunion right now.

70
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,800
Wipe that smug smile off
michelle obama's face.

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,300
Am i the only person around here
That doesn't like reunions?

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,500
Don't tell me you're not gonna go.

73
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,300
This may come as
some surprise to you, jack,

74
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
But i was kind of
a lonely nerd in high school.

75
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,100
And if i remember correctly,
You were a good deal more...

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,500
Yeah, it was hell for me.
I just wanted to be left alone,

77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,300
But i guess every high school
has people like kelsey winthrop.

78
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Hey, liz, how's the telescope?

79
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,200
??

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,500
Ugh, the only people that
are gonna go to this thing

81
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,400
Are people like her
and her stupid friends.

82
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
The cool, pretty crowd.

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, that's you now, lemon.

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,300
You run a hit tv show,
You have very impressive friends.

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
You found a hairstyle that works
for you, So long as it's not too humid.

86
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,100
And you're telling me that
you don't have the confidence

87
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,900
To face a bunch of whittling,
jug-Blowing, Ihop monkeys?

88
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,500
Jack, it's a suburb of philadelphia.

89
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,300
Lemon, you will go and
show that kelsey winthrop

90
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,300
That the ugly duckling has
turned into A vaguely ethnic swan.

91
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,100
No, i'm not going. I'd never
get a rental car now anyway.

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Well, then, take the ge jet.
The ceo insists.

93
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,100
They have popcorn on the plane.

94
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,200
I want to go to there.

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,900
Mr. Geiss, it is very good
to see you Up and about, sir.

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
Yes, jackie boy,

97
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,700
I think you know why you're here.

98
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,500
Congratulations.

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,900
You are the first to know, officially,

100
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,800
That i'm staying on as ceo.

101
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm sorry, what did you say?

102
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,900
A beam of energy came and
spoke to me During my coma.

103
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,000
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I don't know what it was.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,100
It could have been an alien.
Maybe it was god.

105
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,500
Maybe it was an unborn aztec king.

106
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
But it told me my work here
is not yet done.

107
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,300
Oh, it's done. I think it's done.

108
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,800
You're still my choice
to take over when i die,

109
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,200
If that ever even happens.

110
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,800
Tray, why are you in your angry chair?

111
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Because kenneth got a bigger laugh
In the elevator than me today.

112
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
<i>And where were you two?!</i>

113
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,900
Your job is to protect me
from embarrassment.

114
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,300
- Grizz had to go to the optometrist.
- Making up words won't save you.

115
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,100
Okay, we're getting
on the elevator with kenneth,

116
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,800
And you're going to laugh at my jokes.

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,000
<i>Hey, hey.</i>
I'm so glad i found you.

118
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,900
There's been a change of plans.
Geiss is staying on as ceo.

119
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,000
- What?!
- A beam of energy told him to.

120
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,800
That's fun, right?

121
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,500
And instead of running everything,
I'm going back to my old job.

122
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
So the standards department
is telling me

123
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,800
You can only say "cat anus" twice
During the show,

124
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,700
but i'm gonna fight for you.

125
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,700
You can say it three times.

126
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,500
Cat anus, cat anus, cat anus!

127
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
- Are you okay?
- I have to be.

128
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,900
What are my other options?
Cry? Wallow?

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,300
<i>If i do that,</i>
Geiss and the beam win.

130
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,900
If i control my feelings, i win.

131
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,700
Jeez, jack, tough year.

132
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,900
First william f. Buckley dies, now this.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
Next stop impotence, right?

134
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,100
So since we don't have the jet, i guess--

135
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,500
No, no, you're still
going to your reunion.

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,600
Nothing changes, i rented a jet,
And i'll drop you off on my way to miami.

137
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,100
Why are you going to miami?

138
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,100
Why does anybody go to miami?
Ass and the burgeoning art scene.

139
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,700
<i>I gotta blow off some steam.</i>

140
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,800
Come on,

141
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,500
let's go have some fun.

142
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm sorry you're stuck in white haven.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,900
Boy, it was something
landing in this storm, huh?

144
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,600
Listen, about some of
the stuff that i said...

145
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,500
One time i laughed
at a blind guy eating spaghetti!

146
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,300
Sometimes i pee in the shower
if i'm really tired!

147
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,500
I saw my grandparents
making love once,

148
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,700
And i didn't leave right away!

149
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,200
He didn't give it to me.

150
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,500
All that work, all that sacrifice.
Why did i bother?

151
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,700
I know, but remember, don't let him win.

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,100
- Cat anus.
- I don't know who i am.

153
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,500
- Jack...
- i don't know where i am.

154
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I know it's not miami,
But you can blow off steam here.

155
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,900
We have a lovely n.C. Wyeth museum.

156
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,800
Actually, some meth addicts
burned that place down Last august.

157
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Well, there are excellent restaurants
Down on cabot street.

158
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,400
the vietnamese immigrants took over
<i>All of those places.</i>

159
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I wouldn't recommend going to
little hanoi after dark

160
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Unless you're wearing a khan dong.

161
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Why don't you just direct me To the bar?

162
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,100
I'm sorry, sir, no bars here.

163
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,700
We've been a dry county since 1880.

164
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,100
<i>It's the one tradition that remains.</i>

165
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
But do you like methodist churches
Full of vietnamese?

166
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,000
Give me the key.

167
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,400
Hey, elevator, what's this?

168
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
A ghetto mating call.

169
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,900
i didn't get the memo.

170
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,300
Jeesh, buy a guy a drink first.

171
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,000
This place is bigger than my apartment.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
A manhattan, please.

173
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,600
Sure. What kind of bourbon?

174
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
??Ne spritzer, please.

175
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Kelsey winthrop.

176
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,400
I think danvers has a bar.

177
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,600
To get there, you just go Straight
down ngo dinh diem boulevard

178
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,900
Until you see a sign that says "detour."

179
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,800
Now ignore that. It's a trap.

180
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,000
And then you want to get on route
nine going west About 30 miles.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Does the reunion have a bar?

182
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
<i>Kelsey? It's liz lemon.</i>

183
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,300
- Oh, my god!
- Yeah. Surprising.

184
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,300
But cocoon, and then flap,
flap, flap--Butterfly.

185
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,500
i did not think you'd come.

186
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,800
Well, i almost didn't.

187
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,200
I was in manhattan,
working in the fast lane--

188
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,800
You made life a living
hell for everyone here!

189
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,700
You would have to come to the reunion
And make us go through it all again.

190
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,300
- What?
- You know,

191
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,900
i tried to befriend you
Just so you'd leave me alone.

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,300
Hey, liz, how's the telescope?

193
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,800
I don't know, kelsey.
How's your mom's pill addiction?

194
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
What are you talking about?
I was a nerd.

195
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,900
You were a bully!
We were all afraid of you.

196
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,800
We called you the white haven witch.

197
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,000
<i>- Lemon?!
- Oh, erin, no!</i>

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't sink to her level.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
This is a beauty mark.

200
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,700
But you thought it was funny
to say that god pooped on me.

201
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,600
I didn't think
anybody was listening to me.

202
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I was a nobody.
You were homecoming queen.

203
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,800
<i>I have had years of therapy--</i>

204
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,900
<i>Kel--Kels,</i> Your facial tic.

205
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
<i>You brought it back!</i>

206
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
You happy?

207
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
And i still got the mulch business.

208
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,700
It's hard work,
but i'm outside all day,

209
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
And i don't answer to anyone.

210
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Excuse me,

211
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,700
- can i ask you a question?
- Sure.

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,700
Are you happy?

213
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Well, i got a boat,
good friends, and a trampoline.

214
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,500
You tell me.

215
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,900
That's the life, right?

216
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,500
What are you doing here?

217
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm getting drunk.
Lemon, would you buy my mulch?

218
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know, jack.

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,900
I just found out that i was a jerk
In high school.

220
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,700
Yeah, turns out i'm not the lovable
nerd. I was the bully you hate.

221
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,800
This is mostly spit.

222
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,900
Hello, elizabeth.

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,300
It's rob sussman.

224
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,600
Still think i am "gayer than
the volleyball scene In top gun"?

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,100
No, we-- We were friends.

226
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,500
No, i just said that stuff To try
to make it okay for you to come out.

227
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,800
Come out of what?!

228
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,000
<i>I'd like you to meet my wife,</i>

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,100
With whom i've raised
three beautiful dogs.

230
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,500
- Oh, boy.
- I cannot deal right now.

231
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,200
I'm so mad, all i can do is dance.

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,200
even rob sussman hated me?

233
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,700
He was the first gay guy i ever kissed.

234
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,400
What is wrong with these people?

235
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Nothing. They're good americans.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
Hey, lemon, check this out.
I just made it up.

237
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,300
??Beers, boats, and buds.

238
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,100
Doesn't that sound great?

239
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,100
- Are you having a stroke?
- No.

240
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,800
No, all my life i thought i made
good choices, But am i happy?

241
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,600
These people are happy. I envy them.

242
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,300
I wish i was one of them.

243
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,000
Larry?

244
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,100

245
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,000

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,800
Larry braverman.

248
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
No one has seen you
Since what...graduation.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Man, you are still, like,
the coolest guy ever.

250
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,400
Hey, you still got that old camaro?

251
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,700
No, no, it finally broke down.

252
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,700
- Oh, man...

253
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,500

254
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,900

255
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,300
That's awesome.

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Hey, let's go out in the
parking lot And do donuts!

257
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,000
You know, just like in the old days.

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,300
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Let's do it. Come on.

259
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,000
<i>Come on.</i>

260
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,100
Let's do some donuts.

261
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,500
How is this working? You are 12 years
older than everybody here.

262
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Lemon, rich 50 is
middle-Class 38, okay?

263
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,100
Jack...

264
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
no, no, i don't want to
be jack donaghy anymore.

265
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,700
I'm larry now. That's one thing that
don geiss can't take away from me.

266
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,800
Now, are you gonna be leaving soon?

267
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,900
'Cause you're kinda harshin'
everybody's buzz Around here.

268
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,300
No, i'm not gonna leave.

269
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,100
Sure, i said some dumb things
in high school, But i have changed.

270
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm gonna turn this thing around, jack.

271
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,900

272
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,300
Go home, lemon!

273
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,000
No way, new friend.

274
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,500
Jenna, we're the most important
people here, right?

275
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Well, of course, tracy. We're actors.

276
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
If we didn't exist, how would
people know who to vote for?

277
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,600
And people around here shouldn't
take attention From us, should they?

278
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,900
No. Never.

279
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,500
Attention is what gives us power.

280
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,800
If someone threatens that,
you have to put a stop to it.

281
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,100
<i>Wait, who are you worried about?</i>

282
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Is it allison from wardrobe's baby?

283
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,800
What is up with that thing?

284
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,100
So she can put her feet
in her mouth. So can i.

285
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,100
It's not the baby. It's kenneth.

286
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Kenneth?!

287
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,600
Are you crazy?

288
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>Come on. He knows his place.</i>

289
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,600
- And he worships us.
- Yeah... He does.

290
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,400
Come on, you know
we're the big dogs around here.

291
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,600
Hey, let's go throw a tantrum
about the air-Conditioning.

292
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,400
That sounds really nice.

293
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,200
Lemon!

294
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
Larry?

295
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,800
Larry...

296
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,900
It's me, jessica.

297
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,500
I can't believe you're here.

298
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,200
You never answered my letters.

299
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,300
I--I didn't know what to say...

300
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,000
Because of, you know...

301
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,800
- The things.
- I hate the way we ended, larry.

302
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,500
I am so, so sorry for what happened.

303
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,800
I forgive you...

304
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,800
jessica.

305
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,200
Really?

306
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,300
- Even for--
- Especially for that.

307
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,400
Say what you said to me
that night at the lake.

308
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,500
No.

309
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Guys?

310
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,900
I just want to say i'm so, so sorry
If i ever made you--

311
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,500
Really, liz? 20 years
too late and way too little.

312
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,400
Ooh, hello.

313
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,700
Would you please leave us alone.

314
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,400
'Cause you know what,
We're trying to have fun tonight.

315
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,600
That's my point. I've changed.

316
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,200
<i>New liz is fun.</i>

317
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,800
I don't ruin parties. I get 'em going.

318
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,900
Look, let's all do the diane.

319
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,500
What is wrong with you?!

320
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,100
Diane?

321
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,600
Hi.

322
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
Could you hit four, please?

323
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Next stop, kansas city.

324
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,100
you are so funny.

325
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,700
They should put you on the show.

326
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,500
* did you ever know that you're my hero *

327
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,800
* and everything i would like to be-E-E *

328
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Singing in the elevator.
It's like a road trip to the sky!

329
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
* 99 bottles of beer on the wall *

330
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
* 99 bottles of beer *

331
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,900
* you take one down, pass it around *

332
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,100
* 98 bottles of beer on the wall *

333
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,400
Kenneth is a monster!

334
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,900
We have to stop him!

335
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,600
I want you all to know
how happy i am right now.

336
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,200
Being here with you people has
helped me more Than you can know.

337
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
To us!

338
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,300
Oh, man, look at us!

339
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,500
It's just like we're back
in high school, right?

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
You know what was always
my favorite thing?

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Seven minutes in heaven.

342
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,600
You always got the bottle to land on me.

343
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,100
Think you still have the touch?

344
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Oh, yeah.

345
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Do it! Come on!

346
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,100
Come on, braverman!

347
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,800
Do it, do it, do it...

348
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,000
What are we all doing?

349
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,600
Boo!

350
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,900
Just to be clear, we're not making out.
That would be social suicide.

351
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,400
Like i even want to be here
in this closet at this reunion.

352
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,800
- It's a nightmare.
- A nightmare for whom, lemon?

353
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,600
If these jagweeds don't want to
get to know the nice new me,

354
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,500
Then screw them and
their rapidly yellowing teeth.

355
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
lemon, you really
haven't changed, have you?

356
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,100
Excuse me?

357
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,100
What happened when i told you geiss
had screwed me over For the ceo job?

358
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,600
Did you offer your help as a friend?

359
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,200
Or did you make some joke
about me being impotent?

360
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,100
Jeez, that was, like, eight hours ago.

361
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,500
I was just, i don't know,
cutting the tension.

362
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,700
Or, as always, were you hiding
behind your sense of humor

363
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,800
Instead of engaging in a real way?

364
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Really, i'm the one that's hiding,
larry braverman?

365
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,000
There it is, right there.

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,300
When you feel threatened, you attack.

367
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
That's why you're almost 40
and you're still alone.

368
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,700
At least i'm not 50, alone,

369
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,400
And sitting on 2,000 business cards
For a job i'm never gonna get.

370
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
- What did you say?
- Yeah.

371
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,200
Your bags were delivered
to my room by accident.

372
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,300
Look what i found.

373
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,400
You went to a printer, didn't you?

374
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,900
You picked out a font.

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,100
You paid extra for a rush order.

376
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,100
It was your happy, little secret.

377
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,600
<i>What are you doing?</i>

378
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,800
Why is she so mean?

379
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,000
<i>What'd you do to braverman?!</i>

380
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,300
- She's awful.
- She's the gay one!

381
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,400
Here's your lunch, mr. Parcell.
Just the way you like it.

382
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,900
Ham sandwich with the works,
hold the bread.

383
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,100
But that's my job.

384
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,200
This studio hosted The kraft
television theater in the 1950s,

385
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,000
Where young writers like paddy chayefsky
and rod serling First rose to prominence.

386
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Mr. Jordan, why are you giving a tour?

387
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,700
It doesn't feel good when
someone does your job, does it?

388
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I don't understand.

389
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't like it when you do jokes
in the elevator. That's my job.

390
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Oh, lord, i didn't know.

391
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I would never do anything to hurt you.
You're my best friend.

392
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,900
We're not really best friends.
We're just good friends.

393
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I just want you to stop.

394
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,300
I will. I will.

395
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,100
i'm so sorry, miss morone.

396
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,700
No, keep crying.

397
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,500
I want you to feel this So
you never make this mistake again.

398
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,900
And for traveling the farthest distance,
It's david messinger!

399
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,600
<i>Hey, larry,</i>

402
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,200
It will be delicious.

403
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,200
<i>And now, for best school spirit,</i>
It's liz lemon!

404
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,900
Come up on stage, liz!

405
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,600

406
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,400
It comes with a $50 gift certificate
To * outback steak house *

407
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,900
I want to go to there.

408
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,400
Wait...

409
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
Wait!

410
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,800
<i>Wait, we cannot do this.</i>
<i>We cannot carrie liz lemon.</i>

411
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,700
Oh, not okay, guys!

412
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,200
We all know That
liz lemon has her faults,

413
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,900
But no one's perfect.
I mean, i'm certainly not perfect.

414
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,200
Don't say that, braverman!

415
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,300
You're more than perfect.

416
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,900
No, no, no, it's true.

417
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,400
I've made mistakes.

418
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,700
Sacrificed happiness for a job
I don't think i'm ever going to get.

419
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,700
<i>We all have ways of coping.</i>
I use sex and awesomeness.

420
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Lemon here hides behind her insults,
But that's not who she is.

421
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,000
<i>She's a good person...</i>

422
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,000
Whom i'm honored to call my friend.

423

Thank you, larry.

424
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,400
