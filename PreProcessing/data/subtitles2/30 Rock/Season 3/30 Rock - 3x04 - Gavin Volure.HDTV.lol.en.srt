1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,840
We're at a party,lemon,
try to loosen up a little.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,710
How could i loosen up?

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,100
I'm in connecticut, i haven't eaten, and i'm
stressed about an "away toilet" situation.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,210
Do you know how luy we are?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,870
We are in gavin volure's home.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,640
He was the c.e.o.of sunstream.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,340
Yeah,i don't know what that is.

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,070
Is this potpourri or chips?

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,730
'Cause i'm gonna try to eat it.

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,170
Volure is a god.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,970
He was the first man to be on the cover
offortuneandjet magazine at the same time.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,230
Of course,that was back whenjetwas
actually about jet ownership.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,280
That magazine took a weird turn.

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,780
These are not chips.

15
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,620
Then he fell off the face of the earth, sold
sunstream, and shut himself off from the world.

16
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,000
They say he hasn't left his
home in almost three years.

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,050
Well,i hope he shows up for dinner.

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,440
He's already here.

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,110
Thank you all for coming tonight.

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:56,280
Because of my severe agoraphobia
and my debilitating wealth...

21
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,370
I am forced to bring the world to me,

22
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,550
and host dinners for interesting
people from all walks of life.

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,210
The world of fashion, society,
art collecting and yelling...

24
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,040
Why isn't there any good art in here?

25
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:09,950
Come on!

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,740
Business and historical fiction.

27
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,540
Really?

28
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,300
What if the germans
had won the war,lemon?

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,510
And the arts.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,310
I'm glad jack was able to bring you,liz.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,300
I asked him about you after i saw your photo
in the style section of thenew york times.

32
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,400
Funny story,i was only wearing that because the
fire alarm went off while i was getting a haircut.

33
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,960
Well,you looked beautiful.

34
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,600
and,as always, i keep one chair empty,

35
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,520
to represent our
unfulfilled hopes and dreams.

36
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,180
I'm just kidding, eliot
spitzer's hooker couldn't make it.

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,260
Now,i want to send my driver
into manhattan to pick up dessert.

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,920
Anybody know a good place for cupcakes?

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,560
I think there's
a place--

40
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,590
mcenroe,give me a break.I'm on it.

41
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,350
77th and amsterdam, 68th and columbus,
125th and president clinton boulevard,

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,560
Also,don't over think it,
sara lee,frozen, unbelievable.

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,980
Mr. Jordan,what are
you still doing here?

47
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,670
I don't want to go home, ken.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,510
You know my two sons,
tracy,jr. And george foreman?

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,840
They've been acting really weird lately.

50
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,780
Where you going?

51
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,160
Nowhere.

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,330
Those two have never
paid me any attention.

53
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,500
And rightly so.

54
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,530
I'm a strange man who
can't be taken seriously.

55
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,570
Now they won't let
me out of their sight.

56
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,190
Oh,maybe they love you.

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,510
Nope. Look what the little one made me.

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,990
Aw,that's cute.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,210
This is voodoo,ken!

60
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,280
Those two are up to something.

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,770
Sometimes,kids act out
when there's a big change.

62
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,090
I know i was a handful when my family moved from
our farm house to that militia camp in the woods.

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,590
Well,there is all this
new money coming in.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,440
And it's not just from the video game.

65
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,660
It's the tie-ins, the toys, the
life-sized tracy jordan sex doll.

66
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,910
They're selling like hotcakes in japan.

67
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,980
Well,you know what they say,
money is the root of all evil.

68
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,890
I thought that was just a
tagline for my movie,death bank.

69
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,020
I can't believe you're out of the game.

70
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,980
It's like picasso not painting, or bruce
willis not combing action and rock harmonica.

71
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,770
Don't you miss it?

72
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,280
I do.

73
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,910
That's why i'm forming a new company.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,540
Here's the pitch, wind power,
bandwidth,chinese market.

75
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,540
Oh,god.

76
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,030
I'm funding the whole thing myself.

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,790
Partners,oy.

78
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,290
Jack... You're drooling.

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,340
If you want in, i'll make a
little room and pull some strings.

80
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,350
This is the most
exciting day of my life.

81
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,780
And i was pulled onstage once to
dance at a bruce springsteen concert.

82
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,870
Welcome aboard.

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,540
Just think, this time next year, you'll
be so rich you can run for political office

84
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,160
Without having to pretend
to be a fundamentalist.

85
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,100
Jack,the car is here.

86
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,520
Liz... Thank you for coming.

87
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,600
I really enjoyed yo cupcakes.

88
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:22,060
And because my agoraphobia-related germ
issues prevent direct human contact,

89
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,900
I wonder if carl here might say
good night to you for me? Carl?

90
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,880
Good night,liz. I hope
to see you again soon.

91
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,870
Okay. good night.

92
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,030
Guys,listen up...I just got a memo,

93
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,120
saying that every floor in the building has to
designate a floor emergency marshal for fires,

94
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,960
Terrorist attacks, cloverfieldmonsters.

95
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,030
I can't do it,because my head
is too big for the helmet.

96
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,490
So any volunteers?

97
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,260
No,but you have a big head.

98
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,230
- That's not a burn, i just said that.
- Hey,guys.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,020
Cerie,is my phone ringing?

100
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,220
It is. Wow,you have,like, dog ears.

101
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,220
So are you going to... Okay.

102
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,790
- Hello?
- Hey,liz. It's gavin volure.

103
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,590
Listen,i only took that napkin
because i wrapped some chicken in it.

104
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,220
That's not why i'm calling.

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,980
I just had a good time
with you the other night,

106
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,990
And i wondered if you'd like
to come out again this saturday?

107
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,680
Are you having another party?

108
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,180
No.

109
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,160
Well... This must be what
the kids call "a booty call."

110
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,070
I haven't been out of the house since 2004, and
even i know the kids don't call it that anymore.

111
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,420
So,uh,what do you say?

112
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,310
Um,yes. I guess. Right?

113
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,530
Okay. I'll send a helicopter to
take you to the train station.

114
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,120
- Okay.
- Bye.

115
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,710
What the what?

116
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,190
well,it's gonna be a
beautiful sunny day,

117
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,270
And we can expect much more of
the same over the next few days.

118
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,030
Authorities came to believe that the
mendez brothers acted out of pure greed.

119
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,360
The only thing standing between
them and tremendous wealth was--

120
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,430
What? Say it!

121
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,880
Their father. Jose mendez.

122
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,010
My kids are going to kill me!

123
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,780
Kenneth, what are you doing?

124
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,170
Ah,hello,sir.

125
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,430
I've been taking in
laundry to make extra money.

126
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,700
I just don't let myself read the
t-shirts with off-color slogans.

127
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
Laundry,kenneth?

128
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,670
I know we pay you a living
wage, i fought against it.

129
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,380
Yes,sir...

130
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,930
But i've had to send
more money home lately.

131
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,650
There are problems on the farm.

132
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,230
After years of inbreeding,
the pigs are getting violent.

133
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,300
And the pig shield around
the house has worn thin.

134
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,790
Kenneth, how much money do
you have in your savings?

135
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,490
Well,let's see.

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,450
- If you don't include confederate money?
- 4000

137
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm going to invest that for you.

138
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,940
A friend has presented me wi
opportunity, and i want to include you.

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,110
Oh,mr. Donaghy. Thank you,sir.

140
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,410
After i invest this money, you'll
be able to buy your folks a pig moat.

141
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,980
Well,that would be great if
pigs weren't excellent swimmers.

142
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,970
Jack.

143
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,630
Gavin volure just
called and asked me out.

144
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,650
I mean,in... For the weekend.

145
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,790
I thought he might.

146
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,660
He asked if we were involved, i said you used to
have a thing for me, but you were getting over it.

147
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,090
That is what's happening,right?

148
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,380
Yeah. Listen...

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,970
I kind of told him i'd go.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,190
You should, what's the problem?

151
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,340
I don't know,i'm still
tired from that dinner.

152
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,790
And meeting someone new,ugh.

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,660
All the nodding and
smiling and sibling listing.

154
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,490
And what's the upside?

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,320
It works and you have
to have a bunch of sex?

156
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,590
Lemon,what do you want?

157
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,260
Do you want to be alone
for the rest of your life?

158
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,830
No,i just wish i could start a
relationship about 12 years in,

159
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,270
When you really don't have to try anymore and you
can just sit around together and goof on tv shows,

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,040
And then go to bed without
anybody trying any funny business.

161
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,860
Lemon,don't overthink this.
Gavin is a fabulous guy.

162
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,070
If i were dating a man, he would be
the top of my list with michael jordan,

163
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,710
denzel washington,taye diggs...

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,580
God,do i have a black thing?

165
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,660
I do like him.

166
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:17,720
Lemon,you're going to go to gavin's, and you're
going to work this thing like a chinese gymnast.

167
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,870
Wear something tight, force a
smile, and lie about your age.

168
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,310
Hey,guys.

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,340
Daddy's home.

170
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,510
Don't menendez me.

171
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,290
We made the hockey team.

172
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,690
And,uh,this is the study.

173
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,060
This is interesting, uh,one of these
benches is a priceless work of art,

174
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,820
And the other is an ordinary
bench from which to admire it.

175
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,330
Which one's which?

176
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,110
So you just never leave this house?

177
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,900
I'm afraid not. And it does get lonely.

178
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,490
I'd be lying if i told you
i never danced with a broom.

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,490
That's nothing,sometimes, to feel
like i have company during dinner,

180
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,760
I dispute credit card
charges on speaker phone.

181
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,240
Thanks for coming out.

182
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,640
I know my situation is complicated, but i
really enjoyed ur company the other night.

183
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,030
I had a great time too.

184
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,050
So with your agoraphobia,
how does this work?

185
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,530
Well,it's not easy.

186
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:33,480
We can never leave the house, and we'd just
probably sit around all weekend and watch tv.

187
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,110
Go on.

188
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,240
There's not much else to do up here but eat,
and read celebrity gossip on the internet,

189
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,420
- and nap the day away.
- Really?

190
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,310
And unfortunately,
because of my phobias,

191
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,900
we could never be
physically intimate. I know.

192
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,550
What wom would want all that?

193
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,370
oh,hello,kenneth. Please,sit down.

194
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,910
I'm sorry to bother you,mr. Donaghy.

195
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,100
But i've got another $10.
00 i'd like to invest.

196
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,540
I did some street performing
in my neighborhood this weekend.

197
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,380
Kenneth,i'm very proud of you.

198
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,220
Next stop,home ownership.

199
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm just kidding. The middle class
is dying, you'll be renting forever.

200
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,580
Um,let's just call my broker.

201
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,980
Hey,jack.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,830
Hey,walter. I just want to check
on that investment i made on friday.

203
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,300
All right, let's pull it up.

204
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,980
- Um,that account was closed out.
- What?

205
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,120
Yeah,zero balance as of this morning.I
don't know what that hot tip was,

206
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,740
but you'd have been better off
putting that money in a coffee can.

207
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,210
Hi,walter. This is kenneth
parcell, nbc page program.

208
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,620
Wh's the status ofmyinvestment?

209
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,830
Gavin, this was wonderful.

210
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,250
I really enjoyed watching
mtv canada with you.

211
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,820
Yeah. They can't seem to get
anything right up there, can they?

212
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,630
I hope y'll come back.
Maybe next weekend?

213
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
- I'd like that.
- Me too.

214
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,480
Well,i should go.

215
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,300
Do you have everything? Do
you have your cell phone?

216
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,780
Nerds,where is it?

217
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,050
Oh,uh, there it is in the other room.

218
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,700
Carl... Could you get liz's cell phone
for her so i can say a proper good bye?

219
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,690
Thanks,buddy.

220
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,160
Anyway,i just...

221
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,280
- We don't have much time,liz.
- What?

222
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,220
Look,liz,i've decided i can trust you,
so i'm going to tell you the truth.

223
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,050
I'm not rely an eccentric agoraphobe,

224
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,310
I just tell people that so they won't
know i'm under house arrest for tax fraud.

225
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,580
- And arson.
- Volure.

226
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,720
Ah,the wind must've blown it shut,carl.

227
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,750
I'm searching for the key.

228
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,910
Carl's a u.s.marshal.
Come, before they shoot.

229
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,170
I thought derek was upstairs.

230
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,660
I miscounted the men,liz!

231
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,320
I miscounted the men!

232
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,630
Gavin,it's jack, please
call me immediately.

233
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,120
Also that joke answering machine message
makes me really think you've picked up,

234
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,350
So i start talking, and then it
beeps, and,uh,i feel like a fool.

235
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,440
Hey,your friend is a crook.

236
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,610
He's under house arrest for tax
fraud, embezzlement, and racketeering.

237
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,860
What is racketeering?

238
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,890
No one knows,lemon.

239
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,330
And he's not a germaphobe!

240
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,060
I thought i was helping him when i let
him hold my boob while we watchedtop chef.

241
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,730
Oh,i'm sorry.

242
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,900
You should be. You made me go up there.

243
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,090
Well,i'm going to fix this. I'm going to
get kenneth his money back and for you,

244
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,500
I'm going to hit gavin volure harder
than a bottle of whiskey in an irish wake.

245
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,540
Tracy, get out of the hallway.

246
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,190
Or am i?

247
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,910
Oh,god,this dream again?

248
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,100
That's not me.

249
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,560
That's the tracy jordan
japanese sex doll.

250
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,290
You can tell us apart because it's not
suffering from a vitamin deficiency.

251
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,870
Other than the natural inclination to make
love to yourself, why did you get this?

252
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,340
To use as a decoy.

253
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,880
So my greedy children will murder it,
and i'll be able to escape un-mendezed.

254
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,910
This is insanity.

255
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,010
Or is it?

256
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,700
The parallels between the jordans
and the menendi are uncanny.

257
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,670
Both families are rich,
both families have two sons,

258
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,320
and both families are
staples of court tv.

259
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,870
Money does make people
crazy, look at gavin.

260
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,650
And he doesn't have the life-long
scarring of an absentee father.

261
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,160
Exactly!

262
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,750
You want to get one? I can get you one.

263
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,890
You've got ten seconds, volure.

264
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,790
Sorry,jack,but i needed
that money for my escape.

265
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,220
And it's all gone. I
spent it on disguises.

266
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,260
What about your billions?
What about sunstream?

267
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,180
Sunstream is why i'm trped here.

268
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,020
It's not a real company.

269
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,150
You watch our commercials, we
never actually say what we did.

270
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,270
INNOVATION

271
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
TOMORROW

272
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,980
AMERICA

273
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,930
SUNSTREAM

274
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,250
You can't be broke,
what about this house?

275
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,130
The government owns this house.

276
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,510
I share with three other
white collar criminals.

277
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,940
Hey,glenn, that's my peanut butter.

278
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,380
God,you're pathetic.

279
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,710
Creamy? This is-- this is not
my peanut-- i'm sorry,glenn.

280
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,160
I know,i'm pathetic.

281
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,480
But i never meant to hurt liz.

282
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,390
I miss her,jack.

283
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,390
I miss her laughter, her voice,

284
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,950
the sound of her scratching her
dry elbow skin all the way up--

285
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,880
Damn it.

286
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,450
I have got a serious
case of the mondays.

287
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,720
Gavin,you're going to have
to make this thing right.

288
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,570
I will,jack. I promise.

289
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,940
We trusted you,gavin.

290
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,380
I know,good point.

291
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,690
And you betrayed us.

292
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,370
Wow,that's wonderful news.

293
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,520
Gavin? Gavin,what
are you ing in the--

294
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,760
Yep. You and me both,pal.

295
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,960
- I'll just be a minute.
- Carl!

296
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,870
God,these acoustics
in here are fantastic.

297
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,740
Tomorrow,tomorrow

298
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,460
i love you tomorrow

299
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,760
it's only a day

300
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,710
uh,kenneth.

301
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,350
I couldn't get your
money back, and i'm sorry.

302
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,550
I feel responsible, so
i want you to have this.

303
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,790
Mr. Donaghy, i can't take that.

304
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,280
Well,what would this country be if our economy didn't
allow wealthy people to take advantage of rubes?

305
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,050
Well,yes,that's true. But
what about your family?

306
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,080
Ah,don't worry about us.

307
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,910
We parcells have eaten our share
of rock soup and squirrel tail.

308
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,980
But we've also known lean times.

309
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,270
We'll get by.

310
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,940
Kenneth!

311
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,650
I need someone to be our
floor emergency marshal.

312
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,130
And you came to me first? Thank you,sir!

313
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,900
Uh,pete...

314
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,630
Doesn't that responsibility
come with a $4,000 signing bonus?

315
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,550
Uh... Yes?

316
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,450
Oh,right,i rember that meeting.

317
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,610
Where you also said i would
get a per diem for gas.

318
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,480
Yes,yes,um...

319
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,160
- 12 cents a mile.
- Yes! Hornberger!

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,140
Yes,hornberger.

321
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,440
Daddy?

322
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,460
It begins.

323
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,150
Daddy,are you awake?

324
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,170
I keep having a scary dream.

325
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,300
I dreamed that you would get so rich that
you would leave us and get a new family.

326
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,890
And never come back. And daddy...

327
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,710
I don't want you to leave
us. 'Cause i love you.

328
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,420
I love you so much.

329
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,640
I love you too,son!

330
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,220
Stop it. Stop patriciding!

331
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,280
It's me.

332
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,920
There's nothing to be freaked out about.

333
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,910
That's just some japanese
sex doll in daddy's bed.

334
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,200
Now,you listen.

335
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,370
You don't have to ever
worry about me leaving.

336
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,950
'Cause i'll always be
there to take care of you.

337
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,670
And there's something else.

338
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,260
If anything ever happens to me,

339
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,070
you and your brother
are going to go to jail.

340
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,200
Liz lemon! Look!

341
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,330
I'm not dead.

342
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,420
- Good to know.
- Yes,it is.

343
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,690
- Also everything worked out with jenna's dad visiting.
- What?

344
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,930
Oh,you weren't really
around for any of that.

345
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,960
Cast to the stage for rehearsal.

346
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,540
Hello,liz.

347
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh,my god! Gavin?

348
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,700
We're supposed to be
quiet during rehearsal.

349
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,660
What are you doing here?

350
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,030
I came back for you,liz. I was free.

351
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,920
I was across the canadian border.

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,270
No,you weren't. What-- what's
the scam? Do you want money?

353
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,200
No,i'm not lying. I can prove it,look.

354
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,340
Cheap cholesterol medicine from canada.

355
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,570
A paris hilton film
released only in canada.

356
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,620
Camp of approval? What
does that even mean?

357
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,510
Liz... What's the point of
being free if you're alone?

358
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,120
You get me. Come with me to canada.

359
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,400
Toronto was just like new
york, but without all the stuff.

360
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,730
Absolutely not.

361
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,040
Volure.

362
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,360
I thought by now you'd be some place that
u.s.law couldn't touch you, like bali or utah.

363
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,390
What made you come back?

364
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,020
The reason is standing
right next to you.

365
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,150
I came back for liz.

366
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,140
- This isn't going anywhere, volure.
- I already told him that.

367
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,510
You've already done enough damage,

368
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,560
taking advantage of her loneliness
and her big ben-sized biological clock.

369
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,260
- Oh,come on.
- I'm stopping it.

370
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,050
I can't believe i'm saying this to the great
gavin volure, but liz lemon is too good for you.

371
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,340
Oh,well, that is nice.

372
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,530
It's over,volure. Give me the brush.

373
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,670
You stay back. I swear i will paint you.

374
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,750
I am not going torealprison.

375
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,060
I've lost everything.

376
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm financially ruined, i've lost liz.

377
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,420
That paint is drying
weird, and now prison?

378
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,760
Not prison. Not for gavin volure.

379
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,860
What are you doing?

380
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,070
Get down from there.

381
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,590
Good god,volure, that's
got to be 15, 16 feet!

382
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,730
Everybody stand back.

383
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,590
Gavin volure's going to jump.

384
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,760
We need the floor emergency marshal!

385
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,570
Gavin volure, everybody
wanted to be gavin volure.

386
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,950
- Volure,calm down.
- Gavin,don't do this.

387
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,460
All right,everyone, i'm in charge.

388
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,790
Does anyone need water or saltines?

389
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,700
I would feel safer with some saltines.

390
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,840
I d the money, i had the
yacht, i had the women.

391
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,340
I had it all, and then i lost it.

392
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,740
And now,i'm going to jump.

393
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,140
Gavin,listen to me.

394
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,700
I know you've had some setbacks lately.

395
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,390
Glenn ate all my peanut butter.

396
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,170
Gavin,i'm not going to lie to you,

397
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,840
you'll probably be killed in
the first six months of prison.

398
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,890
but that's neither here nor there,

399
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,540
The important thing is that you're
alive now, which means there's hope.

400
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,970
You know,you're making a lot of sense.

401
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,900
Yes,you have to pay for
the things you've done.

402
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:46,060
You're not making sense anymore.

403
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,020
In spite of everything, you still
have friends who will stand by you.

404
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,950
And more importantly...

405
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,340
Perhaps most importantly
of all... Now,tracy!

406
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,990
what? But you're down there.

407
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,360
Or am i?

408
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,060
Good job,sex doll.

409
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,520
he miscounted the men.

410
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,840
You know, a lot of people
look down on sex dolls.

411
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,260
But as we saw tonight,they save
lives and bring families together.

412
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,810
How am i such an expert?

413
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm tracy jordan's sex doll.

414
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,140
All right, Let's do this.

415
