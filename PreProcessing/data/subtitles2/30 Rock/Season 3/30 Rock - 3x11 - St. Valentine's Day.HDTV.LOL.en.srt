1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,170
Oh,good morning, dr. Baird.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,060
Good morning, regular person lemon.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,150
Oh,hey,are you around this weekend?

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,650
- Uh,maybe we could have
that date talked-- - Yes.

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,860
Okay. Uh,how 'bout... Friday?

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,010
Oh,no,friday I have a stupid...
Show. How 'bout saturday?

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,730
Saturday,uh... Okay. I guess
that doesn't have to be weird.

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,530
- Okay then.
- Okay.

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,150
Valentine's day it is.

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,070
Saturday is valentine's day?

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,690
Norts!

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,490
You sound so sexy when you say that.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,450
Say it again.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,930
Your mother's gone back to florrrida.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,490
These mcflurries are amazing.

16
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,470
I know.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,730
The soft swirl of vanilla, And the
hard crunch of candy and cookies.

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,600
You'd think they fight each other,
But no,together they are perfecto.

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,290
Some would say that describes us.

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,970
Who would say such a crazy thing?

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,110
We are us.

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,020
Let a mcflurry be what it is--
The world's greatest dessert.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,510
Actually,the world's greatest
dessert Is served in a restaurant

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,820
right here in new york Called plunder.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,580
It costs $1,000.

26
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,260
Lucky for you,your boyfriend got
reservations For valentine's day.

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,590
But I have to go to church.

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,380
On valentine's day? Is that a thing?

29
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,620
It is the feast of the
martyrdom oft. Valentine.

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:30,060
Please,jack,don't tell me you're
one of those Convenient catholics

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,650
That only goes to church every sunday.

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,840
No.

36
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,890
Oh,kennet h ey,you know how the company
makes an effort To hire the disabled?

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,790
Do i!

38
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,350
I wouldn't have this job If it
weren't for the mouth on my back.

39
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,450
Yeah,i'm supposed to supervise some
blind chick They hired to edit the reruns.

40
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,290
But three of the dancers just found
out They're all dating the same guy,

41
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,120
So i'm gonna go watch that.

42
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,940
So if you see a blind
chick, I don't know.

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,800
Um,give her one of yr ring tours.

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,630
Yes,sir. Yes,sir.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,950
I was just funnin'. It's all sewed up.

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,090
I'll help you,miss.

47
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,640
Oh,thank you so much.

48
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,250
All my friends warned me about the big
city, But look,right away I meet a gentleman.

49
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,930
Is everything okay? Because
now I smell burnt plastic.

50
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,070
Hello? E you there?

51
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,700
Hello?

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,640
I can't make this guy go on
a first date On valentine's.

53
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,340
Why are you so nervous about this?

54
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,420
Because it's a delicate situation,jack.

55
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,600
There is handsomeness involved.

56
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,300
How much?

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
Oh,come on,lemon.

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,330
- What is this,a green card thing?
- No.

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,530
- Closet case?
- I don't think so.

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,840
- Slump buster?
- No,not a ballplayer.

61
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,100
Bundy-esque serial killer?

62
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,840
That wasmyfirst thought, but no.

63
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,970
This is actually happening,
and i'm blowing it.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,850
Who pushes for a first
date on valentine's day?

65
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,980
Lemon,here's how you
correc this misstep.

66
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,490
Instead of going to a restaurant,

67
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,180
Where it'll be nothing but people in
love And rings hidden in pastries...

68
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,630
Cook him a nice meal at home.

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,350
Nice... You mean, like,stew?

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,170
I certainly do not mean stew.

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,060
I mean,try to forget
it's valentine's day.

72
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm into. I'll be in church.

73
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,610
What? Why?

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,530
Elisa is deeply religious.

75
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,390
If I had those knockers,
i'd be thanking god too.

76
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,730
All I want for valentine's day is to go
to plunder And eat the lovers' delight.

77
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,980
That sounds filthy,jack.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,820
It is.

79
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,750
Imagine a
dessert for two--

80
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,710
Tahitian vanilla bean
ice cream in a pool ofogc,

81
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,470
Drizzled in the world's
most expensive chocolate,

82
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,050
Amadei porcelana, Covered with shaved
white, black,and clear truffles,

83
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,870
And topped with edible
25-karat gold leaf.

84
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,860
Can you imagine anything better?

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,870
I don't know,you ever put
a doughnut in the microwave?

86
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,230
Come on,church won't be so
bad. Aren't you catholic?

87
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,080
I was catholic.

88
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,930
But I haven't set foot inside a
church Since I was 13 years old.

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,070
So listen,so you go sit through a night
of church, And then you go to plunder.

90
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,320
Elisa's worth it.

91
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,060
You're right. Elisa is worth it.

92
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,450
And I can fake
enthusiasm when I need to.

93
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,040
Hey,that scarf is fun!

94
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,460
Thanks. I found it at
dunkin-- Wait a minute.

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,290
Nbc. Blah blah blah. Thank you.

96
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,340
Ken,you need to snap out of it
And ask out that sexy miss magoo.

97
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,390
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,100
I know love at first
sight when I see it.

99
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,970
I saw it when I met angie, I saw it the first
time dotcom laid eyes On grizz's fiancee.

100
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:00,730
Okay,there is something about jennifer
That just makes me all car sick inside.

101
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,890
Now is the time for gallantry.

102
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,440
It's you again. I can tell.

103
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,700
Well,cotton and fiddles!
I enjoy your smile.

104
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,030
Oh,my.

105
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,690
I'm jennifer rogers.

106
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,980
You may ll me kenneth the page.

107
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,140
Because that is who I am.

108
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,780
Would you like to go out with me
tomorrow night, Yes-indeedy corncobs?

109
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,760
Well,i'm gonna say yes.

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,250
Because this just feels right, And
my instincts have never let me down.

111
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,510
Except for looking at that eclipse.

112
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,430
It's a valentine's datelie-doo!

113
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,910
That was really good stew.

114
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:02,540
Thank you. It's my own recipe, Where
I use cheddar cheese instead of water.

115
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,810
You know,i'm glad we stayed in tonight.

116
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,300
It's good to take things slow.

117
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,680
Well,please know that when invited you over,
I didn't realize it was valentine's day.

118
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,590
Yeah,you still have that rotting
jack-o'- lantern In the hallway,

119
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,970
So I feel like you don't have a
great sense Of what month it is.

120
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,040
Well,it's just gotten so small That
I kinda want to see if it disappears.

121
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,900
So,uh,first date stuff.
Where are you from?

122
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,960
Well,um,there's a really interesting
answer To that question,actually.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,240
I was born on the border of
maryland and pennsylvania.

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,310
Okay,i feel like I should do the
right thing here And tell you that

125
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,600
Your breast is falling out of your
blouse, And I can see all of it.

126
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,550
Okay,well,i guess we just
jumped ahead to date four.

127
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,410
It's not the good one,either.

128
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,510
- Jack donaghy's office.
- Jonathan!

129
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,330
Our jonathan, who art in the
office, Hallowed be my reservation.

130
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,430
If you are able, hold my table,

131
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,410
At plunder, As we will
not be there by 7:00.

132
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,370
Have them delay our heavenly
dessert, And forgive us our lateness,

133
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,560
As we forgive those who
cause lateness against us...

134
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,120
Well,thank you for explaining that.

135
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,980
I always wanted to know how
a universal remote works.

136
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,480
Well,that's how idoes.

137
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,620
Would you excuse me just one second?

138
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,170
I'll be right back.

139
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,350
Oh,cheese stew! What was I thinking?

140
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,570
I think your brownies are burning.
You want me to take 'em out?

141
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,750
Yes,please.

142
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,700
But whatever you do, Don't
open that kitchen window...

143
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,910
- No!
- Oh,too soon!

144
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,340
The draft made the door fly open!

145
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,530
I know. It's not a big deal.

146
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,720
So we skipped from date four to date...

147
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,350
No,date never. I would
never let that happen.

148
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,320
Liz,it's okay,i'm a doctor.

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
- I've seen much worse.
- Really?

150
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,050
I'm just kidding. That was pretty bad.

151
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,510
Hold on. Sorry. I have to get this.

152
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,610
Hello,mandy.

153
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,100
Yeah,no,i'm downstairs in 3-b. Why?

154
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,790
No,mandy,you can't just
drop her off without calling.

155
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,190
Mandy? Is that like a guy
friend? Like mandy patinkin?

156
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,820
No,i can't.

157
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,930
Because I am on a date right now.

158
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,950
No,mandy, do u

159
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,760
Sorry. That was my ex-wife. My
daughter bethany is on her way up.

160
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,670
You have a daughter?

161
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,540
You will see her. You
will say she's cute.

162
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,450
But let me just say that
she is... Complicated.

163
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,620
My mother usually watches her when I can't,
But my mother has been in the hospital recently,

164
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,510
And she's not doing very
well. And that has been...

165
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,650
Hard f me to handle.

166
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,330
I'm sorry that all this
keeps falling apart.

167
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,950
I was really looking forward to tonight.

168
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,130
Well,we can try again some other time.

169
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,350
- Or...
- I'm listening.

170
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,590
Maybe tonight is a gift.

171
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,130
Maybe we embrace the toilet thing, And the
bra incident, and my ex-wife, And my daughter,

172
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,890
And we just get it all out in one night.

173
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,790
And if by the end of it we still like
each other, Then maybe it's the real thing.

174
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,730
That would be bethany.

175
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,530
Well,this is it. The express
train is leaving the station.

176
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,630
- I'm on the train.
- Okay.

177
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,340
Mom's keying your car.

178
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,430
Bethany,this is liz.

179
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,090
- Hi,it's so nice to mee--
- Why does it smell in here?

180
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,060
- Cheese stew.
- I got sick.

181
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,710
Okay,be nice.

182
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,680
I will be right back After
I go talk to your mother.

183
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,100
And... Give me your purse.

184
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,360
Why don't you ever trust me?

185
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,230
Because,honey,you keep
setting fire to things.

186
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,930
And now a prayer For the pregnant
members of our congregation.

187
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,250
Anita alvarez...

188
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,300
Anna alvarez...

189
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,090
Anabel alvarez...

190
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,580
Honey,this is a catholic church.
We'll be here until morning.

191
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,900
All right, you've been good.

192
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,540
Let's go.

193
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,020
We just have to go to
confession before we leave.

194
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,100
Benita alveroz.

195
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,110
Okay,here's how this is gonna go.

196
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,420
We're gonna sit here in
silence For about three minutes,

197
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,580
Then i'm going to take
my girlfriend to plunder,

198
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,400
Where the pope himself
could not get a table.

199
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,670
- You sound troubled,my son.
- Can it,ther.

200
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,380
That was a nice try,though.

201
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,210
That limo ride was weird.

202
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,970
It felt like we just
circled the block 50 times.

203
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,600
That's how you get to
manhattan's fanciest restaurant.

204
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,420
Ah,monsieur parcell.

205
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,620
Votre table est pret.

206
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,650
I didn't know itas french restaurant.

207
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
Yes,i found it on my
favorite web site--

208
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,520
Stopshowingoff.com.

209
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,650
It's busy tonight.

210
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,870
It's the best darn-tootenest
restaurant In all of new york.

211
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,080
This is thbe thank you,kenneth.

212
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,240
You're one in a million.

213
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,830
Man,can you believe we're
working on valentine's night?

214
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,410
My fiancee's gonna be upset.

215
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,730
Not to worry. I sent her
flowers and a beautiful card.

216
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,880
You're the best.

217
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,100
Don't you have faith?

218
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,790
I have faith in things I can
see, And buy,anderegulate.

219
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,120
Capitalism is my religion. Now,you want
to have an intellectual argument? Fine.

220
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,760
But I should warn you,
I went to princeton.

221
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,840
I went to harvard divinity school.

222
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,000
You crimson guys never
miss a chance,do you?

223
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,120
You want a confession?

224
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,350
Let's get this done so I can go eat.

225
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,610
I am divorced.

226
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,940
I take the lord's name in vain
often and with great relish.

227
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,540
I hit my mother with a
car, possibly by accident.

228
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,100
I almost let him choke to death
Right there on the football field.

229
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,760
I looked the other way when my wig-based parent
company Turned a bunch of children orange.

230
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,760
I once claimed, "i am
god" during a position.

231
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,650
And I may have sodomized
our former vice president

232
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,150
While under the influence of
some weapons-grade narcotics.

233
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,140
It feels good to say
that out loud,actually.

234
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,140
That one was weiinon me.

235
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,980
Wow,i,uh...

236
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,290
I don't know what to say.

237
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,720
I don't want you to say anything.

238
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,190
I already made that clear.

239
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,490
Then what... Brought you here tonight?

240
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,890
What brought me here?

241
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,360
What brings anyone anywhere?

242
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,350
Why do men build bridges?
Why are there jets?

243
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,000
I was hoping to have sex tonight.

244
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,670
Have you ever made
love to a woman,father?

245
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,140
Come on,man.

246
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,260
Imagine cradling your face into
the curve Of a velvety-soft neck.

247
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,670
Your hands cupping the warm
heft Of the greatest pair of...

248
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,530
I need backup! Harvard
did not preparme for this.

249
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,920
Father?

250
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,310
I like your bracelets.

251
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,580
Girls at my school get them For
doing different things on the bus.

252
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,040
Blue is for showing your boobs.

253
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,160
Purple's for doing
stuff over your clothes.

254
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,600
- Black is for doing
stuff-- - okay,uh...

255
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,390
Your mom left. How are
you two getting along?

256
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,290
She had some more stew
while you were outside.

257
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,370
- Wow,liz, did u kill the whole bottle?
- What?

258
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,150
Sorry... Hello.

259
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,590
Yes,gloria. Why are you crying?

260
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,410
Gloria? How many ex-wives does he have?

261
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,310
That's my aunt. She'snotgonna like you.

262
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,660
No,of course. I'll be
there as soon as I can.

263
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,380
Yeah. Good-bye.

264
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,570
Mom has taken a turn.

265
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,800
Oh,i'm so sorry.

266
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,950
Look,i know we said that we would take
this In fast motion tonight, but...

267
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,960
No,no,i know.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,640
I really am glad we did, Because I don't
think I could handle this by myself.

269
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,710
Okay.

270
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,600
What? Liz knew.

271
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,660
Entertainment?

272
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,790
Not just any entertainment.

273
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,070
The best singer in the
world-- Michael mcdonald.

274
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,080
Wow,he does not sound good live.

275
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,870

Okay,in english. In english.

284
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,170
You tortured that poor priest.

285
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,510
Let me ask you somhing.

286
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,910
Do you even believe in the
teachings Of the catholic church?

287
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,320
No.

288
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,390
But I saw your photo with the pope.

289
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,060
That's just good business. I
have photos with a lot of people.

290
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,620
The dalai lama,rabbi yosef, Toby keith.

291
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,810
I see.

292
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,000
You have no faith, only business.

293
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,700
You kn wt your problem is,jack?

294
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,010
You intellectualize
everything with your big head.

295
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,150
Well,you have big boobs!

296
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,750
Which you'll never touch again!

297
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,840
This conversation has
taken an unfortunate turn.

298
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,140
Maybe this is god trying to tell
me That we do not belong together.

299
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,130
Maybe this is a sign.

300
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,750
Look,my driver just
pulled up. That's a sign.

301
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,600
God wants us to leave here, get a good
meal, And go to town on each other.

302
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,770
How dare you say something like that
So close to the statue of santa lucia,

303
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,170
The patron saint of judgmental statues?

304
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,580
Go to your stupid restaurant.
Eat your gold ice cream.

305
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,590
Please come with me.

306
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,860
No. You blew it,jack.

307
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,910
And now you will never see
the crazy underwears I have on!

308
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,910
Elisa!

309
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,070
What kind of god would let that happen?

310
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,420
Oh,drew,finally.

311
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,480
- Who's this?
- This is liz. This is our first date.

I was too scared to talk to you,

So my sophisticated friend tracy
Said the things that I couldn't.

Blindest girl i've ever met.

Let's do this again sometime.

358
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,840
Except have it not be
anything like this at all.

365
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,830
And I have a coupon. You
know where I found it?

366
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,470
In the collection plate.

367
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,510
It was a sign.

368
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,380
I followed it,and it
brought us back together.

369
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,850
Now do you believe?

370
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,430
I believe.

371
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,370
I believe that we were reunited By the
most successful capitalist enterprise

372
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
Of the last hundred years,

373
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,970
Despite the mclean deluxe, or the mcemu.

374
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,020
Whatever.

375
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,830
Someone's trying to tell
us that we belong together.

376
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,320
- Maybe it's god.
- Maybe it's ray kroc.

377
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,580
Maybe it's the hamburglar.

378
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,910
Happy valentine's day, querida.

379
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,840
Happysaintvalentine's day, mi amor.

380
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,930
Boy,he that guy's not planning
To kill her and eat her.

381
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,460
Jack,you're such a romantic.
