1
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:03,958
Liz, did you hear?

2
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:05,771
Yeah, is your brother
Gonna be okay?

3
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,295
Oh, no, not that.

4
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:10,346
A new movie about janis joplin

5
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:11,675
Is going into production.

6
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:14,362
And sheinhdt-universal
Is making it.

7
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:16,464
I know jack can get me
An audition.

8
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:19,755
So i'm gonna storm
Into his office in character.

9
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:20,691
Yay!

10
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:23,783
Oh, liz, i knew
You'd be happy for me.

11
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:27,880
- somebody's sleepy.
- i am sleepy.

12
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,964
But i'm also so excited.

13
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:32,705
Hey, max, is this
Your baby sister?

14
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:35,830
Oh, what a cute little girl.

15
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,998
Or boy if you grow up and feel
That's what's inside you.

16
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:43,160
Omg, liz.

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,422
Look at you and me
And our biological clocks.

18
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:46,794
You're going baby crazy

19
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:49,274
And i keep getting turned
On by car accidents.

20
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:51,317
I'm not baby crazy, jenna.

21
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,822
This whole adoption thing

22
00:00:52,822 --> 00:00:54,915
Is just taking a lot longer
Than i thought.

23
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,457
Where did you get
That little shoe?

24
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,429
It isn't stealing
If it fell on the ground.

25
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,240
So, uh, that's the tour,
Elisa.

26
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:10,239
I think you'll find being
My mother's nurse a mixed bag.

27
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:13,640
When she's in a foul mood,
It can be horribly unpleasant.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,550
But at other times,
She is...asleep.

29
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,830
I understand.
Elder care can be stressful.

30
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,099
Uh, especially when
The object of that care

31
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:24,885
Wanders around at night
In depression-era petty pants.

32
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:27,721
You should've seen my
Grandmother in her later years.

33
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,945
Do you know
What kind of clothes

34
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,064
Old puerto rican ladies
Wear around the house?

35
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:31,702
No.

36
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:33,500
Me neither 'cause
She never wore any.

37
00:01:33,617 --> 00:01:35,298
But family is family.

38
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,047
And you're a good son.

39
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,180
Well, i do what i can
For my mother.

40
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:42,471
Jack, somebody's gotta
Dry me off.

41
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:44,959
He just left, mrs. Donaghy.

42
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:47,203
I'm coming to help you.

43
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:56,537
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,113
<font color="#ffff00">30rock s03e07</font>

46
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,808
Tracy, your friends and i
Are concerned about you.

47
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:15,485
We think your spending
Has gotten out of control.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,361
Give me an example.

49
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,080
Well, you bought three hours
Of network primetime

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,574
For your salute to benny hill.

51
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:32,403
Jack, you don't get it.

52
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:34,164
I don't want to spend
So much.

53
00:02:34,264 --> 00:02:35,258
I have to.

54
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:37,091
I'm afraid angie
Will divorce me

55
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,046
If i ever have enough money
For her to live off of half.

56
00:02:40,137 --> 00:02:41,554
So before she can get,

57
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:43,755
I have to spend it all
On useless things

58
00:02:43,755 --> 00:02:46,777
Like gold shoes
And grizz and dotcom.

59
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:49,725
Well, she's not gonna get
Half your money, tracy.

60
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,047
What does your pre-nup say?

61
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,279
I don't got a pre-nup!

62
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:53,813
When angie and i
Got married,

63
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,078
My only assets were

64
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:57,981
A toaster oven and two tickets
To a young mc concert.

65
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,561
You need to be protected.

66
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,691
Let's bring angie in here.

67
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:03,076
We'll think of something.
A post-nup, if you will.

68
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:05,174
Something that will bring you
Peace of mind.

69
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:06,073
Okay.

70
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,829
I'll bring angie in.

71
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,507
But i'm gonna tell her this
Is all your idea.

72
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,929
Don't help me.

73
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,787
I'm too proud.

74
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,903
Hi!

75
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,325
Hiya, bunny!

76
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:32,923
Uh, excuse me.

77
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:34,638
Hello, there.

78
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:36,506
Did you just touch my head?

79
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:37,316
Well...

80
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:40,414
I had to do something
To get your attention.

81
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:42,325
Okay, you've got it.

82
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:43,481
Yeah, i do.

83
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:45,735
I like your tie.

84
00:03:46,022 --> 00:03:48,393
And i li aggressive women
With a nerdy vibe.

85
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:50,849
How about we grab
Some coffee and explore this?

86
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:52,623
Yeah.

87
00:03:53,908 --> 00:03:55,183
What?

88
00:03:58,116 --> 00:04:01,329
Howdy, jack!
It's me, janis joplin!

89
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:06,927
And i want to audition for
My sheinhardt-universal biopic so bad

90
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,126
That i came here
Dressed as me.

91
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,959
Actually, i am me

92
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,235
So, well, i dressed normal.

93
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:16,910
But my friend, jenna

94
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:20,678
She should be my understudy.

95
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:23,325
I mean, she should audition
For me.

96
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,204
But i'm me now actually.

97
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:29,149
I'm going train wreck aside,
I love this idea.

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,659
- it's great synergy.
- yeah.

99
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,073
By putting a tv actress
Into the movie world

100
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:33,960
We can promote both.

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,889
It's like we're including
A heroes dvd

102
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,368
With missile guidance system
We sell.

103
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:40,534
- i'll call the studio.
- yes!

104
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:45,015
I'm so glad that
I time-traveled here from 1969.

105
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:48,200
Whoa, what is that iron bird?

106
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,505
They had airplanes
In the '60s, jenna.

107
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:50,241
Oh, right.

108
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:53,947
Boy, i feel like
I've just been talking nonstop.

109
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:55,349
No, you also ate quite a bit.

110
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,440
It's my fault for wanting
To hear all about your job.

111
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,380
It's just so much more
Interesting than the u.n.

112
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,361
Oh, come on, really?

113
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,698
You got all the different
Languages and the costumes.

114
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:05,104
And that big meeting room.

115
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,114
It must be like working in
The galactic senate in star wars.

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,223
They are similar.

117
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:11,067
We are also very concerned about

118
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:13,110
The growing influence
Of the sith lords.

119
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,037
Wow.

120
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:19,909
Are you free for dinner
Some night this week?

121
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:21,738
Yeah, sure, i'd love it.
Sounds great.

122
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:29,951
Who was that?

123
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:31,449
A guy that i met.

124
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:32,883
Is this part
Of your mommy thing?

125
00:05:32,883 --> 00:05:34,534
Only in so far as we met

126
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,880
Because i touched his head
Thinking he was a child.

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,128
Oh, liz.

128
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:39,839
I like him.
He's smart.

129
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,636
He's funny.
He's got a job.

130
00:05:41,636 --> 00:05:42,588
- yay!
- but you know what?

131
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:43,593
I'm gonna screw this up.

132
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,443
I always find a way
To screw good things up,

133
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:46,862
And this one
Is a mine field.

134
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:48,978
Did i mention that we met
Because i thought he was a baby?

135
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,140
He doesn't have to know that.

136
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:51,491
He can't know that.

137
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:53,069
But what if i say
Something stupid

138
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:56,873
Like order a tall coffee
Or talk about my nintendo wii?

139
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,742
Liz, you like this guy.

140
00:05:58,742 --> 00:05:59,953
You're a grown woman.

141
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,340
Take a lesson from janis
And show some self-control.

142
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:05,644
How far into that biography
Are you?

143
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:06,485
Not very.

144
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:08,296
Why?
What happens?

145
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:09,686
So let me get this straight.

146
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:11,543
If i sign this

147
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:14,850
And then tracy decides to run away
With that chunky chick from hairspray--

148
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,235
Or any female
Of equivalent thickness.

149
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:20,456
Then i get $8,500?

150
00:06:20,456 --> 00:06:21,282
That's correct.

151
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,865
Ugh.

152
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:26,355
What do i care?

153
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,439
I'll sign your stupid contract.

154
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:30,619
Never gonna leave this man
Anyway.

155
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:31,784
You're not?

156
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:32,760
Baby.

157
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,888
I'm gonna be with you
To the very end.

158
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:37,216
I'm gonna watch you die,
Tracy jordan.

159
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,544
She's done it before, jack.

160
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:42,587
Forget it!

161
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,562
I know you're not
Gonna leave me.

162
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:47,259
I got somebody
Who's gonna watch me die!

163
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,891
Tracy, let's not get
Emotional.

164
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:54,431
This is happening, jack.

165
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:55,901
You could stay
Or you could leave,

166
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:57,097
But it's gonna take a while.

167
00:06:57,549 --> 00:06:58,768
Oh, yeah!

168
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,791
Uh, liz, jenna got the lead
In the janis joplin biopic

169
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:06,605
That i'm co-producing.

170
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:07,981
And i want her to open
The next show

171
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:10,009
With a song from the movie.

172
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,300
Aw, come on, jack.

173
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,454
You can't fight synergy, lemon.
It's bigger than all of us.

174
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,145
Nice dress.
Are you going to dinner?

175
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,294
Don't forget your book.

176
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:19,162
I'll have you know that
I'm having dinner with a man.

177
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:23,104
So stuart, what is it like
Living under a bridge?

178
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:23,817
Kenneth!

179
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,427
Hey, liz.

180
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:26,653
I was just telling him about

181
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,192
My new apartment
In williamsburg...

182
00:07:28,395 --> 00:07:29,348
Under the bridge.

183
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,272
The u.n.?

184
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,236
They still have that?

185
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:33,387
I could've sworn
They turned that building

186
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,480
Into a barnes and noble.

187
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:37,016
Like you guys in corporate america
Are doing any better?

188
00:07:37,061 --> 00:07:37,890
Have you learned how to say

189
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,251
"do you want fries
With that" in chinese?

190
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,363
Ha!

191
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,535
Jack donaghy,

192
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:45,456
Ser vp for television
And microwave oven programming.

193
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,275
Stuart lagrange,
U.n. High commission

194
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:49,496
On water temperature and food taint.

195
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,265
And how did you and lemon meet?

196
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:55,637
Uh, liz here just saw me on the street
And went for it.

197
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:56,792
Lemon did that?

198
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,612
Yeah. You know me.

199
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:01,363
Spend my lunch hour
Walkinup and down 6th aven

200
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:02,996
Looking for a hot meal.

201
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,024
Okay.

202
00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:05,623
Classic lemon man-eater.

203
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,214
Cat sound.

204
00:08:08,162 --> 00:08:09,185
Well, nice to meet you, jack.

205
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:09,929
Yeah.

206
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,043
There he is!

207
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:14,459
I owe you, jackie d.

208
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,893
When i'm on my death bed,
Frenching my wife,

209
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,099
I will think of you.

210
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,201
Please don't.

211
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,867
No, no.
Not again.

212
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:23,836
This is real, people!

213
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:25,214
This is not a drill!

214
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:26,261
Let's go!

215
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:27,094
Yeah!

216
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,207
Tracy, my back!

217
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:31,118
Ooh, baby,
Hurt my back.

218
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:33,240
- yeah!
- oh!

219
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:37,341
I just want you all to know

220
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:39,073
As i prepare to venture
Into moviedom,

221
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,137
That an actor is only
As good as the words--

222
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:41,885
Oh, my thing is on.

223
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,372
Everyone shut up.
Shut your mouths.

224
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:47,289
Breaking news now
About a new janis joplin biopic.

225
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,832
Julia roberts has agreed
To play the tragic singer...

226
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:50,672
What?

227
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:52,294
In a film directed
By martin scorse

228
00:08:52,294 --> 00:08:54,918
And written by the best
Screenwriter in the world,

229
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:55,933
Whoever that is.

230
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:58,828
The announcement is a huge blow
To a competing project

231
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:01,196
From jenna moroney
And steven spielberger.

232
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,408
That's right.
Spielberger.

233
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,470
Here's moroney on a windy day.

234
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:08,802
Don't turn it off,
Ms. Moroney.

235
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,945
They haven't shown that good news
You were telling us about.

236
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,438
'Cause that all seemed
Like really bad news.

237
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,284
It's 7:00.

238
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:19,091
Why don't i hear my mother
Yelling "go home"

239
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,057
To the asian contestant
On jeopardy?

240
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,175
'Cause she's asleep.

241
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,841
Really?

242
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:24,671
How did you do that?

243
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,059
She fought me at first,

244
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,572
But i find that authoritative
Rapid spanish subdues white people.

245
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:31,951
Well, i'm heading out
For the evening.

246
00:09:32,432 --> 00:09:33,416
Oh, i forgot.

247
00:09:34,097 --> 00:09:36,014
Somebody dropped that off
For you earlier.

248
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,839
Oh, good god.

249
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,131
Oh, gold shoes.

250
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:44,995
My nephew just joined
The marines

251
00:09:44,995 --> 00:09:46,111
To try to pay for college,

252
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:47,610
But that's fun.

253
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,199
No, no,
They're from tracy jordan.

254
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:51,876
I tried to get him
And his wife to sign a pre-nup,

255
00:09:51,876 --> 00:09:54,676
But all that led to were pledges
Of everlasting love and devotion.

256
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,132
Was ridiculous.

257
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,968
What's ridiculous about love?

258
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,845
Well, the idea of depending
On one person

259
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:01,339
For the rest of your live
Is irrational.

260
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,244
You come in alone,
You go out alone.

261
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:04,993
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

262
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:06,877
There's nothing sad about it
At all, actually.

263
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,293
I have a great life.

264
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:10,543
Tonight i'm going out
With a fox news correspondent.

265
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,362
We'll have some dinner,
Some laughs, some sex.

266
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:13,911
Not necessarily
In that order.

267
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:16,563
But i'm not counting on spending
The rest of my life with her.

268
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:17,567
So what's your plan?

269
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:19,132
Get old, die alone

270
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,315
In an empty room
With your gold shoes?

271
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,026
That's what happens
To most of us.

272
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:24,359
At least i'm prepared.

273
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,110
Without getting
Into specifics,

274
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,842
My exit involves
A mcflurry machine

275
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:30,666
And a video tape of
Risque commercials from overseas.

276
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:32,097
Well, i don't even know
What to say to that.

277
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,775
Except that in puerto rico,

278
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:36,476
A mcflurry, it's called
Asenor flurry.

279
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:41,229
This guy makes badhushas.

280
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,312
They're like an indian donut.
They're amazing.

281
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,220
Careful, buddy, it's hot!

282
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,188
Are you trying to pick me up
To keep me from touching fire?

283
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:53,823
Kiss me.

284
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:54,917
Wait a minute.

285
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:58,031
When you first met me,
Did you think i was a child?

286
00:10:58,031 --> 00:10:58,906
Yes, i did, sir.

287
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:00,498
Unbelievable.

288
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:02,955
I knew i should've listened
To my friends.

289
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,847
Kofi said you were
Too good to be true.

290
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:06,063
Na ah

291
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:07,999
Told me to wait three days
Before i called you.

292
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:08,902
And yet here we are.

293
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:11,452
Was anything even going
To happen between us tonight?

294
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:11,931
No.

295
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:13,781
But not because of your size.

296
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,757
It's because i have a thing
About intimacy.

297
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:17,669
I'm the weird one.
I'm weirder than you.

298
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:19,561
- ??
- you're not.

299
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:20,536
That came out wrong.

300
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:21,791
You came out wrong.

301
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:25,878
Oh, and i lied
About your show.

302
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,892
I have seen it.

303
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:32,478
Be careful crossing the--

304
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,155
The lady will be having
The tasting menu

305
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,719
But with some substitutions.

306
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,483
Instead of any of it,

307
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:42,961
She'll have a cup of hot water
With a chicken bone in it

308
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:44,920
And a bowl of salted ice cubes.

309
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:04,363
A towel, sir?

310
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:08,023
I have something on my ball.

311
00:12:09,777 --> 00:12:10,599
Mint?

312
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:21,705
Good morning.

313
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:23,101
Morning, everyone.

314
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,245
Are you all right?
You look very pale.

315
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:28,412
I'm fine.

316
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:29,787
I had a good hour
Of sleep last night,

317
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:31,065
Took a few showers.

318
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:33,655
There anything you want
To talk about?

319
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:35,520
I am a nurse.

320
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:36,434
It's nothing.

321
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:38,529
It's embarrassing.

322
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,659
More embarrassing
Than your cd collection?

323
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:44,334
I didn't know michael buble
Had so many albums.

324
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,973
If you must know,

325
00:12:46,938 --> 00:12:47,950
I found a lump.

326
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:48,996
On your testicle?

327
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:51,108
Let me see it.

328
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:52,511
No, thank you.

329
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:54,155
I think i have it
Under control.

330
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:56,616
What?

331
00:12:57,906 --> 00:12:59,012
You're talking so fast.

332
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:01,444
Is that the subjunctive?

333
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,483
How did you do

334
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:05,915
I told you i was
A professional.

335
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:08,907
And you forgot
To put on your underpants.

336
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:14,540
So, uh, any big plans
For your day off?

337
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:16,085
I'm going to prospect park.

338
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,599
It's my goddaughter's
Quincenera.

339
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:23,083
Oh, it'sind of like
A debutante...ball.

340
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:24,737
You did that on purpose.

341
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:25,681
I did.

342
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:29,567
Well, there is something there.

343
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,924
Could be a number
Of things.

344
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,751
You should get it
Checked out by a doctor.

345
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:35,018
Thank you for telling me
What i already know.

346
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:36,776
You should work
Forthe huffington post.

347
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:37,742
I'm sorry.

348
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,213
I'm sure you have friends
Or family you can call.

349
00:13:41,213 --> 00:13:41,863
I'm fine.

350
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:43,098
Oh, please.

351
00:13:43,098 --> 00:13:45,157
Don't try
To besenor macho solo.

352
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,333
Which is actually
What we call a mcrib sandwich.

353
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,056
I'm fine.

354
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,712
I'm handling this...

355
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:52,497
All alone.

356
00:13:56,828 --> 00:13:59,527
Jack, what are we doing
About this julia roberts movie?

357
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:00,610
Aren't people over her?

358
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,672
I mean, come on!

359
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:03,380
Jenna, you're single like me.

360
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:06,816
Do you think we need
Some mythical soul mate

361
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:08,430
To hold our hand through life?

362
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,664
Why, do you want
To get married?

363
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:10,260
I'll do it?

364
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,715
- what?
- what?

365
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:13,057
Uh, no.
Uh, never mind.

366
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:14,615
The movie's gonna
Work out fine.

367
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,997
We're very close to securing
Janis joplin's life rights.

368
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:17,578
Close?

369
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,630
I'm supposed to sing
One of her songs friday night.

370
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,040
Do we at least have
The music rights?

371
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:22,579
Uh, yes and no, jenna.

372
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:23,442
Yes, i'm talking.

373
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,986
No, we do not have the music.

374
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:26,424
But i'm on it.
It's all gonna be fine.

375
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:31,862
Hello.

376
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:32,799
Stuart, it's me.

377
00:14:34,862 --> 00:14:36,352
Look, liz,
I'm really busy right now.

378
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:38,725
I just wanted to apologize
For the other night.

379
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:40,530
But i didn't get a chance
To explain myself.

380
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:44,306
I'm...kind of baby crazy
Of late.

381
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,188
Socially inept and baby crazy.

382
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,244
I feel like i'm
In a beer commercial.

383
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,143
Yeah, i get it.
I'm a piece of work.

384
00:14:50,143 --> 00:14:51,764
But i really like you.

385
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,655
And if you gave me
Another chance,

386
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:54,971
Maybe this could be something.

387
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:56,717
Liz, at this point
In my life,

388
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,732
Maybe just isn't good enough.

389
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:00,876
Okay, here's a thought.

390
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,493
Did you see
Thesex in the citymovie?

391
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:04,422
Once again, liz,
I am an adult man.

392
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:06,715
Okay, well miranda and steve
Were having issues

393
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:07,929
Because steve cheated--

394
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:09,070
Oh, so bored.

395
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,343
The point is they decided
To take a break

396
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,467
And then meet up
At the brooklyn bridge

397
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,026
At such and such a time
If they wanted to stay together.

398
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,799
Maybe we could do
The same thing.

399
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:20,178
Brooklyn bridge,
This saturday, 2:00 p.m.

400
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:22,014
Okay.

401
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:23,546
But for whatever reason,

402
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:24,625
If i don't see you there,

403
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,195
Take care, liz lemon.

404
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:28,190
You too.

405
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,156
Oh, and can you transfer me
To the italian ambassador's office?

406
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:33,312
Because i lika to maka
Prank phone call.

407
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:35,280
Please hold.

408
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,676
Jack.

409
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,632
What are you doing here?

410
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,177
I wanted to come by
And thank you for all your help.

411
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:56,878
I wasn't sure what
You were serving,

412
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,622
So i brought a '65 moet
And some pizza-blasted pringles.

413
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:01,943
That was very thoughtful.

414
00:16:02,173 --> 00:16:03,904
I'm sorry if i was rude
The other day.

415
00:16:04,309 --> 00:16:05,603
Oh, you were not being rude.

416
00:16:05,603 --> 00:16:07,126
You were just being stupid.

417
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,740
Did you go to the doctor?

418
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:10,110
I had a biopsy,

419
00:16:10,315 --> 00:16:11,738
And i'm waiting
For the results.

420
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:12,667
So i'm handling it.

421
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:14,149
Good.
I'm glad.

422
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,857
Excellent.
So, uh, here you go.

423
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:17,806
Thank you.

424
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,530
Jack, would you like
To stay?

425
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,557
Oh, i don't want
To impose.

426
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:24,634
Oh, come on.

427
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:27,053
Oh, thank you.
Okay.

428
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:28,430
Oh, thank you so much.

429
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,368
All of these people
Are your family?

430
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:31,720
Why are they smiling so much?

431
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,936
Who's being ostracized?

432
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:35,137
Everybody, this is
My friend jack.

433
00:16:35,844 --> 00:16:38,407
<font color="#ffff00">???</font>

434
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,271
<font color="#ffff00">??</font>

435
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:41,643
<font color="#ffff00">????</font>

436
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,988
I need to ask your advice
About stuart.

437
00:16:52,988 --> 00:16:56,065
We decided to do this whole
Meet me at the brooklyn bridge

438
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,295
If we still want
To be together thing

439
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:58,620
From thesex in the city
Movie.

440
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,076
They do that a lot in movies.

441
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:01,591
An affair to rember,

442
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:03,247
Sleepless in seattle,

443
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,431
And that remake of
An affair to rember that i was in,

444
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,528
A blaffair to rememblack.

445
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:10,495
I just don't know
What to do.

446
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,334
Here's what you don't do.

447
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:13,518
Be alone.

448
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:15,626
We were never meant
To be alone, lemon.

449
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:17,910
Surround yourself
With people and love

450
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,927
And babies
With pierced ears.

451
00:17:20,614 --> 00:17:21,331
What is wrong with you?

452
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,141
I've had a crazy 48 hours.

453
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,366
It all started when
I realized i'm probably dying.

454
00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:26,969
You see, i have this thing
On my testicle.

455
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:28,514
- ew, my god.
- no, no, it's okay.

456
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,504
Whatever happens,
It's okay.

457
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:31,738
I don't want to die alone
And now i don't have to

458
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:32,896
Because...

459
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:37,012
I'm in love
With my mother's nurse.

460
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,269
Now you have what
Me and angie have,

461
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:41,645
Minus the hypertension.

462
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,831
Jack, slow down.
Have you been to a doctor?

463
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,282
I'm waiting for
The results of a biopsy.

464
00:17:45,282 --> 00:17:46,373
We went to this picnic.

465
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:48,251
Lemon, have you ever had
Apiragua?

466
00:17:48,385 --> 00:17:51,425
It's exactly like a snow cone
Except they call it apiragua.

467
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:55,490
It's my doctor's office.

468
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,029
- you take it.
- no, jack.

469
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,437
I'll do it

470
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:03,376
Hello?

471
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:04,713
Yes.

472
00:18:05,408 --> 00:18:06,042
Okay.

473
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:07,787
Thank you.

474
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,924
The test was positive.

475
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:12,614
No, no, no, no--

476
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,750
I mean positive
Like it's good.

477
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,752
The test results
Were negative.

478
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,043
Oh, i see your confusion.

479
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:21,409
That is funny!

480
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:26,173
- okay.
- funny!

481
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,705
Jack thought the test results
Was positive!

482
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,444
Supersonic idiotic

483
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,740
Disconnected not respected

484
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,676
Who would ever really want
To go and top that

485
00:18:34,676 --> 00:18:35,523
Top that

486
00:18:37,373 --> 00:18:38,027
Thank you.

487
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:41,206
That was the rap song"top that"
From the movieteen witch.

488
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:44,267
Once again, i apologize
That our regular warm-up comic

489
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,215
O.d.ed at a gay man's
Apartment this morning.

490
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,342
30 seconds.

491
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,592
I've decid to go
To the bridge tomorrow.

492
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:52,982
You've inspired me.

493
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,727
What if this experience
Hasn't changed me?

494
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:58,117
Maybe everything
I was feeling for elisa

495
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,983
Was just neediness
And fear.

496
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:04,935
I mean, can two people fall in love
Over a benign gonad cyst?

497
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,696
Why not?

498
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:06,886
It's not about
Where things start.

499
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:08,097
It's about where it goes.

500
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,258
Tracy told me that.

501
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:10,540
He's kind of on a roll.

502
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:11,721
Ladies and gentlemen,

503
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,709
Miss janet jopler!

504
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:15,046
Who?

505
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:16,316
Until we get the life rights,

506
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:17,572
We have to
Protect ourselves.

507
00:19:18,178 --> 00:19:19,975
I'd like you to come on

508
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:21,533
Come on

509
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:24,791
Come on and take it

510
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,834
Take another little chunk
Of my lung now, mister

511
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:31,261
Also, we didn't get the songs.

512
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,790
I wrote this myself
Five minutes ago.

513
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:34,980
You know you bought it

514
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,632
If life makes you
Sweet food

515
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:40,138
Now this i like.

516
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:50,059
Waiting for someone?

517
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:51,134
What?

518
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:52,325
What do you think
You're doing?

519
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,321
Oh, i'm so sorry!

520
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:54,581
I thought he was someone else.

521
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:58,969
Liz.

522
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:00,252
Wh--

523
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,900
Shut it down!

524
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:18,547
Chunk of my lung

525
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:20,204
Chunk of my lung

526
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,862
And take it

527
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:25,762
Take a big ol' chunk
Of my lung now baby

528
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,744
Take it

529
00:20:27,744 --> 00:20:29,967
Take a big old chunk
Of my lung

530
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,716
Chunk of my lung

531
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:35,166
You know you bought it

532
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:37,795
If you buy it with things

533
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:39,912
