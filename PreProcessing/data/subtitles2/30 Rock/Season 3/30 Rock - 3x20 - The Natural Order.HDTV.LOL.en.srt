- How late is Tracy now?
- 2 1/2 hours.

3
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:08,606
[buzzes]
This is outrageous.

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,891
Especially after I was told
I can't leave during the day

5
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:13,994
For my ridiculous anger
management stupid piece of crap!

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,404
How did this happen?

7
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:18,245
I had Grizz call him
at 8:00 this morning

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,101
and pretend it was 11:00.

9
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:20,944
I printed up that fake
rehearsal schedule for him,

10
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,531
Saying we were starting
at 9:00 instead of noon.

11
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:24,057
Oh, and I set all his
watches and clocks

12
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:27,285
- to say P.M. when it's really A.M.
- Oh, boy. We may have overdone it.


13
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:29,001
What the hell time
is it?

14
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:31,013
Hey, you're here!
Let's rehearse!

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,601
No! I took my son to his
cello recital this morning

16
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:37,297
at what turned out to be
midnight yesterday!

17
00:00:37,332 --> 00:00:39,177
White oppressors,
answer my question.

18
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:40,744
<b>What time is it, really?</b>

19
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:43,114
- 2:45 P.M.
- You're a bunch of racists.

20
00:00:43,183 --> 00:00:45,082
What? How did we jump
to that already?

21
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:48,119
You treat me like a child!
No--worse than that!

22
00:00:48,154 --> 00:00:50,553
You treat me like one of those
little pageant girls

23
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:52,013
with the clip-on teeth.

24
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:55,423
No, no, Oprah says that you
teach people how to treat you,

25
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:57,689
and this is what you've taught us,
because you're always late

26
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,728
And you take no responsibility
for your actions.

27
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,028
Irregardless!

28
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:02,629
You know what?
Race card.

29
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:05,431
No, don't accept it!

30
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,226
Hey, Jack,
just a heads-up.

31
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:11,249
Tracy knows what time it is.

32
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:12,568
- Damn it.
- Sir.

33
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,203
Your mother would like to have
breakfast with you

34
00:01:14,272 --> 00:01:15,737
At the hotel tomorrow,

35
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,705
And she had me make dinner
reservations for tonight.

36
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:20,441
And by night,
I mean 4:30 this afternoon.

37
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,842
Colleen's in town?

38
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,211
If you need a break,
I'd be happy to take her out.

39
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:26,679
There's a restaurant hostess
in midtown I'd like to see cry.

40
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,113
Thank you, but I need to be
the attentive son this visit.

41
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:31,582
This Thursday marks
an anniversary for my mother,

42
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,249
An unpleasant one.

43
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:35,284
35 years ago, my father,
Jimmy Donaghy,

44
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:37,018
Went out for a pack
of cigarettes,

45
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:38,853
Came back, smoked one,

46
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:40,353
Told my mother
he was leaving forever,

47
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:41,756
And walked out the door.

48
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:44,558
Oh, boy, that must be hard...
For both of you.

49
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,225
He treated her like dirt
all those years,

50
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:48,526
Coming and going,
taking up with other women,

51
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:50,595
Including more than one
Unitarian!

52
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:51,894
Every time he came back,

53
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:53,698
I promised myself
I would tell him off.

54
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,232
I had my speech all planned.

55
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,133
But I always chickened out.

56
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,601
It's the biggest regret
of my life, Lemon...

57
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,603
And I once made love
to Kathy Hilton.

58
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:04,206
Do you...Want a hug?

59
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:05,906
What is this,
the Italian parliament?

60
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:07,440
No, thank you, Lemon.

61
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,243
Well, you're a good son.
I know she's not easy.

62
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,144
Sir, your mother had me
move her from the plaza

63
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,944
To the Carlyle.

64
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,814
Evidently, the concierge
at the plaza

65
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:20,017
"has a beard," and she'd
rather not get raped.

66
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,588
Please,
tell me we've started.

67
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:26,756
Yes, actually, we're on
our second run-through.

[buzz]

Tracy hasn't come back yet,

70
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,662
But he did sent a gibbon
to rehearse in his place.

71
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,031
[laughs]
he's pretty good.

Did you guys know about this?

74
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:41,102
Tracy has asked us
to read this prepared statement.

75
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:43,941
- "Dear racist Liz Lemon..."
- oh!

Which of these five
cell numbers he answers,

83
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,589
But you get
Tracy down here right now.

84
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,825
Why? The gibbon is on time,
he knows his blocking,

85
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:05,327
And he doesn't try
to bite the dancers!

86
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,332
I think
I've proven my point.

87

Oh, my god!

88
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,738

have time for you

91
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:21,275
Tracy, it costs the show
a lot of money

92
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,579
When you pull
these shenanigans.

93
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:26,982
Don't patronize me with your
Celtic slang, Liz Lemon.

94
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:28,617
We have
a black president now.

What do you care?
You voted for Nader!

96
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,487
This is post-racial America,

97
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:35,257
And I demand to be treated
like everyone else.

98
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:36,291
You wanna be treated
like everybody else?

99
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:37,725
Fantastic.

100
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:40,661
Then tomorrow, I'm sending
a regular town car for you

101
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,529
Instead of one of those
duck tour boats.

102
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:44,063
Fine.

103
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,931
And you're no longer allowed
to point at women

104

In the cafeteria and yell,
"I wanna get that pregnant!"

105
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,537
Fine, I'll bring
my lunch from home.

10:00 A.M. And know your lines.

We'll find out tomorrow
at 10:00 A.M.

00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,427
{\pos(200,220)}Ah. Another day done.

157
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,063
{\pos(200,220)}Now let's get outta here

158
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:12,635
{\pos(200,220)}Before we realize
we've forgotten about something.

159
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:21,609
{\pos(200,220)}I feel like
we're half-assing this.

160
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,878
{\pos(200,220)}Oh, I didn't know
anyone was here.

161
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:24,748
That wasn't me
screaming in the bathroom.

162
00:06:24,815 --> 00:06:26,249
What are you doing with him?

163
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,251
Oh, Mr. Jordan says
he doesn't need it anymore.

164
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,819
So you're just
letting him go?

165
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,423
Well, don't worry.

166
00:06:31,488 --> 00:06:33,023
Once it tries to mate
with a child,

167
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,058
I'm sure animal control
will just shoot it.

168
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:37,594
{\pos(200,220)}No! He's not an animal.
Look at him!

169
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,762
He's a little person!

170
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,597
[giggling]

171
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,466
Oh, he loves me!

172
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,901
Somebody loves me.

173
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,105
{\pos(200,220)}I'm gonna name him
little Jenna

174
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:50,675
And let him live
in my dressing room.

175
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,116
Lemon, Colleen brought
her boyfriend.

176
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,484
His name is Paul.

177
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,485
- What? Really?
- I don't like this guy.

178
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:03,687
I don't trust him.

179
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,555
I mean, he's four years
younger than my mother.

180
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,090
He wears a pinkie ring.

181
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:09,694
When the waiter brought over
the food, he said, "abbondanza."

182
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,496
Okay, Jack, I know
this is a stressful time

183
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:13,264
For you and your mother...

184
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,865
You're right--I don't like
the timing of this at all.

185
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:16,567
Colleen is very
vulnerable right now,

186
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,103
And scam artists
can smell that sort of thing.

187
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,638
Have you ever
been to Florida?

188
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,206
It's basically
a criminal population.

189
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:22,473
It's America's Australia.

190
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,508
Come on,
maybe he just likes her.

191
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,645
You know, some men
like older women.

192
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,479
Let's...Not make this
about you, okay?

193
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:32,618
I've gotta call
my private investigator.

194
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,187
Liz, they want you
onstage for rehearsal.

195
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,122
- Tracy's here already?
- I guess so.

196
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,390
You know, this food area

197
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,558
Is always the first place
I go to look for you...

198
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,595
Thank you, Cerie.

199
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,232
Tracy, you're here already.

200
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,135
Professional
is my middle name.

201
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:53,871
No need.
I've got it memorized.

202
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:57,476
I'm going to do
a Valentino cross,

203
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,711
Camera right,
then dump the laugh.

204
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,714
So stay on your fours,
guys!

205
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,485
One, two, three,
jump and pose!

206
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,220
3:15.
Time for union break.

207
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:10,123
[applause]

208
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,426
Thank you, Tracy!
That is so great for morale.

209
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,094
Listen, about yesterday...

210
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,762
No. Do not apologize.

211
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,197
In fact...
Everyone gather around.

212
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,833
Actor announcement.

213
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,201
I want to publicly thank you,
Liz Lemon,

214
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,505
For you have shown me
that in today's world

215
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,807
Everyone should be treated
exactly the same.

216
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,544
No one should get
preferential treatment.

217
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,679
I agree.
Exactly.

218
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,947
Not black comedy superstars.
Not Hispanics.

219
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,317
Not Indians.
Not whatever this guy is.

220
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,186
And not women, Liz Lemon.

221
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,388
I'm right there
with you, Tracy.

222
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:47,458
Good. I feel parched
from being so professional.

223
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,327
Could I trouble you
for some water?

224
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,395
Yeah, of course.

225
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,735
Brian, would you
help me out with this?

226
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:00,537
No! No!

227
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,838
- Equality.
- What?

228
00:09:02,906 --> 00:09:05,474
Everyone should be treated
the same, right, Liz Lemon?

229
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,709
You should change it.

230
00:09:07,776 --> 00:09:11,548
Yeah, okay.
I know how to do this.

231
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,095
No one help her!

232
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,404
I got it.
That's good.

233
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:37,474
Just gotta get my hammies
in the handles so I...

234
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,414
Hold on.

235
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,650
Oof!

236
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,827
[panting]

237
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,702
All right!

238
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,371
Let's...Take it
from the top.

239
00:10:12,848 --> 00:10:14,981
[clicking]

240
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,985
Hello, Len.

241
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:21,489
Oh. Thanks for meeting me
here, Mr. Donaghy.

242
00:10:21,556 --> 00:10:24,723
You, uh...Staking out
a cheating husband?

243
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,226
No. I'm taking
a photography class.

244
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,396
Look at the way the sunlight
hits that cobweb.

245
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,596
[clicking]

246
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,066
So, uh, what have you
got for me?

247
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,633
Well, I looked into
this Paul Brett guy,

248
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,068
And I gotta tell you,

249
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,403
This is the weirdest case
I've ever worked.

250
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,107
I knew it.
What is he, a check forger?

251
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:42,508
Real estate swindler?
Bird owner?

252
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:44,043
- No, he's clean.
- What?

253
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,578
I've never seen
anything like it.

254
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,447
Everyone's
got something to hide.

255
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,416
For instance, I'm wearing
a child's Halloween costume

256
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,650
Under this.

257
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,519
But this guy...
no priors, no debts.

258
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,822
He's been married to his wife
Louise for 35 years.

259
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,757
- He's married?
- Yeah.

260
00:10:57,826 --> 00:10:59,859
I wish I had more
to give you.

261
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,962
But this Paul Brett guy,
he's, uh...

262
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,697
He's like a boy scout.

263
00:11:03,765 --> 00:11:05,699
I'm sorry, Mr. Donaghy.

264
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:14,844
Miss Maroney, I have
the ukulele you asked for.

265
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:16,145
Oh, it's not for me.

266
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:19,147
Someone's in a little
mariachi band today.

267
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,850
Ma'am, this is a wild animal.

268
00:11:20,917 --> 00:11:22,452
You can't treat it
like a person.

269
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,719
No, he's happy.

270
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:25,520
His costume
is hiding his erection.

271
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:27,288
Well, as a child,
I had a prize pig

272
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:29,058
That I thought
was my best friend.

273
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:32,027
But then one day,
I picked up one of her piglets.

274
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:34,162
She went crazy!

275
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,031
She bit off my nut sack

276
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:39,001
That I kept tied around
my belt to feed squirrels.

277
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:42,136
Please be careful,
Miss Maroney.

278
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,042
Tracy did that thing
with the water on purpose.

279
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,978
Grizz and Dotcom warned me
he would act out.

280
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:52,480
Look, if Tracy's revenge plan

281
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,416
Involves him
being good at his job,

282
00:11:54,484 --> 00:11:57,386
You might have
to just take it.

283
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:01,456
Hello, Liz Lemon.

284
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,059
I was just
telling these fellas

285
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:05,460
About how you don't wanna be
treated any differently

286
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:07,595
Because you're a woman.

287
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:09,198
Well, thank you.
Of course I don't.

288
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:11,232
Really. You don't want us
to hold back anymore.

289
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm sorry--were you guys
holding back something?

290
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:15,535
Our farts,
to start with.

291
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,573
Also, we didn't invite you
to Lutz's fake bachelor party.

292
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,041
Lutz's what?

293
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:21,476
I realize I'm never
getting married

294
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:22,710
Because of my gland thing...

295
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,878
But I wanna have
a bachelor party.

296
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:26,580
Well, you should have
invited me.

297
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:28,816
It's not fair...
That you didn't.

298
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:30,718
We're goin'
to a strip club.

299
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:34,288
I'm glad that we're having
this conversation,

300
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,423
Because we live in a world

301
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,191
Where a lot of
the old divisions

302
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,127
Are starting to disappear.

303
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,596
And I hope to have
a daughter someday,

304
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,865
And I want her to...

305
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,499
Aghh. Oh, god,
what is that smell?

306
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,634
Oh, dear lord, frank!

307
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:51,439
It's like orange-flavored egg!
It's in my mouth!

308
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:53,308
Good. We're learning.

309
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,942
This next one's me.

310
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:03,249
Ohh!

311
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:58,830
{ Advertisement }

312
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,385
Hey, Jack,
do you treat me any differently

313
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,755
Because I'm a woman?

314
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:11,758
Well, I pay you
a little less, yes.

315
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:12,992
No, I mean day-to-day.

316
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,829
- Do you coddle me?
- In some ways.

317
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:16,764
With a man,
I can be more direct,

318
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,699
But with you, uh,
I have to have a conversation,

319
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,367
Talk things through more.

320
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,035
Gimme an example.

321
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:26,539
Well, uh...
Right now comes to mind.

322
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:28,840
Are we through listening
and sharing,

323
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,243
Because I have something
I want you to look at.

324
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,746
It's a marriage certificate.

325
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,712
It's Paul's
marriage certificate.

326
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,181
My mother's boyfriend.

327
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,150
- He's married.
- What?

328
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,221
I knew I was right.
That guy is shady!

329
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,556
Oh, my god.
Have you told Colleen?

330
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:44,722
No Colleen.

331
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,290
I have an opportunity here,
Lemon,

332
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,760
A chance to go back
to the past to put things right

333
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,895
That once went wrong.

334
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:52,930
<b>That's the quantum leap
intro.</b>

335
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:54,231
Be that as it may,

336
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:56,935
I'm finally going
to stand up for Colleen.

337
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,971
The small part of her
that is still human deserves it.

338
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,739
I'll see Paul,

339
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,176
And I'll give him the speech
I wrote for Jimmy Donaghy.

340
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,778
- Paul's not your dad, Jack.
- But Paul's here.

341
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,247
And he's taking advantage
of my mother.

342
00:14:09,314 --> 00:14:11,615
Now, what I originally
wrote for my father

343
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:12,815
May be dated.

344
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:15,585
Who would be our current
Nikita Khrushchev?

345
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:16,855
Mm...Simon Cowell?

346
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:17,987
[gasps]

347
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,789
Now you're standing
on the very spot

348
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:22,692
Where Gracie Allen
took Jack Paar's virginity.

349
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,826
I thought I heard a tour.

350
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:25,628
Boy, people
are not gonna believe

351
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,130
<i>That you saw this.</i>

352
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,433
- So take a lot of pictures.
- Miss Maroney.

353
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,536
No good will come of this.
This is unnatural.

354
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:36,038
It is unnatural...For
a grandmother to look this good!

355
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:37,974
Little Jenna
had a baby last night.

356
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,841
Crowd: Ooh!

357
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:41,243
Thank you.

358
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:49,485
Good job
with the water, Liz.

359
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,887
Ow, frank!
What the hell?

360
00:14:51,954 --> 00:14:53,688
What? I'm trying
to treat you like one of us.

361
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:55,893
Hello, Elizabeth.

362
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,895
Tracy, shouldn't you be
working down on stage?

363
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:02,165
I'm done with my work.
I was very professional.

364
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:03,697
Hmm. That must have been
hard for you.

365
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:05,266
It was.

366
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:08,468
All right, Tracy's here.
Let's do this bachelor party.

367
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:10,837
- Yeah!
- You coming, Liz Lemon?

368
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,305
Because a dude boss
would be a jerk

369
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:14,641
If he didn't come
to Lutz's bachelor party.

370
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,877
Also a dude boss
would pay for it.

371
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:23,381
Yeah, I'm coming.
Of course I'm coming.

372
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,084
- But you're not.
- Twist!

373
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:27,752
You have to stay here.

374
00:15:27,821 --> 00:15:30,255
I haven't gotten your notes
on the rewrite,

375
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:32,758
And your input
is invaluable to the process...

376
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:35,528
Since we're all equal now.

377
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:39,832
Let's go see some naked
daughters and moms!

378
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,501
- All right!
- Whoo hoo!

379
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:44,070
[indistinct cheering]

380
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,442
Oh. Hello, Jack.

381
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:52,612
I'm sorry.
Your mom's out shopping.

382
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,813
I know.

383
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:55,348
My credit card company
called to confirm

384
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,618
<b>My purchase of a book entitled
intercourse after hip surgery.</b>

385
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:03,358
Well...Why don't you
come on in?

386
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:06,061
I'm just watching
the hotel channel.

387
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,099
You can check out
on the TV.

388
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,035
I bet you can,
you son of a bitch.

389
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,536
I beg your pardon?

390
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,104
I am tired of watching you
treat my mother like this.

391
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:16,939
I am not afraid of you.
You're just a big bully.

392
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,142
Like Simon Cowell.
That's right.

393
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,944
I just called you
a communist.

394
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,946
I want you out
of our lives forever,

395
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:25,115
[door opens]
and I want you to know

396
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:26,316
That I am never
going to be

397
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,318
Anything like you
when I grow up.

398
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,955
What in god's name
is going on here?

399
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:34,728
Paul is leaving, mother.
And I think you should know why.

400
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,994
He's married.

401
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,963
Oh, my...

402
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,467
I know that!

403
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,233
[sighs] Paul...

404
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,935
Find something to do
in the bathroom.

405
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,105
I have to talk to my son.

406
00:16:45,173 --> 00:16:48,040
Okay.

407
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:49,275
Shoot.

408
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,943
You knew?

409
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,945
It's Florida, Jack!

410
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:56,515
It's like it never stopped
being the '70s down there.

411
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,452
And a guy like Paul,
who can drive at night,

412
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
You just don't say no
to that!

413
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,822
Well, I apologize then.

414
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,990
I thought we were going
to get through this together.

415
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,994
I guess your coping mechanism

416
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,462
Is to bring a married man
back to your hotel room!

417
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,697
Coping?

418
00:17:10,765 --> 00:17:13,133
What am I supposed
to be coping with?

419
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,403
It's the 35th anniversary
of dad leaving!

420
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,839
Which time, Jack?

421
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,876
That man left and came back
so many times

422
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,678
That I totally lost count!

423
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:26,750
One night,
he went out to move the car,

424
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,149
And he was gone...

425
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:31,085
From the spring of '57
until...

426
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:34,021
One night he just
showed up out of the blue!

427
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:35,490
"put your shoes on, Collie.

428
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:37,392
<i>We're goin' to see
some like it hot."</i>

429
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:42,495
You honestly don't remember
when he left for good,

430
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:45,366
Because I sure as hell do.

431
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:48,370
Oh, my god.
Is that what this is all about?

432
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:52,006
Is that what you've been
holding onto all these years?

433
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:56,544
Jack, stop wasting your time
thinking about that man!

434
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:58,246
You're nothing like him,
you know.

435
00:17:58,314 --> 00:18:00,182
No way you ever could be.

436
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,384
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

437
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:04,753
I'm old, Jack, you know?

438
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:07,622
And I don't know what I'm
thinking about half the time.

439
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,592
I do know this:

440
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,596
You're my good boy.

441
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:16,964
[voice breaking]
I just love ya to death.

442
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,870
Thank you, mother.
And I love you too.

443
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:24,540
Paul!

444
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,540
You're on your own tonight.

445
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,609
I have a date with my son.

446
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,044
He's taking me out
to a late dinner.

447
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:33,013
It's, uh, 6:00.

448
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:37,652
Whoops!

449
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:42,357
Say you like my body.

450
00:18:47,964 --> 00:18:49,264
[crying]
I don't wanna be here!

451
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,034
I don't like it here!
Who's this guy?

452
00:18:52,101 --> 00:18:53,502
[sobbing]

453
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,441
Okay, which one of us
is gonna give up first?

454
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:00,075
The black one.
I can't take it anymore!

455
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:01,411
I hate it!

456
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:03,278
One of those strippers
took of Lutz's shirt.

457
00:19:03,346 --> 00:19:04,680
That gland thing
is no joke!

458
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:06,950
Everything is upside down!

459
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,351
We need to go back
to the way things were

460
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,553
With both of us getting
preferential treatment.

461
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:12,454
Yes. We upset
the natural order.

462
00:19:12,522 --> 00:19:15,423
You're going to strip clubs.
I'm up writing all night.

463
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,593
Look who's a sailor!

464
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:19,394
We're dressing monkeys up
as people,

465
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,764
And monkeys are playing
with people as toys!

466
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:23,399
It's not a toy, Tracy.

467
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:26,467
Little Jenna thinks
that this is her baby.

468
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:28,404
[screeching]

469
00:19:28,472 --> 00:19:31,141
- Oh, no!
- You said you loved me!

470
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,908
Your foot fingers
are so strong!

471
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:34,711
We don't wanna end up
like those two.

472
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:38,880
You're so right.
[Jenna laughing]

473
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:40,283
We're okay!

474
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:41,918
He's just expressing himself!

475
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:43,453
[monkey chittering]

476
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:47,557
Hey, before you hear crazy
rumors and start believing them,

477
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:49,459
The gibbon did not
attack Jenna.

478
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,560
He was trying to mate
with her face.

479
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:54,063
- What?
- Nothing. Everyone's fine.

480
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:56,766
<i>Hey! Some like it hot.
I love this movie.</i>

481
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,601
My mother told me
she and my dad

482
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:00,903
Went to see it together,

483
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,138
And if that's the stuff
she remembers,

484
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:04,273
Maybe that's how
I should remember him too...

485
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:07,744
On a date with my mom
instead of walking out the door.

486
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:10,846
1959. Boy, it would have
been fun to write back then.

487
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:13,449
You could get away
with crazy plot twists

488
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,818
Because audiences were
so much less sophisticated.

489
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,086
Wait a minute.

490
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:19,955
This movie
came out in 1959?

491
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,392
How could my father
have been gone

492
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:25,494
From the spring of '57
until 1959

493
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:29,531
If I was conceived in '58...

494
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,167
Jimmy Donaghy's not my father.

495
00:20:33,236 --> 00:20:34,569
[gasps]
Twist!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
