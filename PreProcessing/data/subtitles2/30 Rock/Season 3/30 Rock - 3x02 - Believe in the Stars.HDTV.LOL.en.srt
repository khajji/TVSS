1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,510
Uh, is this important?

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,880
It'll just take a second.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,190
Fine, but Mr. Donaghy is on another call right now and
doesn't have time for a separate interaction with you.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,180
So everything he says will have
to work for both conversations.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,460
- Really?
- Lemon.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,580
Lemon works for your business call?

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,650
Oh, right, well, I just wanted to let you know
that I have to go to Chicago for jury duty

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,010
because I never changed
my residence to New York.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,720
Why not?

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,060
Because I wanted to vote
in a swing state, Jack.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,890
Also, I want to stay on the mailing
list at Chicago Pizza Explosion.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,970
How fast can you turn it around?

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,910
Who, me? Oh, right. I'll
fly back in the morning.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,270
I never get put in a jury.

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,930
I wear my Princess Leia costume,
and they dismiss me immediately.

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,070
Well, that sounds good for both
of us. Thank you very much, sir.

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,770
That last part didn't work
both ways. You said sir.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,660
I think it worked fine. I'll have Jonathan
call travel and upgrade your flight.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,430
Sweet.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
What do you take to fly?

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,380
Candy and magazines.

22
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,850
No, no, no. Pills.

23
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,150
Nobody flies without medication anymore.

24
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,520
Why shouldn't you enjoy
the same luxuries as a dog?

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,310
Comana it may cause dizziness, sexual
nightmares, and sleep crime.

26
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,370
It's... Very good.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,850
Tyler Brody on two, sir.

28
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,880
Tyler Brody? The dude from the olympics?

29
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,160
Yes, he was the silver
medalist in tetherball.

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,150
Speedman's caught an angle.
Tyler Brody is flailing.

31
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,240
And there's the coil.

32
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,480
Lance Speedman is the
olympic tetherball champion.

33
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,900
And Tyler Brody can't believe it.

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,660
Boy, there sure are a lot of
weird olympic events these days.

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,710
Not that weird, lemon.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,230
Tetherball we faked.

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,300
What? Why would you
fake an olympic event?

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,420
For ratings.

39
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,160
We staged several events so that
americans could win more medals.

40
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,420
That's despicable.

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,570
It took years of planning, and now Tyler Brody
is threatening to go public and ruin everything.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,970
So, obviously, I have a lot on my plate
and no time to babysit the sixth flo,

43
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,580
so before you go gallivanting off to Chicago,
make sure you get your people under control.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,170
- Be a manager.
- Yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,230
Liz, Tracy is countersuing me.

46
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,110
- Good morning.
- For defamation of character.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,180
Who's been arrested in three
different Chuck E. Cheese's?

48
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,320
Do y'all know who I am?

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,270
Seriously. Please, tell me who I am.

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,190
Jenna, I'm not taking sides
in this lawsuit thing.

51
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,230
It's ridiculous.

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,230
Tracy's video game never would
have worked without my voice acting.

53
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,670
I deserve to get paid.

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,240
Liz Lemon! Nemesis.

55
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,990
Liz, will you tell Tracy I don't
even want to speak with him.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,140
Okay, two can play at that game.

57
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,560
Liz, could you please tell
Kenneth that Liz wants him?

58
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,470
That's not even--
okay, that's it.

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,720
I am calling human resources and
setting up a mediation for you.

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,820
I told you. I don't
drink that much at work.

61
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,220
Mediation is a binding form of
non-judicial dispute resolution.

62
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,770
I watched Boston Legal nine times
before I realized it wasn't a new Star Trek.

63
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,640
Liz, you have to admit this is unfair.

64
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,620
I got nothing.

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,060
Meanwhile, Grizz and
Dotcom bought a boat.

66
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,020
Cape Hatteras is lovely
this time of year.

67
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,400
Oh, well, of course, Tracy takes
care of his boys and not you.

68
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,260
He thinks he can take advantage
of you because you're a woman.

69
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,180
Men think they can
get away with anything.

70
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,040
It's like when Adrien Brody
kissed Halle Berry at the Oscars.

71
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,800
No one has it harder in this
country today than women.

72
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,850
It turns out we can't be president, we can't be
network news anchors, Madonna's arms look crazy.

73
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,900
Tyler, I know you're upset we didn't pick you
for the gold, and I'm going to make it up to you.

74
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,750
How would you like to host Deal or No Deal 
in the privacy of your own home?

75
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,220
I think I'll hold a
press conference instead,

76
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,100
tell the world there's no such
thing as olympic tetherball...

77
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,560
or synchronized running...

78
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,330
or octuples tennis.

79
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,610
It's all a lie.

80
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,710
A white lie that did a lot of
good for this country's morale.

81
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,730
Did you know that President Bush's approval rating
was almost as high as 15% following the olympics?

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,220
Gasp. Olympic hero Tyler Brody.

83
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,690
Olympic fraud.

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,680
There is no such thing
as olympic tetherball.

85
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,630
They made it all up for the ratings.

86
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,740
What are you saying?

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,580
Tyler...

88
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,570
You can be the voice of Knight Rider.

89
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,670
The film.

90
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,820
I'm listening.

91

94
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,080
Okay, I'm Jeffrey. I am a mediator.

95
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,030
And you two are having a dispute.

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,040
Now why is that?

97
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,950
Because Tracy thinks he can treat
me unfairly because I'm a woman.

98
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,650
What? Please.

99
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,230
We are here because white folks think they
can do whatever they want to do to black folks.

100
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,380
It's like when Adrien Brody
kissed Halle Berry at the oscars.

101
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,480
White people stole jazz, rock and
roll, Will Smith, and heart disease.

102
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,680
Now they think they can
take my hard-earned money.

103
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,800
Ay, well, if we look at how voice
actors are normally compensated--

104
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,940
Liz says in this day's America, it's
harder to be a woman than a black man.

105
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,550
Liz Lemon? That chick is dumb.

106
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,290
Okay.

107
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,560
Tracy, do you know women still get paid
less than men for doing the same job?

108
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,220
Do you know it's still
illegal to be black in Arizona?

109
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,920
Do you have any idea how hard it is to be
an overweight, transgender in this country?

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,210
In preparation for landing
at Chicago's O'Hare airport...

111
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,810
No, grandma, no.

112
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,090
"Believe in the stars."

113
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,560
It's like that doesn't
even mean anything anymore.

114
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,390
Kenneth.

115
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,830
I'm sure I can trust your discretion
about what happened in my office today.

116
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,000
What you overheard was
some rather grown-up talk.

117
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,270
Was any of it real, Mr. Donaghy?

118
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,740
Beer pong, jazzercise, women's soccer.

119
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,060
You're not in stone
mountain anymore, Kenneth.

120
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,560
This is the real world, and not
everything is in black and white.

121
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,700
There's always a right
thing to do, Mr. Donaghy.

122
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,280
Just sometimes, it's not
the easy thing to do.

123
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,930
Tyler Brody was not the
only hero I lost today, sir.

124
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,190
The other hero was
you, in case that--

125
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,920
I got it, Kenneth.

126
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,850
If it weren't for you people,
I'd still be in Africa.

127
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,240
Gorgeous, politically stable Africa.

128
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,280
My people?

129
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,840
Women are the oppressed ones.

130
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,940
And it's even harder
being a beautiful woman.

131
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,810
Everyone assumes I don't try in bed.

132
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,210
- It's discrimination.
- Whatever.

133
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,590
You couldn't last one day in
my shoes, maroney. Right, Toof?

134
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,580
No, thank you.

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,190
I could totally be black.

136
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,650
You should try being a white woman.

137
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,760
Okay, I will.

138
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,740
No, no, no, no.

139
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,900
I don't like where this is heading.

140
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,880
Freaky friday social experiment.

141
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,710
Oh, it's on.

142
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,910
Where is Liz Lemon?

143
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,990
I don't really think it's fair for me to
be on a jury because I can read thoughts.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,370
Dismissed.

145
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,980
Welcome aboard flight 1876 to New York.

146
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,410
- Hello?
- Lemon, as part of our deal to keep him quiet,

147
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,560
Tyler Brody is going to
be on your show this week.

148
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,230
But he won't do any tetherball stuff.

149
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,140
Boy, Jack, it must be nice to dump
your problems on other people.

150
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,210
It is. Lemo do you think
Kenneth admires you?

151
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,060
Sure, that kid looks up to everybody.

152
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,680
He calls Tracy's lizards "sir."

153
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,550
So someone would have to be a
complete monster to lose his respect.

154
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,380
Yeah.

155
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,290
I don't know what we're talking about.

156
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,380
We're talking about nobody.

157
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,070
A hillbilly nobody that
doesn't know anything.

158
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,010
- Hello?
- Tracy is a white woman, Liz.

159
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,640
What?

160
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,190
He's trying to prove that being a white
woman is easier than being a black man.

161
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,220
Wait, no, what about the mediation?

162
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,650
We are way past that.

163
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,670
This is gonna be bigger than when
tyra banks put on that fat suit.

164
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:52,670
And n't worry, when I prove Tracy
wrong, you'll get all the credit.

165
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,910
What are you gonna do? Jenna?

166
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,900
Hello?

167
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,160
Liz, it's Becky, your college roommate.

168
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry. Who?

169
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,540
Hey, Liz Lemon, you're already
treating me with more respect.

170
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,640
Oh, god, Tracy.

171
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,380
You wait till I test
this noise out on society.

172
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,690
Minds will be blown.

173
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,820
No. No society. Do not go outside.
Do not let Jack Donaghy see you.

174
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,590
Tracis, listen
to me-- oh, boy.

175
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,610
This pill's damn strong.

176
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,500
You can't fix this, Liz Lemon.

177
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,160
It's about race. It's about
being a woman. It's about money.

178
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,300
It's about being on TV. And
no one understands all that.

179
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,450
Hello.

180
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,550
I'm gonna call you back.

181
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,180
I snitting next to Borpo.

182
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,780
Whoa, Portland's got a
fun little waterfront.

183
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,830
Do you mind if I close
this window shade?

184
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,930
I'm trying to adopt a baby, but
my job is making it impossible

185
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,150
because my work self is
suffocating my life me.

186
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,380
I'm Liz Lemon, and I
lost my virginity at 25.

187
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,110
I saw the show about following your fear,
and it inspired me to wear shorts to work.

188
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,820
It didn't go great.

189
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,390
Do you know Tracy Jordan?

190
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,540
I took a pill earlier, but I didn't
get my september issue of O Magazine.

191
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,560
Do you have the number
for subscriptions?

192
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,840
Why would you? Blagh!

193
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,800
I eat emotionally.

194
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,740
And one time at summer camp, I kissed
a girl on a dare, but then she drowned.

195
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,940
And here comes some more stuff.

196
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,120
I hate my feet.

197
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,450
And once, I had a sex dream about Nate Berkus,
but halfway through, he turned into Dr. Oz.

198
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,220
Has that ever happened to you? 
A hug. This is happening.

199
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,840
It's all right, Liz. It's all right.

200
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,900
Uh, I'm okay. Please stay close.

201
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,050
Uh, can you keep your
hands outside my clothes?

202
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,340
- Okay.
- Good.

203
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,620
Kenneth, I'm a good person.

204
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,120
If you say so, sir.

205
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,390
But sometimes life is complicated.

206
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,590
There isn't always a right answer.

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,570
Say you're in a life boat.

208
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,710
You're on a life boat.

209
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,500
The boat holds eight people,
but you have nine on board.

210
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:09,060
Either you will capsize and everyone will drown,
or one person can be sacrificed to save the othe.

211
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,410
Now how do you decide who should die?

212
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,790
Oh, I don't believe in hypothetical
situations, Mr. Donaghy.

213
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,380
That's like lying to your brain.

214
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,360
Kenneth, you've lived a sheltered life.

215
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,790
Virtue never tested is no virtue at all.

216
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,300
Oh, I have been tested, sir.

217
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,180
There are only two things I love in
this world: everybody and television.

218
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,300
But up in my neighborhood,
we can't even afford cable.

219
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,100
So my neighbor the colonel and I just
watch whatever the old rabbit ears pick up.

220
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,280
A lot of folks have chosen to go ahead and steal
cable from the poor, defenseless cable company.

221
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,450
But not me.

222
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,990
As bad as I want all those channels, I
don't do it because stealing is wrong.

223
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,160
Kenneth, I'm familiar
with the ten commandments.

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,340
Ten?

225
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,450
A lot of us women eat otionally, Liz, and while
we're not always in control of our feelings,

226
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,080
we do control the decisions we make.

227
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,360
I know. Of course.

228
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,490
Now you say that you want a child.

229
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,290
And yet, you let Jenna and Tracy
fill that role in your life.

230
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,420
Maybe you're afraid of
taking that next step.

231
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,340
Oh, my god. That's it.

232
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,260
Now that we've leveled off, I think
they're gonna serve us a little snack.

233
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,390
So true. So wise.

234
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,160
You know, when you say that to everything,
it makes me feel like you're not listening.

235
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,790
Sorry.

236
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,650
Here. Try this. It's wonderful.

237
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,610
Salt water taffy from Rhode Island.

238
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320
Wow, is this one of your favorite things?

239
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,780
Oh, yes, and I have so many wonderful
favorite things this year--

240
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:46,350
Sweater capes, calypso music,
paisley tops, chinese checkers,

241
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,940
High-heeled flip-flo that lift up
your butt and give you a workout,

242
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,730
and you, Liz Lemon.

243
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,730
Too many women are wearing
themselves too thin these days.

244
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,800
And what suffers because of that?

245
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,570
- Your bowel movements.
- Your personal life.

246
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,940
Personal life, yes.

247
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,640
I want to help you. What can I do?

248
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,480
Oh, my god, would you say,
"please welcome Liz Lemon"?

249
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,580
No, but here is what I will do.

250
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,630
While I'm in New York, if you want, I can
stop by, and I can talk to Tracy and Jenna.

251
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,800
Solve that little problem for ya.

252
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,590
So you can concentrate on Liz for once.

253
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,460
Oh, you are the best
person in the whole world.

254
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,740
Good grief.

255
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,510
Hi, strangers. Do you think I'm sexy?

256
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,730
Giggle, giggle, giggle.

257
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,950
Tracy, I know it's you, and, yeah, I do.

258
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,090
I'm meeting my girlfriends for brunch.

259
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,480
I hope we can sit outside.

260
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,550
Lipstick!

261
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,780
Jack, what are you doing down here?

262
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
It's been a real crazy day, lemon.

263
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,240
We're bidding to build
a wind farm in Turkey,

264
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,790
I'm trying to convince the board
to sell the locomotive division,

265
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
And Kenneth is being
a real stick-in-the-mud.

266
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,730
Well, there's nothing to see down here.

267
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,230
Everything is under
control in studio 6-H.

268
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,580
Good morning.

269
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,970
No! No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

270
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,040
No, no, no, no. Wait, stop.

271
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,730
Why do you have a monster claw?

272
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,640
They ran out of white makeup because
I insisted they do my buttocks.

273
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,150
Good morning.

274
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,480
What is going on here?

275
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,560
Jenna and I are doing
a social experiment.

276
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,200
No, you're not. Wait.
What is Jenna doing?

277
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,380
You gotta ease on down ease on
down the road right this minute.

278
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,700
Stop that right now.

279
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,930
This is worse than when you
wore your shorts to work.

280
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,960
You realize this is
incredibly offensive.

281
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,530
Yes.

282
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,310
And you realize blackface makeup reignites
racial stereotypes African-Americans

283
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,320
have worked for hundreds
of years to overcome?

284
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,160
Here we go.

285
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,130
Yeah, it's bad. I get it.
Go get some baby wipes.

286
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,070
We're trying to prove who has it
hardest in America, women or black men.

287
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,310
I'll tell you who has it
the hardest. White men.

288
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,160
We make the unpopular, difficult
decisions, the tough choices.

289
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,720
We land on the moon and Normandy Beach, 
and yet they resent us.

290
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,400
Well, sir, I'm sorry to disagree,
but I am also a white man.

291
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,710
Uh, no, you are not.

292
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,400
Socioeconomically speaking you
are more like an inner-city latina.

293
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,810
The point is, men like me have to
step in and clean up messes like this.

294
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,270
No, you don't.

295
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,570
I've got this under control.

296
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,980
She's coming, Jack.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,410
Oprah is coming.

298
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,300
And she's gonna fix everything.

299
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,150
Oprah.

300
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,330
Oh, my, what was that?

301
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,550
We've tripped the
emergency brake, Kenneth.

302
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,640
Mr. Donaghy.

303
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,010
And I've hermetically sealed
this elevator car.

304
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,280
No air can get in or out.

305
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,850
Don't worry, folks.
Help will be here soon.

306
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,010
And we have enough
oxygen for eight people.

307
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,690
Unfortunately, there are
nine of us in here now.

308
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,850
One must die.

309
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,930
Mr. Donaghy!

310
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,900
In the panel where the elevator phone should
be, I've placed a pistol loaded with one bullet.

311
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,500
It's empty.

312
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,000
Then you'll have to
choke me with my belt.

313
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,390
I will fight you. It's human nature.

314
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,400
What's wrong with you?

315
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,250
Oprah smells like
rosewater and warm laundry.

316
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,190
Did she tell you any of her new
favorite things for this year?

317
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,890
Calypso, paisley, Chinese
checkers, and sweater capes.

318
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,810
Let's go to the mall.

319
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,350
Did she touch you?

320
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,390
Well, Kenneth, I give up.

321
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,990
I thought pure morality died with
Chuck Heston, but you proved me wrong.

322
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,950
You are better than all of us.

323
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,630
You are one latina fantastica.

324
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,780
Hola.

325
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,100
Kenneth Ellen Parcell, you are my hero.

326
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,940
You don't mean hero
like sandwich, do you?

327
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,420
No, Kenneth. Not like sandwich.

328
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,700
You deserve this!

329
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,180
Oh, no.

330
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,740
Oprah's coming.

331
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,390
I haven't seen Oprah since she did that
episode about the worst celebrity dads.

332
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,750
Um, Liz, your guest is here.

333
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,440
Oprah!

334
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,520
Hello, Liz Lemon!

335
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,210
Uh, how you doing?

336
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,460
What were you on? That's a kid.

337
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,380
That does explain some
of the stuff she said.

338
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,320
I get to fly first class because
my mom's a flight attendant.

339
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,580
I lost my headgear at six flags.

340
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,440
My boyfriend's in ninth grade.

341
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,380
It's not Oprah.

342
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,820
I thought it was Oprah.

343
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,520
It's a spunky little tween.

344
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,980
Now, as I'm sure Liz
has told you, I am pam.

345
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,730
Pam.

346
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,220
I'm a middle school class vice president,
a certified and trained baby sitter,

347
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,220
And I recently got internet in my room.

348
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,660
I think I gave her wine.

349
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,280
I believe I can achieve anything.

350
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,940
So let's get down to solving this problem:
Which one of you is janna?

351
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,850
Hello, Mr. Donaghy.

352
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,210
Did you have a good night, Kenneth?

353
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,550
Oh, yes, sir.

354
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,360
Hardly any screaming from the colonel.

355
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,070
Actually, I was thinking,
we all try to be perfect,

356
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,140
but the world
maybe, well--

357
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,630
Uh, what I'm trying to say...

358
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,270
There's a whole channel on the cable that
just tells you what's on the other channels.

359
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,370
I know, Kenneth. It's okay.

360
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,670
I'm glad I'm not a
white man, Mr. Donaghy.

361
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,850
Is Spongebob Squarepants
supposed to be terrifying?

362
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,260
You're darn right he is, Kenneth.

363
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,200
I knew it.

364
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,820
Yesterday, Liz and I realized that she's
probably wearing the wrong bra size.

365
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,640
Yup. That one's definitely bigger.

366
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,010
And that made me feel sad.

367
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,250
Now show me your emotion drawings.

368
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,320
Tracy, your emotion is upside-down.

369
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,650
That's the way my world is right now.

370
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,970
I guess I'm gonna have to
clean up your mess after all.

371
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,660
She's twelve.
How did I--

372
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,690
It's okay. It happens to the best of us.

373
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,960
In-flight medication is how I met M. Night
Shyamalan, until it turned out to be--

374
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,730
That was the best day of my life.

375
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,310
Liz, we worked it out.

376
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,510
I've been hearing, but
I haven't been listening.

377
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,120
And I need to stop being a
frenemy and be your real b.f..

378
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,860
Well, it looks like my work here is done.

379
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,580
So I'll see you at my
parents' house for dinner.

380
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,920
My best friend Gail can't make it because
she has some algebra test tomorrow.

381
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,780
Oh, Gail.

382
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,770
Good job, Lemon.

383
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,270
Good job, Pam, really.

384
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,760
Be a white man. Take credit.

385
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,850
# Lean on me when you're not strong...

386
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,550
We're not doing that now.
Stop that. Do you hear me?

387
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,210
I don't think I should be drinking this.

388
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,200
Oh, come on. Like you never have a drink?

389
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,860
Well, I did have some champagne
at my cousin's wedding once.

390
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,090
Yeah, you did. To Oprah.

391
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,770
My name is Pam.

392
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,040
Oh, Oprah!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
