1
00:00:01,728 --> 00:00:03,692
Are you sure you don't wanna go
to a real restaurant?

2
00:00:03,917 --> 00:00:06,351
No, this food car is great!

3
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:15,332
Look at this guy, used to be a man once.

4
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:18,911
What is that supposed to mean?
Don't you want what he has some day?

5
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,049
Family, wife, children.

6
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,820
Lemon, you're a woman.

7
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:29,303
Of course I am!
That doctor was a quack,

8
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:31,154
I don't even know why
my parents listened to him.

9
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:36,244
I need advice. Elisa is coming by
this afternoon to, uh,

10
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:39,776
- talk about us.
- Ach, ladies are such a bummer.

11
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:41,748
Where is this going,
how serious are we,

12
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,145
why don't you listen
to my story about my friend?

13
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:47,909
Well, where is it going? Ladies like
to know what that next step is, they--

14
00:00:48,553 --> 00:00:50,164
<i>we</i> can't help ourselves.

15
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,562
Oh, believe me Lemon, I want
to take that next step.

16
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,882
- You mean, like, marriage?
- No, the one before that.

17
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:57,524
- Moving in together?
That's huge! - No,

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,019
the thing you do before that.

19
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:03,608
- think "you in the mid-nineties."
- You haven't had sex?

20
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:07,242
Elisa had a very strict,
very religious upbringing.

21
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:08,660
She does not take that step lightly.

22
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,259
We have, of course,

23
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,865
- pleasured one another--
- No, stop, I believe.

24
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:18,551
But she wants me to make some
kind of commitment before we go forward.

25
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:21,742
Obviously I care about her a lot,
but she keeps confusing me 

26
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:25,387
with this ridiculous notion that "sex"
and "love" are somehow connected.

27
00:01:25,387 --> 00:01:28,290
OK, two things: one, be honest,
if this is a big deal to her

28
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,194
do not take that next step
unless you are sure,

29
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,789
and second, and more importantly,

30
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,889
in 2009 I have done it
two more times than you.

31
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:40,322
Give it up what, what.

32
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:43,352
Whoo, do not leave a brother hanging.

33
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,706
You're ready for <i>Larry King Live</i> tonight?

34
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:17,372
You know it occurs for two hours straight
just to get it out of my system you dumb bitch.

35
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,815
- Oh, no. - Listen, we have a request,

36
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,370
can you, please, try to remember
to talk about <i>TGS</i> tonight?

37
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,601
You only have to plug it once:
"<i>TGS</i>, Fridays at 10:30 on <i>NBC</i>."

38
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:31,448
You got it! "NGS Fridays
at c-thirty on TB-10."

39
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,064
Thank you.

40
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:39,082
What's that, you're calling me,
how's that possible? Hello!  

41
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:41,879
This phone was left in my cab
by a woman wearing

42
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,505
- the shirt of a man.
- Ah, you left your phone in his car.

43
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:48,726
- Hi, I'm Liz, you have my phone?
- Yes. This is Asseef,

44
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:51,927
I'm in <i>Green's Taxi</i> dispatch
in Long Island City, you come?

45
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,734
Yes, I will, thank you.

46
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:57,379
Hey, why do you have Tracy Jordan's
phone number in your address book?

47
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:00,459
I work with him, if you want
I could bring a signed photo.

48
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,539
You bring 800 dollars, rich lady,
or I throw the phone away.

49
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:08,194
What? Oh, yeah, I'll definitely
do that, on Opposite Day.

50
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm new to this country,

51
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:11,597
is that a real thing?

52
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:18,262
Hi baby, I got you something to
remember me while I'm in Puerto Rico.

53
00:03:18,706 --> 00:03:20,150
It's a caricature
of me on a skateboard.

54
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,554
So I guess you're still
planning on taking your trip?

55
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:26,199
Well, I've been going home
every winter for the last 15 years.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,986
I guess I could consider staying,
if I knew where this was going.

57
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:34,055
And the woman talk begins.
Well played. Look, you know

58
00:03:34,116 --> 00:03:36,307
I'm serious about us,
we're great together.

59
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:38,730
We're Jack and Elisa -- Jalisa.

60
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,194
That's really lame, Jack.

61
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,052
Yeah that was just a joke.

62
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:47,839
I don't wanna go all "Marc Anthony" on you,
but I need to know how you feel.

63
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:49,697
I love you.

64
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,129
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Jack Donaghy.

65
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,180
Then you'll stay?

66
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:58,744
OK, I'll stay.

67
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:02,743
But if I have to give up my trip,
then I want us to spend that time together.

68
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,490
Just us, "Jalisa."

69
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,458
Jonathan, clear my schedule
for next week, starting with tonight.

70
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,235
You won't be coming in at all?
But what about "Jackonathon?"

71
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:16,729
I think tonight is going to be
a very special night.

72
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,769
- If you know what I mean...
- I think I do.

73
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,445
Don't forget your skateboard.

74
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:24,706
But then he scores a basket,
even though he's not a wolf anymore.

75
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:27,574
We're here with Tracy Jordan,
who just recounted, by the way,

76
00:04:27,574 --> 00:04:30,381
the entire plot of
the movie <i>Teen Wolf</i>.

77
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,744
What? Oh, hold on, Tracy.

78
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:35,652
My producers are telling me
there is breaking news.

79
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:40,095
The Asian financial markets
have just opened to a huge sell-off,

80
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:44,609
- and we're gonna switch to that story right now.
- Good. I'm glad I'm here.

81
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:48,598
Your thoughts, Tracy Jordan,
on how this is gonna impact Wall Street.

82
00:04:48,749 --> 00:04:51,961
Larry, I'm not an expert,
but I do have a strong opinion.

83
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:55,576
New York as we know it
will no longer exist tomorrow.

84
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:58,433
- Expand on that!
- Look, I grew up here, Larry,

85
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,362
 in the days before Starbuck.

86
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:05,219
and if Wall Street crashes,
it will be the 1970s all over again.

87
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:10,096
People will get mean, the streets won't be safe,
it will be graffiti everywhere,

88
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,389
and the movies are only cost three dollars.

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,590
Tracy Jordan, saying three serious things,

90
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:16,569
and then a joke.

91
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:23,454
Oh, Jack, have you taken a gander
at the Asian markets?

92
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:25,654
The <i>???</i> index is off the charts!

93
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,529
Well, good luck with that, Jorgensen
but I'm on vacation now.

94
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,743
But, I have these papers.

95
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:34,417
- Hey, Jack, how are you doing?
- Like a lion, ready to take its mate.

96
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:39,921
How are you calling me?

97
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:43,390
Ach, I lost my phone
and this jagweed cabby has it.

98
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:46,018
Hey, stop harassing my friends, Asseef.

99
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,177
Hey, Liz, I just wanted to let you know

100
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:50,902
that I found that special picture

101
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:54,580
- that you took with your phone.
- What picture? Oh my god!

102
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,058
- Yes.  That one.
- There's a picture on my phone.

103
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:01,143
- An adult picture, of me.
- What?

104
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,616
Drew took it as a joke, I'm making a face like--
Why am I telling you this?

105
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:08,026
Top-end bottom, may I speak with Asseef?

106
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,978
- OK, what do you want?
- 2,000 cash or I email the picture

107
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,247
to everyone in your address book.

108
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:16,880
Have you been to Asia, Tracy?

109
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,660
Oh, my work has taken me there,

110
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:20,677
I was supposed to be in that movie <i>Rush Hour</i>

111
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:23,853
but two weeks into shooting
I was replaced by Jackie Chan.

112
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,984
- OK, I'm going to get my phone.
- You're gonna pay that guy?

113
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:29,723
Well, it's, you know I need
my address book and stuff.

114
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:33,045
But I'm not going alone
to meet some creep at a taxi garage.

115
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:33,876
Will one of your guys go with me?

116
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:34,962
- No ma'am.
- Good luck.

117
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:37,856
- I would, but I don't want to.
- I will escort you, Miss Lemon.

118
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,855
We pages are accustomed to danger.

119
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,346
Thank you Kenneth, can you
leave now, this place is in Queens.

120
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:45,523
Oh, Miss Lemon, I can't
leave Manhattan on page business.

121
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:49,402
NBC's interns doesn't cover it.
I'll have to do this as a friend.

122
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:50,503
OK, fine.

123
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:53,519
Say it. Say I'm your friend.

124
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,823
Fine. You're my friend,
Kenneth. Let's go.

125
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,227
The Mumbay stock exchange
is now down in early trading.

126
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:06,170
Is this panic becoming global?
Tracy Jordan, talk us through this.

127
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:10,552
Larry, what everyone needs to do,
is to take a deep breath,

128
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:14,659
calm down, and start preparing their bodies
for the Thunderdome.

129
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,028
That is the new law.

130
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:18,100
That's my TV!

131
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:22,664
This is as far as we can get by subway.
We need to find a cab.

132
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,525
Hold, Miss Lemon, this is
a pretty bad neighborhood.

133
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,230
Aww, I just got tagged.

134
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:37,607
Mr. Jordan and Mr. Larry King are right,
New York is not safe anymore.

135
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,386
And I'm not risking your life
for a cell phone.

136
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,892
It's not just a phone, Kenneth,
it's what's on it.

137
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,685
I don't understand, what
could be so important?

138
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,761
It wasn't something of
sentimental value, was it?

139
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:51,746
Yes, very sentimental.

140
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:56,839
It's a song, a lullaby that my nana Lemon
used to sing to me every night

141
00:07:57,204 --> 00:08:00,846
Oh, was it "The Day is Done My Sweet,
For the Lambs Have Been Decapitated?"

142
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:04,150
No, it was... a German song,
she was German.

143
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:07,601
And my nana got very sick recently,
and I went to visit her

144
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,120
and I had her singing it for me
one final time

145
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:13,452
and I recorded that on my phone
and I'm glad that I did because

146
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:17,176
she died a few hours later.
It was my birthday.

147
00:08:17,285 --> 00:08:20,343
Miss Lemon, I am so sorry,
would you sing it for me?

148
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,451
* Hast du etwas Zeit für mich *

149
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:27,490
* dann singe ich ein Lied für dich *

150
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,854
Stop. Now that I know,
the reason we are doing this

151
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:32,200
is not only moral, but beautiful

152
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,417
then I will not rest
until I get my friend her phone.

153
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:37,878
OK, come on.

154
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:43,519
- That was amazing.
- Thank you.

155
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:47,836
I watched an <i>American Masters</i>
last night about Baryshnikov.

156
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:49,817
I picked up a couple of ideas.

157
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,070
Our sushi. No, no, no, no, no,
I'll get it. You'll need your rest,

158
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:58,005
we're going again in 15.

159
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,886
- Jack, you've got company.
- Jack, why aren't you answering your phone?

160
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,078
What are you doing here?

161
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:10,820
People are freaking out about
this Asia thing, and we can't find Geiss.

162
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:13,659
He's AWOL, now everyone's looking to you, Jack.

163
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:18,862
I don't care what's going on out there.

164
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:20,811
I'm staying here.

165
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,722
There are some things more important than
a stock quote crawling across a screen.

166
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:26,812
I'm in love with this magnificent woman,

167
00:09:27,177 --> 00:09:29,879
and there is no amount of money this company
could lose that would cause me to--

168
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:32,417
yes, that's the amount,
I'll get dressed right now.

169
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:38,706
Bill Hewitt, Undersecretary of the Treasury,

170
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,257
what advice can you give our viewers
in these uncertain times?

171
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,670
The worst thing you could do
in a time like this is to pull out

172
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,624
your investments, don't panic,
because I think that--

173
00:09:47,706 --> 00:09:52,334
Devil's avocado here, Larry, I think
people should freak the geek out.

174
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:56,500
- Withdraw all your money and hide it!
- Interesting strategy.

175
00:09:56,825 --> 00:10:00,430
It's what I've always done.
I hide cash everywhere.

176
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,205
At home, at church, even at work.

177
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:07,130
In fact, I've hidden so much money
that if some of it was gone

178
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,764
I'd probably wouldn't even notice.

179
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:11,402
- Now why would you say that?
- I don't know.

180
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:20,466
Don't worry Miss Lemon, I'll protect you.

181
00:10:23,286 --> 00:10:25,696
Ah, it's just kids.

182
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:32,250
What is going on with people?

183
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:39,653
They took my wallet.

184
00:10:41,615 --> 00:10:44,271
- Was this your nana Lemon?
- Yeah, she's the one we're doing this for.

185
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:48,616
- She's dead, come on.
- Wait, why is she wearing these glasses?

186
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:51,263
This is from New Year's, but you said
she died on your birthday,

187
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:52,327
and that's in November.

188
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:55,836
No, that's not a New Year's thing,
that's the year she wanted to live to,

189
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:59,770
- and she didn't make it.
- Sing that lullaby again!

190
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,281
* Hast du etwas Zeit für mich *

191
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,316
* dann singe ich ein Lied für dich *

192
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:05,968
Keep going.

193
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:09,428
* von 99 Luftballons *

194
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:15,333
I knew it! That's "99 Red Balloons,"
Nena's famous anti-balloon protest song.

195
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:18,455
- You lied to me.
- Yeah, alright, I lied, so what?

196
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:20,591
You want the truth Kenneth, you want the truth?

197
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:22,243
I can't handle the truth!

198
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:25,666
There's an adult picture of me
on that phone!

199
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:28,843
Adult? You mean like you're
driving a car or wearing a suit?

200
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:30,650
It's a boobies picture, Kenneth, 

201
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:34,374
and I only kept it because for once
they were both pointing in the same direction.

202
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:36,948
I knew you wouldn't help me
if I told you the truth.

203
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,381
So you lied to me?

204
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:40,782
That's not something that friends
do to each other.

205
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,379
Then maybe we're not friends.

206
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:46,213
- But we are! You said so before we left.
- You made me say that!

207
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:52,849
Well I guess then I'm here as a page
in violation of NBC's interns policy.

208
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,496
I should probably head back to Manhattan.

209
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,403
Good.

210
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,146
I don't need you!

211
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:03,045
Co-worker!

212
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,167
- Did you get hold of Geiss?
- No.

213
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:17,531
- Did you try his mistress?
- Not there.

214
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,552
- How about his manstress?
- Nothing. I think we should listen

215
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:23,163
- to Tracy Jordan and panic, sir.
- What?

216
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:26,713
I'm saying the disneyfication of New York
is over, everyone.

217
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:29,671
At the stroke of midnight,
your Lexus is gonna turn back

218
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:32,582
into a high-powered rats,
fighting over a human finger.

219
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,951
Joining us on the phone is
GE Vice President Jack Donaghy,

220
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,712
Jack, what's your outlook on all of this?

221
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:40,095
I just wanna preach caution, Larry

222
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,724
if there was anything to worry about
I would be at my office.

223
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:46,904
Instead of at home, right now,
with my beautiful girlfriend.

224
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,204
- She's Latin.
- Expand on that.

225
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:53,485
Look, my point is that some of the things
that Tracy is saying are just fanning the flames.

226
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:56,014
Hang on. I know Jack Donaghy,

227
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,538
and that is an impostor.

228
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:01,792
- Hang up! Hang up on him Larry!
- I'm going to, but not because you told me.

229
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:03,964
Lincoln, Nebraska, you are on the air.

230
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:08,108
So is this what you'd rather be doing
than spending time with me?

231
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:12,745
- It smells like dude in here.
- I tried to call you why didn't you pick up?

232
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:14,671
Because I'm sick of listening to you.

233
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,793
"Oh, I love you, Elisa."

234
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,832
This was all just another Jack Donaghy lie.

235
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:23,269
Like when you said
you could dunk a basketball?

236
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,976
I can, on a regulation hoop.

237
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:27,532
Look, this is an emergency,
if I'm not here, tonight--

238
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:30,544
What? What's gonna happen?
People are gonna die?

239
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:35,829
No. You'll all just get poor like the rest of us.
You'll eat cereal that comes in a bag,

240
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,993
and you'll keep the free hand wipes
from the casino.

241
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:40,448
You might even have to spend some
time with your children.

242
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:43,524
Who is this woman,
why isn't someone shutting her up?

243
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:46,509
Now why don't you just go
back to my apartment

244
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:49,914
and I will meet you there, eventually.

245
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:54,989
Don't worry about it.
I'm going to Puerto Rico!

246
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:57,252
Elisa, don't do that, you don't understand.

247
00:13:57,408 --> 00:14:00,073
What's happening here is
a once in a lifetime thing.

248
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,241
So am I.

249
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:08,580
Well, that was kind of neato, she just,
whoop, flipped your words around on you.

250
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:10,150
Sorry.

251
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:15,782
- Forget it, we're never gonna find Tracy's money.
- There's something under here!

252
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:23,769
- It's nothing but a bunch of tarantula food.
- What? I didn't even know Tracy had a tarantula.

253
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,652
You know what? There's
an easier way to do this.

254
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,071
Our next caller is Pete from Manhattan,

255
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:34,211
- Pete, was is your question?
- Hey Larry, first time caller, I adore the show--

256
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:39,186
Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere Larry,
that's my friend Peter Frampton on the phone.

257
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,245
Ah, sure.

258
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:42,937
Uh, sure, listen, Tracy I love
the idea of hiding cash at work,

259
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,311
could you be more specific about
where you hid your money?

260
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:50,075
Of course Pete, I hid my money
in the safest place at 30 Rock.

261
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:54,840
Without giving it away: the place I picked
is very dry and warm.

262
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,345
Its top is hard, but its bottom is soft.

263
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,403
And although the location changes all the time,

264
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,105
the money stays in the same place.

265
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,227
If you're just joining us, we're with Tracy Jordan

266
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:10,987
who is giving guitar icon
Peter Frampton enigmatic clues

267
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:14,018
about a secret treasure. Stay with us.

268
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:19,303
Mr. Donaghy, this just arrived.
It's from Mr. Geiss.

269
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:24,068
Everything is gonna be alright. Geiss is back.

270
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:27,801
- Jonathan, can we even play this thing?
- Oh yes, I keep a VCR so

271
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,645
I can watch your old football tapes.

272
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,048
- Jonathan, what is that camcorder for?
- Nothing. I don't know.

273
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:46,002
Hello. If you're watching this, you're an executive
of the General Electric Corporation

274
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,293
and the unthinkable is happening.

275
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:52,656
Capitalism is ending, either because
of the Soviets or of something ridiculous,

276
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:55,869
- like a woman president.
- God, he looks so young.

277
00:15:56,042 --> 00:16:00,807
I'm speaking to you in the year 1987,
but my message is timeless.

278
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:02,359
Avoid...

279
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:04,148
the night.

280
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,795
We've all worked hard, but now it's over.

281
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:08,821
There's only one thing for you to do.

282
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:10,985
Go to your loved ones.

283
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,477
Hold them close.

284
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:17,128
Because in the end and if you're watching this

285
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,972
it <i>is</i> the end,

286
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:22,449
love is all that matters.

287
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:26,101
How the hell am I gonna turn this damn thing off?

288
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:28,592
What's that gizmo?

289
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:43,170
Elisa?

290
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:47,186
I was about to do the whole run-to-the-airport
thing like Ross did on <i>Friends</i>

291
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,787
and Liz Lemon did in real life.
What are you doing here?

292
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:54,506
The taxis want 500 bucks to go to J.F.K.
and the buses are worse.

293
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:56,533
Everything's gone cocoa for cuckoo poops!

294
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:59,034
- Is that right?
- Elisa, listen to me.

295
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,753
I meant everything I said but I know that
that's just words, you want commitment.

296
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:05,359
Here it is:

297
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,094
Let's get married.

298
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,549
- Jack!
- I love you, Elisa

299
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,393
and I don't wanna be with anyone else.

300
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,026
Okay.

301
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:17,928
But I want a ring so big, 

302
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,192
that it gives me back problems.

303
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,932
- That's my phone, I'm Liz Lemon.
- Where is the 2,000 dollars?

304
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:31,529
I don't have it, I lost all my money

305
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:33,364
and my bank card's in my retainer. Geez.

306
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:36,472
Please, Asseef, give me my phone.

307
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,014
Maybe you could call a friend
to get the money or, wait!

308
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,889
Every number in this address book
is a work number.

309
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,335
Work number, work number, work number.

310
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:46,444
You have no friends.

311
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:50,068
Yes. I. Am.

312
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:54,376
OK, you have 2,000 dollars?

313
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:55,800
No.

314
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:58,849
I'm gonna watch TV until
you come up with my money.

315
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:02,427
Maybe you get it through sex trade.
You're a pretty young thing.

316
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,640
- You're disgusting.
- I'm not talking to you.

317
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,665
- Frank, calm down.
- It's not in here.

318
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:14,631
This isn't about the money,
this is about my own issues

319
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,808
- with Liz.
- Stop it!

320
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,391
We have Peter Frampton on the phone again.

321
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,482
Come on, Tracy, just tell us where the money is,

322
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,755
where's the safest place in 30 Rock?

323
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:26,050
- Is that Pete?
- I already told you, it's dry and warm,

324
00:18:26,269 --> 00:18:28,852
its top is hard but its bottom is soft,

325
00:18:29,089 --> 00:18:31,499
and although the location changes, 

326
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,110
it's always in the same place.

327
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,003
There's nothing like that in 30 Rock, nothing.

328
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:38,947
I never said it was a "thing."

329
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:41,083
It's me.

330
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:44,935
I am the safest place in 30 Rock.

331
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:01,904
I would thank you to give the lady
its cell phone back.

332
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,317
Thank you for coming back, Kenneth,
you're a good friend.

333
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:08,768
- You mean it?
- Yes!

334
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,383
Because I'm having an asbestos removal party
in my apartment on Sunday,

335
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:13,871
Yeah, I'm in.

336
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,535
Now that the US markets have opened
unaffected by the Asian melt-down,

337
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:22,131
many people are blaming the panic
in New York last night on one man,

338
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,275
Tracy Jordan.

339
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:26,850
He is here with me now. Tracy, a lot of of people
are calling you a "fear monger,"

340
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,196
and, I'm quoting here, "an idiot."

341
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:30,684
What do you have to say for yourself?

342
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:33,943
Watch <i>TGS</i> Fridays at 10:30 on NBC!

343
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,166
Word.

344
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:39,547
- Morning Jonathan.
- Good morning sir, crazy night last night.

345
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:41,774
Lots of emotions, people getting carried away.

346
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:44,969
Yes, it was a crazy night. Is Elisa here?

347
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,361
We're having a couples spa day.

348
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,780
She came by earlier,
she asked me to give you this,

349
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:52,107
she said to just press "play."

350
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,386
Hi Jack, I'm on my way to Puerto Rico.

351
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:01,938
I'm sorry.

352
00:20:02,321 --> 00:20:05,626
Yesterday was crazy, lots of emotion.

353
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:10,272
I think maybe you asked me
what you asked me out of panic.

354
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,041
So, I'm gonna go see my family and

355
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:17,236
give us both a chance to think about everything.

356
00:20:18,642 --> 00:20:19,929
OK, I'll call you.

357
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,882
Adiós mi amor.

358
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:25,050
Aww, how do you turn this damn thing off?

359
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:30,033
No!

360
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:32,799
That's personal.

361
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:38,684
