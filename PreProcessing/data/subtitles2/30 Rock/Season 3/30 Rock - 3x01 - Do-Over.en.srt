00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,040
Hello,pussycat!

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,140
Oh,really?

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,960
Lot of ladies get right in the car
after that line, you creepy piece of--

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,670
jack!

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,600
- What are you--
- oh,i'm sorry.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,830
When did you get back from D. C.?

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,590
How did you get out
of your government job?

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,690
Um,i'm not at liberty to discuss that.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,350
That information is classified.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,830
At least until cheney dies, which
is gonna be a long time from now.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,300
That man is mostly metal.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,010
The important thing is that i'm here,
and i'm gonna get my old job back.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,010
Yes,please come back,jack!
Devin is the worst.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,340
It's like he doesn't he even care when we should have
cake for people's whose birthdays are on the weekend.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,240
The friday before. At lunch.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,660
So what's with the outfit,lemon?

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,330
Did the people from that makeover
show finally respond to your letter?

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:57,320
No,i am dressed up because the adoption
agency is doing my home evaluation today.

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,530
Just be yourself,lemon.

20
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,100
I'm gonna be better than myself.

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,520
My apartment is spotless.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,100
I have practiced all my answers.

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,350
I got rid of all my colin firth movies
in case they consider them erotica.

24
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,510
That man can wear a sweater.

25
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,640
There is no chance
that i'm blowing this.

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,460
What can i do for you,jack?

30
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,670
Devin,i know we've had
our battles in the past,

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,100
But i want to offer my
assistance to you and kathy.

32
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,150
Oh,that's funny,jack.

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,250
You see,the only thing that
kathy and i need assistance with

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,160
is deciding which john
mayer song to do it to.

35
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,880
Oh,come on,banks.

36
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,330
You sold off small appliances.

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,940
Sheinhardt wigs missed
projections for last quarter.

38
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,710
I hear that that theme park fire di't
destroy any of the stuff it was supposed to.

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,190
Rumor has it you're in over your head.

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,750
Well,you know what they
say about rumors,jack.

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,500
They make a "ru" out of "mor" and "s."

42
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,170
Yes,we've had some setback.

43
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,610
But kathy and i have
everything under control.

44
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,370
No!

45
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,290
Don't even think about talking
to her when her soaps are on!

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,650
Seriously, she will bite you.

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,370
You owe me a job,banks.

48
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,600
You know her father wanted me to
takeover before he slipped into that coma.

49
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,000
If there's one thing i learned from
you,jack, it's keep your friends close...

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,170
And your enemies so close
that you're almost kissing.

51
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,690
So-- ahem-- that's why
i'm gonna offer you a job.

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,550
In the mailroom.

53
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,130
I'll take it.

54
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,580
Great news,guys.

55
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,020
I just got a residual check from
that japanese commercial i did.

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,510
I still don't know how that
advertised tokyo university.

57
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,690
But i'm gonna use this $300 to
buy us all some new boots for me.

58
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,250
It's official!

59
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,350
I'm a genius.

60
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,260
My video game is selling
through the rizznoof.

61
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,640
Well,how far through theriznoof?

62
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,000
Whoa,that's not slang.

63
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,960
He has a speech impediment.

64
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,510
61 million copie at $60 each.

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,230
Well,you know you didn't make
this video game alone,tracy.

66
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,740
A lot of people helped.

67
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,980
I don't know. I think i did it alone.

68
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,130
And this check is the prizznoof.

69
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,580
Now that one was just
him being obnoxious.

70
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,460
Thank you.

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,510
Jack?

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,010
I'm back,lemon.

73
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,640
Devin thought he could humiliate me,

74
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,010
But he doesn't understand that i
worked my way up from the bottom before,

75
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,940
And i can do it again.

76
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,370
The last time took me 22 years, but
i know so much more now this time.

77
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,640
I think i can do it in nine.

78
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,230
So you're gonna be a mailroom guy.

79
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,470
I'm the head mailroom guy.

80
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,360
I've already been promoted
once since this morning.

81
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,210
That's pretty fast.

82
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,260
With a little hard work, i think i'll
be back to vp status before i'm 60.

83
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,440
And if my home evaluation goes
well, i will be a mother by 50.

84
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,220
- We really can have it all.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,440
What was your reason
for wanting to adopt?

86
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,130
Thank you for that question,bev.

87
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,110
The world is a troubled place, and with so many children in need of adoption worldwide
- so...

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,610
"infertility" or "other?"

89
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,480
Other.

90
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,980
- How old are you,liz?
- 37

91
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,320
I should tell you right now it's
important that you don't lie.

92
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,940
How often do you entertain
gentlemen sex guests?

93
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,570
Oh,boy,that's once a year,maybe.

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,330
But i'd be open to cutting that down.

95
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,790
Is that a safety thing?
Because i can fix that.

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,140
You ever run a webcam
ring out of here,liz?

97
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,150
Gentlemen tell you what to do,you do it?

98
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,410
At first with some feigned hesitation?

99
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,740
No! Is that on the form?

100
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,900
Haveou ever been convicted of a crime?

101
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,320
I was arrested once in
germany for public nudity.

102
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,890
I thought it was a topless
beach. It was a shipyard.

103
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,780
You're a tv writer,liz.

104
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,590
How many hours per week do you work?

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,210
Between 60 and 80.

106
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,020
- Is that a work call?
- Could be.

107
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,900
Or it could be my annual sex guest.

108
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,370
Your work life seems very demanding.

109
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,240
Maybe i should pop by there tomorrow.

110
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,360
Uh,ms. Geiss,i have
yoursoap opera digest.

111
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,530
Kathy,this can't be easy for you.

112
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,280
Your father, such a great
leader, trapped in a coma.

113
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,990
All this responsibility
heaped on your...

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,460
Young shoulders.

115
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,280
With all due respect to devin, he's
a party boy with a grown man's job.

116
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,080
He can't handle it.

117
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,620
I want to be of service.

118
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,960
Let me help you.

119
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,280
can i have everyone's attention,please?

120
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,010
Hi,there's-- there is a woman
coming by the office today...

121
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,590
No,stop it. Uh,her name is bev, and
she is evaluating me for an adoption.

122
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,120
Morons.

123
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,050
I need everyone to be
on their best behavior.

124
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,920
No cursing. Please take down any
pornography that you have in your office.

125
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,460
Nothing weird.

126
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,540
Oh,come on. It's movie party thursday.

127
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,390
I brought in my tape
of circus accidents.

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,320
No,no.

129
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,860
Please,a lion eats a sad clown.

130
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,640
Tomorrow.

131
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,570
Please just be
normal-sauce for one day.

132
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,000
And change that hat.

133
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,540
Pete,i need you to call the set design guys and
have them make the green room into a nursery.

134
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,260
I may have lied about some stuff.

135
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,270
Liz.

136
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,590
I have a serious issue.

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,130
Oh,i told you not to
write back to your stalker.

138
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,390
Oh,no,this is not about yolanda.

139
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,790
Listen,tracy keeps bragging about all the
money he's making off of his stupid video game.

140
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,900
Meanwhile,those of us who did the
voice acting weren't even compensated.

141
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,590
I mean,i don't do anything for yolanda,and
she sends me those headless dolls.

142
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,910
Well,i was not supposed to say anything,
but he has something very special planned.

143
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,960
Oh,i'll believe that when i see it.

144
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,340
Well,you will see, and then you are gonna
be embarrassed that we had this conversation.

145
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,460
Can i hide this box of penis
pasta in your dressing room?

146
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,140
Lemon.

147
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,640
- She touched me.
- Who?

148
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,070
Kathy geiss. She touched
me in my swimsuit area.

149
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,730
No! Kathy?

150
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,520
It made me very uncomfortable.

151
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,870
It's not all erotic and fun,
like when men do it to women.

152
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,620
Have you ever been sexually harassed?

153
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,880
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

154
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,770
i mean,how far would i have to
let her go to get my old job back?

155
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,570
Are we talking over the
shirt? Frontsies,backsies?

156
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,730
Or would i really have
to give her my gift?

157
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,280
Oh,what am i talking about?
I can't go through this.

158
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,020
If i pleasure kathy to get my
old job, i'm no better than devin.

159
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,710
The only path is the virtuous path.

160
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,050
Even if it takes five years.

161
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,030
I thought you said nine years.

162
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,530
I was promoted again this morning.
I'm now director of mail systems.

163
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,920
Nice work,hornberger. Are these dolls?

164
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,740
Are they?

165
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,820
Mommy!

166
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,720
They're called little creepers.

167
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,700
Oh,is it so wrong that i just want to
have one of these to grow up and resent me?

168
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,430
Oh,you will.

169
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,900
Hey,tracy,did you see that thing in
the paper today about how lil wayne--

170
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,010
that's a person,ight?

171
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,980
Anyway,lil wayne, every
time one of his albumsdrops,

172
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,940
He buys diamond watches for
everybody that worked on it.

173
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,040
I know what you're hinting at,liz lemon.

174
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,950
I should get my rap career going again.

175
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,400
All in due time.

176
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,600
No,i want you to get presents for everyone
who helped you with your video game.

177
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,270
Especially jenna.

178
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,720
Noblesse oblige,yes.

179
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,850
Let's go shopping. To the batmobile!

180
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,110
Don't worry. He's just leasing it.

181
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
Oh,good.

182
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,280
What i'm saying is don't
dress for the job you have.

183
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,130
Dress for the job you
want to have.So now,manny--

184
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,070
tomorrow i'll show up for work
dressed as a mexican wrestler.

185
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,870

Well--

186
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,140
Banks?

187
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,570
Good god,what are you dog
here? Where are your shoes?

188
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,220
Oh,damn it.

189
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,610
Must've left them in
my business meeting.

190
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,410
Banks,you've gotta get a hold of
yourself. You've got a company to run.

191
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,160
Oh,i'm running it.

192
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,710
I have a plan to quadruple
profits by the year 2015.

193
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,390
How are you possibly going to do that?

194
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,820
The old-fashioned way,jack.

195
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,280
I'm gonna shut it down.

196
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,420
I'm gonna shut the whole
thing down for two years.

197
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,800
I mean,imagine how badly
people'll want light bulbs then.

198
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,240
Are you insane?

199
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,040
Think about the jobs,
the economy. This is ge!

200
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,600
It's just "g" now,jack. I sold the
"e" to samsung. They're samesung now.

201
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,500
I was supposed to be at a
board mting five hours ago.

202
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,720
Which way's
connecticut-- oh!

203
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,070
May i help you.

204
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,270
Ah,i'm bev.

205
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm here to do liz's
adoption evaluation.

206
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,070
Oh,of course.

207
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,620
I think adoption is a wonderful thing.

208
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,290
Three of my nine siblings were adopted.

209
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,880
And someday i'm gonna find them.

210
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,410
Bev,hi! Thank you,kenneth.

211
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,650
So this our studio.

212
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,280
It would be a really fun
place for a kid to grow up.

213
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,410
Lots of
costumes and--

214
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,320
- watch out,idiot!
- Nice job,jackass!

215
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,990
We're like a big family here. Hey,rick!

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,030
I'm fred. Rick is the other black guy.

217
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,620
Happens to everyone, right,bev?

218
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,480
Yeah,happens all the
time to my black husband.

219
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,150
Well,i first met liz in 1993.

220
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,590
She was fresh out of college,and i
had just broken up with o.j.simpson.

221
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,030
And can i just say something?

222
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,660
Total gentleman.

223
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,000
Liz is a really,really mature person.

224
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,960
And she totally deserves
to get custody of her kids.

225
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,300
It's not a custody case.Liz
is trying to adopt a child.

226
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,900
Then who were those kids that
you were yelling at the other day?

227
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,460
Those were some child actors who had
lied about being able to break-dance.

228
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,720
Actually,i lived with liz while
i was separated from my wife.

229
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,320
In a platonic way.

230
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,640
Um,but i haven't lived
there for a couple months now

231
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,280
Because i've been in an anger
management treatment center

232
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,100
'Cause i shot one of my
coworkers with an arrow.

233
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,290
I think it's a circus
in the philippines.

234
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,660
The lion goes nuts and
attacks this older clown.

235
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,330
How did we get started
talking about this?

236
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,030
Did you bring it up?

237
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,970
I'm so sorry.Would you
excuse us for a moment,please?

238
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,900
-How is your thing going?
-Not terrific.

239
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,640
I'm not sure that she's--
lemon,i don't have five years.

240
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,490
-What?
-Devin's lost it.

241
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,780
I've gotta stop him before
this whole thing implodes.

242
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,600
-He wants to shut down the entire company.
-What are you talking about?

243
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,150
I've gotta go now while
devin's in connecticut.

244
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,580
I'm doing this for the greater good.

245
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,630
What are you saying?

246
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,380
I'm going upstairs...

247
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Todoinkkathy geiss.

248
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,490
tracy jordan's not here right now.

249
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,610
But he's great.It's a shame
you won't get toeet him.

250
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,050
Attention,everyone!

251
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,140
Hey,great.

252
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,740
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank
everyone involved in making my video game

253
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,120
The most profitable thing
since the war on terror.

254
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,460
Yes,i am provocative.

255
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,420
Frank,for all your hard work,please
accept this set of solid gold nunchackus.

256
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,440
I will use these only for good.

257
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,180
Petey pete,for letting
us use the sound booth,

258
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,410
please accept this chinchilla coat.

259
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,480
You're gonna get so much nice-nice in that
you're gonnaave to grow an another ding--

260
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,110
Tracy,this is bev.

261
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,460
The lady from the adoption thing.

262
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,910
Bev...

263
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,860
Now you look out for my girl,liz lemon,

264
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,400
'Cause me and her go way back
like spinal cords and car seats.

265
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,000
That's not really an expression.

266
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,060
Mr. Banks?

267
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,960
I thought you were going
to connecticut today.

268
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,950
I blew it off.

269
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,430
Nice to see you,liz.Let's
chitchat.What's that?

270
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,950
Man trouble,boot-cut jeans?Fun,bye!

271
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,340
Kenneth,it is imperative that you keep mr.
Banks down here until i can get to jack.

272
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,930
Do you know what "imperative" means?

273
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,920
Tell me,tell me!

274
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,270
Rock important.It means important.

275
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,830
I'll just be a minute,bev!

276
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,790
Mr. Banks,look how
many pushups i can do.

277
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,270
Devin'here!

278
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,470
Cover yourself.

279
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,320
You smell like strawberries.

280
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,840
That's the lip gloss she put on
me so i could be her fancy boy.

281
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,710
Is this the way my life
was supposed to play out?

282
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,230
The kid who walked four
miles every saturday to caddy

283
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,960
Because mother said that golf
was a game for businessmen?

284
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,660
Paid his way through princeton by
working the day shift at that graveyard

285
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,630
And the graveyard shift at the days inn?

286
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,670
22 years of single-mindedly fighting
my way to the top of this company.

287
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,480
Thank god i don't have your
biological need for children.

288
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,000
-That would make success impossible.
-Thanks.

289
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,120
This job was all i've ever wanted,lemon.

290
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,940
And now it hinges on how far i'm willing to
go with a woman in dora the explorer panties

291
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,230
that were clearly made
for an obese child.

292
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,820
Are you sure she wants sex?Maybe
she's just looking for attention.

293
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,150
I mean,her whole world is
stuffed unicorns and soap operas.

294
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,430
-Aren't soap operas all about sex?
-No,no way.

295
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,790
No,the best part of a soap opera is
when someone's twin interrupts a wedding

296
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,470
Or somebody pulls a gun
at the fitness center.

297
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,700
Hold on a second.

298
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,810
Kathy's texting me now.

299
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,420
She's wondering where
my strawberry mouth is.

300
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,390
Oh,nerds,it's bev.

301
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,580
Please be charming.

302
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,580
Hello,bev.I'm jack donaghy.

303
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,040
Have you had a tour of
our magnificent studio?

304
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,790
-I have not.
-Right this way.

305
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,190
This is what you're giving me as a "thk
you" gift--Some coupons for free hugs?

306
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,820
I'm suing you for my share of
your video game profits,tracy.

307
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
You're gonna sue me?

308
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,300
Would you like to see the green room?

309
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,330
Who do you think you
are,the san diego zoo?

310
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,410
You mean the nursery!

311
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,700
We gotta get this stuff back
to the rental place by 5:00.

312
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,450
I love you!Mommy,i love you!

313
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,650
Rock dear god.

314
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,530
Ms.lemon,did you lie to me
about their being a nursery here?

315
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,680
No!

316
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,850
Rick,what are you doing?

317
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,450
Bitch,my name is fred.

318
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,290
This is very disturbing,liz.

319
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,410
This is a very serious breach of trust.

320
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,890
Bev,allow me to explain.

321
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,030
I've been mentoring
lemon for some time now.

322
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,050
Are you her boss?

323
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,700
No,i work in the mail room.

324
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,710
Kathy,bev and i are just friends!

325
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,210
Kathy's the new ceo of our company.

326
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,290
Bev,you better run!

327
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,200
She's surprisingly strong!

328
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,480
Frank,i told you to change that hat!

329
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,920
Oh,god,how can i have a kid here?

330
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,250
I can't even keep a grown
woman safe in this place.

331
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,320
"unsatisfactory"?

332
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,060
Are you okay,bev?

333
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,520
You had quite a fall there.

334
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,350
Ah,i'm bev.

335
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,090
I'm here to do liz's
adoption evaluation.

336
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,540
Why,yes,hello,bev.

337
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,560
Did you just get here?

338
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,470
Yes,i'm here to do liz's
adoption evaluation.

339
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,180
Where's my clicky pen?

340
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,260
I get a do-over.

341
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,790
No,we have to take her to a hospital.

342
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,870
No,20 minutes.

343
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,430
Just give me 20 minutes.

344
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,920

Do-over,do-over!

345
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,770
She doesn't remember anything.

346
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,070
You heard what the lady
said.We're taking a mulligan.

347
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,990
Let's make this one count now.

348
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,090
It's time,lemon.

349
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,800
Kathy's texting me that devin's
gone.I have to go upstairs.

350
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,210
What are you gonna do?

351
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,350
I'm gonna give kathy the full soap opera while
you try to trick a lady with a head injury.

352
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,610
We might not be the best people.

353
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,790
But we're not the worst.

354
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,260
Graduate students are the worst.

355
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,360
Hi,i'm bev.Let's get stard.

356
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,170
Right this way!

357
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,560
I know liz would be
a wonderful mother...

358
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,120
Because she's intelligent and kind.

359
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,400
She reminds me of my own mom.

360
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,990
Tough love,consistency,a little
mustache in a certain light.

361
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,060
And other kids really like her.

362
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,050
What?

363
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,160
Hey,fred!

364
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,230
Well,i think i've seen
everything i need to see.

365
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,880
Man,do i have a headache.

366
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,220
Let's get down to brass tacks.

367
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,400
Liz,as a single woman with a
demanding job working in such a,well,

368
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,930
Nontraditional environment,

369
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,830
i'm sorry,but you're
not an ideal candidate.

370
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,150
But we did everything
perfectly this time.

371
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,530
Bev,listen to me.

372
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,190
Yes,i work very hard.

373
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,660
Almost all the time.

374
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,210
But i feel like my life
will open up and make room,

375
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,480
Just the same way that my heart will open
up and make room when i meet this baby.

376
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,600
And,yes,this place is not ideal,but
these weirdoes are family to me.

377
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,860
And so if this job is a deal-breaker,

378
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,010
Then you tear up my application and
i will start over someplace else.

379
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,550
I wish there were a box on these forms
where i could check off "passion."

380
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,470
Because that is exactly the kind of warmth
and assertiveness that we are looking for.

381
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,330
I am going to reconsider
your recommendation.

382
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,830
Oh,bev,thank you!

383
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,810
Rock thank you,bev!

384
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm bev.

385
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,380
I'm here to do liz's
adoption evaluation.

386
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,800
Gargh!

387
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,950
All right,take her to the hospital.

388
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,400
Let's get started.

389
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,980
What are you doing?Get upstairs.

390
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,360
Jonathan,not now.

391
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,310
Yes now!Jack kicked
me out of the office.

392
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,190
He's about to debase
himself to save the company.

393
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,090
Don't do this!If you do,you'll
be just as bad as devin.

394
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,390
Liz,what are you doing here?

395
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,370
I thought you were at the
fitness center with your twin.

396
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,760
What?

397
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,620
Liz,it's not what you think.

398
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,220
Kathy and i are just working together.

399
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,600
Kathy,you know my lover,liz.

400
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,140
That better be true,jack,or
i'll make both of you disappr,

401
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,180
Just like i did with vivienne and patch.

402
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,680
Don't be ridiculous,liz.

403
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,220
You know you're the only
woman i've ever really loved.

404
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,610
Kathy's my partner.

405
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,300
She's hiring me to advise her
in all her business matters.

406
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,190
Isn't that true,kathy?

407
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm sorry,darling.

408
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,020
I've just been paranoid ever since
that incident with the weather machine.

409
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,890
Kiss!Kiss!Kiss!

410
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,150

No,that's--

411
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,700
-No,i don't think so.
-No thank you.

412
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,020
Got any mail for me,donaghy?

413
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,550
It's all over,banks.

414
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,640
Kathy has hired me privately to
advise her on all business matters.

415
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,030
My god.That's her signature.

416
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,410
Yeah.

417
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,140
Well,i'm t stupid,jack.

418
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,940
I saw this day coming.

419
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,120
But i've already made provisions
for my financial future.

420
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,870
Check this out.

421
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm gonna sue you!

422
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,940
I've gonna sue the
entire city of new york!

423
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,100
I'm gonna sue you.

424
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,130
You can't sue me!

425
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,490
I'm already being sued!

426
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,070
Double indemnity!

427
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,010
No,no,no!

428
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,440
Lemon,h's your friend bev?

429
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,170
Unfortunately,bev has
made a full recovery.

430
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,220
So i have to start over
with another agency.

431
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,350
This might take a long time,actually.

432
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,580
The semi-virtuous path.

433
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,450
You won't regret it.

434
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,800
Did you need something else,lemon?

435
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,670
No.

436
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,450
I just like seeing you in there.

437
