1
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:08,645
I'm gonna duck uptown
and have lunch with my boyfriend.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,693
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:00:09,818 --> 00:00:12,510
Is that code for some kind
of older gal medical procedure?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,693
No, I really have a boyfriend.

5
00:00:14,818 --> 00:00:17,015
- Look, he's handsome and a doctor.
- A doctor?

6
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,819
Well, don't get too attached.

7
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,071
As soon as people realize
his tonics don't work,

8
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:22,783
it's on to the next town.

9
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,357
You know what I have a craving for?

10
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:28,135
Jerk chicken from that place
in Mill Basin?

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,069
And some?

12
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:31,947
Catalog photos of expectant mothers
in their swimming suits?

13
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:34,407
You are my radar O'Reilly.

14
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:38,003
Now get in here and rub my feet
till you hear a chopper coming.

15
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,582
How's Tracy?

16
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,953
- What's his mood?
- Upbeat and confused.

17
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,055
- Perfect. You know his contract is up.
- Has it been that long?

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,174
We sure have done some crazy things
with Tracy in the last three years.

19
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,167
We sure have.

20
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,956
I'm thinking about some of them now.

21
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:56,556
Me too.

22
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,873
Anyway, I'm handling
the Tracy thing myself.

23
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:02,184
Right. Play hardball.
Get your business jollies.

24
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:05,834
Sadly enough this time, with Tracy,
it's not about money anymore.

25
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,901
His video game made a fortune
and he invested all of it in a company

26
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,736
that dismantles bank signs.
They're doing very well.

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,107
- You don't think he's gonna leave?
- Don't worry.

28
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:17,701
When you're above money, personal
relationships become your currency.

29
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:20,036
Tracy and I have become quite close.

30
00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:22,452
Look. We got BFF bracelets.

31
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,207
You guys are best friends forever?

32
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,455
That's not what that stands for.

33
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,177
Why would you celebrate that?

34
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,033
Tell me where you went
to school again?

35
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:35,219
Well... I...

36
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,662
- You really look nice today.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:40,437
- Do you know her?
- No, I don't think so.

38
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:43,207
Wait! No!
That's my car!

39
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:44,728
Meter's expired.

40
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:46,574
I forgot to get quarters.

41
00:01:48,013 --> 00:01:49,941
You know what?
I got quarters.

42
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,623
- Thanks, officer.
- You're welcome.

43
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,795
People sure are nice to you.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,855
I guess.

45
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,903
Excuse me.
I'm Calvin Klein

46
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,495
and I think you should be
my next underwear model.

47
00:02:02,885 --> 00:02:03,955
Well, thanks.

48
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:08,029
You don't wanna get a card,
phone number?

Episode 315:
"The Bubble"

53
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,363
You went to Plunder for lunch?
How did you get a table?

54
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:40,742
I don't know. It was packed.
But they just gave Drew a table.

55
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,951
It's ridiculous how people treat him.
The chef sent over food.

56
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,255
Ladies sent drinks.

57
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,224
Mayer Bloomberg asked him to dance.

58
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,877
Beautiful people
are treated differently from...

59
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:52,421
moderately...
pleasant-looking people.

60
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,988
- It's true.
- They live in a bubble.

61
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,792
A bubble of free drinks,
kindness, and outdoor sex.

62
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:00,970
How did Drew turn out as well as he did
going through life like that?

63
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,292
The bubble isn't always a bad thing.
Look at me. I turned out OK, didn't I?

64
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,045
I want you to pay close attention

65
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,620
to the following
over-the-top eye roll.

66
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:10,522
Oh brother!

67
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:12,671
I don't share this often.

68
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,870
But this is a photo of me
when I was 25 years old.

69
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:18,673
What the... what?

70
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,865
You have a superman chest!

71
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,423
- I know.
- Oh, my god.

72
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:25,398
The lady will have
two tickets to the gun show.

73
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,413
And your eyes are so much bluer.

74
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,797
- What happened to your eyes?
- My point is,

75
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,552
the bubble doesn't last forever. So get
in there with Drew and enjoy those perks

76
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:35,589
- while you can.
- Can I keep that?

77
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:37,537
It's my only copy.

78
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,680
Everyone gather around please.

79
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,140
Actor announcement.
As you probably know,

80
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,348
especially if you read page six
of my publicist's emails,

81
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:52,647
I have decided to cut my hair
and donate it to charity.

82
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,484
But, why would you cut
your beautiful hair?

83
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,204
You look just how I picture
Mary Magdalene.

84
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:02,030
Because, I'm a selfless person
who can't get arrested in this town.

85
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,311
Meanwhile,
Tracy's face is everywhere.

86
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:07,187
I already explained that.
That was a police sketch of a flasher

87
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:09,789
who happened to look
like Tracy... We hope.

88
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,375
- Whatever. He's hogging the buzz.
- You've got buzz.

89
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,816
You were in that magazine that time.

90
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,456
I don't even know
what you're referring to.

91
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:21,174
And that was two years ago.

92
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,491
As usual, I have to create
my own opportunities.

93
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,431
No one will be talking about
Tracy Jordan this Friday

94
00:04:26,601 --> 00:04:28,933
when I cut my hair off
on The Today Show.

95
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,271
You're what I think
Judas looks like.

96
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,944
I hope you know
how much we value you here

97
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,458
at TGS. I like to think
of this staff as a family.

98
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,271
This is better than a family.

99
00:04:44,396 --> 00:04:46,993
No one around here asks me
for my damn bone marrow.

100
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,012
Why don't we make this
easy on ourselves

101
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:51,237
and renew your existing contract

102
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,036
with a 3% increase?

103
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:59,457
Sorry it took me so long to answer.

104
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:02,425
I was just thinking about
how weird it is that we eat birds.

105
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,394
All right, we have a deal.

106
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:07,514
You see how easy negotiating can be
when it's not really about money.

107
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,645
How's this really not about money?

108
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,185
Obviously you don't need to work.

109
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:13,978
What's that now, Charles?

110
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,439
I'm just saying
you made $300 million

111
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,703
last year,
so there's no financial need

112
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,214
for you to continue
with the show, but...

113
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,039
I never thought of it like that.
Thank you.

114
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,368
I quit. Goodbye.

115
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:32,254
Had he really not put that together?

116
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,208
Tracy's is a tactile
kinesthetic learning style.

117
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:38,256
So help me god...

118
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,471
It's nice of those guys
to give up their court for us.

119
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:45,696
Yes, for us.

120
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:52,559
So I should probably warn you
I was pro in college.

121
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,598
What?

122
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:55,287
I started teaching kids at the Y

123
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:58,190
and then all their mothers wanted
to take private lessons from me.

124
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,364
But I promise
I'll take it easy on you.

125
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,338
It's been a long time since college?

126
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:22,839
What do you mean?

127
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,164
Excuse me.
Do you give lessons?

128
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:38,439
- Now what is this?
- Dr. Drew's salmon bourguignon.

129
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:40,523
What is this orangey taste?

130
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:41,607
Gatorade.

131
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:54,454
That was awesome.

132
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:07,558
Are you choking?
I'm a doctor. Stay calm.

133
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:09,219
I just need to shake it loose.

134
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,057
Don't panic. I just need something
to push it down with.

135
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,434
Do you have a chopstick
or a fireplace match or something?

136
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,276
There you go.

137
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,146
Jack, there you are.

138
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:28,238
- I need to talk to you about something.
- The Tracy deal is a process.

139
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,548
We are in process.

140
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,826
Something happened with Drew.

141
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,317
- He's not a BFF?
- No! Never.

142
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,860
It's the bubble.

143
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:39,333
He is a doctor who doesn't know
the Heimlich maneuver.

144
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,334
He can't play tennis.
He can't cook.

145
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:43,355
He's as bad at sex as I am.

146
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:44,983
But he has no idea.

147
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,388
That is the danger
of being super handsome.

148
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,662
When you're in the bubble,
nobody tells you the truth.

149
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:51,804
For years I thought
I spoke excellent French.

150
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:57,058
Drew deserves to be told the truth.

151
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,463
He's a good person who is a victim

152
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,773
of our nation's obscene
cult of superficiality.

153
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,942
Did you tell him
that he was no good in tennis?

154
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,070
No, I let him win cause I wanted
to make out with him in the cab.

155
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,228
It's not fair
to let Drew live a lie.

156
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:15,138
- And I think I'm the woman to fix him.
- Be careful.

157
00:08:15,263 --> 00:08:18,204
You wake a sleepwalker,
you risk getting urinated on.

158
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:20,421
Or thanked... on.

159
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,220
- Mr. Jordan quit.
- What?

160
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,209
I thought you were in process.

161
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,259
Tracy's taking a strong position
right now in the negotiation.

162
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,886
It's not unheard of for him to stay home
while I formulate my counter-proposal.

163
00:08:35,011 --> 00:08:37,928
What if it doesn't work?
What if he doesn't come back?

164
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,269
When I get upset my accent come out!

165
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:44,897
And when it gets to comin' out
I can't get to talkin'...

166
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,525
I have a show on Friday.

167
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,933
It will be rectified.

168
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:50,486
I didn't mean to upset you.

169
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,573
Mr. Donaghy told us not to tell you
but I couldn't hold it in anymore.

170
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,409
Wait a minute. Are you hiding
your screw-up from me?

171
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:58,809
Don't cling to this.

172
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:00,410
Be a manager.

173
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:03,195
Control your people.
Buy better clothes.

174
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,151
I'm allowing this because
I made a misstep. I'm handling it.

175
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,296
And Tracy will be here
by Friday night.

176
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,747
Just get it done.

177
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,893
Nope, I lost it.
That was Batman.

178
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:18,220
Thank you team Jenna for being here.

179
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:20,214
Obviously my Today Show
charity haircut

180
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,268
is just the first step
in my reinvention.

181
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,289
- This is serial killer language.
- My mother's boyfriend raised me

182
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,815
to believe that a woman's hair
is her crowning glory.

183
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:29,821
A haircut
can make or break a career.

184
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:32,417
Before the Rachel, Jennifer Aniston
was just a chunky nobody

185
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,947
- who couldn't get a job.
- Wasn't she already on Friends?

186
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,367
Richard Esposito, move to the back.

187
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:40,170
If I make the wrong choice,
I could end up like Keri Russell,

188
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:41,412
<i>Felicity</i>, season 2.

189
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's brainstorm. Everyone shout out
words that describe my beauty.

190
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,751
- Fading.
- '80s.

191
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,721
1880s.

192
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:53,424
- You needed me?
- You know Rick from accounting?

193
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,552
- I don't. Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

194
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,812
I have arrange
for one of Tracy's childhood idols

195
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:01,489
to reach out to him.

196
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,860
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Tracy, this is Jack.

197
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:08,356
I have someone here
who wants to speak with you.

198
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,354
This is Bill Cosby.

199
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,237
- Really? This is your strategy?
- I heard him do this at a party.

200
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:15,850
I want you to come back to the TGS

201
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,366
for the people who like
the jokes and the things.

202
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,245
<i>Bill Cosby, you got a lot of nerve
getting on the phone with me</i>

203
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,496
<i>after what you did
to my aunt Paulette!</i>

204
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:25,957
I think you're confusing me
with someone else.

205
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,710
<i>1971, Cincinnati.</i>

206
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:30,736
<i>She was the cocktail waitress
with the droopy eye.</i>

207
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm the guy with the pudding...

208
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,727
<i>Try to tell me what to do?</i>

209
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:37,999
<i>Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable
with your light-ass kids.</i>

210
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,121
<i>Why would you make me
talk to this man?</i>

211
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:42,932
Don't hang up.

212
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,044
Tracy, this is Billy Dee Williams.
I just wanna say I love your work.

213
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,519
It's very smooth.

214
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:02,449
Sorry I'm late.
Why are you waiting here?

215
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:05,162
I put our name in
but it's gonna be a 45 minute wait.

216
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,207
What?
I'll go talk to the hostess.

217
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:09,936
I wanna show you something.

218
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,295
We're going to wait for the table.

219
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,727
I hate this.

220
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,593
This is gonna be unpleasant.

221
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:23,306
As Tracy's family and inner circle,

222
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,016
I wanted to enlist your help.

223
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,010
While I'm sure all of you
treasure him being home more...

224
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:30,873
I'm sorry. You want our help
with your problem?

225
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:32,982
You need to get
our father back to work.

226
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:34,567
That's what I'm trying to do.

227
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,068
You wanna see what he packed me
for lunch today?

228
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,890
Mayonnaise...

229
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,982
- And a pack of cigarettes.
- That is unfortunate.

230
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:45,036
He set up a home recording studio
in our rec room.

231
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,715
<i>My girl has a fat neck</i>

232
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:49,791
I'm sharp.
Let's do it again.

233
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,766
Thanks to you, I now have
an unemployed father.

234
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:56,255
You trying to make a stereotype
out of me? Did you even vote for Obama?

235
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,842
We've heard from Tracy junior.
Where is your mother?

236
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,387
Gone to take a spa week at Canyon Ranch
before my dad broke it in half.

237
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:05,765
What's that supposed to mean? I should
not have to hear that. I'm a child!

238
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,808
Tracy junior, George Foreman,

239
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,658
I want to get your father back to work
just as much as you do.

240
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,994
But what do I offer the man
who has everything?

241
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,401
I don't know what to do.

242
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,464
I didn't come here
to hear more excuses.

243
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,026
I'm here to see the dumbest
cracker in all of New York.

244
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,489
You gotta fix this, Donaghy.
Fix this!

245
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:24,028
You know I don't see it on the menu

246
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:26,285
but I would love a catfish po'boy

247
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,217
and a diet raspberry Fanta.

248
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:29,538
That is a great idea.

249
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,124
Let me order that for you.
Excuse me.

250
00:12:32,343 --> 00:12:34,493
We will have a turkeyburger deluxe

251
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:37,667
and a catfish po'boy
with a diet raspberry Fanta.

252
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,032
I'm gonna come back in five minutes

253
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,885
you try to order off the menu again

254
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,388
I will smack those glasses
off your face.

255
00:12:45,294 --> 00:12:47,149
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

256
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,561
What was that?
Why didn't she call you "sweetheart"?

257
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:54,504
And where's the complimentary
app sampler? What's going on?

258
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,233
This is how most people live.

259
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,413
See, because of your whole,
you know,

260
00:13:00,538 --> 00:13:02,823
- Disney prince thing...
- Actually they used

261
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,491
footage of me from high school
swim team to draw prince Eric.

262
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,410
Right, because of that...

263
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,663
you live in a bubble

264
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:12,791
where people do what you want
and tell you what you wanna hear.

265
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,859
- I don't think that's true.
- I'm gonna tell you for your own good.

266
00:13:15,984 --> 00:13:18,463
You can't put Gatorade on salmon.

267
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,624
Yes, you can. The hot Italian lady
from the food network told me so.

268
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,408
Did she say it on TV?

269
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,236
She said it to me when she jumped
escalators to try to talk to...

270
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,388
I don't wanna live that way.
I don't want you to treat me that way.

271
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,438
Are you sure?

272
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,087
I'm an adult.

273
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:38,482
You can be honest with me.
I can take it.

274
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:50,494
- That's game. Your serve.
- That's it! I quit!

275
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:53,330
This racquet is a fart
and you cheat!

276
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,394
You're a cheating bitch!

277
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,217
I need your help.

278
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,844
You know Tracy quite well,
wouldn't you say?

279
00:14:07,231 --> 00:14:10,431
I know Mr. Jordan like the back
of my stepfather Ron's hand.

280
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,433
I know all his ATM pin codes.

281
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,750
I know when he's cranky
and needs his binky.

282
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:17,725
I know that by binky
he means 1970s pornography.

283
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,191
So how is he functioning
without you?

284
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,443
I'm still doing everything for him.

285
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,239
Tonight I have to ride my bike
over to his house in New Jersey

286
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,780
to hold his hand during <i>Lost</i>.

287
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,575
That's it, don't you see?

288
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,745
- You're our ace in the hole.
- How dare you!

289
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,512
You're what I've been looking for.

290
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:36,415
The one thing at TGS
that Tracy cannot live without.

291
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:38,126
Now, I need you...

292
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,170
to cut Tracy off completely.

293
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,338
I don't know if I could do that.

294
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:45,627
You want him to come back, don't you?
This is the only way.

295
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:48,052
Don't answer that.
It could be Tracy.

296
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:51,305
But I have to answer the phones.
That's my job.

297
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,461
Hello. Studio 6H.

298
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,015
This is...

299
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:01,483
Cranston.

300
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,073
Hey Cranston,
I was looking for Kenneth.

301
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,528
<i>He's not here.</i>

302
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:08,925
But I'm sure wherever he is,
he loves you very much.

303
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,753
You seem really stressed out.
You wanna talk about what's going on?

304
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:23,671
I just hope it's not a mistake.

305
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,508
Maybe it is.
But you have to listen to your heart.

306
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,009
But why meddle
with something that was great?

307
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,012
It'll grow back.

308
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,180
What?

309
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,224
We're talking about my hair, right?

310
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:37,592
<i>Fat neck girl</i>

311
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,015
<i>Let me count your neck rings</i>

312
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,204
I'm thirsty!

313
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:45,265
Family!

314
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:47,665
Who's in charge of my thirst?

315
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,880
Why hasn't Kenneth
called me back yet?

316
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,086
I miss him.

317
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,512
Why are you crying?

318
00:16:06,072 --> 00:16:07,881
This is too hard, Mr. Donaghy.

319
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,991
I cannot stand by while Mr. Jordan

320
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:12,344
dies of dehydration
in his recording studio.

321
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,736
Plus, I've started
to dream as Cranston.

322
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,893
The more desperate Tracy becomes
the more our plan is working.

323
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,480
Next thing he'll do is show up here.
He'll demand you go with. You say no.

324
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,516
Stay strong and he'll cave.

325
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:27,233
Trust me.

326
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:28,570
I hope your right.

327
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,448
Because you're playing
with people's lives here.

328
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:33,906
Don't you think I know that?

329
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:38,871
We are back with sketch comedian
Jenna Maroney.

330
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,874
Thank you, Meredith.
But please, I'm not a hero.

331
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,516
Just trying to raise awareness

332
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,129
that I'm more than that hot chick
on Tracy Jordan's show.

333
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,182
- So this is for Locks of Love?
- Locks of Love turned me down.

334
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:51,888
They said my hair was too processed
for a sick person to wear.

335
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:54,887
But this is for a wonderful charity
called Merkins of Hope.

336
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,681
Let's make the big cut.

337
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:01,268
So what about that crazy news
that Tracy Jordan

338
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,138
- has quit TGS?
- What?

339
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:05,982
Word is he quit
over a contract dispute.

340
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,326
Guess you're the only star
left on that show.

341
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,916
Stop cutting my hair!
I don't need this anymore!

342
00:17:12,522 --> 00:17:13,405
It's OK.

343
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,784
It's OK.
I can fix this.

344
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,511
Is Tracy still not here?
We have 3 hours before the show.

345
00:17:22,636 --> 00:17:26,012
Security told me that
he's in the building, so it's working.

346
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:29,251
Now it's all up
to Kenneth Ellen Parcell.

347
00:17:31,921 --> 00:17:34,803
I've been calling you. Has Cranston
not been giving you my messages?

348
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,389
He told me.

349
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,517
Well... don't worry.

350
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,957
Just came to get a few of my things.

351
00:17:42,082 --> 00:17:43,732
Then I won't bother you.

352
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,943
All right,
I guess that's everything.

353
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,074
But I want you to know

354
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,853
if I walk out that door,

355
00:17:54,978 --> 00:17:56,572
I'm not gonna call again.

356
00:17:56,697 --> 00:17:57,697
It's over.

357
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,494
You understand?

358
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:04,373
I can't do this.

359
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,546
I'm sorry, but I can't.

360
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,257
Mr. Donaghy wanted me to stop
talking to you so you'd come back.

361
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,466
So you used Cranston
as his gatekeeper.

362
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:16,067
I'm very disappointed.

363
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,026
I know, I blew it.

364
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,328
I guess I'm only farm strong
and not heart strong.

365
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,878
Fine. Go and help him.
I shouldn't have tried to...

366
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,890
manipulate the two of you that way.

367
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:28,313
But I will need you
to turn in your page jacket.

368
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:31,257
What?

369
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:33,386
Your main duty
was taking care of Tracy.

370
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:34,820
He no longer works here.

371
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,573
Therefore your services
are no longer required.

372
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,852
As a page?

373
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:42,870
Wait a minute.
You want to fire my boy Ken?

374
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,792
Stay out of this.
It's not your concern.

375
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,791
- Unless.
- Unless what?

376
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,025
You said Kenneth can't work here
because I don't work here.

377
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,254
But if I work here, so can Kenneth.

378
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,633
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't, you idiot.

379
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,510
I'm coming back to work!

380
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:58,990
With Kenneth!

381
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,722
Damn you and your meddling.

382
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,515
I'll be in my dressing room.

383
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,017
Atta boy. Come on.

384
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,412
I've gotta get back
into that bubble.

385
00:19:18,222 --> 00:19:19,910
Sir, you are pulling that look off.

386
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,328
I wanted to apologize for my behavior
the other day on the tennis court.

387
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:25,078
That is not who I am.

388
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,623
- But you made me feel like a loser
- Cause you lost.

389
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,946
Maybe I shouldn't
have done that to you, but...

390
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:32,711
you have so much potential.

391
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,505
But I'm happy this way.

392
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:37,101
I didn't like it outside the bubble.

393
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,855
- It was very ironic.
- No, it wasn't.

394
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,151
- That's not how you use that word...
- Stop it.

395
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:44,015
I wanna use ironic however I want.

396
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,177
I wanna stay in the bubble.

397
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:48,645
And I want you in there with me.

398
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,130
Come on.

399
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,773
Come away with me.

400
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,526
We can go upstate
on my new motorcycle.

401
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,866
I don't think this is going to work.

402
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:08,164
I guess I'll see you around then.

403
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,576
Or as the french say,

404
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:16,214
I'll see you around.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
