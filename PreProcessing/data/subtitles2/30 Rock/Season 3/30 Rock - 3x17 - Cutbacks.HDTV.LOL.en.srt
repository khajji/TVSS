14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,700
I had to let jonathan go today.

Is gonna come under some very close scrutiny.

It's so bad. It's stsare hiring 
An outside consulting firm.

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,000
What does that mean?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,300
It means they're bringing in
hatchet men to trim the fat.

26
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,300
And on monday, you will have

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,700

theconsulting.

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,300
liz lemon. this is
my associate, peter hornberger.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,700
Liz, is there a conference room where
we can sit down And get started?

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Actually, i thought
we'd do this outside the box.

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
I'd like to tell you
about three television programs.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,600
A comedy show,
a musical variety show,

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,800
And a live television event.

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,600
Comedy, music show,
live show.

67
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,800
Comedy, music, live.

68
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,600
Are you getting it? Yeah.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,500
They're all the same show.
They're all tgs.

70
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,600
Now i could stand here, brad,
And i could bore you with numbers.

71
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,200
I could tell you that we are the number
one late night show among men 9-13

72
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,400
and the morbidly obese.

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,400
I could tell you that we'ree.In final negotiations
To create exclusive content for america's jails

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
But i'm not the one
being judged here.

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,000
So i thought i'd let
the show speak for herself.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
dessert!

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Someone put too many farts
in this engine!

78
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,200
It's about to explode!

79
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm flavor obama

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,800
and i'd like to introduce The under
secretary of housing and crystal meth, boy!

81
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,400
It's the bear and robot talk show!

82
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,300
My name is suri cruise.
Put your hands in the air.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,200
I came out of the womb
with a full head of hair.

84
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,100
It's farting!
It's farting!

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,100

This is tgs!

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
So where's that conference room?

89
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,800
- Oh. Golly.
- Whoa, k.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,600
I am sorry, mr. Jordan.
I'm just overworked.

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,300
With my page duties and being
mr. Donaghy's assistant,

92
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,200
There's not enough hours
in the day.

93
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
I'm sorry about that.

94
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,900
But just let me know
if there's any way i can help.

95
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,300
- Actually, there is one thing.
- No. I was just saying that.

96
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Why can't you read
human facial queues?

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,700
All right, what is it?

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, with both these jobs, I don't know
when i'm gonna be able to get home.

99
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm worried about my bird,
sonny crockett.

100
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,300
Would you mind going
to my apent and feeding him?

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,100
Yeah, okay. Birds are
like little dinosaurs.

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,700
So what i'll be doing is
actually pretty cool and brave.

103
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,600
Thank you, sir.
Here are my keys.

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,500
Oh, and one thing,
don't go into my bedroom.

105
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,200
- What?
- Do not go into my bedroom.

106
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,000
25%? How am i supposed
to cut a quarter of our budget?

107
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Well, there is some fat.

108
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,000
What about sid?

109
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,000
Sid? I can't fire our announcer.
He'll lose his insurance.

110
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,600
You know, he has a lot
of health problems.

111
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,200
Yeah, because he was hit by lightning
And can't really talk anymore.

112
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:16,400
It's tergis with tracky
ng-Jong And jimmy moop!

113
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,400
No. Sid is off the table.

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm not firing any of my people.
I'm not doing that to their families.

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Or in sid's case, their much younger wife
With whom they have an open relationship.

116
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,100
All right, we'll find
the money somewhere else.

117
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,500
- The food budget--
- No!

118
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,800
All right, what about straws?
We spend $1,200 a year on straws.

119
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,200
Okay, fine. No mstraws.

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,700
Everyone drinks
from the can from now on.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,200
- Oh, no, we need straws.
- Oh, god! That's its bathroom!

122
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Listen, liz, i'm gonna need your
revised budget By the end of today.

123
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,100
I don't know, brad.
Tgs is a complicated machine.

124
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,100
- Every part's important.
- Get it.

125
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,800
You don't want to be
the bad guy.

126
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,100
But if you don't make
the cuts, i will.

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,300
And i don't give a crap
about anyone here.

128
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,400
Matthew, i know this isn't ea
But the company's facing cutbacks.

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,900
And you have to admit your boom box
division Is a little bit behind the times.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
We're not behind the times,
we're groovy!

131
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,600
I can offer you
two weeks severance.

132
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,300
Mr. Donaghy, i know you said only
interrupt you If it was very important,

133
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,300
But tashonda from time
warner cable Is on the phone

134
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,200
And she's offering three
free months of showtime.

135
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
But we have to act now.

136
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,100
Kenneth, this does not qualify
As something important.

137
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,800
I do not want showtime.

138
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,100
I just didn't want you to miss out
On this exciting opportunity--

140
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,300
Thank you, kenneth.

141
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,600
Take your time.

142
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,700
Hey, little guy.

143
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,600

144
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,300
- Don't go in the bedroom.
- I wasn't going to!

145
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,900
I wa't going to! Bye!

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000

Mr. Donaghy is in an important meeting.
And i've been told not to interrupt him.

151
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,000
What is this pertaining to?

152
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,400
The tgs budget.

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Oh, my. That sounds very important.

154
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,800
- Mr. Donaghy.
- Kenneth!

155
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,100
i've worked here 20 years.

156
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,200
I was wrong.
That was not important enough.

157
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,900
It's me, kenneth the page,
this job is hard.

158
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,100
Please have a seat.
Mr. Donaghy will be right with you.

159
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
Do you know what these
meetings are about?

160
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,900
I hear people are getting fired.

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,700
Yeah. I don't know.

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,900
- Do you know jack donaghy well?
- Pretty well.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Do you happen to know
If he's a boob man or a butt man?

164
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,000
- What? Why wouou ask that?
- Because i don't want to get fired.

165
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,900
So i'm gonna have to go in there
And boink my way out of this

166
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm cheryl, by the way.

167
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
You're gonna try to have sex with jack?

168
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,400
I have to.
I have 15 employees.

169
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm responsible for them.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,100
Well, yeah, i have
200 people under me, but--

172
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,900
Wow. Maybe we could team up,
go in there together,

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
- lez out, give him a show.
- No. Cheryl, get a grip.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh, boy.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,500
Miss lemon, mr. Donaghy
will see you now.

176
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Make it quick, lemon.

177
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,100
I'm in the middle
of a very unpleasant day.

178
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Okay, well, so am i.

179
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,100
I know this cutback stuff
is difficult.

180
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,600
I don't want to fire anyone.

181
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
And i don't want to take
anything away from my crew.

182
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,900
And i want to keep making free,
long-Distance prank calls

183
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,300
To people like seattle's
richard sacmuncher.

184
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,800
And i think
that's reasonable.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
So what do i do
to get out of this?

186
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
The only thing to do is make your cuts
And live to fight another day.

187
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,800
What? That's it?

188
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
I thought you'd tell me
to cook the numbers

189
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,000
Or shred something or do
some pelican brief stuff.

190
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,900
Why is everyone talking
about that movie?

191
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,100
It's playing
on showtime.

192
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
Kenneth, get me showtime.

193
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,200
What? Why now?

194
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,300
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,400
I know this is hard,
but there's no way out of it.

196
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,300
Well, little heads up,
Your next meeting might disagree.

197
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
She's planning to change
your mind By hitting...

198
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,900
- ...that.
- Oh, no, not again.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,700
This last guy tried
to take my belt off.

200
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
But the sad thing is,
it sometimes works.

201
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,200
Sexual bartering pays off.

202
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,500
Salome. Mata hari.
Deborah norville.

203
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,500
Well, good luck downstairs.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

204
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,100
Oh, and one more thing,

205
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,400
uh, don't cut the straw budget
'Cause i've already cut the exterminators.

206
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Jenna, something weird
is going on.

207
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,000
You mean this budget stuff?
Don't worry about it, tracy.

208
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,900
It's just gonna affect
the non-Specials.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,100
No, it's not that.

210
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,700
Jenna, you're the smartest
person i know.

211
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,900
You think kenneth
could be a murderer?

212
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,900
What? Why would you
think that?

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, i might be crazy,

214
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,300
But neither he nor his bird
would let me into his bedroom.

215
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,900
And why wouldn't you want
to let tracy jordan Into your bedroom

216
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
unless you got a bunch
Of dead nurses in there?

217
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, i had to study serial killers To prepare
for my role as criminal profiler Jill st. Ferrari

218
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,300
in the lifetime original
miniseries Hushed rapings.

219
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,700
And all masked murderers
share three characteristics:

220
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,200
Cruelty to animals...

221
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,300
- He grew up killing pigs!
- Bedwetting.

222
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,500
No wonder he's fascinated
when i do that!

223
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,800
And an inability to read
human facial queues!

224
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,000
I admonished him
for that earlier!

225
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Three for three.
He's a monster!

226
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,400
Okay, we've gotta go
tell jack.

227
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,700
You know, if kenneth is actually
a killer, We're gonna be heroes.

228
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,500
Liz, our food is gone.
They took it.

229
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It happened this morning.

230
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,500
Do you have a cookie?
Mommy's baby needs his yum-Yums.

231
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Oh, my god.
Sid, did you get fired?

232
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Good-Bye, lerz.

233
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,100
- Liz, it's a massacre!
- What is going on?

234
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Brad came in this morning
and started making cuts.

235
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,700
I can't go back to
teaching high school math.

236
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,900
Those girls pretend
they're not women yet, But they are.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,400
- Do something, liz.
- You're our only hope.

238
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,800
Halster, you look hot in those trousers.

239
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,500
how about we grab drinks tonight?

240
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,600
Marissa, update my sched.

241
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
Good morning, sir.

242
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,200
Kenneth, i know there's a ere,
But i need you to focus.

243
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,500
No mistakes now.

244
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,200
Think before you speak.

245
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,800
Understand?

246
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,100
Yes.

247
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,200
- oh.
- Hey, k.

248
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,200
- Where's jonathan?
- Jonathan's not here anymore.

249
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,100
- How may i help you?
- Um, we need to see jack.

250
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,900
I don't know if i can allow that.

251
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,300
I've made some mistakes lately.

252
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,700
- Terrible mistakes.
- Uh-Huh.

253
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,400
So i need to know
what this is about.

254
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,400
I can't have you getting me
into trouble.

255
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,600
It's not about you.

256
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,100
Yeah,t'out someone else.

257
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,700
I'm afraid this guy know in ca
Might be a serial killer.

258
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,100
- And what his name?
- Kenneth.

259
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,100
I mean--I'll tell you his name.

260
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,000
It's kenneth.

261
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,500
Excellent. 

262
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,500
I will be sure to let him know As soon as
he's done firing steven lee from microwaves.

263
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,800
What?

264
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,700
Oh, mr. Lee, i forgot.
He's ready for you now.

265
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
I've got chills.
He's evil.

266
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
If i had any doubts out this before,

267
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,600
and i don't think i did,
they're gone now.

268
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,600
We gotta go to his apartment
and save who we can.

269
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,900
We're defitely gonna be heroes.

270
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,400

in the pelican brief!

271
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,300

You're our hero.

279
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,800
They may take my dignity,

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,200
But they will never take our straws!

281
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,600
Yeah!

282
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Oh, my god.

283
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
Why does he have a rolled up towel
Against the bottom of the door?

284
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,100
It's so creepy!

285
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,900
Jenna, i just want you to know that
if we find Any human remains in there,

293

We know the deal.
Let's cut to the chase.

298
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,700
That's certainly direct.

299

We go upstairs.20 minutes.
Open mouth.I will work your ears.

300

I don't know, liz. What you're
asking me to do is a big deal.

301
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,800
If i go through with this,
i need to know it's worth it.

302
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Fine. 30 minutes.
I'll make some sounds.

303
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,100
And you can say
one weird thing to me.

304
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,700
All right, hardball.
30 minutes. sounds.

305
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,900
Top front of my body is now
in play. Deal?

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,200
Deal.

307
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Lemon, i heard a rumor that you went out
With one of the consultants last night.

308
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,400
Well, i had no choice.

309
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,300
I had to give him
a little taste of the lemon.

310
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,900
And it was not sour,
my friend. Not sour.

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
It's interesting
you put it that way

312
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,000
Because your writers' room is now the headquarters

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For telemundo's coverage of
world cup soccer qualifying.

314
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,000
<i>Equador tiene que ganar
o atar contra peru</i>

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,300
<i>Para avanzar en los finales.</i>

316
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
- What the what?!
- Ssh.

317
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Brad and i had a deal.
I gave him top front.

318
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,800
Top front? Good lord, lemon,
that's your worst quadrant.

319
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Kenneth, you know how you told
tracy Not to into your bedroom?

320
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,300
Well, naturally, we assumed
you were a serial killer.

321
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
and as you can imagine,
your bird is dead.

322
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,000
yeah, but on the bright side,

323
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,100
You've been downgraded From
"suspect" to "person of interest."

324
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,000
Some day, we're gonna
look back on this and laugh.

325
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,500
time does heal all wounds!

326
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
now you wait just one minute.

327
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,900
I am sorry to be using my barn voice
In front of a lady, but i am riled up.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,800
it is not enough that you killed
the bird I've had for almost 60 years.

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But the fact that you didn't
trust me is unforgivable.

330
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,700
But whd i expect?

331
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,600
Look at you two walking around
without a care in the world

332
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
As budgets are slashed

333
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,300
And people keep getting called
into mr. Donaghy's office To be fired.

334
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,800
I may just be a non-Special,

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,300
But what you two did
is inexcusable.

336
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,700
Good day.

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm out of letters.I have to
return my kids' braces.

338
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
What did you do?
We trusted you!

339
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,000
You ruined it
with your talking, didn't you?

340
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Hey!

341
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,200
Why are you
still messing with my show?

342
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,300
What about last night?

343
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,200
Liz, last night was what it was,
But business is business.

344
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Right. And last night,
i gave you the business.

345
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,100
We had an agreement.
Top front and some light ear work!

346
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,400
You got your quid, halst
where's my quo?

347
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,700
Oh, my god.

348
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Last night was about the show?

349
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,300
Oh, please,
you know it was.

350
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,100
You were all, oh,
it's gotta be worth it

351
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
And what you're asking me to do
is such a big deal.

352
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,200
It was a big deal.

353
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
Being with a woman for the
first time since my wife died.

354
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,900
- Ah, snap.
- It was just a transaction?

355
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
What kind of person are you?!

356
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,400
Does it help if i tell you I thought
we were doing sexual espionage?

357
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,100
Oh, god.

358
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,600
Sharon! Angel!

359
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,700
i swore to you the next
one would be worthy, But she's not!

360
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,900
she's a monster!

361
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,000
Marissa, add dr. Walters
to my sched.

362
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,500
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

363
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,700
Okay

364
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,800
so mr. Halster has filed a complaint
against you With human resources.

365
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,200
Specifically, his claim suggests that you tried to barter
sex In exchange for professional consideration.

366
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,400
In the human resource world, We refer to
that as "being a filthy prostitute."

367
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,900
Now, since this is your first incident

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
And, uh, mr. Donaghy has explained
The mitigating circumstances...

369
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,300
I'm convinced that this sexual outburst
Was brought on by menopause.

370
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,400
We are recommending only
a two-Week suspension Without pay.

371
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Okay. That's fair.

372
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,000
and obviously mr. halster cannot
function In this hostile work environment.

373
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,700
His company has reassigned him.

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And your budget review process
will start over again Under my supervision.

375
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,800
- Really.
- Yes, really.

376
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,000
I hope you've learned
your lesson, miss lemon.

377
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,200
When you harass sexually
in the workplace,

378
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,500
Things do not somehow
just work out in the end.

379
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,600
Mr. Donaghy, i thought you'd like to know
That there's a spider on the printer.

380
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,500
Oh, no.
Am i interrupting?

381
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,600
Is this another firing meeting?

382
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,200
It is now.

383
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,400
Kenneth, have a seat.

384
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,700
Ken, we feel bad that we--
But mostly jenna--Gassed your bird.

385
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I agree.

386
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Not to name names, but it's so sad That
a certain black individual Found it necessary

387
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,100
to trick someone so pretty
Into believing you were a murderer.

388
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm sorry, is there
a point to all this?

389
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
I've had a bad couple of days.

390
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,800
Well, we feel terrible
about what happened,

391
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,800
So we did a little something
to make it up to you.

392
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,900
looks like i've got
some naming to do.

393
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,100
Pat. Balthazar. Donna.

394
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
lorne. michael.
