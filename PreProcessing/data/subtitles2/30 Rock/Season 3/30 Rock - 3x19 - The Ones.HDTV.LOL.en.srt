1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:03,955
Hi.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,674
I'm looking for an engagement ring.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,909
Are you sure?

4
00:00:12,503 --> 00:00:14,477
Maybe you should have had a ring
The first time you proposed

5
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:17,086
- then Elisa wouldn't have said no.
- She didn't say no.

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,982
- She said we should think about it.
- Yeah, that does not mean yes.

7
00:00:20,017 --> 00:00:22,095
In my experience,
"let's think about it"

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,294
usually ends up with
me watching solid gold

9
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,763
in my basement on prom night.

10
00:00:25,798 --> 00:00:28,602
The point is I have thought about it,
and I haven't changed my mind.

11
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:32,625
In fact, I've coined a new term
to describe what Elisa is to me:

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,587
- The one.
- The one?

13
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:36,754
As in the only one for me.

14
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,307
The one I'm meant to be with.
Get it? The one.

15
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:40,541
Yeah, you should be a writer.

16
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:44,787
Whoa, check out the bling!
Or whatever it's called now.

17
00:00:44,822 --> 00:00:46,899
- Aah!
- Huh!

18
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,593
- Good god.
- I got it!

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,129
Oh, god, there's a vent!

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,129
She's very... Spirited.
Like a show horse.

21
00:00:59,197 --> 00:01:02,493
- You're a lucky man.
- Oh, no, no. She's not the bride.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,432
- This is the one I am marrying.
- Oh, my apologies, sir.

23
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:09,435
Please follow me to the real showroom.

24
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,664
- Yes.
- My finger is caught in the vent.

25
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:18,327
Hey, where are my snow balls?

26
00:01:18,362 --> 00:01:20,674
I was gonna go to the gym later,
so I deserve a treat.

27
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,661
Oh, Miss Lemon,

28
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,702
we can't have coconut products out
anymore because of staff allergies.

29
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:27,217
What? No, allergies are psychosomatic.

30
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:30,398
The only reason I'm allergic to dogs
is because one bit me

31
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:33,412
- the first time I got my period.
- No, allergies are real.

32
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:35,805
If I have a strawberry,
my throat shuts up

33
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:38,941
- Faster than a girl in math class.
- I didn't know you had allergies.

34
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:40,678
You know if my cousin
Stephanie eats a walnut,

35
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:42,679
Her throat shuts up faster
than a Filipino at a...

36
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:44,681
Guys! Come on. Not okay.

37
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Rossitano,
no unauthorized food.

38
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:49,742
Don't worry, no food in here, Kenneth.

39
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:52,328
Just a doughnut box with a mouse in it.

40
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,821
Oh, are the pranks-men
going after Lutz again?

41
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:55,894
Someone say my name?

42
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:58,723
- Hey, look.
- Awesome! Doughnuts!

43
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:00,763
Aah! Aah!

44
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,219
Oh!

45
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,882
Hey, we've narrowed
it down, Liz Lemon.

46
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,266
Oh, great.
What are we talking about?

47
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:31,001
Tracy has to get a
present for his wife.

48
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:35,134
This Saturday is the 20th anniversary
of the night that me and Angie met.

49
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,876
She was working at the
Dyker Heights Arthur Treacher's,

50
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,200
and I was residing there.

51
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:43,175
She slipped me a free shrimp combo,
and we've been together ever since.

52
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,507
So this present has to be special.

53
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:49,027
It's either gonna be a denim jacket
that says "hot bitch" in diamonds...

54
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:51,179
- Uh-huh.
- Or a slanket.

55
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:54,706
{\pos(200,210)}Yeah, Angie doesn't want that.

56
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,632
{\pos(200,220)}Why don't you just ask
Angie what she wants

57
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,667
{\pos(200,220)}instead of spending
all this money on junk?

58
00:02:58,702 --> 00:03:02,919
{\pos(200,220)}You are wise, Liz Lemon.
Like a genetically manipulated shark.

59
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:06,806
{\pos(200,220)}So as a token of my gratitude,
I got something specially for you.

60
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:09,765
{\pos(200,220)}Wow.

61
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,244
{\pos(200,220)}I'll take that slanket too
if you're not gonna use it.

62
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,138
{\pos(200,220)}- Puerto Rican!
- That's interesting.

63
00:03:16,173 --> 00:03:19,221
{\pos(200,220)}I mean Puerto Rico,
where you're supposed to be.

64
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:22,242
{\pos(200,220)}- When did you get back?
- Actually, Lemon, three weeks ago.

65
00:03:22,277 --> 00:03:25,005
{\pos(200,220)}- What? Why doesn't Jack know that?
- Because I don't know what to do.

66
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,227
{\pos(200,220)}I'm afraid he's gonna want to go through
with his proposings of marriage.

67
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,162
Sorry, I haven't spoken
English in two menses.

68
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:33,938
{\pos(200,220)}Are you saying that you
don't want to go through

69
00:03:33,973 --> 00:03:35,964
with his proposings of marriage?

70
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,134
{\pos(200,220)}I don't understand, Elisa.
You love him.

71
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,106
{\pos(200,220)}- I do. That's why I call him "El Uno. "
- Yeah.

72
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:45,787
{\pos(200,220)}But I cannot marry him
because of a terrible secret.

73
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:49,062
{\pos(200,220)}- Please don't ask me what it is.
- I won't. I don't want to know.

74
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:52,076
- Are you a man?
- Really?

75
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,621
That's your guess, a man?

76
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:56,088
- You want to see me naked?
- Sort of.

77
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,983
{\pos(200,220)}I love Jack so much.

78
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,474
I don't think I have the strength
to tell it to his head.

79
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,931
- That's why I was hoping that you...
- Oh, no, no, no!

80
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:09,602
Oh, thank you for
doing what I cannot.

81
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:12,672
Good-bye forever,
Liz Lemon.

82
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,474
Well, I see why he likes it.

83
00:04:21,716 --> 00:04:23,555
{\pos(200,220)}I hope you guys
have learned a lesson.

84
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,335
Because of what you did,
we almost lost a monitor.

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,414
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,370
You're a big fan of mine,
and you're not gay?

87
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:36,575
- Not even bi-curious?
- I don't know what to tell you.

88
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:38,622
I love your show.
I read your blog.

89
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,307
I've got all your albums.
Even the one you did with Phil Spector.

90
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:44,129
I still think that would have sold much
better If he had shot me in the face.

91
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:46,248
Well, I'm glad you
didn't get shot in the face.

92
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,433
- Thank you.
- But if you had...

93
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,122
I would have liked to
have gotten that call.

94
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,701
That would have been nice.

95
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,366
Jenna, Us Weekly is calling to confirm
a story that your animal rescue shelter

96
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:59,397
is supplying quesadilla meat
to amusement parks.

97
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,066
What?!
I need to call my lawyer.

98
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,108
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

99
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:07,287
Dude, we have got to go man.
I stole some pens.

100
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:13,027
Mr. Lutz, this is my telephone number.
Please give it to Jenna Maroney.

101
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,315
You okay?
Good!

102
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:27,583
Hey Jack, do you have a sec?

103
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:30,587
It's over Lemon.
It's over before it started.

104
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:32,972
- Drink with me.
- I'm Sorry,

105
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,787
but I'm glad it didn't
have to come from me.

106
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,959
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

107
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:41,841
Wigo.com, Sheinhart's Wigs
user generated video content site.

108
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,042
All anybody posted on it were penises.

109
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:49,271
- What did you want to talk to me about?
- Hey, Jack... Right... Okay...

110
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:50,957
I've been trying to
figure out how to

111
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:53,588
- not tell you this...
- Oh mi amor.

112
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:57,059
- Querida!
- I'm Back. Let's Get married.

113
00:05:57,347 --> 00:06:01,166
I'll call Pablo to have them hold the table.
So we can celebrate in style.

114
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,848
And carbo-load for the reunion sex.

115
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:07,849
Lemon, isn't it wonderful?

116
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,434
Don't dare say anything about
what I told you about my secret.

117
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:12,503
I'm not going to,
because you have to.

118
00:06:18,352 --> 00:06:22,152
♪ baby cried the day
the circus came to town. ♪

119
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:26,101
- Uh... You okay?
- Oh, I didn't see you there.

120
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,111
I'm fine.

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,054
♪ Don't cry out loud! ♪

122
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:34,748
You sure you don't want to
talk about something?

123
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:38,193
Well, it's kinda none of your business.
But all right.

124
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:40,991
I met this cute paramedic yesterday.

125
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,160
He thinks I'm incredible,
we're perfect for each other.

126
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,037
But he left before
I could get his name.

127
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,497
Well, I'm sure there's a way to find out.

128
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,659
I called 911, they wouldn't even
connect me to their celebrity service.

129
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,360
I don't know what to do!

130
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:56,061
You know, your dilemma reminds me
of a book I read once.

131
00:06:56,062 --> 00:06:58,307
- See ya later Pete.
- No, no, listen, listen.

132
00:06:58,342 --> 00:07:01,503
There's this question psychiatrists
use to identify sociopaths.

133
00:07:01,564 --> 00:07:03,425
A woman goes to her mother's funeral,

134
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,905
where she meets the perfect man,
it's love at first sight.

135
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:09,203
But he leaves before she
finds out who he is. So...

136
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:11,777
What does she do to see him again?

137
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:15,372
She kills her father hoping that
the guy will come to that funeral too.

138
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:18,167
That's correct!
Oh boy...

139
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:20,544
- Thanks for the advice.
- No, no, no. That wasn't advice.

140
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,739
But of course she'd also have to
kill her father's doorman,

141
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:24,053
and anyone else who might have seen her

142
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,235
and you for giving her
the idea in the first place.

143
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:41,271
- Liz Lemon, you dummy!
- I'm Wearing it as a joke.

144
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:44,005
I asked Angie what she
wanted for our anniversary

145
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,616
and she wants me to get
a tattoo of her name

146
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:48,006
Oh, okay, you like tattoos.

147
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,618
And above it she wants
this picture of her face.

148
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:54,674
I can't have this on my chest
scaring off beautiful women in the clubs.

149
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,587
- Tracy...
- You know I like to socialize Liz Lemon.

150
00:07:57,622 --> 00:08:00,161
and you know my signature
move with the ladies.

151
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:02,419
- is taking off my shirt!
- Is taking off your shirt!

152
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,413
Now it's a Sophie's choice.

153
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:11,613
I can't get this tattoo,
and I can't tell Angie no.

154
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:12,835
What do you want me to say Tracy?

155
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,430
I'm sorry I made it harder
for you to cheat on your wife?

156
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,810
That's a start Liz Lemon.
That's a start!

157
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:43,223
Strawberries!

158
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,954
My real name is Diplin!

159
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,983
Oh, somebody call
the cute guy at 911!

160
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:54,325
Lemon I need to ask you
something about Elisa.

161
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:57,290
Did she say anything to you,
anything at all, about a secret...

162
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:02,764
- Desire to keep her maiden name?
- Oh, no, sorry.

163
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,032
Because I'd like her to be Elisa Donaghy,

164
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,430
but if she wants to be Elisa Padriera Donaghy...

165
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,012
Elisa Padriera?
Ah!

166
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,700
- Viuva negra!
- What?

167
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:15,454
- What does that mean?
- The black widow!

168
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:17,621
Elisa has a terrible secret,
my current theory is

169
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:19,328
she's the mother of those
Michael Jackson's kids.

170
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:26,321
Okay, I searched Elisa Padriera
and the black widow,

171
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,911
But all the web sites are in Spanish.

172
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,384
- Blue writing on green. Why?!
- Call that cleaning lady back.

173
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,395
- We need somebody who speaks Spanish.
- I speak Spanish.

174
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:35,564
- Puerto Rican!
- La viuva negra!

175
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,167
Really, Lemon?

176
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:41,622
- Jack, let me explain.
- Elisa, there is nothing you can say

177
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,292
That will change the way I feel.

178
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:46,328
I'm so sorry to tell
you such a dark tale

179
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,478
while wearing such a silly T-shirt.

180
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,738
I was married once,
and I killed my husband.

181
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:55,531
It was a crime of passion.

182
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:57,705
He cheated on me.

183
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,730
And in a rage I took my revenge.

184
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,149
You know me, Jack.

185
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:03,435
I'm a Catholic.

186
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,112
I take the bonds of
marriage very seriously.

187
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,695
- Why aren't you in jail?
- They threw my case out.

188
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,185
I couldn't get an impartial jury
after that song about me came out.

189
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:15,557
♪ Elisa, Elisa ♪

190
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:17,292
♪ La viuda negra ♪

191
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:18,481
♪ Elisa ♪

192
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,052
I guess I'm glad you know.

193
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:24,706
I understand if this changes everything.

194
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:26,377
It's up to you.

195
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,343
My god,

196
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:35,677
I already put my wedding announcement
in cigar aficionado.

197
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,969
How about this?
You get the tattoo,

198
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:42,538
but when you hit the clubs,

199
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,339
you draw a mane around
the face with a marker,

200
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:49,187
and make it look like a
lion named "Tangiers".

201
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,689
Dotcom, that is a great idea!

202
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,682
If you want everyone to
think I own a gay lion!

203
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:58,336
- Tangiers?!
- No judgment in brainstorming.

204
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:00,981
Look, this is my reputation
we're talking about here!

205
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,529
Use your heads!

206
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:07,418
The Moroccan national
soccer team is the lions.

207
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,935
Tangiers is in Morocco.

208
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,111
So, yeah, I guess I'm an idiot.

209
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:15,402
Have you ever met anyone
that's killed somebody?

210
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:18,449
I think my grandpa may have.

211
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:21,912
But he never really liked to talk about
what happened at Kent State.

212
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,554
I still want to marry Elisa.

213
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:28,020
- Wow, you do? Really?
- So she had one bad day.

214
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,978
Being in a relationship means
overlooking certain flaws.

215
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,381
I mean,
somewhere right now,

216
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,928
a guy is on a j-date
with Monica Lewinsky.

217
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:35,627
Nobody's perfect.

218
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,083
- Jack!
- I'm 50.

219
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:41,021
To put it in perspective,
that's like 32 for ladies.

220
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:42,881
How many more Elisas
am I going to meet?

221
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,181
Okay, well,
God bless.

222
00:11:45,249 --> 00:11:48,215
I guess I just really
don't understand men.

223
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:50,285
Nobody ever said you did,
Lemon.

224
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,137
Nyah...

225
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:54,865
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

226
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,181
I'm sorry, what are
you two doing here?

227
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,096
Where's the hot guy?

228
00:11:58,161 --> 00:11:59,705
Ma'am, are you taking any medication?

229
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,421
Yes. Where's the cute paramedic
who was here last night?

230
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,358
He was wearing a uniform.
He was totally into me.

231
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:06,579
If he was here at night,
he must work the evening shift.

232
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:08,326
So there are different shifts?

233
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:10,948
Like on a Sheik's pleasure yacht.

234
00:12:11,562 --> 00:12:12,818
Thank you.

235
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:15,476
Lemon.

236
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,377
It's not product placement.
I just like it.

237
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,581
- What?
- What?

238
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:21,540
What if I marry Elisa
and I accidentally cheat?

239
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,998
She could snap again.

240
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,665
She's very passionate, and she doesn't
react well to betrayal.

241
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,140
Why won't you open?!

242
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:33,106
Yes. What a quandary.
Oh, wait, I have a suggestion...

243
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,349
- Don't cheat.
- But you never know, Lemon.

244
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:37,676
What if I find myself
stranded in a snow cave

245
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,944
with a stern but comely lady geologist,

246
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,887
both of us knowing that
our only chance for survival

247
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:43,631
is the heat from our naked bodies?

248
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,835
- Sorry, I just do not get you guys.
- Again, that is not being disputed.

249
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,361
But my options for male
advice around here are limited.

250
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:53,368
So I think the pranks-men
should all wear fedoras.

251
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:55,303
- Could the hats have feathers?
- Yes! Yes!

252
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:59,956
Face it, you are the closest thing to
a man working here right now.

253
00:13:00,501 --> 00:13:01,958
Well, dude,

254
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:05,764
I guess you gotta find a comely geologist
and a snow cave and see what happens.

255
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,886
Tracy, I need your help.

256
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:11,005
My fiancee murdered her ex-husband
when he cheated on her.

257
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:13,828
- Continue.
- I love her.

258
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:16,639
But the only way I can make
sure that I won't stray...

259
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,707
is for me to arrange a
test of erotic temptation.

260
00:13:19,774 --> 00:13:21,681
- Yes.
- Exactly.

261
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:24,551
We're going out tonight, Jackie D,

262
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:28,517
and you're gonna be tempted
like Jesus in the wilderness.

263
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:32,815
Jesus is my stereo guy, and the
Wilderness is a club I took him to once.

264
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,694
Jenna, come quick.
Kenneth's passed out again.

265
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,997
Oh, no, I can't believe this
is happening during night shift!

266
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,709
Oh, for god sakes!
What is this, third watch?

267
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,513
Somehow Kenneth ate strawberries again,

268
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:51,705
and now he's gone into
acute strawberry shock.

269
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:54,605
- Is that a thing?
- Just ask this real EMT.

270
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:56,953
We're gonna have to cut off his hands
to get the sickness out.

271
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,182
He's gonna have to learn
how to urinate with his feet.

272
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,177
- How could this have happened again?!
- It's my fault. I did it.

273
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:05,637
I just wanted that hot EMT to come back.
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

274
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:09,804
Oh Kenneth, I'm so sorry.
But I am not a monster.

275
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,876
I'm just a girl standing in
front of a boy she poisoned

276
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,357
So this other boy
would go to town on her.

277
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,193
- I think she's had enough, sirs.
- Aw, Kenneth!

278
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:21,329
What's happening?
Is this a trick? I knew it!

279
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,059
I was just playing along.
No, seriously, what's happening?

280
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:26,584
Jenna, do you feel genuine remorse?

281
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:27,636
Thank god.

282
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:30,604
Sociopath downgraded
to extreme narcissist.

283
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,945
Now quit it with the strawberry stuff.

284
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,131
Or you might once again
feel the righteous lash

285
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,597
of the pranks-men.

286
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:41,511
Is that a thing?

287
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,612
Hey, Tray.

288
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,615
- You and your friend wanna party later?
- Sure thing, baby.

289
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,712
Give the kid a call.

290
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,069
- Holla.
- This is decadent?

291
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:56,582
And I once went to Miami
with Darryl Strawberry.

292
00:14:56,617 --> 00:14:59,066
Tip of the iceberg, Jackie D.

293
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:01,362
You can have all of
this whenever you want.

294
00:15:01,397 --> 00:15:04,867
Or you can marry that nice
lady that you're in love with.

295
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,859
- It's up to you.
- Look, I love Elisa.

296
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,491
- But you love Angie, right?
- Of course I do. Angie's the one.

297
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:13,420
The one?
Where did you hear that?

298
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,218
It's a thing I made up
after seeing the Matrix.

299
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:19,171
Well, Elisa is my one.
But Tracy,

300
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:22,117
sometimes I think men like us
aren't built for marriage.

301
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:27,904
Okay, this is something
I've never told anyone.

302
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:29,927
This is my terrible secret.

303
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,110
In the 20 years that I've known her...

304
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:35,693
I've never cheated on my wife.

305
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,770
There.
I said it.

306
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:40,529
Don't look at me.

307
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,054
Wait a minute.
That can't be the truth.

308
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,374
The partying is just for show.

309
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:48,015
And because I'm a
high-functioning alcoholic.

310
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,942
All the phone numbers
you see me hand out,

311
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:51,729
They're not even mine.

312
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,936
Hello?

313
00:15:56,971 --> 00:15:59,161
No, this isn't Tracy Jordan.

314
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:01,315
Really?

315
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:04,514
I've not heard of that term before.

316
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,879
Do you know how to get to Connecticut?

317
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:11,633
Oh, my god.
That's an inspiration.

318
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,828
- I mean, if you can do it...
- So can you.

319
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:16,619
Because I'm a ridiculous,
unstable human being.

320
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:18,476
What is wrong with me?

321
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,790
I mean, if Elisa's only flaw is
that she demands I be faithful,

322
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,641
Then I will be faithful!

323
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:26,686
And if Angie wants me to get
a tattoo of her to prove my love,

324
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,352
 then I'm getting that tattoo!

325
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:30,936
Grizz, get the car.
Dotcom, get the coats.

326
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:33,434
And which one of you ladies
wants to pick up the tab?

327
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:35,167
Oh, me! Me!

328
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:38,449
I put strawberry juice
in your chickpeas.

329
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,051
And in your water.

330
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,577
- And on your harmonica.
- My what?

331
00:16:43,822 --> 00:16:46,464
Oh, you mean my mouth radio?

332
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:47,688
I am so sorry, Kenneth.

333
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,245
I just want you to know that I would not
do this to you for just any guy.

334
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,710
He was special.

335
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:54,597
I really thought that he was...

336
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:56,838
- The one.
- Oh, Miss Maroney,

337
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:59,275
it's horrible to think you might
have found your true love,

338
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,492
- but only to lose him.
- It hurts more than my foot botox

339
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,723
to know that he's out there,
and I have no way to find him.

340
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:11,318
When you call 911,

341
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:14,155
tell them they have to send everyone.

342
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,843
- Earn... This!
- Oh...

343
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:26,265
You remarkable son of a bitch!

344
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,868
We have an emergency!

345
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,079
♪ workin' on my night cheese ♪

346
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,358
Oh!
Jack?

347
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,440
Do you know what time it is?
I was sound asleep.

348
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:47,213
I heard you singing "night cheese".

349
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:49,647
Lemon, I've had a crazy night.

350
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:52,501
We all can learn a lot
from Tracy Jordan.

351
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:56,152
We went out clubbing.
His life is like Enron, 1999.

352
00:17:56,187 --> 00:17:58,352
- It's wild.
- I'm sure it was.

353
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:01,544
How are you so quiet when
your parades are so loud?

354
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,120
You were supposed
to be thinking about us.

355
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:08,407
And you spent the whole night
partying with that black guy!

356
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,648
- Did she not come here with you?
- Have you been following me?

357
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:14,982
And then you come here
at 4:00 in the morning?!

358
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:19,173
I knew your relationship was too weird
not to be sexual!

359
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,287
Okay, everybody be cool.

360
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:22,926
Wait a minute, you're jealous of Lemon?
That's insane.

361
00:18:22,949 --> 00:18:24,595
Yeah,come on,
look at me.

362
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:27,545
- Ooh.
- Elisa, I proved to myself tonight

363
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,958
that I would never cheat on you.
That's why I went out with Tracy.

364
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,896
And I came to Liz's because...

365
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,808
- Because she's your bro.
- Exactly.

366
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:36,585
- Oh...
- Elisa, this is troubling.

367
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,348
And how do you think I feel?

368
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:43,145
I get a ring on my finger for one day
and I start acting like Glenn Close

369
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,310
- in "Atraccion Fatal".
- Oh, that has a whole different title here.

370
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:49,882
Lemon, isn't there a slanket somewhere
you should be filling with your farts?

371
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,911
Shoo.

372
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:55,186
Baby, this is my curse.

373
00:18:55,221 --> 00:18:57,531
I love too deeply.

374
00:18:57,566 --> 00:19:01,784
And eventually it makes
me loco for choco-puffs.

375
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,669
Querida, if you ever find yourself
less in love with me,

376
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:08,159
I hope you'll give me a call.

377
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:10,707
But if tonight is what
it's going to be like,

378
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:15,833
obviously, engagement-wise,
we are not going to forge ahead.

379
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,987
Is it my English? Or was that
not a great breaking-up speech?

380
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:23,379
It was your English.
That was quite moving.

381
00:19:40,703 --> 00:19:44,112
Boy, you look happy. What, did you settle
that lawsuit over your exercise tape?

382
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:46,467
Even better.
I had an amazing date last night.

383
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:49,706
- And it's all thanks to Kenneth.
- Oh, it was nothing.

384
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:51,891
Sure, I was legally
dead for five minutes,

385
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,523
- But I did it for true love.
- Well actually,

386
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,151
 it turns out Roger has sole custody
Of his five-year-old son, 

387
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:58,495
So pffft!

388
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:02,172
- Wait a minute, you were dead?
- Oh, I'm fine.

389
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:05,525
But I think I brought
something back with me.

390
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,222
Tracy, did you even go home last night?
And where is your shirt?

391
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,609
No,
and at large.

392
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:21,658
I might've went out and had a little
too much to drink last night,

393
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:24,456
but you'll be proud of me,
Liz Lemon "Cool J".

394
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:28,552
'cause I went out and got that tattoo
Angie wanted me to get.

395
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,063
Pow!

396
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,265
How you like me now?

397
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:39,628
Wow, that is one gay lion.

398
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:39,928
