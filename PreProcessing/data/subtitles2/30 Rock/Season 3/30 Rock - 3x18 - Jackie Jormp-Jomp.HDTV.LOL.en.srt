1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,270
Okay.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,380
Now,you're all here because you've been
suspended om work for sexual harassment.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,810
But through this seminar,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,030
You will learn the skills to keep you from making
the same kinds of mistakes that got you here.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,980
Excuse me,mr.
Winerslav--

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,790
It's pronounced "weener-slave."

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,560
okay,jeffrey.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,840
Is there anything I can do to
speed this process up so I can just

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,120
I'm afraid not.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,030
But someone who's in a
rush to get back to work?

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,420
That's somethin' you
don't see every day.

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,590
Now,that is an example of a very
appropriate and very,very funny joke.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,670
Jenna, I need to speak with you.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,740
Jack,i did not hit that asian page.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,200
I was just swinging my arm
and she walked into me. Twice.

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,120
Jenna,it's not about that.

17
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,410
It's about your sheinhardt-universal
janis joplin biopic.

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,690
Wait. We can call her janis joplin?

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,540
We got the life rights? It's
not janie jimplin anymore?

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,600
Apparently, neither name cleared.

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,650
It looks like your character's
going to be called jackie jormp-jomp.

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,690
- Oh,okay. So what's the good news?
- I didn't say there was any.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,490
Sheinhardt-universal did
some focus testing this week.

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,430
- We got 100?
- You're holding that upsiddown.

25
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,140
- Oh,no.
- Yes. I was afraid of this.

26
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,310
It turns out not having the life rights or any
janis joplin songs was a negative for audiences.

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,170
But what about my duet with
jimi hendrickson at woodstocks?

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,860
We're all here at woodstocks

29
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,880
someday there will be a black president

30
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,910
uh,jenna, Sheinhdtniversal does
not wanna release the picture.

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,770
And how will that
affect my oscar chances?

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,680
Adversely. Unless we get
independent distribution.

33
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,860
To do that, "sing dem blues,white girl: "the
jackie jormp-jomp story" has gotta get some buzz.

34
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,190
I'm gonna need your help for that.

35
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,840
Do you need a sex tape
released? 'Cause I got a wrdne.

36
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,690
It's night vision and you can
see that his buddy is robbing me.

37
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,370
No,jenna,i want you on the pr warpath.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,600
If there's a red carpet,i want you on
it talking up the movie starting monday.

39
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,020
The kids' choice awards? Fine.

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,300
I'll set aside my feud with
raven simone for one day.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,780
But she knows what she did.

45
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,810
Miss lemon,you aren't
supposed to be here.

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,930
You're on
s-e-x probation.

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,520
Yeah,i know,i just wanted
to stop by and check in.

48
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,530
Kenneth,stop. I just want
a script or a rundown,okay?

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,940
Put that down. You
give that to me,kenneth.

50
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,760
Did you hear what I said?

51
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,650
Mr. Donaghy,help! Rule breaking!

52
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,600
This is sad.

53
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,620
Lemon,come with me.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,870
Lemon,you know you're supposed to
go home after your pervert seminars.

55
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,710
I'm going. I just hate not being here.

56
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,200
- You have to rehearse!
- No! Passive resistance!

57
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,580
I learned that from dr. King! I'm brave!

58
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,530
- You sure you miss this?
- Yes.

59
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,560
As crazy and stressful as this
place is, not being here is worse.

60
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,900
I feel for you.

61
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,400
Remember that time I came back from
the world economic forum with mono

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,710
And missed a week of work and I wanted to pull
my hair out but I couldn't because it's too thick?

63
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,240
People like us, we need the stress.

64
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,340
We're only happy when
we're overcoming obstacles.

65
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,350
You take that away, we start bouncing off the
walls, spend our days jabbering at doormen.

66
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,780
Hey,i brighten their day.

67
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,660
Before I go,can I at least
find out what frank's hat says?

68
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,940
- "constant cving."
- He could do better.

69
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,720
Has anyone looked at this sexual
harassment stuff they gave us?

70
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,670
I don't need to read it.

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,490
The whole thing is loosely based on
a evening I spent with isiah thomas.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,270
No wonder liz got busted.

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,370
According to this, you can't do anything
without it being considered harassment.

74
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,370
Did you know you have to
report in-office relationships?

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,590
- Is that true?
- It's the first thing listed.

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,870
Have you read this?

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,460
Well,i wanted to, because
it's full of rules,

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,210
but ms.Vieira made me throw it away.

79
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,750
And said pretty boys like me shouldn't
be filling their heads with ideas.

80
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,410
- Hi,frank.
- Hello.

81
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,060
Coworker.

82
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,280
Ms.vieira...

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,760
Of course my job is annoying, but
that doesn't mean I don't love it.

84
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm sure your job can be annoying.

85
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,620
Not all the tenants are as fun as me.

86
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,370
I get it.

87
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,720
Hey,would you mind if
brought a chair down here?

88
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,190
Yes,my job is stressful. Very stressful.

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,650
But in the end,i get
paid to make people laugh.

90
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,480
We have a saying that laughter is the best
medicine, so I'm kind of like a doctor here.

91
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,020
Like you were,in poland.

92
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,510
We have a show tonight.

93
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,370
I've never missed a show.

94
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,550
Not even the time I had that virus
they kept saying only raccoons get.

95
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,080
I can't believe I'm not there.

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,500
Hey,I've-- uh,I've picked
up some polish from you guys.

97
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,120
******

98
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,440
It's kinda cold out for a jog.

99
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,080
- Oh,I'm just going downstairs to the fitness center.
- What? This building has a gym?

100
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,810
Yeah,it'the door right next
to the vending machines.

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,240
Vending machines? What kind?

102
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,350
I don't know,sorry. I'm emily.
Are you new to the building?

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,060
No,I'm liz. I've lived
here for four years.

104
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:31,040
I usually work crazy,long hours, but I'm
on leave right now for normal reasons.

105
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,600
- And you're feeling a little lost.
- I am.

106
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,090
Right now,i should be standing in a toilet
stall so nobody bothers me while I eat lunch.

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,520
God,i miss it.

108
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,310
I was an investment banker for 15 years.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,290
80-hour workweeks, corner
office, secret candy drawer...

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,770
A a decoy candy drawer to
throw others off the trail?

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,070
Smart.

112
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,880
The point is you get
addicted to the stress.

113
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,820
Think it gives your life purpose.

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,540
- And then when you stop--
- for normal reasons...

115
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,370
You see how stupid you were.

116
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,190
It just takes time to realize there
are much better ways to be happy.

117
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,180
Wait for me... Lady.

118
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,770
Kenneth, what can I do for ya?

119
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,940
Well,sir, I recently learned
that company policy requires

120
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,730
That employees disclose their relationships
with their cowkers to their immediate supervisor.

121
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,650
I am not kyo there are
perhaps 40 people between us.

122
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,930
Pete,for instance.

123
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,900
Oh,i just don't trust
mr. Hornberger,sir.

124
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,660
He has a ridge on the section of the
skull associated with deviousness.

125
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,150
Okay. So there's a girl.

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,710
Yes,sir. Her name is daphne.
She's one of thetgsdancers.

127
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,240
And when I watch her dance,
my heart skips a beat.

128
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,900
And not because of my acute ventralitis.

129
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,800
Wait. You're dating one of the dancers?

130
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,990
Oh,no,sir.

131
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,050
I actually haven't spoken to her yet,
but I have a long-term plan to marry her,

132
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,580
And I wanted the company to
be aware of my intentions.

133
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,600
I see. I'll be sure to mention
that at the next board meeting.

134
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,430
Thank you,sir.

135
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,360
Oh,also, I don't know
if this is harassment,

136
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,060
But someone atthe today show made me
eat an unripe bana in front of her.

137
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,880
Hey,ken. Do you know who
our immediate supervisor is?

138
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,780
I will not be able to
attend your wedding.

139
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,990
Because of a prior conflict.

140
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,410
Oh,what's the special occasion?

141
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,160
Weekday.

142
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,080
w,so this is normal?

143
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,920
This is,like,your version
of sweatpants and pop-tarts?

144
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,290
Not too shabs.

145
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,640
Short for shabby. Hilarious.

146
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,110
This could be your life too,liz.

147
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,890
Just short the housing market.

148
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,350
Or write a cookbook specifically
for mixed-race children.

149
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,640
Or marry a rich, old dude who dies.

150
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,140
Clive,i wanna say?

151
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,120
Or have mild lupus and great insurance.

152
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,830
So,here is the plan for today.

153
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,010
- Start with facials and massages...
- Yes,please.

154
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,620
Then private shopping at bergdorf,

155
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,180
- swing by the dermatologist
for a tune-up. - Fabulous.

156
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,970
Dinner at jewel bako,
then a nightcap back here.

157
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,780
Wow,that is a plan.

158
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,380
But,uh,i don't think I should go.

159
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,490
Oh,liz is still stressed
about her old job.

160
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,420
It's just-- it's friday,and at
my job that is our biggest day.

161
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,360
I don't think i'd be good company.

162
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,380
But thank you for inviting
me. I'll have one drink here.

163
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,400
Have two.

164
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,720
But then I really should
go home, 'cause i,you know--

165
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:40,280
I'm still in work mode, I'm
not really in spa/shopping mode.

166
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,890
I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself.

167
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,160
And I don't wanna crash your
day together and ruin it.

168
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,680
- We're always together.
- Thank you.

169
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,110
Cocktails.

170
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,640
It's just so stressful thinking aut my
employees trying to do everything without me.

171
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,690
- Those look great on you.
- Then I'm buying them.

172
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,790
I guess I'm just one of
those people that needs work.

173
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,600
You know,i
thrive there.I--

174
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,730
- and it's gone just like that?
- Just like that.

175
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,290
- Thank you,dr. Binderman.
- ***

176
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,450
My point is,you are
so sweet to include me.

177
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,470
Believe me,I'm jealous, but
today's just not the day.

178
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,210
So,you know,i'll hang out
with you guys for a little bit,

179
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,510
and i'll have my one drink,and...

180
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,310
- What time is it?
- Almost midnight.

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,100
If we're gonna get up in time for our
mani/pedis, we really should turn in.

182
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,440
Bye.

183
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,450
I forgot to watch my show.

184
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,860
I'm prepared to do a
nipple slip if you need it.

185
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,040
Just talk about the movie.

186
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,210
Hi,I'm ethan fromnick magazine.

187
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,000
- Whose mom are you?
- Thank you. Well,tonight's about fun.

188
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,140
I'm wearing taylor dayne for
express, and my peace sign,of course,

189
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,150
- Is a nod to janis joplin, who,I'm
so-- - dora the explorer's backpack!

190
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,620
Backpack, is map in you tonight?

191
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,300
here are your lunches, gentlemen.

192
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,500
Dotcom,i forgot to
get you extra mustard.

193
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,310
All right,enough!

194
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,120
This fighting stops now!

195
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,970
I asorry. Mr. Slattery hurt
me, and now I'm hurting him.

196
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,930
He'll never get mustard.

197
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,490
Except for the mustard that
comes with the sandwich.

198
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,170
I said I was sorry,ken.

199
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,500
I didn't even mean to hurt you.

200
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,220
Oh,really? I love you too,dotcom.

201
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,290
- I didn't say-- - I knew
this would happen someday.

202
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,500
A woman would come between us.

203
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,320
Well,I'm not standing
by. I'm taking action.

204
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,840
Oh,sir,before miss lemon left,i promised
her I wouldn't let you start any adventures.

205
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,090
Yeah,well, liz lemon's in jail now.

206
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,710
And somebody has to step up
and take charge around here.

207
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,280
Let the problem solving begin.

208
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,290
Are you daphne? Yeah,you're fired.

209
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,860
First a backpack upstages me, then the
paparazzi kept calling me dina lohan,

210
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,120
And now the cyrus family has
decided to rock a bunch ofunky hats.

211
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,010
You can't give up now.

212
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,400
Did jackie jormp-jomp give up when
those vampires attacked woodstocks?

213
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,130
Nobody even knows I'm here.

214
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,480
From dreamworks's upcoming feature
film on top of spaghetti, helen mirren.

215
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,900
Good evening.

216
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,390
And now we
take a moment--

217
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,750
oh,that's horrible.

218
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,780
You got me.

219
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,830
And now we take a moment to remember those we
lost this year in the kid entertainment industry.

220
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,650
<i>******</i>

221
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,150
<i>R******</i>

222
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,360
<i>E******</i>

223
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,980
<i>J******</i>

224
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,630
Was that me?

225
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
Did they just say I'm dead?

226
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,980
I thought you spoke to the producers.

227
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,120
Look,connor,if we don't get some
traction, jenna maroney's picture's dead.

228
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,630
- We need your help.
- Maroney. Picture. Dead. Got it.

229
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,520
This is a disaster.

230
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,590
No,no. We hit the jackpot.

231
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,670
You being dead is the best thing
that ever happened to this movie.

232
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,660
- Jenna. I wanna tupac you.
- Fine. But I have to pee first.

233
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,330
No. No,no,no, tupac shakur,the rapper.

234
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,390
He sold ten times more albums when
he was dead than when he was alive.

235
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,770
That's what we're going
to do with this movie.

236
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,420
Die young,become a
legend. Just like janis.

237
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,540
Or rusty,the bear fromthe magicals.

238
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,230
Yes. Now... You just need to
stay dead while I sell the movie.

239
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,420
Oh,i can play dead.

240
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,290
I watched my whole church
group get eaten by a bear.

241
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,300
Congratulations,miss lemon.

242
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,620
You've completed your
sensitivity traing.

243
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,760
Your suspension is up, and
here is your certificate.

244
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,300
Wow,so I can go back to work tomorrow?

245
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,580
That's soon.

246
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,100
Well,i know how eager
you are to return to work.

247
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,430
I guess so.

248
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,090
But coming back to
work isn't always easy.

249
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,180
Work means stress.

250
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,490
And stress can make you
fall back on old behavior.

251
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,340
So tonight, I want you to
really think about th d back.

252
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,990
Visualize everything that's facing you.

253
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,390
Think about walking through that door and immediately
dealing with 100 different problems and responsibilities.

254
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,620
Your coworkers' demands
on you, the long hours,

255
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,940
the pointless meetings
and endless phone calls.

256
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,570
Think of the frustration, the futility,

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,960
and the time That you will never get back
as you creep closer and closer to the grave.

258
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,940
Okay. Any questions for me?

259
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,740
Just one.

260
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,260
Why don't you drop those dockers
and gimme a piece of that sweet ass?

261
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,250
- What're we doing today,ladies?
- More of the same.

262
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,630
- Chell-o? - Lemon,what the hell
happened at your reinstatement hearing?

263
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,880
Jeffrey weener-slave said you
put your fingers in his mouth.

264
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,230
Did i? Or did he put
his mouth on my fingers?

265
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,960
It's gonna take at least six weeks
paid leave to g to the bottom of this.

266
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,450
I'm very busy right now faking
jenna's death to sell her movie.

267
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm not going to engage on that. Mantra.

268
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,110
But I am calling h.r.and getting
you back for the next show.

269
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,310
No,i just-- I need a little more
time off. I'm on humanity leave.

270
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,770
Good god,what indigo
girls song is that from?

271
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,830
Syllabus of usoff
vagabonds,martyrs,and quilts.

272
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,500
The point is I have met the
most amazing group of women,jack.

273
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,080
They just live.

274
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,460
And they spin every morning,
and they go to museums.

275
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,730
- Lemon,you are not a rich divorcee.
- I know.

276
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,620
But I have some money
saved-- enough for two years.

277
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,440
Maybe four if I give up cable.

278
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,560
So I will me back to
the show in four years.

279
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,520
You're fooling yourself. You
know you can't live like that.

280
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,330
Yes,i can. Emily and
her friends are happy.

281
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,620
Believe me,there is no
solace in their luxury.

282
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,710
Only deep despair.

283
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,060
How do you know all
these indigo girls songs?

284
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,480
Listen,you are wrong about emily.

285
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,530
Oh,god,there's a spider
nest in my yo mat!

286
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,780
Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan,what did you do?

287
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,340
You fired daphne?

288
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,420
I had to.

289
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,120
Friendship and trust in the
entourage is the most important thing.

290
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,110
Like that hbo show. John adams.

291
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,690
- Well,me and dotcom are back to
being best friends. - We were never--

292
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,020
but the other dancers are refusing to
come to work out of solidarity with daphne.

293
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,080
Usually,this is the point in my process when
liz lemon steps in and takes care of everything.

294
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,050
Heavy is the head that eats the crayons.

295
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,920
I'm gonna take a nap.
See you in ten hours.

296
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,140
Kenneth. Have any of the
dancers come in yet today?

297
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,200
Pete. A word.

298
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,150
- Jenna's dead.
- I don't feel anything.

299
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,340
- What's wrong with me?
- No,no, it's a marketing ploy. For her new movie.

300
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,990
But it mns you won't have
her for the show on friday.

301
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,100
And you need to put together
some sort of on-air tribute.

302
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,630
We actually already have
an obituary reel for jenna.

303
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,220
We put it together after
she cheated on that mobster.

304
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,050
That's good.

305
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,790
Oh,eating right, working out,sleeping...

306
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,200
Bm-ing like a rock star?

307
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,910
All right,all right. What's
the hump day schedule look like?

308
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,580
Oh,it's esy, liz,it's thursday.

309
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,800
I read somewhere it's tuesday.

310
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,950
Mr. Jordan,it's friday. We really need to
tell mr. Hornberger that the dancers quit.

311
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,210
No we don't. He's not even
gonna notice they're gone.

312
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,930
- Oh,my.
- These are the new dancers,kid.

313
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,350
- Say hi to velvet.
- Hello,miss velvet.

314
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,240
Just think,an hour ago they
were brawling in a parking lot,

315
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,450
But tonight, they're gonna be stars.

316
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,010
Show ken here what we worked on.

317
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,330
Oh,boy.

318
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,260
Oh,boy, I am really starting to feel the
benefits of massages and yoga five days a week.

319
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,410
Check this out.

320
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,410
Look at you.

321
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,210
Last week you were flipping
out about missing work.

322
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,360
Oh,no,that's old liz.

323
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,400
My boss kept trying to tell me that I would go
crazy living a life of leisure,That it's unhe

324
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,640
well,he's actually right.

325
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,290
No,no,he's not,emily.

326
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,120
No,i used to be a neurosurgeon before
jasmine guy and I wrote our cookbook,

327
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,370
And the human brain needs
stimulation or it atrophies.

328
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,650
And your pleasure
center literally shrinks.

329
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,670
That's why we do our special activity.

330
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,080
To combat that.

331
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,610
What,like,sudoku?

332
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,640
uh,we did a games night for a
couple of weeks. Didn't last.

333
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,760
So charity work?

334
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,500
No,charity work sucks.

335
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,200
- Should we tell her?
- Erin,it's too soon.

336
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,760
- Punch me in the face,liz.
- I'm sorry,what?

337
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,860
You heard me.Punch
me as hard as you can,

338
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,250
and then I am coming
at you like an animal.

339
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,880
Oh,god, is this a fight club?

340
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,390
The pain provese're alive.

341
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,290
Oh,this is very dispointing!

342
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,760
Come on,hit me. Get a taste.

343
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,940
I brought a roll of
quarters to hold in my fist.

344
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,300
Oh,god. Jack was right.

345
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,460
Oh,i have to get back to my show.

346
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,680
- I need the show.
- You want out,liz?

347
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,260
You're gonna have to fight your way out.

348
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,500
As we celebrate the
life of jenna maroney...

349
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:26,740
The coast guard won't officially declare her
dead yet, but what the pirates did to that boat!

350
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,480
Well,it's a very generous
offer. We'll be in touch.

351
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,680
Jenna,what the hell are you doing here?

352
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,930
They're talking about me.

353
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm really better today.

354
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,350
So's the laundry, *******

355
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,850
that was some of jenna
maroney's earlier work.

356
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,850
It's hard to believe that both
of those women outlived her.

357
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,190
Especially the woman on the right.

358
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,660
We'll be right back.

359
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,450
A coupla gay guys were crying.

360
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,630
Oh,jack,thiss just the
greatest night of my--

361
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,130
What the hell is that?

362
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,810
Well,it's you. What's the problem?

363
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,480
It has the year I was born on it.

364
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,900
Therealyear, not the actress year.

365
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,470
Now almost a million people
are gonna know that I'm f-- f--

366
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,170
- It's too late to change it,jack.
- Jenna,calm down.

367
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,690
I'm selling the movie in the
next 12 hours. Your movie.

368
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,150
Think about what matters here.

369
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,220
In five,four,three...

370
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,960
And finally tonight, what more fitting
way to say good-bye to our friend

371
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,370
than with the gifts
she gave all of us...

372
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,030
Her music.

373
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,640
Ladies and gentlemen, itzhak
bemelmans and the tracy jordan dancers.

374
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,170
Gimme me a microphone.

375
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:46,800
* Whole grain,low fat I
know you want a piece of that

376
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,730
* but I just wanna dance

377
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,690
still alive.Not yet 32.
Sorry,jack. Worth it.

378
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,540
- I'm back.
- What did it turn out to be? Lesbians?

379
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,710
No. Fight club.

380
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,860
this this is a disaster.

381
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,440
* But I'm just here to dance

382
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,570
what is wrong with you two?

383
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,130
You guys mess up everything you touch,
and then I have to come in here and fix it.

384
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,150
- I am so mad.
- Why are you smiling?

385
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,720
You're freaking me out.

386
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,310
Oh,you two troublemakers. Come here!

387
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,270
- She's gonna do something to us.
- You're crazy!

388
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,360
I'm back,nerds.
