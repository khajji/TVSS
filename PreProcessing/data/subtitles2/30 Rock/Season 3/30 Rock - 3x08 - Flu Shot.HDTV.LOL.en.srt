1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,290
Hey,guys! Four days till vacation
week. Where are we all going?

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,740
Nowhere. We don't get next week off.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,400
We gotta load out thse,
take 'em to storage.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,640
Then at night,i gotta drive around
newark lookin' for my runaway daughter.

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,690
Oh,what happened to your hand?

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,160
Oh,i was trying out my spray tan for
my trip to st. Bartleby's next week.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,690
Oh,miss lemon, how could you
do that to your beautiful hands?

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,100
With your flat, manly milking thumbs
and your long, graceful knuckle hair--

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,130
Thank you,kenneth.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,360
Are you sick? 'Cause i am not
getting sick before my trip.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,190
The place i go to has private
beaches, soft serve ice cream machines,

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,340
And,after the french custom,
people wear dark socks to the beach.

13
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,570
It's the one thing i do for
myself every year, and i am going.

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:53,300
Look,i even bought a new swimsuit.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,850
What is that?

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,720
It's called a tankoort,cerie.

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,330
You may have seen it inus weekly, being
worn by dame judi dench... 'S mother.

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,050
Kenneth...

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,080
Don't worry,miss
lemon. I never get sick.

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,810
I have the constitution of an ox.

21
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,340
Oh,no. I must have ox fever!

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,490
When did i walk barefoot near an ox?

23
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,280
You have the flu. Go home.

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,020
You are not ruing my vacation!

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,050
- Liz,wait. Did you get that swim... Thing for your vacation?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,140
- You know it's canceled,right?
- No! What? What are you talking about?

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,620
The hotel was overbooked. I texted you.

28
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,500
No,you--
no,you didn't.

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,480
Oh,i forgot to hit send.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,170
Just hold on a second. There ya go.

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,300
I got a great reservation to
celebrate our first real date.

32
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,600
Now,have you ever had sushi?

33
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,830
I once had a very undercooked
fish sandwich at a parade.

34
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,400
I guess that counts.

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,120
Oh,no,but...

36
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,980
I can only stay for five minut.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,130
I have to go back to work.

38
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,740
I thought today was your day off.

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,920
I have another patient on my off days.

40
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,130
He's a sweet old man
with advanced dementia.

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,450
Totally disconnected from reality.

42
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,040
Well,that reminds me.
I owe lou dobbs a call.

43
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,380
Elisa,are you telling me that
you work seven days a week?

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,940
Yes,i have two jobs.

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,030
That's what regular people do,you know?

46
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,030
Especially those whose grandmothers
are addicted to online poker.

47
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,420
Don't let that keep us apart.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,610
When are you back with my mother?

49
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,070
- I'll cook you dinner.
- Jack...

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
Your house is my workplace.

51
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,510
Plus,colleen doesn't seem
to like that we're together.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,660
I hope you know she acts like that
because she hates every woman i like.

53
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,420
It's not because you're a...

54
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,040
I'm sorry, what do you call yourself?

55
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,890
A puerto rican.

56
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,550
No,i know you can say that,
but what do i call you?

57
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,520
A puerto rican.

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,930
That does not sound right.

Oh,miss lemon.

63
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,630
Mr. Donaghy wants to see
you in the green room.

64
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,450
Kenneth, why are you still here?

65
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,120
Ohdon't worry about
me. I'm a-oh-boy.

66
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,460
I should be going to the caribbean.

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,770
Instead,i'm stuck here with you
and a bunch of guys named sully.

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,230
- Miss lemon?
- Sully!

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,500
Brett favre,right?

70
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,080
Jack,i ne task you to drop your pants.

71
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,480
That's it.

72
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,490
Have a sucker.

73
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,320
Lemon,there you are.
Leo's giving out flu shots.

74
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,680
Not my favorite part of
the medical profession.

75
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,990
My favorite part is
attending executions.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,460
Can i ask you a question as a woman?

77
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,370
You may,jack. Are you going to alter
your voice or dress up in any way?

78
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,430
- Liz.
- Sorry.

79
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,460
I don't know what to do about elisa.

80
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,360
She works all the time.

81
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,000
You know she's second
generation puerto rican.

82
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,500
Jack,you can't call her that!

83
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,740
That's what i thought.

84
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,970
With work and everything, it's
just turning out to be complicated.

85
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,620
You said the same thing about c.

86
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,890
Count yourself lucky
you're getting one of these.

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,220
He only has five left.

88
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,390
Lemon,i need you to tell me who on
your staff is important enou to get one.

89
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,750
Hold on. You're rationing
health care? That's not okay.

90
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,060
Yes,lemon.

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,940
Important people get better health care.

92
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,020
They also get better restaurant
reservations, bigger seats in planes.

93
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,450
A more refined class of prostitute.

94
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,560
For me,it's really
about the companionship.

95
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,150
Like it or not, you're one
of us now, one of the elite.

96
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
No,i'm not. I am from white haven,

97
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,030
P.a.my grandfather dug
out the white haven quarry,

98
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,390
And my other gndfather filled it back in
with the sludge from the eraser factory.

99
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,040
I am still way more like
those people than you.

100
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,500
And i don't want
anything they don't get.

101
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,040
Lemon,you don't wanna get sick.

102
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,240
It's not about that. It's about
fairness. I don't want the shot.

103
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,040
When is modern science gonna
find a cure for a woman's mouth?

104
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,280
Jack! What are you doing here?

105
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,350
Making this work.

106
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,380
Look,i brought some dinner and monopoly.

107
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,690
We can have a fun, low-key
night... Unless i lose.

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,900
That is sweet. But very inappropriate.

109
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,380
Get in before somebody sees you.

110
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,470
The agency would fire me if
they knew i was having guests!

111
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,100
Well... Who's going to tell them? Him?

112
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,300
Hey,it's me, matlock. I need your help.

113
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,720
Okay,very funny, jack.

114
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,880
Elisa...

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,890
You work so hard.

116
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,030
Don't you think you deserve
some time for yourself?

117
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,200
Of course i do.

118
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,170
I've been living in
new york for 15 years,

119
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,130
And i've never seen a broadway play or been
in a restaurant that didn't have a tv in it

120
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,870
Or had a romantic dinner
with a man in a suit.

121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,730
Okay,you can stay.

122
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,500
But it's not all gonna be fun and games.

123
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,540
Mr. Templeton's foot is still healing.

124
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,650
Of course...You do
your job,and i'll just--

125
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,340
what is wrong with it? Is that a beak?

126
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,680
- Yes!
- No.

127
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,280
Yes!

128
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,990
Liz... Tracy says kauai is more
beautiful than maui and keeps shouting

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,290
When i try to give my
opinion, which is that...

130
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,900
- Blah-blah-blah! Blah-blah-blah!
- Kauai is too rustic.

131
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,200
- Maui is the wind-surfing capital
of the world! - Blah-blah-blah!

132
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,710
Guys,come on,we have
to shoot these promos.

133
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,430
Oh,my god,jack gave you two flu shots?

134
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,010
He said it was a flu shot.

135
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,700
But know it's really a truth serum.

136
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,590
It's not a truth serum.

137
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,200
Them why ayou you look
like tootsie today?

138
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,990
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

139
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,070
The crew is on death's door,
and you're arguing about hawaii?

140
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,450
If i were you, i'd be doi
something special to thank them.

141
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,750
- That would make us look pretty great.
- Yeah.

142
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,960
Kenneth,i'm considering giving
you one of the remaining flu shots.

143
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,140
No need,sir.

144
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,580
It would be an honor to die at my post and be
given the traditional burial of a parcell man--

145
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,830
Wrapped in a confederate
flag, fried,and fed to dogs.

146
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,040
Are you ready for your shot?

147
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,870
Never. Two-tiered
health care is a crime.

148
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,350
You know,in cuba,everybody
gets equal health care.

149
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,350
What a surprise-- you've
seen the michael moore movie.

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,170
Think again,jack.

151
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,100
I saw the trailer when i went
to seealvin and the chipmunks.

152
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,110
But this flu shot rationing is baloney.

153
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,660
If my crew can't get a
shot, i'm not getting a shot.

154
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,010
Hey,you tell him,liz!

155
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,960
God bless you... Crewman.

156
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,480
- We gotta fight the power.
- Yeah!

157
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,150
Oh,boy.

158
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,300
- Fight the powers that be!
- Yeah!

159
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,180
That's right

160
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,840
just makes me wanna shoop!

161
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,410
Shoop,shoop,shoop,shoop!

162
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,780
Mr. Jordan,miss moroney,
you wanted to see me?

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,380
Kenneth,tracy and i wanna
do something for the crew...

164
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,390
You know,to thank them for being sick.

165
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,710
We didn't know what to get them.

166
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,540
But then i had a brainstorm!

167
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,800
It was a bad one.

168
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,610
Jenna had to put my tongue guard in.

169
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,660
But after he stabilized, we
decided we'd get them all hot soup.

170
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,080
So... Go do that.

171
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,300
All the other pages have gone home sick.

172
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,520
I can't make any runs right now.

173
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,850
Maybe... The two of you
could go get the soup?

174
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,240
I don't understand.

175
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,580
Well,i'm saying you
could get your wallet...

176
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,510
- My what? - And go
downstairs to the basement--

177
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,830
- no!
- Then you go to the soup place and bring the soup back up here.

178
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,930
- With what,my arms?
- Make sure to take your ids with you.

179
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,680
That'd be the worst part!

180
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,110
Wait. Tracy, we have to do this.

181
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,270
Without the crew, we'd just be two
amazing people succeeding in a vacuum.

182
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,380
Come on,do it for them.

183
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,830
Yeah. For the crew.

184
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,550
'Cause it's their birthday.

185
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,460
I had a woerful time last night.

186
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,550
Yeah,i did too.

187
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,410
Are you with mr. Templeton now?

188
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,900
How i envy him.

189
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,730
I wish you would exercise my
muscles so they don't atrophy.

190
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,700
Well,are you coming over tonight?

191
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,270
We can finish our game of monopoly.

192
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,750
Of course i am. I'm just
gonna be a little late.

193
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,370
I have tickets to a special
ary performance ofthe lion king.

194
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,880
I wish i could convince
you to go with me.

195
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,930
You know i can't,jack.
Are you kidding me?

196
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,540
I'd love to go out, get all dressed
up, tip maitre d's and be all like...

197
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,250
"thank you,roger.

198
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,410
This table was super-duper."

199
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,270
I live in the big apple, but i spend
all my time with the big vegetable.

200
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,070
Why can't i have fun like
an upper middle class person?

201
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,660
Why can't you?

202
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,490
You sound just like lemon. Come with
me tonight. Be a member of the elite.

203
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,770
hey,liz.

204
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,040
Just wanna let you know we
appreciate what you said before.

205
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,440
So in order to thank you,
we got you a meat plate.

206
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,630
Thanks,guys! I am
really... Going to eat this.

207
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,650
Enjoy.

208
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,140
<i>********</i>

209
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,870
Hey,cerie,what is this text
you sent me supposed to mean?

210
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,980
Your vacation is back on.

211
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,140
Well,how is that any easier--
wait. My vacation's back on?

212
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,450
Yeah. I guess since this flu,
there's been a bunch of cancellatns.

213
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,690
I'm so happy the number 4,the letter u.

214
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,520
Thank you,banyani.

215
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,630
Thank you,oscar.

216
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,990
Oh,god,they're all sick!

217
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,740
You're all diseased!

218
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,430
I can't get sick. I can't get sick!

219
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,650
Stay away,sick lutz!

220
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,390
Miss
lemon--

221
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,880
I have revision pages for you!

222
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,370
Oh,my god,pete! Thank god it's you!

223
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,560
Liz,what's wrong?

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why?

225
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,980
Gimme the shot. I
wanna go on my vacation.

226
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,640
I take back all the stuff i said!

227
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,540
If you want a shot...

228
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,700
You're going to have to dance for it.

229
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,220
Very nice.

230
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
i'm such a hypocrite.

231
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,200
You have to promise me you won't
tell anyone i'm getting this shot.

232
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,430
Liz,i believe doctor/patient
confidentiality is a two-way street.

233
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,610
I'm cheating on my wife.

234
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,390
Hey,where have you guys been?

235
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,600
We were supposed to shoot
promos like an hour ago.

236
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,750
Okay,we forgot about that.
But we have a good reason.

237
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,600
Yeah,we were out tting
soup for the crew.

238
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,860
No. We forgot about that too.

239
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,110
We were out shoppin'
together. We had fun,though.

240
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,860
Every girl crazy
'bout a sharp--

241
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,830
i get it,you went shopping.
I don't need the montage.

242
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,760
Yeah. I tried on a lotta outfits.

243
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,440
And some of them,
i was like-- no.

244
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,250
But them some of them, i was like,yeah!

245
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,560
So we' running behind because
you guys forgot to get soup.

246
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,550
Is there anything you do that
doesn't make my life harder?

247
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,510
I can't believe we forgot the soup.

248
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,030
We have to think of something else.

249
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,360
I know.

250
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,740
I also wanna thank you for
controlling yourself sexually

251
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,910
while we spent time
together on this adnture.

252
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,570
Hey,liz, how you feeling?
You got this bug yet?

253
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm a little achy.

254
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,100
Probably 'cause i didn't get the shot.

255
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,460
You should go home,
sweetheart. You don't want this.

256
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,770
No way,dude. If you're
workin',i'm workin'.

257
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,110
Hey,that liz lemon's okay.

258
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,620
Why do we hate her guts so much?

259
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,460
Lemon, we actually went on a date last
night, elisa and i, and it was magical.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,070
Oh,my purse!

261
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,650
You took the old man with you?

262
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,930
I admit it's an ethical gray area.

263
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,540
No! It's just wrong.

264
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,460
Yes,well,we all can't be as noble as you,
turning down a flu shot on moral grounds,

265
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,860
Coming into work and risking your
health despite your special vacation.

266
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,430
It's called principles,jack.

267
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,290
I think i'm probably getting it.

268
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,250
Oh,that reminds me.About 24 hours
after receiving the flu shot,

269
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,300
you develop a distinctive
rash at the injection site.

270
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,750
So please let makeup
know for tracy and jenna.

271
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,260
I wasn't resting.

272
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,890
A parcell man never
lies down on the job.

273
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,020
Unless that job involves
milking pig teats.

274
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,090
Miss lemon,what is that?

275
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,220
Did you... Did you get the shot?

276
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,970
No,no,no. This is a dream.

277
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,890
You're having a fever dream.

278
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,960
We're speaking french,
and i'm your mother.

279
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,580
Oh,ma cherie man, pourquoi?
Pourquoi m'as tu laisse?

280
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,120
What are we doing tonight?

281
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,670
It's a surprise.

282
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,950
But he's gonna need a helmet. Come here.

283
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,520
It's mr. Templeton's son!

284
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,240
I thought you said he
didn't have any family.

285
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,510
Not here. He lives in london.

286
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,550
But now god has sent him to
punish me for being so bad.

287
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,870
Or maybe it's a business trip.

288
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,310
You need to hide. I
cannot lose this job.

289
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,240
I'd have to go back to work in
the late shift at dunkin' donuts.

290
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,490
The customers are so sad.

291
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,820
- Can i help you?
- Yes.

292
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,480
What time do you start
throwing out donuts?

293
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,500
He's coming in!

294
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,000
- There ya are.
- Of course. I'm here. Always.

295
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,240
Sorry to surprise you. I just wanted
to... Check on dad. How's he doin'?

296
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,900
Well,he's stable but vegetative.

297
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,910
Totally unaware of his surroundings.

298
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,490
A man comes at night.

299
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,310
- He comes to the house and takes me.
- Dad!

300
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,130
Okayth's surprising.

301
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,170
He wears a suit.

302
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,240
His hair is thick, like
a bolshevik commissar.

303
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,760
He made me watch a giraffe
with the legs of a man!

304
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,930
Dad,it's me,michael.

305
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,690
He gave money to a silver man.

306
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,780
- He ate a plate of fire!
- D...

307
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,080
There's no man.

308
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,980
Yes! He was in prison.

309
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,560
But now he owns a railroad.

310
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,940
What is going on?

311
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,210
Why is he all worked up?

312
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,860
You know,sometimes they watch cartoons,
and they think it's real. It's very common.

313
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,490
Tracy,i got it!

314
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,720
Give it to me! It's mine!

315
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,980
No. I know what we can get the crew.

316
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,200
They don't need soup.

317
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,620
They need medicine, and
what's the best medicine?

318
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,950
Medicine?

319
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
Laughter.

320
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,480
Do you see where i'm going with this?

321
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,590
No!

322
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,530
Well,he's finally asleep.

323
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,270
You must be exhausted.

324
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,260
Why don't you go to bed?

325
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,780
No,thanks. I'm not tired.

326
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,020
Oh,good.

327
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,070
Because there is something in the
other room that i need to show you,

328
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,120
And i won't remember
what it is until i see it.

329
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,990
The dark man is here!
He's come to take me!

330
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,790
No,shh,sir,no!

331
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,080
I did things during the
war-- terrible things.

332
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,050
Mr. Templeton, my name is jack, and
i'm just a guy dating your nurse,

333
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:14,400
And i took advantage of your
condition so i could be with her.

334
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,830
Do you understand what i'm saying?

335
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,390
What we did was wrong, but weid
it for the greatest reason of all.

336
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,860
You see,i've lost too many good things
because i couldn't make time for them,

337
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,260
And i can't let that happen with elisa.

338
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,000
Is elisa the puerto rican?

339
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,920
Wow,that really doesn't sound okay.

340
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,990
But yes,and i beg you...

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,010
- Please don't tell your son.
- All right.

342
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,950
But the next time we go out, i
wanna go to washington square park.

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,110
It's where i proposed to my wife.

344
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,230
And then... I wanna go to a negro bar.

345
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,970
I'll see what i can do.

346
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,440
- Attention,ladies and germs and gentlemen!
- Hey,liz!

347
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,940
Are you ready to feel better?

348
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,060
'Cause we have just the thing!

349
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,720
- Soup?
- No!

350
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,520
Now,in the grand
tradition of patch adams,

351
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,460
Prepare yourself for
the comic stylings of

352
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,010
tracy the amazing and jenna!

353
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,800
Really? Do you really
think this is helping?

354
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,910
- Leave her alone!
- Yeah!

355
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,680
What? Why aren't you laughing?

356
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,690
This is happening to liz!

357
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,670
Noth love liz now. Everybody likes me.

358
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,810
- It's you two idiots-- -
hey,what's that on your arm?

359
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,690
She got a flu shot!
She-- she lied to us!

360
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,600
Give us back our meat plate!

361
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,580
No,guys,listen! You don't understand!

362
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,830
- This vacation-- - you
sold us out for a vacation?

363
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,500
No! Not just a vation.

364
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:00,110
This one has beach socks and
ice cream and sandwich turtles.

365
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,100
I work so hard,guys. Don't
i deserve to sit on a ach?

366
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,480
- Je vous deteste!
- Yeah!

367
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,940
It's not what you think.

368
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,230
There is a gentleman involved.

369
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,040
A filipino gentleman.
Is name is banyani.

370
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:18,120
I want to take him as my island lover.

371
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,200
Last year, he was totally sending signals,
and this time, i was gonna go for it.

372
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,350
There. I said it! Are you happy?

373
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,420
It kinda peters out after that.

374
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,310
I just... Suck pie off my
sweatshirt for the next half hour.

375
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,220
I'm so embarrassed.

376
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,370
Well,that goes without saying.

377
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,960
But the good news is is that your relationship
with the crew is back where it should be,

378
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,640
And now you can go on
your vacation guilt-free.

379
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,540
No,i can't. I feel like a jerk.

380
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,750
Oh,come on,lemon. Embrace your elitism.

381
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,100
What do we elites do when we screw up?

382
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,460
We pretend it never happened
and ve ourselves a giant bonus.

383
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,150
That you don't deserve. I
don't deserve to go anywhere.

384
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,630
Says who?

385
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,180
What elisa and i did wasn't
right, but we're happier now.

386
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,240
And you're going to be happier
when you go to st.Bartleby's

387
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,870
and get whatever's left
of your groove back.

388
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,470
Face it,lemon, not everyone gets a shot.

389
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,160
Not everyone gets to go to the
caribbean. But you're special.

390
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,670
You're better.

391
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:15,350
So go. Go to your... Island lover.

392
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,300
Yeah. All right,yes. I'm gonna.

393
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,590
Did that come out of you or me?

394
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,280
I don't know.

395
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,840
It's really hot in here.

396
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,790
You know,the flu vaccine is actually
a small dose of the virus itself.

397
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,250
So there's always
the risk that--

398
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,430
both ends.Both ends!
I'm not gonna make it!
