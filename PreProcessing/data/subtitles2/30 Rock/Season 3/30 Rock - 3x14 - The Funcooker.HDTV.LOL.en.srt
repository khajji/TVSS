1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,638
Miss Lemon! Let me help you out.

2
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:08,060
Thanks, Kenneth.

3
00:00:08,379 --> 00:00:10,800
What are all these little
plastic containers for?

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,929
Are you pickling squirrel meat?
Cause I can lend you my skull presser

5
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:18,051
No, I went to the new
flagship compartment store on 5th Avenue

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,056
and got everything I need
to get my life in order.

7
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:25,065
A stacker thing to separate junk mail
from your humidifier catalogs.

8
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,526
A thing you stick on your laptop
that holds your keys.

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,192
A round plastic deal
that holds your shoes

10
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:33,243
with a pocket for a photograph

11
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:35,218
of what shoes are in there.

12
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,868
I'm going to become wonderful.

13
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,543
It's a new beginning.

14
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:41,874
- Like a phoenix rise...
- Look out!

15
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:43,834
Or...

16
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,921
maybe this is gonna be
the worst day ever.

"The Funcooker"

20
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,534
Morning meeting.

21
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,694
Everybody shut up.
Shut up, Lutz.

22
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,196
Already today,

23
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,955
I have lost faith in decor-ganizing,

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,282
chipped a tooth...

25
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:20,157
And lost a shoving match
to what I thought

26
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:22,651
was a female bike messenger.

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,294
So I am asking all of you
for the next 12 to 14 hours

28
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,045
to just be cool.
Let's have a normal day.

29
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:32,101
- Guys, seriously, be cool.
- Why are you not wearing pants?

30
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:35,301
They still have the heat set for winter,
and my office is boiling.

31
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:36,594
Put on your pants!

32
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,098
Please make me
a dentist appointment today.

33
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,643
You can't go today.
You have jury duty.

34
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:45,347
What? No!
I'm registered in Illinois.

35
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:47,188
How did New York find me?

36
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,470
I changed
your voter registration for you.

37
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,235
What's wrong?
You told me to be more proactive.

38
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:55,633
I told you to buy more Proactiv!

39
00:01:57,412 --> 00:02:00,218
Mr. Donaghy wants to see you now
about what Jenna and Tracy did

40
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,911
during St. Patrick's day parade.

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,651
Was it something good?

42
00:02:04,914 --> 00:02:06,816
Have a seat. It was very simple.

43
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:10,211
I asked you two to host NBC's
coverage of St. Patrick's day parade.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,674
Read the cue cards. Promote the show.
So would you explain to Mr. O'Cannon

45
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,010
why it went so very wrong?

46
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,511
Sir, as I'm sure you know
from reading my blog,

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,889
I'm currently shooting
a feature film inspired by,

48
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,767
but, for legal reasons,
not based on Janis Joplin.

49
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:28,106
<i>Synonym's just another word
for the word you wanna use</i>

50
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,544
we can't sing the original songs,
but it's gonna be phenomenal.

51
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,297
But, between the movie at night
and working here during the day,

52
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,772
I am so exhausted.

53
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:37,782
So when I got to the parade...

54
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,864
That's no excuse, ye banshee.

55
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,052
You and this gravy face
have slarneyed up

56
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:44,577
a real donnybrook.

57
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,208
<i>Here comes the County Cork steppers.</i>

58
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,738
<i>Their traditional dance
celebrates the spirit</i>

59
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:52,313
<i>and the ingenuity
of the Irish people.</i>

60
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:55,778
<i>Wake up, mother...</i>

61
00:02:58,408 --> 00:02:59,848
You're a disgrace.

62
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,494
Passing out and cursing
on St. Patrick's day?

63
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,142
Is nothing sacred?

64
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,440
I should be rewarded
for going this long

65
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,439
without swearing on live TV.

66
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,650
The FCC disagrees. They've decided
to make an example of you

67
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:16,820
- and fine you personally $50,000.
- 50 grand?

68
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,155
Can anyone cut this in half?

69
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,742
Look at you! I told you.
You're spreading yourself too thin.

70
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,204
- I only heard the thin part.
- Lemon is right.

71
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:28,248
Obviously, you can't do
both TGS and Janie Jimplin.

72
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,584
I choose the movie.
My face is bigger on it.

73
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,920
I don't mean quit,
Liz will find a way to make both work.

74
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:35,092
Am I right?

75
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,466
I'll have to use you less
in the show.

76
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:40,844
And I'll scale back the movie.
We could cut the lesbian scene.

77
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,513
But the Oscars love
that kind of thing.

78
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,390
There's 2 guys in my gym
named Oscar.

79
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,585
You have got to start
taking care of yourself.

80
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,810
You're a wreck.

81
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,979
I am fine.

82
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,147
Jenna, that's a glue stick.

83
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,150
You're going to the doctor.

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,735
OK, great meeting.

85
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:04,276
Let's try to have a calm week
downstairs, shall we?

86
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:05,702
Yes, I'm trying.

87
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,057
I don't need any distractions.
On Friday,

88
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:10,657
Microwaves is announcing
a very big project

89
00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:12,732
or, should I say, very little?

90
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:15,087
The pocket microwave?

91
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,464
You can buy it on Friday
along with everyone else.

92
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,389
It has a ham button.
You used my idea!

93
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:24,809
I understand what it's like
having too much on your plate.

94
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:28,225
Between medical practice and this job,
I'm pulled in every direction.

95
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,602
What can I do, doctor?
Haven't been this tired

96
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,313
since I was forced to do
that dance marathon in Dubai.

97
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:35,415
I can give you
these pamphlets on stress

98
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,690
and diet and doing a movie
and a TV show at same time.

99
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,772
But they're all gonna tell you
that you need to give something up.

100
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,328
And they're wrong.

101
00:04:43,608 --> 00:04:45,533
You can burn the candle
at both ends.

102
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:46,518
Go on.

103
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:48,923
My lab works is in the field
of sleep research.

104
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,623
Mostly because I checked
the wrong box on a form once.

105
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:53,541
We are current working on a pill

106
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,247
that keeps people awake
under any circumstances.

107
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:59,522
It's being funded
by the U.S. Military and the WNBA.

108
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,509
- Does it work?
- It's kept my lab rats awake for days.

109
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,970
- But we're looking for human subjects.
- Where do I sign up?

110
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:08,662
Please, we don't want a paper trail.

111
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:14,437
Take 25 of these a day
for the rest of your life.

112
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:20,279
I am going to jury duty,
but I will be right back.

113
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,028
I got my princess Leia outfit,

114
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,031
some Playgirl magazines
from the early 1980s.

115
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,283
They will dismiss me
immediately as a weirdo.

116
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:29,916
- Who's in charge while you're gone?
- Let's see.

117
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,164
Pete is spending spring break
with his kids,

118
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,414
so no one.

119
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,883
No one here is in charge in any way.

120
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:37,996
If no one's in charge,

121
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,580
who will yell at me
for goofing up the lunch order?

122
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,882
We all will, Kenneth.
We all will.

123
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,859
You guys are my best friends.

124
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,934
There you are!
You wanna buy half a watch?

125
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,936
I have to pay my fine in cash.

126
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:58,022
I guess FCC stands
for Federal Bunch of Sticklers.

127
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,608
I hope you've learned
a lesson from this.

128
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:01,710
I sure have.

129
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:04,144
I learned that if you pay
some money afterwards,

130
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,114
you can say whatever you want on TV.

131
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:09,409
I can even say what Ernest Borgnine
whispered to me at...

132
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,035
Stop. That's not the lesson.

133
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,840
That's always the lesson.

134
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:15,832
If you have money,
you can do whatever you want.

135
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:18,837
Now I'm off to appear
on Martha Stewart live.

136
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,211
It's gonna be raunchy.

137
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,999
Great news.

138
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,510
I'm in the clinical trial
for a military-grade anti-sleeping pill.

139
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,079
Of course you are.

140
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:32,154
Now I can still be on the show
as much as you want and do the movie.

141
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,891
Look how much energy I have.

142
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,345
Come on, guys. I just have to go
and get out of jury duty,

143
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,932
and we can talk
about all of this when I get back.

144
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:45,074
I thought you left.

145
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,200
Listen to me.

146
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:49,366
I am not asking you this as the boss
you love to undermine,

147
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,452
but as the friend whose birthday
you love to forget.

148
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,888
Just be normal sauce
for like two hours.

149
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:57,387
Please.

150
00:06:57,889 --> 00:06:59,327
I will be right back.

151
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,353
And I don't really think
it's fair for me

152
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:06,967
to be in a jury
because I'm a hologram.

153
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,677
You seem fine to me.
Report to jury room B.

154
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,429
Charles what now?

155
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:19,933
The subject's unusually thirsty.

156
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:24,859
Everyone shut up.
Shut up, Lutz.

157
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,278
- Where's Lemon?
- She went to get out of jury duty.

158
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,072
Can we get lunch from McDonald's?

159
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:31,992
I need your creative input.

160
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,495
I've spent the better part
of last 3 years developing

161
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,537
a portable,
miniature microwave oven.

162
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,041
Most of that time has been spent
focused on coming up

163
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,764
with a hip name for the product,

164
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,795
that will appeal
to the marketing holy trinity:

165
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,171
college students, morbidly obese,
and homosexuals.

166
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,076
Unfortunately,
legal just informed me

167
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,828
that the name we settled on
for our bite-size microwave,

168
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:51,969
the bitenuker,
is highly offensive to those

169
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,596
who speak French or Dutch.

170
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,474
A Franco-Dutchman
would pronounce it "bet nyuker."

171
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,351
Zat's awful.

172
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,561
I'm sorry,
miss Laroche-Van Der Hoot.

173
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,366
This product rolls out in 2 days.

174
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:05,024
We're in danger of losing
the European market.

175
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,861
Everyone here needs
to brainstorm new names.

176
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,905
Starting today, you are all members
of the microwave division.

177
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,200
- We should make t-shirts!
- Yes. And you're in charge of that.

178
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,910
Remember, this isn't TGS, guys.

179
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,381
Let's not shoot
for the middle this time.

180
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:22,503
Absolutely not.

181
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,919
Excuse me, imperial guard,

182
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,219
how long do these arson trials
typically last?

183
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,654
Couple of weeks, probably.

184
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,282
You can drop the voice.

185
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,560
This used to get me out of jury duty
in Chicago all the time.

186
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,228
This ain't Chicago, honey.
Look at these people.

187
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:48,484
Studio 6H.

188
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:51,455
- It's Liz.
- Where are you?

189
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,115
The pig spoor has hit
the wind spinner.

190
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,565
<i>Mr. Jordan cussed at Martha Stewart,</i>

191
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,907
Miss Maroney drank all
the water out of the toilets.

192
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:01,461
And I keep starting to sneeze,
but nothing comes out.

193
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:04,125
What?
Does anyone there listen to me?

194
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:07,068
It's not my fault.
You didn't put anyone in charge.

195
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:08,601
<i>I've been put on a jury.</i>

196
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:11,191
I'll head up there as soon
as we are dismissed for the day.

197
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,614
Try not to let anything else
bad happen.

198
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:18,159
I'm in charge.

199
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,101
Attention, everyone.

200
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:25,268
All menstruating women go home
immediately.

201
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:31,402
He's been doing that
for almost eight hours,

202
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,571
Dr. Vicky.

203
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,094
You know what I like to do
for 8 hours?

204
00:09:35,219 --> 00:09:37,033
The TV guide crossword puzzle.

205
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,626
Give me your hand.

206
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,079
Now look into my eyes.

207
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,124
Now let's try one
where you're not...

208
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,685
- clawing at the window.
- I don't think so.

209
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,085
This feels more natural.

210
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,465
- You're saying, "give me your hand."
- This is what my character would do.

211
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,109
You're back.

212
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,299
Guess I'm not in charge anymore.

213
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:05,768
Guys?

214
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,212
I've got a couple hours.

215
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:15,447
- Where is everybody?
- They're all dead.

216
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:19,575
They're all dead unless they come up
with a name for my pocket microwave.

217
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,077
They're up in my office,

218
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,791
where there are fewer...

219
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:24,081
foosballs.

220
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,665
So who's writing the show?

221
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,502
Now that you're back,
I thought you could do it yourself.

222
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,921
How hard can it be?
"Hey, I'm rapping Obama".

223
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,969
"Welcome to another episode
of robot/bear talk show".

224
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:36,732
I'm Josh doing an impression
of De Niro as an auctioneer.

225
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:39,428
"Do I hear $1,000?
Do I hear $1,000?"

226
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,638
Really good!

227
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,809
Jenna fills in time with a song.
"Good night, good night". Mild applause.

228
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,909
You'll be done in an hour.

229
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:47,623
In the meantime,

230
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,856
any ideas for microwave names?

231
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:54,569
The small wonder.
The micromate. The porta-hotty.

232
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,347
If you're not going to take this
seriously, then do your job.

233
00:10:57,472 --> 00:10:59,699
Write the show, and more important,
deal with Tracy.

234
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,835
How? That guy's got enough money
to pay FCC fines for the next 200 years.

235
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,205
Forget the fines.
I've dealt with the FCC.

236
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,064
And NBC is issuing an apology
on Tracy's behalf.

237
00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:11,585
Your problem is
your advertisers are pulling out.

238
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,483
- My god. With no ads...
- No ads, no TGS.

239
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:15,558
No TGS...

240
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,102
I see you self-publishing your novel

241
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,137
and moving back in
with your parents.

242
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:22,763
I'll go talk to Tracy.

243
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,601
Just catching up on some work.

244
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,686
Really?

245
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,229
What sounds more shocking?

246
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,606
Or...

247
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,945
Here you go. Everything's OK.

248
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,242
No, just because you have money
doesn't mean you can say

249
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,744
whatever *** thing that you want.

250
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,053
This has gotten bigger
than you just paying fines.

251
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:51,433
Our sponsors are pulling out
because of you.

252
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:54,545
And if we don't have advertisers,
they're gonna pull the plug on TGS.

253
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,422
Think about how
you're hurting the crew.

254
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,133
I don't want to hurt the crew.
I love the crew.

255
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,179
All we do is joke around together

256
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,262
about our stupid boss, Liz Lem...

257
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,500
Anyway, unless you know

258
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,952
an advertiser that really wants
to be associated with this,

259
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,395
you need to stop.

260
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,614
Great idea.

261
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:14,982
Which part are you talking about?

262
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,299
The first 2/3.

263
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:18,382
I don't need to stop being myself

264
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,641
if I am the advertiser.

265
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,031
I have the money.

266
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,750
I'll just buy up all the ads

267
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,132
and let that hilarious
Tracy Jordan character

268
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:29,120
- do whatever he wants.
- Put the phone down. You can't do that.

269
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:31,457
- Jack won't let you.
- We'll see about that.

270
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,175
I need you to set up a meeting with you
and the folks from ad sales.

271
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,173
What do you mean
you're not in charge anymore?

272
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:45,951
Tracy Jordan from Tracyco
called to invite you to a luncheon

273
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:49,059
- celebrating their new ad campaign.
- What... seriously, not now.

274
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,277
All right, everyone,
back to the drawing board.

275
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,393
Legal rejected all of our ideas.

276
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,981
Every names we came up with
was offensive in some language.

277
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,550
Including English.

278
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,223
They knew what a Hot Richard was?

279
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:03,740
So we're going to think
outside the box a little bit here.

280
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,034
I'm going to pick some random letters
from this bag of Scrabble tiles.

281
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,219
Let fate choose a name for us.

282
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,003
Why don't we start over?

283
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:22,095
I have an idea. Why don't I just
pull them all at once?

284
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,247
Why don't we take a break?

285
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,474
Could you get Lemon
on the phone for me, please?

286
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,258
Ms. Gaulke,

287
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,838
how long have you been an employee

288
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,565
of Mailboxes Plus?

289
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,904
I've been an assistant manager there

290
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,579
for over seven years.

291
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,817
And how would you describe the events
that took place there on December 17th?

292
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,490
The night of the fire.

293
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,568
Christmas was always
a very busy time at the store.

294
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:54,070
Throw in a late Hanukkah and the fact
that I work in a "Kwanzaa neighborhood",

295
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:56,667
and it all made
for a very stressful day.

296
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,921
I sent Malik uptown
for more 18-inch boxes,

297
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,221
but he returned unrepentant

298
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,217
with 12-inch ones.

299
00:14:05,985 --> 00:14:08,554
Christine was late,
as well as Harry S.

300
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:11,015
They said it was a problem
with the subways,

301
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,268
I suspect they were doing
sex with each other.

302
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,858
How many employees
do you have, Ms. Gaulke?

303
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,746
I supervise 12 employees,

304
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:20,900
most of whom would be
unemployable in any other field.

305
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,199
They are selfish,
irresponsible people

306
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:25,613
who I know talk about me
behind my back.

307
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:29,674
They seem to think that their job
is wasting my time and energy

308
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:32,498
by making their every
minuscule problem

309
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,246
my personal responsibility.

310
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,748
They don't care.

311
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,876
And don't even get me started
on Tracy and Jenna.

312
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,380
And when the last one of them
trundled off that night,

313
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:45,714
I smelled the air,
and I could feel that it was time.

314
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,385
Time for a new beginning.

315
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:52,353
And I knew that this was possible
only through a cleansing fire.

316
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:55,017
It would all have to burn.

317
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,479
The packing peanuts,
the delivery slips...

318
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:01,232
All of it would dance
in the warm mouth of my fire.

319
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,658
And a new, better, wonderful me

320
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:07,343
would rise from the ashes
like a phoenix.

321
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:09,927
Behold...

322
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,809
the splendor of my beginning!

323
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:15,105
I rest my case, your honor.

324
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:21,585
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

325
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:23,707
Underlings, I wanna hear your ideas.

326
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,633
I knew this day would come.
I have so much inside of me.

327
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:30,052
My first idea is a movie
that combines action and romance.

328
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,555
Kenneth, you go.

329
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,548
A name...

330
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,894
for a pocket microwave oven.

331
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,631
That's neat.
A little microwave oven.

332
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,980
So it's kinda like a funcooker.

333
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:43,282
The Funcooker!

334
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:47,444
It's snappy, fresh,
and incapable of offending.

335
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,910
Get legal on the phone.

336
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:53,617
- I owe you one.
- One hug, you mean?

337
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,334
They're reading Mr. Jordan's apology
if you want to watch it.

338
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,102
<i>"I regret any pain my words and actions
may have caused.</i>

339
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,004
<i>"I apologize to my family my fans,</i>

340
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:06,505
<i>"and the American public.</i>

341
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,507
<i>"Peace and love, Tracy Jordan."</i>

342
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,923
<i>A heartfelt apology from a comedy icon.
And we'll be right back.</i>

343
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:14,382
<i>I do not apologize, America.</i>

344
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,557
<i>I didn't even write that apology.</i>

345
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,687
<i>I am advertiser Tracy Jordan,
and I approve this message.</i>

346
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,451
<i>I am an advertiser.</i>

347
00:16:23,576 --> 00:16:26,038
<i>I am an advertiser.</i>

348
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,082
<i>Is that 30 seconds yet?</i>

349
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:30,546
Doesn't matter.

350
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:32,781
We have The Funcooker.

351
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:36,738
Hi, it's Liz.

352
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,610
I should be able
to get up there in an hour.

353
00:16:40,034 --> 00:16:41,805
Where are you rushing off to?

354
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,780
Work?

355
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:43,899
Not me.

356
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,212
I'm gonna have a sandwich
in my cell and take a nap.

357
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:49,548
This man opens doors for me.

358
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,192
I'm free.

359
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,926
I'm freer than you.

360
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:54,928
Freer than you.

361
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,584
Professor Bananas is dead.

362
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:05,478
Look, I know we're fighting,
but I need to borrow your car.

363
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,479
<i>30 seconds.</i>

364
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:11,612
- How are you feeling, Miss?
- Great. Alert.

365
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,086
Is your vision steadily
narrowing down to a pinpoint

366
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:17,653
- as if darkness is closing in on you?
- No, ma'am.

367
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:24,645
<i>Cast is set
for robot/bear talk show.</i>

368
00:17:25,113 --> 00:17:25,985
I'm back.

369
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,838
What's going on? What have they done?
Do we need to shut this down?

370
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,341
Calm down. Everything's going
to work out just fine.

371
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,926
The show's about to begin,
your sketch is adequate,

372
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,605
and I've got The Funcooker.

373
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,765
- What about the...
- <i>It's the bear and robot talk show.</i>

374
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,892
Jenna needs to sleep,
or she's going to die!

375
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,370
<i>Which one of you is Jenna?</i>

376
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:49,627
<i>Go to sleep!</i>

377
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:51,248
<i>Sleep, Jenna!</i>

378
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,423
<i>Sleep! It's for your own good.</i>

379
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:55,128
<i>Don't fight me.</i>

380
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:02,037
- <i>Sleep or die!</i>
- <i>Hey, America.</i>

381
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,082
- Come on Tracy. Please cover for them.
- <i>Check out my funcooker.</i>

382
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,209
Did he just say funcooker?

383
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,158
That's where I've heard that.

384
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,319
Go to commercial!

385
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:20,764
Go to commercial!

386
00:18:21,047 --> 00:18:22,795
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan.

387
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,746
My wife's throwing away
some of our old towels.

388
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,828
Do you want them?
Cause they're out by the trashcans.

389
00:18:28,953 --> 00:18:30,817
Now that's got to be 30 seconds.

390
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:32,711
Nine?

391
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:35,487
Here comes the funcooker.

392
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,541
I'll be with you in a minute.

393
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,544
Could we get some diet slice
and pita chips up in here?

394
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Bitenuker!

395
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,717
9:00 A.M. Monday.

396
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,970
Right? I'll be there with pants on.
You're the best.

397
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:43,347
Hi, girlfriend.

398
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,850
Let's go out this weekend
and talk about you.

399
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,833
All I did was ask for a diet slice

400
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,458
and some pita chips.

401
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,116
Nice try.

402
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:54,566
Now it's my turn.

403
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,450
They're all terrified of you.
That'll get you a week of good behavior.

404
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:06,818
My containers.

405
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:09,056
My new beginning.

406
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,674
We've both had a rough week.

407
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,494
You went firebug, and I'm sitting
on four million...

408
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,225
mini-microwaves that legal
won't let out of the warehouse.

409
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,051
I suggest we both go to our
respective homes, open a bottle of wine,

410
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:23,972
and heat up some ham in the shower.

411
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,473
It works in the shower?

412
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,384
You know what?

413
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,602
This really is the best day ever.

414
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,817
Here comes the funcooker!

9999
