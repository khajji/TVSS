00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:18,775
Mr. Jordan, I understand
how hard that must've been,

160
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,143
but it was so long ago.

161
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:22,179
You can't understand, Ken.

162
00:06:22,246 --> 00:06:25,116
Where I come from,
street cred is everything.

163
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,087
That's why when I left
that school in shame,

164
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,022
I vowed never to cry again.

165
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:32,390
And I never have!

166
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,492
Um...

167
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,196
Don't die!
I love you, Jack!

168
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,810
I want diet slice
and some pita chips.

169
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,334
I don't wanna be here!
I don't like it here!

170
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:43,904
I was just callin' y'all
a bunch of racists.

171
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,905
We're not really best friends,
we're just good friends.

172
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,209
I was chicken!
I was chicken!

173
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,500
I'm never going back
to Frank Lucas High School

174
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:55,180
to be reminded
of my greatest failure.

175
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,220
Mr. Jordan,
I think it's sad

176
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:58,850
that you're still
ashamed of that kid.

177
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,194
That kid is you.

178
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,421
Uh-uh. I've changed, Ken.

179
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,690
Into a badass adult.

180
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,893
I have a wolf dog,
I have two bad knees,

181
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,261
And a gun.

182
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,698
That I lost!

183
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,365
[knocks]

184
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,435
Milton, are you
going somewhere?

185
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,967
I have to get
back to Bennington.

186
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:21,741
<i>I owe my publishers a chapter
of From Peanut to President.</i>

187
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,209
But before I go,

188
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,435
I think we should talk
about the other day.

189
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,655
Milton,
the Donaghys do not talk.

190
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,316
We let things fester until they
erupt in inappropriate anger,

191
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:34,192
preferably during a wedding
or elementary school graduation.

192
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,755
Well, the Greenes
are talkers and huggers.

193
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:38,221
I'm sorry, Jack.

194
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:40,226
I should never have
put you in this position.

195
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,603
Or this one.

196
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:45,595
Look, I don't want
a kidney from you.

197
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,433
All I want is
to make up for lost time.

198
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,363
Can I come back next week?

199
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:53,669
Sure, okay.

200
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:55,672
We can go to a Yankee game.
I have great seats.

201
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:56,750
In the section between

202
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:59,108
the players' wives
and the players' mistresses.

203
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:00,610
But I don't go on bat day.

204
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:02,813
So, my son likes baseball.

205
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,578
You know,

206
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,037
there's a great
sports memorabilia store

207
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:07,286
on Third Avenue.

208
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:10,721
Remember Carlton Fisk's home run
in the '75 series?

209
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:11,773
That's this ball?

210
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:13,957
No, that's a ball he
fouled off in the third inning.

211
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,359
Huh.

212
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:18,362
No, I want you to have it.

213
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:19,796
Milton, that's too generous.

214
00:08:19,864 --> 00:08:22,298
No, I insist.
For bringing me into your life.

215
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:24,667
I-I-I can't.

216
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,872
Jack.
We're having a catch.

217
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:31,907
Don't ruin it, Milton.

218
00:08:31,974 --> 00:08:33,310
Just like
Jimmy and Chip Carter.

219
00:08:33,376 --> 00:08:34,542
Did you hear what I said?

220
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:37,112
[laughing] This is great.

221
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,246
Ooh!

222
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:39,086
{ Advertisement }

223
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:50,118
Damn, Ken,
you know who that was?

224
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:52,221
I don't, sir, do you?

225
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:53,567
I grew up with that guy.

226
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:56,403
He was the baddest gangster
in my class.

227
00:08:56,438 --> 00:09:00,070
We called him "Mean Steve", but
his real name was Steven Killer.

228
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,629
Does seeing him
in this menial job

229
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:02,982
make you think about anything?

230
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:05,038
Well, if a badass
O.G. Like that

231
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:07,742
could get stuck deliverin' food,
how did I get out?

232
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:10,889
Because you're not
a bad-bleep O.G.

233
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:13,262
You're a sensitive artist.

234
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:14,117
You're different.

235
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:15,787
And isn't that
a message those kids

236
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,081
at your old high school
should hear?

237
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:19,984
You're right, Ken.
They should.

238
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:22,183
Five f-bombs, right?

239
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,251
[phone rings]

240
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:25,586
Hello.

241
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:26,821
Jack, it's Leo.

242
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:29,623
I got the, uh, results
of your blood work back.

243
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,863
Right, yes, and?

244
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:35,170
Well, "cytotoxic cross match
of target HLA

245
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,591
resulted in lyses of cells."

246
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:39,833
Now, Jack, in layman's terms,

247
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,503
what do you think that means?

248
00:09:41,538 --> 00:09:44,004
I don't know. Could I give
this guy a kidney or not?

249
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:45,939
"Due to negative
blood tissue match,

250
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,142
transplantation
is not recommended."

251
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,610
Damn it, is this
written in Greek?

252
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:51,212
It means we're not a match.

253
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,146
Oh. Sorry.

254
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:54,990
I was really looking
forward to putting

255
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:56,451
your father's kidney in you.

256
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:58,218
The other way around, Leo.

257
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:02,122
[chuckles]
That's not what these forms say.

258
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:03,898
Lemon.

259
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,193
I'm getting
Milton Greene a kidney.

260
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:07,361
[gasps] You're a match?

261
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:08,182
No, I'm not.

262
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:09,863
Then where are you gonna
get a kidney from?

263
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:11,523
I don't know, but I have
the entire

264
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:13,947
liberal media
establishment at my disposal.

265
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,744
The same manipulation machine
that got people

266
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,136
to vote for Barack Obama

267
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:19,271
and donate all that money
after rainstorm Katrina.

268
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:22,073
I'm going to use that
to find my dad a kidney.

269
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:23,637
You should do
a celebrity concert.

270
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:25,721
Like that gay guy did
to benefit old gays.

271
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:28,508
Yes, a benefit concert
like "We are the World"

272
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:31,064
or "Weird Al" Yankovic's
less successful

273
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,641
parody benefit
"We are the Pizza".

274
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:34,086
Tell Pete to start
building a set.

275
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,854
Wait a minute,
we have to do this?

276
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:37,590
Well, you found a way
to do your day job

277
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,715
and be on Vontella...
a great job, by the way.

278
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,378
I haven't seen that many
riled-up dirtbags

279
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,827
since CVS put the cold medicine
behind the counter.

280
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:45,933
Well, they want me to go
back on Vontella, actually,

281
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:48,979
but I'm not sure I'm qualified
to give relationship advice.

282
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:49,716
You're not.

283
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:50,988
Suburban seventh graders

284
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:52,655
have more sexual experience
than you do,

285
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,403
but that doesn't matter.

286
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:56,702
- Right, because I'm helping people.
- No, you're helping yourself.

287
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:58,878
So make the most
of this opportunity.

288
00:10:58,913 --> 00:11:01,552
After all, how many years
does TGS have left?

289
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,926
I don't know. 20?

290
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:05,132
[laughs] What do you
think this is, Wings?

291
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,473
You've got two more years,
at best.

292
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:08,050
Lemon,

293
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:10,645
This is what I've been trying to
tell you since I first met you.

294
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,100
Life is short. You've gotta
get out there and get yours.

295
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,935
"Get yours".
I like that.

296
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,578
Can I use that
as one of my catch phrases?

297
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,871
Sorry, Leo Spaceman's
using it as the title

298
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:21,916
of his new sex book
for couples.

299
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:23,468
Ooh. Ooh.

300
00:11:23,535 --> 00:11:24,469
Mary.

301
00:11:24,536 --> 00:11:26,338
Uh, Elvis.

302
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,672
Mr. Aiken.

303
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:29,641
Thank you all for coming here
on such short notice.

304
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,692
No problem, I just had
my driver drop me off.

305
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,015
So how come I saw you
getting off the subway?

306
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,148
What were you doin'
down there?

307
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:35,977
Uh, okay.

308
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:37,220
I asked the three of you
to be here

309
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,133
because you are all deeply
committed to charity work.

310
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:43,096
My Mary J. Blige Foundation
is celebrating its tenth year

311
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:45,013
of searching
for the Loch Ness monster.

312
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,799
Well, musicians have banded
together before to solve...

313
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,030
All kinds of problems.

314
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:51,088
World hunger, the collapse
of the American farm,

315
00:11:51,123 --> 00:11:54,760
global warming, and uh,
you're over 3 guys.

316
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,801
I am disappointed
and, in us as a group.

317
00:11:56,836 --> 00:11:59,551
How about a problem
you can solve?

318
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,668
One song, one man,
one kidney.

319
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:03,369
Let me get this straight.

320
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:06,142
You want us to do
a charity concert for one guy?

321
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,774
Elvis, haven't you said
that if a song

322
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,216
reaches just one person,
you've done your job?

323
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,042
No, I've never said that.

324
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:14,304
Fine. Listen, the man who
needs the kidney is my father.

325
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:16,577
We just met,
and I don't want to lose him

326
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,336
before I get
a chance to know him.

327
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,082
Please, I'm asking
for your help.

328
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,597
Okay, let's cut to the chase.

329
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:24,738
M.J., you owe me.

330
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:27,974
Who got you out of a 20-year exclusive
performance contract at Sea World?

331
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:29,476
Aiken, your cousin
Kenneth Parcell

332
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:30,941
already promised me
you'd do this.

333
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,759
And Elvis,
or should I say,

334
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:36,183
Declan McManus,
international art thief?

335
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:38,003
Okay,
Jack Dona-you-tumbled-me.

336
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:38,990
We'll do it.

337
00:12:39,471 --> 00:12:42,039
Also, you have a ton
of interview requests.

338
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:43,678
And they want you
on the seventh hour

339
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,267
<i>of The Today Show
tomorrow morning.</i>

340
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:46,729
Tell them all yes.

341
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:48,688
I'm getting mine, Cerie.

342
00:12:49,113 --> 00:12:52,411
Also, Pete and Tracy's wives
are in your office.

343
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,317
Paula is Pete's wife,
and Angie is the black one...

344
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:55,979
Okay, Cerie, I got it.

345
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:58,791
Dr. Liz, we need some advice
from the dealbreaker lady.

346
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,144
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

347
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,016
I know you,
and I know your husbands...

348
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:04,141
I just found out Tracy has

349
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,280
a secret credit card
I didn't know anything about.

350
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:07,695
Not on my watch, biatch.

351
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,764
And he's been
using that credit card

352
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:12,817
to pay for a hotel room here
in New York two days a week.

353
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:15,650
As that did.
Shut it down. Dealbreaker.

354
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:16,236
Paula.

355
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:18,930
Pete is refusing to drive
to my parents' place

356
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,187
for just two weeks
of family vacation.

357
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:22,556
No to the way
to the Jose.

358
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:25,295
But Paula, talk it out
before you walk it out.

359
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,495
And I'm here in New York

360
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,666
while he's back
in Hooglanderveen.

361
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,618
Long distance
is the wrong distance, Sue.

362
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:31,596
Dealbreaker.

363
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:33,654
Mickey Rourke
wants to take me camping.

364
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,386
Dealbreaker, Jenna! God!

365
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:37,587
I haven't seen
my fiance in seven months.

366
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,661
Cerie, I have
two words for you.

367
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,320
[robot voice]
Robot warning.

368
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:42,928
Okay, that catch phrase
needs a little work.

369
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:44,098
Dealbreaker!

370
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:45,961
Teach it like ya preach it,
Liz Lemon!

371
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:48,601
[cheering]

372
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:51,480
I almost didn't make it here
this afternoon.

373
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:54,754
But then a very special friend
of mine showed me the way.

374
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,710
So I'd like to take
a moment to thank

375
00:13:56,745 --> 00:14:00,209
Victor Cordova from the Sunoco
Station on Lennox Avenue.

376
00:14:00,277 --> 00:14:01,132
[applause]

377
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:04,011
But there's another reason
why I almost didn't come today.

378
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:06,583
Fear.

379
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,218
Fear of letting people
know the real me.

380
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:12,275
I have but one thing
to say to all of you.

381
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,934
Be yourself.

382
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:16,267
And I'm talkin'
to you clearly, gay kid.

383
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,055
Who told?

384
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:19,963
And you, white kid
just tryin' to go unnoticed.

385
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:22,036
- Aw, come on.
- Just be yourself.

386
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:23,898
And I guarantee you

387
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:26,886
every single person in this room

388
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:31,148
will one day be
president of the United States.

389
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,475
Thank you.
[applause]

390
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:37,853
Tracy, before you go, I have
a special surprise for you.

391
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:39,974
Okay,
but I'm allergic to horses.

392
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:44,414
It is my pleasure to award
you this honorary diploma.

393
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:46,987
Congratulations.

394
00:14:48,856 --> 00:14:50,423
[crying]

395
00:14:50,492 --> 00:14:52,092
Take a breath, Mr. Jordan.

396
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,094
[crying]
Aah!

397
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:56,551
Aah!

398
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:59,035
Who wants my autograph? Aah!

399
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,333
So you can see
how important this is to me.

400
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,137
- Are you in?
- I'm in. I think it'll be fun.

401
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:06,645
I actually played a kidney
in my fifth grade school play.

402
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,425
With this loser...

403
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,922
I'm in, but when
Costello's not lookin'

404
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:11,359
I'm gonna punch him
in the back of the head.

405
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:12,144
Fair enough.

406
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,244
Hey, Jack,

407
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,079
Are you doing
my musical benefit idea?

408
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:17,752
- Because I'd love to be...
- Uh, no, it didn't work out.

409
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:19,484
Jenna, you know
my European friends

410
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,905
Uh, Rokus and,
uh, Shandelay.

411
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,063
- Alloo.
- Please to meet.

412
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,261
Thank you.

413
00:15:31,615 --> 00:15:33,342
Cerie, I'm going out
for a couple hours.

414
00:15:33,377 --> 00:15:34,266
Okay. I'll just, uh...

415
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,199
I'm meeting a book agent

416
00:15:35,266 --> 00:15:36,934
about writing
a Dealbreaker book.

417
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,188
He's gonna take me to lunch
wherever I wanna go.

418
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:41,677
Do you know if there's
a sit-down Quizno's in midtown?

419
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:43,974
Never mind.

420
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,015
Liz Lemon,
you dumb bitch.

421
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,456
What?

422
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:47,472
Here's the reason
I don't wanna go

423
00:15:47,507 --> 00:15:50,294
on that family vacation:
It's a working farm.

424
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,118
And I'm the only one
whose hands are big enough

425
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:54,123
to guide the bull
during mating.

426
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:56,229
- Yeah, well, dealbreaker...
- Shut up.

427
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,627
There you are,
you stupid cracker.

428
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:01,798
You know why I get a hotel room?
To poop in peace.

429
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,505
No kids bangin'
on the door,

430
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,783
No phones ringin'.

431
00:16:04,818 --> 00:16:05,834
It's my time!

432
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:09,261
Every Tuesday and Thursday
at 3:00 pm!

433
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:11,619
I don't know why
I only go twice a week.

434
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:14,156
<i>That's what Angie
should be worried about!</i>

435
00:16:14,191 --> 00:16:15,349
You've gotta stop
giving advice.

436
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:17,013
You don't know what
you're talking about.

437
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,778
No, I'm not stopping.
I'm gonna write a book.

438
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:20,719
I have to!
This is my next step!

439
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:21,769
What're you talking about?

440
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:23,810
This job isn't gonna
last forever, Pete.

441
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:26,401
TGS has two years left, tops.

442
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:31,039
Pete, how'm I gonna live?
I only have $300 million.

443
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,023
[laughs]
This... this is crazy, Jack.

444
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:35,691
I've never seen
anything like this.

445
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,358
And I was
at "We are the pizza."

446
00:16:37,427 --> 00:16:38,759
Well, I thought
I had to do something.

447
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:40,061
Once I found
that I wasn't a match,

448
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:41,128
I felt like I'd let you down.

449
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:43,065
You couldn't
let me down, Jack.

450
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,101
- [coughs] Get a room.
- Yeah, get a room.

451
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,202
High school graduate.

452
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,705
Do you know what this means,
Grizz, Dotcom, Ken?

453
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,306
We're goin' to college!

454
00:16:54,374 --> 00:16:58,343
And so began
the craziest summer of my life.

455
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,544
How'd you say that
without movin' your mouth?

456
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:03,013
Say what?

457
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,169
Lemon, how are you?

458
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,985
You know what?
I'm good.

459
00:17:07,054 --> 00:17:09,888
I've got a book deal,
a free sandwich in my pocket,

460
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:12,223
and I have this weird,
loose feeling in my shoulders.

461
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,031
What is that?

462
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,801
It's either happiness
or osteoporosis.

463
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,362
I think it's happiness.

464
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:21,533
You're getting yours.

465
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,663
Jack, what have you done?

466
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:26,102
I called in
every favor I had.

467
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,370
He's my dad, Liz.

468
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:29,472
Oh, my god, Sheryl Crow!

469
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,133
We were best friends
in elementary school!

470
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,902
- Hi, Sheryl!
- We're live in three...

471
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:37,346
- Two...
- I'll talk to her later.
