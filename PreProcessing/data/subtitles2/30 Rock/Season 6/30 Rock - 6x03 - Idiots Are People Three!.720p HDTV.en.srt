00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:42,068
Damn it!

164
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,169
No names!

165
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,204
We don't want him to die.

166
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,205
But more importantly,

167
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,206
we don't want to be blamed for

168
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,207
what's happened to him.

169
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,208
It's been five hours since

170
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:50,744
he's pressed an elevator button.

171
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:52,495
His office is on
this floor, isn't it?

172
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:55,482
Yes, but to get him there, you
have to go through the backstage

173
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:57,317
and the backstage
is full of people.

174
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,985
We need a distraction.

175
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,005
Something to clear
the halls of TGS.

176
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,296
How much time will
Kenneth and I have?

177
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:11,398
How long is the show?

178
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:12,933
I don't know.

179
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:18,271
I've never done it before, baby.

180
00:06:18,306 --> 00:06:19,439
I will make
a brief statement

181
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,975
on behalf of
the idiot community,

182
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:23,810
then I will open
the floor for questions.

183
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:26,196
Since its founding
early this afternoon,

184
00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:30,083
the national association for
zero intolerance, or Nazi...

185
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,985
- We should change that.
- It's fine.

186
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,589
We are outraged that the
American bigot, Liz Lemon,

187
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:37,591
has made no effort
to reach out to us.

188
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,825
Tracy, are you kidding me?

189
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,160
I have been calling
your cell all day.

190
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,545
My ringtone is
the chicken dance.

191
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:44,547
If I answer it,
I won't hear the whole song!

192
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,932
I have to go talk
to Jack right now.

193
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:49,636
Wait for me in my office.

194
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,671
Is there anything
you would like to add?

195
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:56,109
These microphones look like
black ice cream cones.

196
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:00,447
Thank you all for coming out.

197
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:04,034
Jack, I am giving you your
money back.

198
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,519
You can't tear up
my checks, Criss.

199
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:09,039
They're printed on
Nixon's old bed sheets.

200
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:11,691
Look, I don't understand
your relationship with Liz.

201
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:13,126
She's my subordifriend.

202
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,494
Well, she's my girlfriend
and I'm not

203
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:15,695
gonna let you
get in between us.

204
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,831
[Laughs]
It's a little late for that.

205
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:20,033
You're not going to want to hear
this, but I am

206
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,635
officially disapproving of you.

207
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,803
Well, I'm sorry, but I really
don't care what you think.

208
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:26,373
That's really not how things
work around here, Criss.

209
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,475
Damn it, Criss, stop talking
to him, it's a trap!

210
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:29,476
You said I won.

211
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,477
You said you wouldn't ask any

212
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:31,878
more questions about Criss.

213
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,713
I said I wouldn't ask
you any more questions.

214
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:35,265
Semantics!

215
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:36,549
You had no right
to come to my home

216
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,319
to trick Criss to
rearrange my bathroom.

217
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:40,487
- For the better.
- Yes.

218
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,155
The basket of shells
was a nice touch.

219
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:43,406
But, I'm afraid
I have bad news.

220
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:46,943
I just told Criss that I am
officially disapproving.

221
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:48,662
- Oh, no.
- Who cares?

222
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:50,263
Of course, you're free to make
your own decisions, Lemon.

223
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:53,033
You can either pretend that you
and I are not in agreement

224
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,367
and continue this, uh...

225
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:55,835
charade.

226
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,470
Or you can part ways
with Criss now

227
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:00,373
and go and find someone who will
truly make you happy.

228
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:01,775
I'm sorry, is this guy
breaking up with me?

229
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,460
Of course, you and Criss
can still be friends.

230
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:06,262
Okay, Liz, I guess you
got a choice to make.

231
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:08,598
You can listen to Jack,
we can call it quits

232
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:09,849
and I go back to
sleeping on the floor

233
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:11,351
of my Uncle's
mattress store, or...

234
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:12,352
You don't understand.

235
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:13,853
He's in my head.

236
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:14,854
Okay, forget Jack.

237
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:16,589
What does Liz think, hmm?

238
00:08:16,624 --> 00:08:17,757
What do you want?

239
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,776
Do you want to be
with me or not?

240
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,629
Don't look at me, ask her.

241
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:23,997
I don't know, Liz.

242
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,949
It's gonna go wrong
eventually, right?

243
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:28,318
I mean, I like him, but,
what are we doing here?

244
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:29,636
Really?

245
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,539
This is how you see yourself?

246
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,941
Of course I pick you, Criss.

247
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,744
If you would just address
some of the issues

248
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:40,213
that we as a group have
been talking about.

249
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,248
[Sighs]
Unbelievable.

250
00:08:44,451 --> 00:08:46,986
Well, I have to go get a bunch
of gaybies into preschool

251
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:50,006
before we all get sued,
so, uh...

252
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,260
Well done, Lemon.

253
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,325
So, then he says
"Tiff down there"...

254
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:02,330
[Both laugh]

255
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:03,915
Good one, Jack.

256
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:04,916
I'll tell you,
friendship is the

257
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,551
one kind of ship
that never sinks.

258
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,236
Douglas, so good to see you.

259
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,205
Uh, do you know
my friend, Devin Banks?

260
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,206
A friend of Donaghy's, eh?

261
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,641
I'll watch my wallet.

262
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:16,093
[Laughs]
Yes, yes, very good, Douglas.

263
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:17,111
Very funny.

264
00:09:17,145 --> 00:09:18,512
So now we're all good friends

265
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:20,114
and good friends do
favors for each other.

266
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:21,682
Is that a St. Matthew's tie?

267
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:22,733
I didn't know you went there.

268
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:23,935
Not only did I go there,

269
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,736
I happen to be President
of the board.

270
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:27,321
Although, during
my financial report

271
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,423
I may be President of the bored.

272
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,294
[Forced laugh]
[Forced laugh]

273
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,079
St. Matthew's is such a
wonderful school.

274
00:09:35,113 --> 00:09:36,330
We were just talking about that.

275
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:38,399
In fact, Devin's triplets are

276
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,801
applying to St. Matthew's
right now.

277
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,970
I see...

278
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,805
Splendid.

279
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,566
On a totally unrelated topic,

280
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:50,531
did you know that I'm also on the
board of the Manhattan hospital

281
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:52,813
for rich whites and
assimilated Jews?

282
00:09:52,848 --> 00:09:53,814
I did not know that.

283
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:55,317
Unfortunately,

284
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:57,232
shortly before Don Geiss died,

285
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:01,188
the Geiss foundation made a
sizeable pledge to the hospital.

286
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:04,558
A pledge which, sadly,
has not been fulfilled.

287
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:05,653
What a coincidence

288
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:08,629
because Devin and I happen
to know the new chair

289
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,815
of the Geiss
foundation quite well.

290
00:10:10,866 --> 00:10:12,600
That is a coincidence.

291
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:17,622
[All laugh awkwardly]

292
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:21,842
Kathy, are you
ready to come out now?

293
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:27,281
There she is.

294
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:28,649
Hey, you.

295
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:30,217
Hey, funny.

296
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,453
Kathy, I know this
is a lot to take in but,

297
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:35,256
your father made a promise
to my friend, so,

298
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,626
what can we do to get
that check right now?

299
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,364
And that's why I'm so thrilled
to introduce NBC's new mascot,

300
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:45,016
Magellica the Unicorn.

301
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,317
It's wondrous.

302
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:47,351
Indeed.

303
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:48,836
Back to you, Thomas.

304
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,305
Okay...we now return
to our coverage

305
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,541
of that train derailment
in California.

306
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:56,344
And idiots can do anything
we put our minds to.

307
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:58,713
I played
a "nucular" psychiatrist

308
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,848
in a James "Bong" movie.

309
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:03,317
Look, what do I need to do to
make this go away?

310
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:04,318
I want you to call my phone so

311
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:05,786
I can hear
the chicken dance again.

312
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:07,488
And I want the video
for my new single

313
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:09,156
to play on TGS this week.

00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:22,403
[Sighs]
I'll try to cut it down.

323
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:24,055
But above all, we want you to

324
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:26,407
recognize who we are
as a community.

325
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:29,877
Idiots aren't just strippers or
stay at home moms.

326
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:31,862
Idiots are all around us.

327
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:33,981
I couldn't find a Lincoln hat

328
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,983
so I grabbed this
chimney sweep hat instead.

329
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,017
If anyone notices...

330
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,570
We're dead.

331
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:40,955
So it would mean a lot if you

332
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,890
apologized publically,
Liz Lemon.

333
00:11:42,924 --> 00:11:44,825
Let the healing begin.

334
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,094
And since
you wrote my apology,

335
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:49,363
we went on ahead
and wrote yours.

336
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,733
Careful.

337
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:54,835
Careful.

338
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:57,471
Who designed your bathroom?

339
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:58,639
It's exquisite.

340
00:11:58,673 --> 00:11:59,874
I did, you son of a bitch.

341
00:11:59,908 --> 00:12:01,892
I'm excellent at
rearranging bathrooms.

342
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:03,544
Now get out of here,
you got what you wanted.

343
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,596
I just wanted to
say thank you, Jack.

344
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:06,597
Very impressive.

345
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:07,598
Can't imagine that your boss,

346
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:08,733
Hank Cooper, was all that happy

347
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:10,451
about the logo change.

348
00:12:10,485 --> 00:12:12,052
Eh, we'll see.

349
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:12,994
Our new slogan,

350
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,989
"NBC, we have a magical horse?"

351
00:12:15,023 --> 00:12:18,225
Is testing, uh...Okay.

352
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:21,061
Oh, I also wanted to
say that I was lying

353
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:22,763
when I said that this
wasn't a business play.

354
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,231
Banks, you're out of the game.

355
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,232
That's true.

356
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,734
And I've admitted defeat.

357
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:28,102
For our generation.

358
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:29,770
But for the next generation?

359
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:32,807
Well, thanks to you,
the Banks boys are way ahead.

360
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:34,208
All the favors
that you called in,

361
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:36,243
you would have used next year
for little lippy.

362
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:37,411
Liddy.

363
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:38,646
Is that even a name?

364
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,314
In Brooklyn, I know,
like, six lippys...

365
00:12:40,348 --> 00:12:42,383
Doesn't matter.

366
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,452
You just mortgaged
your daughter's future

367
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:46,103
to get out of
a little jam at work.

368
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:49,790
My mommy and me group would
really judge your parenting.

369
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:51,892
Especially lippy's mother.

370
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:52,927
Which lippy?

371
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,228
Lippy D.

372
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:57,164
Oh, God, Liddy might have to
go to public school.

373
00:12:57,199 --> 00:12:58,566
See you in 30 years, Jack.

374
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,268
I wonder what Liddy will be
doing with her degree from suny.

375
00:13:01,286 --> 00:13:02,269
Don't even say it.

376
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:03,304
Oneonta.

377
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,841
You, jacket.

378
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:18,156
Well, hello there,
welcome to the White House.

379
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:20,218
[Crowd cheers and applauds]

380
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:21,735
Four score and
seven years ago...

381
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,503
What's with that hat?

382
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,739
[Feminine voice] Oh, I think
it looks very authentic.

383
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:29,543
Yeah, I guess you're right.

384
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,351
Mary Todd, you say?

385
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,072
Wha... what's happening?

386
00:13:42,123 --> 00:13:44,157
Shh, Pete, don't talk.

387
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,827
Wassup?!

388
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,528
Yeah, baby!

389
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:52,165
I'm here today to apologize for
my earlier comments.

390
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,769
I used an offensive term to
describe a group of people

391
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:59,006
who made America the great...

392
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,375
continent that it is today.

393
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,376
Yeah!

394
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,543
These kickass people have

395
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,430
given the world countless
bodacious things

396
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:10,400
like the birther movement,
intelligent design...

397
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:11,685
[Crowd cheers]

398
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:14,154
Water parks... no, I will not
endorse water parks.

399
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,189
They are a cesspool of
disease and people boo you

400
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:18,158
when you walk back
down the stairs.

401
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,861
You know what you people
have given the world?

402
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:23,563
<i>Girls gone wild.</i>
<i>[Crowd cheers]</i>

403
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:27,834
The Golden Globes, cans that
tell you how cold beer is,

404
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:30,570
Florida, bratz dolls.
[Crowd cheers]

405
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:31,571
Oh, I get it.

406
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:32,839
She's naming awesome things.

407
00:14:32,874 --> 00:14:34,241
No, listen to me.

408
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:38,211
Because of you, there may be
an <i>entourage</i>movie.

409
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:40,013
Hug it off, ma'am!

410
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:42,349
[Crowd chants]
Turtle, turtle, turtle!

411
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:43,800
You know what, I give up.

412
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:45,852
You should know better, but no.

413
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,755
You're just gonna keep
on riding motorcycles,

414
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:50,345
having unprotected sex

415
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:53,060
and voting against
free health care.

416
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:56,329
You will make the same
self-destructive decisions

417
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:59,232
over and over and you will
never really be happy.

418
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:02,069
And your jaw will
hurt all the time.

419
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,453
Oh, look at you.

420
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,105
Perfect little weiner dog,

421
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,324
you just need a little
mustard on you like that.

422
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,744
And a little bun,
just boop, like that.

423
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:15,115
No one will make you
deutschepancakes,

424
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,985
or welcome you home smelling of
hot dog water and onion,

425
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,790
or let you break out of jail
when you play monopoly.

426
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,226
Oh, my God, I'm such an idiot.

427
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,899
[Crowd cheers and applauds]

428
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:33,900
Wanna make out?

429
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:34,935
No, thank you.

430
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:42,692
Hot crowd, hot crowd.

431
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,477
We've only got a minute before I
have to get back out there.

432
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:47,280
Act two is a play within a play.

433
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,533
It's funny, in school all you
learn about Abraham Lincoln

434
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,917
is that he was a gay alcoholic.

435
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:54,988
Grab his feet.

436
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,790
Kelsey Gram...

437
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:58,425
Shh, shh, shh.

438
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,427
There, there, there you go.

439
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,462
Okay, okay.

440
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,858
I've gotta get back
into character.

441
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:15,909
Hit me in the face!

442
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,483
What... I forgot to
press a floor again.

443
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:26,286
Hey, what's up, Jackie d?

444
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,589
In a lot of ways, you and I
had similar upbringings.

445
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:31,191
Terrible schools,
broken homes...

446
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,993
Thinking basketball was the
ticket out.

447
00:16:33,027 --> 00:16:33,994
Being wrong.

448
00:16:34,028 --> 00:16:35,762
At some point,
our paths diverged.

449
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:38,832
I went on to Princeton, business
school, ge and beyond.

450
00:16:38,866 --> 00:16:40,200
And look at me.

451
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,368
I spent all day
creating a movement

452
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,738
just to get back at Liz Lemon.

453
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:45,872
[Laughs]

454
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:47,808
I said creating a movement.
[Laughs]

455
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:50,811
The point is that excellence
can come from anywhere.

456
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,179
It's the same with stupidity.

457
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:55,415
In this country, anyone could be
the next Jack Donaghy

458
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:57,450
or the next Denise Richards.

459
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:01,421
This room...

460
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,356
Is moving.

461
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:04,391
Oh, God.

462
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,501
Banks.

463
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,602
What are you still doing here?

464
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,270
Well, my husband was supposed

465
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:19,739
to pick me up at 6:00 but
he can be such an idiot.

466
00:17:19,774 --> 00:17:21,408
I'm sure he can.

467
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:24,377
Where did you go
to school, Devin?

468
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:27,430
I had the best education
in the world.

469
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:30,917
Private kindergarten where I got
straight check marks.

470
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:32,886
Experimental boarding school
in carmel

471
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,855
where the students
teach the teachers,

472
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:36,990
and the teachers teach animals.

473
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:39,092
Year abroad on an
all-male catamaran.

474
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,795
Then on to Northwestern where
I majored in confidence.

475
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:44,130
I had every educational
advantage, Jack.

476
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,933
Just like my children will.

477
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:49,436
But I beat you.

478
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,437
What?

479
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:51,438
I beat you.

480
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:52,973
I came from nothing.

481
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,075
But I caught up
and I crushed you.

482
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,877
Just like Liddy's
gonna crush your sons.

483
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,613
She's already sorting objects by
shape and color.

484
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,114
At 11 months,
I don't think so.

485
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,983
She can count to ten if
you say seven for her.

486
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:04,117
She gets five and nine?

487
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:05,418
- She can save five words.
- So.

488
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,786
In mandarin.

489
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,255
They've put her with
the toddlers at her

490
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,056
singing and clapping
class at fun factory.

491
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,458
She's in Orange group?

492
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,326
She's already out of the
piaget sensorimotor stage.

493
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:14,661
That's impossible.

494
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:17,831
She scored a 62 on the object
permanence matrix.

495
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,799
But that's an adult score.

496
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,301
And did I mention...

497
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:22,903
She's using the potty.

498
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,237
Surely just for wee-wee.

499
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:25,272
No.

500
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:27,307
See you in 30 years, Banks.

501
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:30,577
It's already, like,
turning itself.

502
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,828
But I feel like I still
have to turn it.

503
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,113
[Laughs]

504
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:37,033
Oh, oh, my God, mustard just
came out my nose.

505
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:41,454
Oh, it's burning
the backs of my eyes.

506
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:42,622
All right, I gotta go
back to work, bye.

507
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:44,324
Okay, all right.

508
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:46,492
Ah, it's burning my face now.

509
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,527
[Both laugh]

510
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:55,135
All right, I'm putting you on
probationary approval.

511
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:56,636
Okay, I don't really care.

512
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,938
I'll tell you what
changed my mind, Criss:

513
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:59,773
a conversation I had
with Tracy Jordan.

514
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:02,776
You see, greatness can
come from anywhere.

515
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,212
So if a poor boy from
Boston can become me,

516
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,280
maybe you could become

517
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,783
a suitable sex partner
for Liz Lemon.

518
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:12,685
You've got three months.

519
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:14,321
But your opinion
doesn't matter.

520
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:16,356
You have no say in this.

521
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:19,692
[Laughs]

522
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:27,300
Liz, there's something
wrong with Pete.

523
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:30,503
[Gasps]
Oh, my God!

524
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:31,705
I don't know what happened.

525
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:32,872
Pete, I have been
out there putting

526
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,090
out fires all day
while you've been

527
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,675
hiding in here doing this?

528
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,844
You're disgusting.

529
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:41,281
No, no, I was... I didn't... I...

530
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:42,715
Kelsey Grammer!

531
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,651
Kelsey Grammer did this to me.

532
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,852
Really, Pete?

533
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,821
Kelsey Grammer made you do this

534
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:53,026
while he was performing his one
man show about Abraham Lincoln?

535
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,728
Ugh.

536
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:57,263
Here's to another successful
operation by...

537
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,832
The best friends gang.

538
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,966
[All chuckle]

539
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:00,967
Hang on.

540
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,035
I didn't notice before with all

541
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,837
the excitement, but...

542
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,872
I look incredibly beautiful.

543
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:08,174
The lighting is back to normal.

544
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,343
Both switches need
to be on, woman.

545
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:12,078
The bulb wasn't even broken?

546
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:14,014
None of this was necessary.

547
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:15,048
[All laugh]

548
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:25,874
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

549
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,531
I know...

550
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,718
I've been successfully
assassinated.

551
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:40,149
But I have one last thing
to tell my country.

552
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:44,093
Blackbeard's gold
is buried in...

553
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:46,741
[death rattle]

554
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:48,364
[all gasp]

555
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,293
I am a ghost now,

556
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:57,089
Leaving behind my
earthly possessions.

557
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:01,833
And although I left my
country divided by war,

558
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,728
A civil war...

559
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,560
So that's where
that name came from.

560
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:11,088
I know that future generations
will forge a stronger country

561
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:14,418
And that some day,
America will be a place

562
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:18,682
Where everybody
knows your name.

563
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:21,104
[crowd cheers and applauds]
