157
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,518
He doesn't know anything.

158
00:06:22,552 --> 00:06:25,221
No, it's not about sex.
It's about money.

159
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:26,272
[Chuckles]
Oh, Liz!

160
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:28,807
Sex, money, power, fire,

161
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:31,026
choking, being dragged
behind a speed boat...

162
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,394
It's all the same thing.

163
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:34,863
Look, you and I
are both in situations

164
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:36,065
where we're the breadwinner.

165
00:06:36,116 --> 00:06:38,367
How do you and Paul
deal with that?

166
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,518
We love it.

167
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,787
Gender role-reversal
is such a turn-on.

168
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:43,522
Paul keeps the house nice,

169
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,990
and I try
to get him pregnant.

170
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:47,576
And the best part is,
if I want to treat myself

171
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,495
to a new pair
of Christy LaButtons,

172
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,214
I don't have to
ask any man for $17.

173
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:54,166
- I'm sorry, Christy who?
- LaButtons.

174
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,751
They're knockoff
Christian Louboutins.

175
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,886
I got tired of ruining
$1,200 shoes

176
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:59,471
trying to impregnate
my boyfriend.

177
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,257
You know something,
against all odds,

178
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:02,341
you have a point.

179
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,009
Feminism promised us
two things...

180
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:07,096
Fatter dolls, and an end
to traditional gender roles.

181
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:08,564
Why am I fighting this?

182
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:10,399
So what if I make
more money than Criss?

183
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:12,568
Exactly.
It doesn't bother me.

184
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:13,902
Doesn't bother Oprah.

185
00:07:13,937 --> 00:07:15,237
It sure doesn't seem
to bother Criss.

186
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:16,438
He's at yoga right now.

187
00:07:16,489 --> 00:07:17,940
You wear the pants, Liz.

188
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,391
You don't necessarily
pull them off

189
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,860
because of your hips,
but you wear them.

190
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:24,113
So embrace it!

191
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:32,288
Lemon, Avery's missed
the past 12 months

192
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:33,589
of popular culture.

193
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,924
Could you put together
a presentation for tomorrow?

194
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,042
An hour, tops.

195
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:38,744
An <i>hour</i> for the <i>year?</i>

196
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:40,912
Am I supposed to just
scratch the surface

197
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,015
of channing Tatum's
meteoric rise?

198
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:47,770
Lemon, Avery did
something strange this morning.

199
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,722
[Gasps] They brainwashed her,
didn't they?

200
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,440
Avery said something
this morning...

201
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,442
Something shocking.

202
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,861
That no matter what happened
while she was gone,

203
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:57,363
"all is forgiven."

204
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:58,697
And that's bad?

205
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:01,233
It seems awfully nice
of her, considering.

206
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:02,701
Exactly. Awfully nice.

207
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:03,902
Does that sound like Avery
to you?

208
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:05,704
- Well, no.
- That woman does not forgive.

209
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,456
She's still furious
with Al Gore

210
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,075
for stealing George Bush's
idea to have an Internet.

211
00:08:10,109 --> 00:08:11,827
And now she's forgiving me?
Why?

212
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,379
Because she wants to change
the conversation

213
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,331
because she's done something
she doesn't want to talk about.

214
00:08:15,382 --> 00:08:16,799
And what do people
not want to talk about?

215
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,884
Soccer, jazz, infidelity.

216
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:19,708
Okay, first of all,

217
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,453
I don't know what you
count as cheating,

218
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:24,173
but she was forced
to marry someone else.

219
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:25,808
Kim Jong-Un, Lemon.

220
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:28,260
Have you seen news footage
of that man?

221
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:31,597
I have so many missile!

222
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:34,233
I even have
nuclear missile.

223
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:37,202
Just for you,
sugarprong.

224
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:39,705
There was another
American there, Lemon.

225
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,990
A man. It raises
some red flags.

226
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:43,575
Oh, my God.
Who are you to talk?

227
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:45,494
You French-Canadian kissed
her mother,

228
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:46,829
which is my name
for French kissing

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,464
when it bums
everybody else out.

230
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:52,668
Yes. Brilliant.
I'll use my indiscretion

231
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:54,053
to guilt her into
revealing hers.

232
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:55,754
The game is afoot!

233
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,923
No. She's been back
for, like six hours.

234
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,308
Maybe take a little time,

235
00:08:59,342 --> 00:09:01,143
let things get back
to normal.

236
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:03,729
Playing psycho-sexual
mind games <i>is</i> our normal, Lemon.

237
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:07,399
This is perfect.
Everything's perfect.

238
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:15,535
Dadgum possum up and what
been bit my mother's neck brace.

239
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:18,785
Dadgum possum up and what
been bit my mother's neck brace.

240
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,254
- Again!
- Dadgum possum up and what been

241
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:22,956
my mom's neck brace.

242
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,624
Again, you waste
of my time!

243
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:28,011
Dadgum possum up'n what bit
my mama's neck brace!

244
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:30,463
There it is.
Again!

245
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:43,443
Excellent.
Again!

246
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:48,782
Dixie's callin', y'all.
I reckon you should answer.

247
00:09:48,816 --> 00:09:51,534
No, this isn't right.

248
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:53,370
This isn't Southern elegance.

249
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:55,455
This is a dirtbag girl
I once knew.

250
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:57,356
A girl named <i>Jay-nuh!</i>

251
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,659
She used to get into
fistfights at water parks,

252
00:09:59,693 --> 00:10:03,079
and lost her virginity to a bait
salesman on a <i>water bed.</i>

253
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,666
She's not who I am any more.
I'm classy.

254
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,419
People who say that
about themselves usually are.

255
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,554
This whole Southern thing
is wrong.

256
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:13,056
I need to find
a new wedding sponsor

257
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,707
that's as classy
as I am.

258
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:18,061
I'm not this person,
<i>'cause I done got rid of her!</i>

259
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:22,949
Kim Jong-Il could not
be reached for comment

260
00:10:22,983 --> 00:10:24,701
because he was having
a totally normal day

261
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:26,169
being alive and not dead.

262
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:28,354
And now with sports,
Scott Scottsman.

263
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,273
Thanks, Avery.
In NBA action,

264
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:32,659
Kim Jong-Un won
the championship today.

265
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,577
Our brilliant comrade
scored 200 points

266
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:36,863
and then went hot-tubbing
with a couple guys

267
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:38,782
he's definitely
just friends with.

268
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,767
[Pause button hit]

269
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:44,921
- Hey.
- Hi.

270
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:47,040
Look, I've been thinking
about what you said earlier

271
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:49,959
about forgiveness...
It was beautiful.

272
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,378
But I would feel very guilty
if I kept anything from you,

273
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,413
as I know you would if you
kept something from me.

274
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,883
So while you were away,

275
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:01,387
I did have feelings
for another woman.

276
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,890
Thank you.

277
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:05,308
I forgive you.

278
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:08,111
You lose, Jack...

279
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,130
Is what Kim Jong-Il said
to Jack Nicklaus

280
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:11,314
after def eating him
in golf today

281
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:14,200
because they're both
totally alive.

282
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,375
Wow, you went out
and bought a Fedora.

283
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,661
Oh, this? I finally watched
the premiere

284
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:27,464
of <i>Prime suspect</i> on Hulu.
It's really very good.

285
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,549
Anyway, I thought
I would treat myself.

286
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:33,586
But don't worry, I'm gonna
take care of you too.

287
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,255
Wow. Okay, but look,

288
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:37,223
I still want to chip in
on this renovation.

289
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:39,092
And clean out
your life savings?

290
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,810
Why don't you take
that $200

291
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:42,645
and buy yourself
something cute?

292
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,266
Here's a hint.
[Whispers] I like zippers.

293
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,318
I'm a man.
I'm a man, I'm a <i>man!</i>

294
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:50,270
I'm an adult man!

295
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:51,855
You think I like you having
to pay for everything?

296
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:52,989
It's humiliating.

297
00:11:53,023 --> 00:11:54,774
But gender roles,
fat dolls...

298
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,110
You think I like having
to earn <i>crisspoints</i>

299
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,996
so that I can take you on dates
that you actually pay for?

300
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,698
I thought you liked
the crisspoints system.

301
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,833
Only because liking
the crisspoints system

302
00:12:03,868 --> 00:12:06,870
is one of the ways
I earn crisspoints!

303
00:12:06,921 --> 00:12:10,507
Okay, I'm sorry that I
offended your male pride,

304
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:13,343
but you're the one who chose
to sell hot dogs out of a car.

305
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:16,346
It is a van
with a car engine, Liz, okay?

306
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,498
Now, look, if your show
gets canceled, okay,

307
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:21,667
or NBC just becomes
a web site

308
00:12:21,685 --> 00:12:23,336
that sells
used office supplies,

309
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:25,188
I'd like to know that
I can take care of you.

310
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:27,673
And now we're talking
about having a <i>plant?</i>

311
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:28,892

Yes, I think
you've mentioned that.

466
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:32,305
Booo... booo...

467
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:36,309
Scott.

468
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:39,229
Happy birthdaversary,
honey.

469
00:18:39,263 --> 00:18:41,264
Oh, Jack, this homecoming's
been amazing.

470
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:43,934
Nice to see you relaxing
and enjoying yourself,

471
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:46,737
and totally unprepared
for a forgiveness attack.

472
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:48,688
- What?
- Avery...

473
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,906
What?

474
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:53,193
The woman I kissed
is your mother.

475
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:55,311
[Gasps]

476
00:18:55,329 --> 00:19:00,333
That is... shocking.

477
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:03,620
But I told you
all is forgiven,

478
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:08,175
so... all is forgiven.

479
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:12,295
What do I have to say
to guilt the truth out of you?

480
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:13,496
How about this?
A few months ago,

481
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:14,664
Liddy broke into
the gun safe

482
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:16,967
and shot up
your gift-wrapping room.

483
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,518
I did wear your nightgowns.

484
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,937
Not to feel you near,
they're just comfortable.

485
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:25,609
I had an erotic dream about
an adult Dora the explorer.

486
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:27,194
I took her on a balcony
in Madrid,

487
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:29,329
above the Plaza Mayor.

488
00:19:29,363 --> 00:19:32,065
She had flowers
in her hair.

489
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:33,366
Now I've admitted everything.

490
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,819
Game over, Avery.
Tell me what you did.

491
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:38,855
I'll tell you exactly
what I did, Jack.

492
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,408
- I won.
- You what?

493
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:43,026
I got you to tell me
everything you did.

494
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:45,879
And guess what...
I didn't do anything.

495
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:48,165
- But Scott Scottsman...
- Until the flight home,

496
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:50,884
the only words I'd ever said
to Scott Scottsman were,

497
00:19:50,918 --> 00:19:53,303
"and now with sports,
Scott Scottsman."

498
00:19:53,337 --> 00:19:54,704
I thought I was playing you,

499
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:56,890
and you were playing me
the whole time.

500
00:19:56,924 --> 00:19:58,675
And in 24 hours,
I got you to tell me things

501
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:00,811
it would have taken you years
to admit.

502
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:03,180
<i>Now</i> we can start over.

503
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:06,049
The final piece of the puzzle
is just me forgiving you

504
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:10,654
for, um...
Kissing my mother!

505
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:12,823
We did it.
Everything's normal.

506
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:15,158
- USA!
- It's classic us.

507
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:17,277
Damn it, Jessup,
I'd marry you all over again!

508
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:21,281
That's what we're gonna do.
We've gonna renew our vows.

509
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:23,233
- We need a new blender anyway.
- Oh, baby.

510
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:25,669
Oh!

511
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:26,411
Sorry I'm late.

512
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,205
Criss got into a fight with an Elmo.

513
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:30,340
And he hates it that
I make more money than he does.

514
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:33,093
And I don't know, maybe we're not
supposed to have a plant together.

515
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:35,679
- Love is complicated, right?
- Wrong.

516
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:38,131
- We kicked love's ass!
- Yes!

517
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:39,266
We're renewing our vows.

518
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,302
No, no, renewing vows
is a kiss of death.

519
00:20:42,353 --> 00:20:43,603
You should have let me
finish my rap.

520
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:45,472
There was a whole verse
about it!

521
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:47,090
♪ J-Lo and Marc Anthony ♪

522
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:48,642
♪ Donn and Vicki from <i>O. C.</i> ♪

523
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,227
♪ 12-month wrap-up,
rap-rap-rap-up ♪

524
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:51,311
Lemon.

525
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,429
It's the kiss of death, yo!

526
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:56,299
I reject Chris Brown's comeback!
Lemon out!
