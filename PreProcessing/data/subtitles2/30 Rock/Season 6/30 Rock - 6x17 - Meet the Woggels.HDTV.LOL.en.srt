00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:05,497
The TGS sweatshirts were

3
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:08,153
supposed to say
"TGS Season Six, Yuck,"

4
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:10,672
which is a catch-phrase
from a pretty great sketch.

5
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:11,663
Yuck!
[Audience cheers]

6
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:13,978
But they got misprinted
and now they say,

"TGS Season Six, Duck!"

8
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:17,732
And that's a season
five catchphrase.

Lemon,
that is not a real problem.

11
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,655
A real problem is losing
your giant scissors

12
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,325
right before a ribbon-cutting

Oh, thank God.

15
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:35,666

to be perfect.

And factories
provide three things

Jobs, pride, and material
for Bruce Springsteen songs.

Great, so we solved
your problem,

I was out all last night with my
new rock star boyfriend.

26
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,059
Oh, I listened
to rock and roll music once,

27
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,678
but I stopped before I started
worshipping the devil.

28
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:04,898
The song went, "Mr. Sandma--",
then I shut it off.

You've been with
tons of musicians.

with the guy from
blues traveler.

37

He still had
his harmonica thing on.

38
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:23,970
Sure, I've dated
musicians before.

39

But I've never sexually
manipulated one

graduated that year

A month later, he and I
went hunting in Mexico.

He shot thousands
of doves that day

call your son is worrisome.

179
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:39,508
He's useless in a hospital.

180

he cried and cried.

317
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:40,045
She won't go to a hotel,

318
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,113
and she hates
the Princeton club,

319
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:42,614
because Dean Cain
is always there

320
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:45,167
hoping to get recognized.

321
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,286
I tried to leave her
at the Bodies" exhibit--

322
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:48,888
God, that is all
just a smoke screen.

323
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:51,790
She's acting out because she
wants to have the conversation,

324
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,392
and you won't meet her halfway.

325
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,177
I decided something last night

326
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,296
after I got your
tenth text message,

327
00:11:57,314 --> 00:11:59,432
one of which was
an inscrutable emoticon.

328
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:00,433
Hold it sideways,

329
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:01,800
it's me going like this:

330
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,436
"Talk to your mother!"

331
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,738
The "8" is my glasses.

332
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,073
Yes, someday,
my mother is going to die,

333
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:10,142
and we're going
to deal with it our way.

334
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,193
Well, your way is wrong,

335
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:14,864
and I bet Colleen
agrees with me.

336
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,066
I'm glad you said that, Lemon.

337
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,885
Good luck.

338
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:22,321
Ah, Elizabeth.

339
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:25,424
Can we do something about
the temperature in here?

340
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:27,092
I'd like it humid and cold.

341
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:28,177
Duck!

342
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:33,420
Yoko announcement.

343
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,255
Russ wrote a song.

344
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,456
A great song.

345
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:38,291
And if you don't sing
it at the Gwammys,

346
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,644
which is the Grammys for
toddlers, Russ is going solo.

347
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,928
Russ, I write the songs here,
so you have to choose.

348
00:12:44,956 --> 00:12:46,280
Her, or us?

349
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,401
Come on, mate, Woggel power.

350
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,520
In Australia,
"woggel" means "white."

351
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,637
Hm.

352
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:53,022
Let's get out of here.

353
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:55,406
I want to lick that
turtleneck off of you.

354
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:58,278
Yeah. Come on, Jenna.

355
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,279
Fine, leave.

356
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,280
We'll just replace you.

357
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,848
Anyone can be replaced.

358
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,450
Especially girlfriends.

359
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,402
No, you don't know
what you're talking about.

360
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:06,453
Paul isn't gonna--

361
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,322
I mean, Russ.

362
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:11,641
Paul is American for Russ.

363
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:14,360
Oh.

364
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:21,318
Ugh, Dean Cain.
[Sighs]

365
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,253
You know what?

366
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,305
I'm glad Jack put you in here.

367
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,226
Because I think we need to talk,
about talking.

368
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,310
What's the matter with you?

369
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,012
Are you on drugs or something?

370
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:34,181
Don't you think,
at a certain point in life,

371
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:38,018
parents and children should sit
down and express their feelings

372
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,364
before it's too late?

373
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:41,149
God on a wheel!

374
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,017
Jackie and I know how we feel.

375
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:47,205
We don't have to say it out loud
like a couple of gays

376
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,859
getting married
in jean shorts in Provincetown

377
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:54,629
while I'm just trying to enjoy
an ice cream on the pier!

378
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,381
Okay, fine.
If I can't convince you,

379
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:59,751
maybe you'll listen to the words
of Mike and the mechanics,

380
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:04,232
whose song <i>The Living Years</i>
I definitely remember.

381
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:08,042
"Say it out, speak it clear.

382
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,312
"You should listen, dude.
Also, hear.

383
00:14:11,347 --> 00:14:14,249
It's too late, when--"
[Crash]

384
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:15,900
- [Beep, beep, beep]
- You have two minutes

385
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:20,104
to find that battery
before I die.

386
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:23,224
[Beeping continues]

387
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:27,045
You guys do not like talking!

388
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,280
Great news, everyone!

389
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:31,432
George Foreman
is not going to Stanford.

390
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:34,402
He's decided to permanently
join the entourage.

391
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,371
I'll start the paperwork.

392
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:38,373
Wait, he's not
going to college?

393
00:14:38,407 --> 00:14:40,959
Look, yesterday was the first
time I've ever spent the day

394
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,743
with my dad like that, and...

395
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:44,762
I just want to keep doing it.

396
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:45,763
You need to take him
to security.

397
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:46,931
It takes a week to get an I.D.

398
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:48,600
Tony will rush it for me.

399
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:50,935
We do zumba together.

400
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:56,474
[Sighs] My son is 17.

401
00:14:56,525 --> 00:14:58,393
Have I really never spent
a day with him

402
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,612
doing father and son stuff?

403
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:03,097
Like teaching him
how to ride a bike...

404
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,149
Down the Luxor pyramid.

405
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:06,951
Or drive a car...

406
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:10,104
Vel franchise into the ground.

407
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,541
I never even taught
him how to shave...

408
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:14,742
An orangutan.

409
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:17,462
Well, sir...

410
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,631
That doesn't mean
you're a bad father.

411
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:20,882
Yes, it does.

412
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,801
I haven't been there
for him since day one.

413
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,087
[Telephone rings]

414

Hey, Angie.

415
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,089
What's up?

416
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:29,790
- [Moans]
- You had the baby?

417
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:32,060
Okay.
Name him George Foreman.

418
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,012
And also,
we're out of soda at home.

419

[Moans]

420
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:36,797
Lamont, hurry up
and deliver that baby

421
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:39,017
before they realize
we're not doctors.

422
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,935
But I'm finally
connecting with my son,

423
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:42,604
and he wants to be here.

424
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,472
I don't know what to do.

425
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,908
I wish I had a father
to talk to.

426
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:50,161
But Liz Lemon is the only person
I know who even has a father.

427
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:53,147
Well, Mr. Jordan,
speaking from experience,

428
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:57,452
<i>All My Children...</i>
was cancelled.

As you can see, I'm out
of my wheelhouse here.

00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:02,657
But, if you want
to talk about wheelhouses--

Jack, can we make sure
the pilot is a man.

00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,516
I don't know,
ever since Amelia Earhart,

I'm a little skittish
about lady pilots.

- Mm, good.
- Good-bye, mother.

I know it won't be welcome,

459
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:13,144
but I will point out that this
is your final "talk-portunity."

what to do about George Foreman.

464
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,337

thing been a mistake?

- What if I'm already too late?

- I'll just go to the beach.
- Replaced me?

Both of you need
to stop right there.

If you are having
a problem with a loved one,

Go to Paul,
go to George Foreman.

And as difficult
as it might be,

474
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:42,607
talk to them.

475
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,475
