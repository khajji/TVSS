317
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:46,715
USC.

318
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,934
I don't know, Jack,
you should stay out of this.

319
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:50,102
No, I could
help this girl.

320
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:52,521
Or destroy this monster.

321
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:55,024
If I could just tell whether
she's vicious or vulnerable.

322
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,942
That's the problem.
She's a teenage girl.

323
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,727
She's vicious
and vulnerable.

324
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:00,279
She might be
completely lying,

325
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:02,731
like when I was 15
and told everyone at my school

326
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:04,116
that I'd already
gotten my period,

327
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,402
or she could be
in real trouble,

328
00:12:06,453 --> 00:12:08,871
like when I was 17,
and finally got my period

329
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:12,858
at a very loosely supervised
petting zoo.

330
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:14,243
Once again, Lemon,
I leave your office

331
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,911
more confused
than when I entered,

332
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:19,215
but having glimpsed yet another
tile in the rich mosaic

333
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:24,169
that is your
menstrual history.

334
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,639
So bravo wants to do
a reality show about us,

335
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:28,206
and I thought
the opening credits

336
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,142
could be all of us
in a giant dog bed,

337
00:12:30,176 --> 00:12:31,310
and you guys are suckling

338
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:34,096
on prosthetic dog teats
that I'm wearing.

339
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,232
Actually,
we had a different idea.

340
00:12:36,266 --> 00:12:37,650
Now that Judy's gone,

341
00:12:37,684 --> 00:12:39,768
it's kind of obvious
someone is the odd person out.

342
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,103
It's Jerome, right?

343
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:42,404
I didn't want
to say anything

344
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,606
'cause I was trying
to be a good mother,

345
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:45,324
but you're cheesy,
and everyone hates you.

346
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:46,909
No, Jenna, you.

347
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,028
You're so much older
than the rest of us,

348
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,412
so we're thinking
the show is more like

349
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:51,747
<i>The girls next door,</i>

350
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:54,700
and you're that old boat captain
that shows up sometimes.

351
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,368
That's Hugh Hefner,
Jessica.

352
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,520
Yeah, we have no idea
who that is,

353
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:00,256
so you're kind of
just proving our point.

354
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,126
I see.

355
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:08,130
Very well.

356
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:17,222
Looking for this?

357
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,558
Well played.

358
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,112
Oh...

359
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:26,148
[Sighs]

360
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:39,328
[Crying]

361
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:41,380
Dude, what's up?

362
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:44,750
I'm just having
a bad day, sir.

363
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:49,388
All right, bro-bro,
let's just be cool,

364
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:52,925
and sit down and pee in silence,
like dudes do.

365
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,627
It's just...
I started a new job,

366
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,796
and it's stressful enough

367
00:13:57,814 --> 00:14:01,150
just having my own wastebasket
that I have to fill every day

368
00:14:01,184 --> 00:14:03,301
without Liz Lemon
yelling at me,

369
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,238
and I just wish
I had never been born!

370
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,573
[Heaves]

371
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,142
'Cause if I can't even
get my friend Liz...

372
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,277
At least I thought
she was my friend...

373
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:13,912
To respect me,
how will I ever run a network

374
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:17,950
and boss around
those Jewish executives

375
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,652
that were trained
from birth to argue?

376
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,705
So, I should just
give Liz what she wants,

377
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:23,956
and quit.

378
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,657
[Sobbing]
Bro...

379
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:29,327
You should just smack
that Liz in the mouth.

380
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,113
Sorry I babbled
so much.

381
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:32,598
Thanks for listening.

382
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm Kenneth, by the way.

383
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:36,835
Me too. I'm Kenneth.

384
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,171
Kenneth... uh...

385
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,523
Toilethole.

386
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:46,489
I'm so sorry Dr. Melvoin.

387
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,345
You know, I already apologized
to Vickie, and to fat Vickie.

388
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,463
Fat Vickie's parents
were very upset

389
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:52,982
that she was dragged
into this mess.

390
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,318
I know.
I know what I did was stupid,

391
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,320
and I've really learned
my lesson.

392
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,056
Look, if I could
go back in time,

393
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:01,991
I'd just...
I'd skip clarinet,

394
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,893
and I'd go to the spring
football with my friends,

395
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:06,112
and none of this
ever would've happened.

396
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:08,498
Or you simply could have
not posted those pictures.

397
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,066
On hot Vickie's
youface page, miss Hooper.

398
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:11,534
Uh, hold on, Melvoin.

399
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,369
You told me
it was the piano,

400
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:15,872
and that everyone went
to the King of Prussia mall.

401
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:19,676
Well...

402
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,011
I don't remember.

403
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,464
And I'm just
so emotional right now.

404
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,415
[Sniffs]

405
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:30,053
Ha!

406
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:33,973
I'm sorry, how are you
related to miss Hooper?

407
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:36,092
I'm her Nemesis.

408
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,360
You bastard.

409
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,529
Don't do this, Donaghy.

410
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,780
I think that this school

411
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,565
has done everything it can
for Kaylie,

412
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:46,286
but the only fitting
punishment...

413
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,704
Is expulsion.

414
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,156
It's days like this
that remind me

415
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:52,492
why I got into teaching
in the first place.

416
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:59,132
Kenneth,
we need to talk.

417
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,834
I don't know,
'cause someone

418
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,302
who actually cares
about my feelings

419
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,887
told me to smack you
in the mouth.

420
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,339
No, don't listen
to Kenneth Toilethole.

421
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,675
- You know him?
- Yeah. He's great.

422
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:11,511
We should all go
get dinner sometime.

423
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,680
Kenneth,
you can do this job,

424
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:16,099
and I do respect you.

425
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,734
Then wash my feet
with your hair.

426
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,186
No! But I did completely
rewrite the show.

427
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:23,573
We're not even using
the word "dingbat," Mr. Parcell.

428
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,309
A Parcell man
has never been called "mister"

429
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,411
outside of
an execution chamber.

430
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,246
Oh, boy.

431
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,250
[Crying]

432
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,536
The blonde ones,
they turned on me.

433
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,205
They threw me away like
I was some kind of Judy.

434
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:41,591
Oh, God.
Is this how Judy felt?

435
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,459
Judy was nice and sweet

436
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:45,995
and wanted to get
a coffee enema or something,

437
00:16:46,013 --> 00:16:48,097
and I treated her
like garbage.

438
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,849
Well, then why don't you
apologize to her?

439
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,050
She's right behind you.

440
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,769
Oh.

441
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:57,056
Judy,
you're so beautiful now!

442
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:59,559
Oh.

443
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,028
I just came to say good-bye
before I head home.

444
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,730
I wish we had spent
more time together,

445
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:05,782
but I guess I'll see you
on TV.

446
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,183
No.
Of all my children,

447
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:08,184
you're the only one
that proves

448
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:09,652
there's any good in me.

449
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:10,737
Forget TV.

450
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,705
Let's go get
that coffee now.

451
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,074
No. You know
you can't do that.

452
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,827
<i>One minute to air.
One minute.</i>

453
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,495
I have to stop Jenna
from leaving. You just...

454
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:20,747
No problem.
I'll cover.

455
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:21,998
Day two of my fast,
and you were right.

456
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:24,500
My mind is clear,
and I'm sharp as a tack.

457
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:25,668
Great, Tray, thanks.

458
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:26,970
My brain is working
overtime.

459
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,222
I finally understand the ending
of <i>The sixth sense.</i>

460
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,591
Those names are the people
who worked on the movie.

461
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:32,892
Oh, yeah, and I just got

462
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,510
what you were trying
to tell me yesterday.

463
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,512
You want me to do
my filthy stand-up act

464
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:39,182
instead of reading
the cue cards.

465
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:40,216
No.

466
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:43,653
Jack! Help!

467
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,939
I was right about Kaylie,
and I crushed her.

468
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,106
That's great.
I need...

469
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:48,391
The whole time,
she was playing me,

470
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:50,076
but in the end, she made
the biggest mistake.

471
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,494
She could not have been worse
in that meeting

472
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,747
than if she had
wanted me to...

473
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,332
Son of a dingbat!

474
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,403
Tracy's gonna do
his stand-up act on the show!

475
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:03,172
What are we gonna do?

476
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,075
I'm gonna live bleep him.

477
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:10,179
Normally, I'd have to get
permission from Irene first,

478
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,382
but there isn't time.

479
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,812
You know why I love
Dominican women?

480
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:28,498
'Cause they love to [Bleep]
those big [Bleep] [Bleep]

481
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:30,650
'Cause they eat all our
[Bleep] aloud.

482
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:33,236
I'd like to introduce [Bleep]
housed in a [Bleep]

483
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,154
[Bleep], booooy!

484
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:38,074
You just ate a [Bleep]
with extra [Bleep]?

485
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,575
Well, you called
the right [Bleep].

486
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,127
That's our show
for tonight!

487
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,330
See you next week!
[Cheers and applause]

488
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:47,166
- That was amazing!
- It sure was.

489
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:49,335
Kenneth,
I'm Gaylord Felcher.

490
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:50,720
The head of Standards?

491
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,638
I have never seen
bleeping like that,

492
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,956
so guess what?

493
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,725
I'm [Bleep] promoting you,
you little [Bleep]-face.

494
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,094
All right, Felcher, you don't
have to talk like that.

495
00:18:58,112 --> 00:18:59,479
Well, who's gonna stop me?

496
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,166
Who among you has the power
to censor the censor?

497
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,741
What a surprise.

498
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,443
Whatever are you doing here,
Kaylie Hooper?

499
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:17,413
Enjoying my total lack
of adult supervision.

500
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,083
I just had fruit roll-ups
for dinner...

501
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,086
At a strip club.

502
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,453
[Sighs]

503
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,256
Do you wanted to get expelled
from school, didn't you?

504
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,509
Look who figured it out.

505
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,344
It only took you,
oh, I don't know,

506
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:32,962
a million hours.

507
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,982
You didn't lie to me
about getting sent to school

508
00:19:36,016 --> 00:19:37,183
in the "Middle of nowhere."

509
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:38,801
What I realized too late is,

510
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,187
you were talking
about Beekman Academy,

511
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:42,355
right here in Manhattan,

512
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:44,107
in the neighborhood
North of ware street,

513
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,909
otherwise known as,
uh, "noware."

514
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:49,812
Now I'll be able to be close
to my boyfriend Henry.

515
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,148
Like hot Vickie could
ever steal him from me.

516
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:55,585
He's going to NYU.
To study acting.

517
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:56,619
[Snickers]

518
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,920
If Pop-Pop had gone
to that meeting,

519
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:58,921
he would have just
written a check

520
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:00,489
and made it all go away.

521
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:03,376
You needed somebody
to throw you under the bus.

522
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:04,994
You needed a patsy.

523
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:09,682
I, uh, couldn't
help but notice

524
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:12,685
that lacrosse ball
in your backpack.

525
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:14,854
Too bad I'm on the board of
the Central Park conservancy,

526
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:18,107
so beekman won't have a field
to play on next year.

527
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:21,077
Well, good, 'cause I planted
that lacrosse ball there

528
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,980
to get back at a girl I hate
who plays lacrosse.

529
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,982
Her name is Jack... ie.

530
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,985
Jackie... officecouch.

531
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,686
Damn you, Donaghy!

532
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,909
Cato? Seriously,
not tonight.

533
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,910
I mean it this time.

534
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:39,445
- Aah!
- [Groans]

535
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,030
Son of a dingbat!

536
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:46,304
Sorry.
That phone call took forever.

537
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:47,488
Where's Kenneth Toilethole?

538
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:48,990
You just missed him.

539
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,024
Again.
[Groans]

540
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,443
He had to go
to the bathroom.

541
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:54,078
You know what?
I'll go get him.

542
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:55,496
No, don't!

543
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,116
Every time one of you leaves,
the other one comes back.

544
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:02,169
You know,
I'm starting to suspect

545
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,955
that I have bad luck.

546
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,315
Dude, bro, where's Liz?

547
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,164
You didn't see her?
She just left.

548
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:13,265
Oh, I gotta go feed the meter.

549
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:14,773
Ohh!

550
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:19,002
