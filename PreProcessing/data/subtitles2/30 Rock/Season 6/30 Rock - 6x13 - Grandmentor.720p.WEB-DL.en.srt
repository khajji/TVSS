00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:16,761
And I brought back a bunch
of oriental sex powders."

160
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:19,521
- I know how you can get
Avery back on television.

161
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,633
Her story has everything!

162
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,507
Blondeness, kidnapping,

163
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,366
a villain with an accent.

164
00:06:25,366 --> 00:06:28,516
It's the perfect TV movie.
I should know.

165
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:31,742
<i>I played Italian party whore
in the Amanda Knox story.</i>

166
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:34,385
- A TV movie--Jenna, I don't
want to trivialize this ordeal.

167
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:35,838
- But those movies get results.

168
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:37,592
Every kidnapped woman
I've ever played

169
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:38,516
has been released.

170
00:06:38,516 --> 00:06:41,152
- Well, it would allow me
to control the story.

171
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:42,369
- Well, you better hurry, Jack.

172
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,805
Oxygen is already working
on a movie

173
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,972
about the baby miners.

174
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:46,304
- Then we'll have
to slow them down.

175
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:47,549
Gabriel...

176
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:51,385
Send a bunch of pies
to the Oxygen network.

177
00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:57,652
- Excuse me,
Ms. what's-her-name.

178
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:58,706
What's that?

179
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:00,214
- Not that it's any
of your business,

180
00:07:00,214 --> 00:07:03,696
but Tracy's jaw is tired
from pretending to be pac-man.

181
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:07,278
So I'm making it easier
for him to eat.

182
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,779
- No! No!

183
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:10,915
He can't eat that junk.

184
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,457
He just got his cholesterol
down to triple digits.

185
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:16,741
- Get off my ass, Parcell.
I'm doing my job.

186
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,074
You think you can push me around
just because you have a penis?

187
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,350
- I definitely have a penis.

188
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,452
- You think I'm some
delicate little girl

189
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:25,100
who'll do whatever you say?

190
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,416
Well, I'm not delicate.

191
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:28,795
I've been in tons
of car wrecks.

192
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:30,774
- Hazel, I just peed this.

193
00:07:30,774 --> 00:07:32,224
Could you take care
of it for me?

194
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:33,414
- Sir!

195
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:36,311
I am resuming responsibility
for your care.

196
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:38,092
You are in dire need

197
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,695
of a getting-your-act-together
montage.

198
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,948
♪ Down so low,
don't know what up is ♪

199
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:45,816
♪ When--
- I'm sorry, Tracy.

200
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:49,487
You wanna be bossed around
by this trailer park Hitler?

201
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:52,773
Or do you wanna do whatever you
want with a sexy, fun bitch

202
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,243
who just bought you a pinata?

203
00:07:55,277 --> 00:07:56,944
- Awesome!

204
00:07:58,747 --> 00:07:59,947
- [Inaudible]

205
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,948
Miss Lemon, do you
have a moment

206
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,060
or are you busy regretting
your life choices,

207
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:09,173
for example, missing your window
for having children?

208
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:11,994
- Get to the point, Kenneth.
- It's Hazel.

209
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:14,713
I'm trying to help her,
but she's gone crazy.

210
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:16,353
- Uh-huh.
You can't handle the fact

211
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,331
that a woman is doing
your old job.

212
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,520
What a world.

213
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,974
I bet even Hillary Clinton
has to put up with this crap

214
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,143
from whoever was
secretary of state before her.

215
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:25,664
- You mean Condoleezza--
- Shut up.

216
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:28,043
Look, I believe in Hazel.
I happen to be her mentor.

217
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:29,660
So to quote Mr. Miyagi,

218
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:32,863
"leave girl alone or you deal
with me, surf shop owner."

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,335
- Hey, sweetie.
How was your day?

220
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,870
- Not even half over, Hazel.

221
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:42,090
Ugh! I still have to read
all these essays.

222
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:44,325
Okay.
- Look at you.

223
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:47,445
You're a whirlwind--
in charge in the board room...

224
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:49,713
And the bedroom.
- Sure.

225
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,766
- You're a modern,
DTF type woman

226
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,234
whose whole vibe says,

227
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,654
"yeah! Dig sex and I'm not
gonna apologize for it."

228
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:59,774
- Okay, here's a little
bedroom tip.

229
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:03,494
Put a bag of popcorn
in the microwave beforehand.

230
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,729
That way, when you're done,
you have a treat.

231
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:08,866
- I wish I had your
emotional intelligence.

232
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,537
My boyfriend Razmig and I
have hit a little rough patch.

233
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,373
- Okay.
Lay it on me.

234
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:19,126
- Well, I went home
this afternoon to get some,

235
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:23,445
and I found Razmig banging the
fattest chick I've ever seen.

236
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:26,072
And you know,
I used to weigh 800 pounds.

237
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,049
- Stop right there.

238
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,328
You didn't hit a rough patch.
He cheated on you.

239
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:30,926
You have to dump him
immediately.

240
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:33,020
- What?
How can you say that?

241
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,246
- Hazel,
I'm trying to help you.

242
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:36,701
- By asking me to break up
with the man I love?

243
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,724
Helping me would be teaching me
how to spice things up.

244
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,589
Like by greeting him
at the front door

245
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:43,434
wearing nothing
but false teeth.

246
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:47,104
I'm very disappointed
in your mentorship, Liz.

247
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:48,439
If this were two years ago,

248
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,124
I would sit on you
till you died.

249
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,547
- No wigs.

250
00:09:56,582 --> 00:09:59,450
I said no wigs.

251
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,002
You're not a lead, Gabe.

252
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:03,337
At best, you're a featured extra
with no lines.

253
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:08,009
Do you understand?
- Hey, Gabe.

254
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,394
- Lemon, would you be interested
in writing the screenplay

255
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:12,396
for the greatest love story
ever told?

256
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:15,966
- You mean Lois Lane's love
affair with journalism?

257
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,602
I said it.
- Avery and me.

258
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:19,487
I'm producing
a television movie

259
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:20,905
to get her back
in the headlines.

260
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,107
For obvious reasons,
I'm fast-tracking the project.

261
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:25,154
The script is due on Monday.
- Monday?

262
00:10:25,154 --> 00:10:27,288
Hmm. I guess I won't be able
to go to the gym this weekend.

263
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:28,552
- I know it's short notice,

264
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,295
but I would consider it
a personal favor

265
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,255
after six years of listening
to you complain

266
00:10:32,255 --> 00:10:34,142
about how there are
so few women on death row.

267
00:10:34,142 --> 00:10:36,811
- Is a coincidence,
or is the system sexist?

268
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:39,874
Oh! Speaking
of our amazing dynamic,

269
00:10:39,925 --> 00:10:41,825
I have taken on a mentee
of my own, Jack--

270
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:42,960
a page named Hazel.

271
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:44,328
- You're a mentor?

272
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:46,180
But that makes me
a grand-mentor.

273
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:48,129
And I'm still so young.
- Don't worry.

274
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:49,412
I already messed it up.

275
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,011
I told her to break up
with her awful boyfriend

276
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:53,298
and she got really mad at me.

277
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,198
- Often, the best way
for a mentee to learn

278
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,760
is for you to let her fail.

279
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,272
- Wait, does that mean
you've done that to me?

280
00:10:58,272 --> 00:10:59,740
When?
- Um--

281
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,140
- I think the crowd
at the Apollo

282
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,646
might welcome a change of pace.

283
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:04,899
- You're right.
You should do it.

284
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,833
Sometimes, they have
to learn the hard way.

285
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,662
If Hazel rejects your advice,
let her.

286
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:09,870
She'll get there on her own

287
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:11,616
just like you did
after the crowd at the Apollo

288
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:12,865
chased you into the river.

289
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:16,510
- Okay, I understand the irony
of what I'm about to say,

290
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,004
but I reject that advice.

291
00:11:19,004 --> 00:11:21,405
Don't worry, I'll bring you back
a t-shirt from successtown.

292
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,689
Ow! My groin!

293
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:28,539
- Mr. Jordan!
- K-dog.

294
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,375
You were wrong.
They do still make crossbows.

295
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,430
- You let him buy a crossbow?

296
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,013
And a motorcycle?

297
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,674
- No, Kenneth, I let him buy
a motorcycle ramp

298
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:40,259
and no motorcycle!

299
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:45,230
Can I help you?

300
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,847
Tracy's very tired.
He didn't sleep last night.

301
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:48,840
- Why not?

302
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,806
If he doesn't get at least
14 hours a night,

303
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:52,095
he starts to go crazy.

304
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:53,672
<i>- We on a show within a show!</i>

305
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,597
<i>My real name is Tracy Morgan!</i>

306
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,215
- Well, Tracy wanted
to go clubbing.

307
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:59,341
And I don't know
if you know this, Kenneth,

308
00:11:59,454 --> 00:12:01,339
but night clubs
are open at night.

309
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,674
- You didn't let him drink,
did you?

310
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,243
Mr. Jordan can't mix alcohol
with his medication.

311
00:12:06,261 --> 00:12:08,879
- I'm not an idiot, Kenneth.
I took him off his medication.

312
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:10,264
- You what?

313
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:11,682
Why are you doing this?

314
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:13,601
- Because Liz told me to.

315
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:16,420
Having access to Tracy
is an opportunity,

316
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,189
and I'm taking advantage of it.

317
00:12:18,223 --> 00:12:21,225
Did you see page six today?

318
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,194
Those are my toes
he's sucking on.

319
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:26,564
And he did not want to.

320
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:32,870
[Gasping] Ah, mm.

321
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:38,042
- Jack!

322
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:39,943
What the hell is this?

323
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:42,079
- Where did you get that?

324
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:44,332
- Donna from casting and I
are friends.

325
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:45,579
Well, not so much friends

326
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,502
as I own a magnet
that can scramble her pacemaker.

327
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:49,337
- Jenna,
you are not playing Avery.

328
00:12:49,388 --> 00:12:51,672
- Why not?
This movie was my idea!

329
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:53,007
- I appreciate that.

330
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:55,810
You can play
a Korean party whore.

331
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:58,128
I just don't think you can
capture Avery's essence.

332
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:00,097
- That's ridiculous.

333
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:02,566
<i>I posed bottomless in essence.</i>

334
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,819
- Jenna, Avery is worldly.
Traveled.

335
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:05,936
She went to Yale.

336
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,355
- Oh, I see.

337
00:13:07,406 --> 00:13:10,024
You think I'm stupid,
just because my college

338
00:13:10,075 --> 00:13:12,026
got tipped
over by those Miami heat fans.

339
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,530
- I didn't say stupid.

340
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,350
Jenna, there are many kinds
of intelligence.

341
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:18,483
Practical, emotional,
and there's actual intelligence,

342
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:20,251
which is
what I'm talking about.

343
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:22,002
- I want this part, Jack.

344
00:13:22,037 --> 00:13:23,871
It's a guaranteed
Emmy nomination.

345
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:25,873
- I'm sorry.
I've made up my mind.

346
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:28,992
- Very well.

347
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,878
But let me ask you this, Jack.

348
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,330
Would a dumb person be able
to think of something amazing

349
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:37,968
to say as she leaves?

350
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:43,724
- Liz, we have a show
in four hours.

351
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:45,486
Have you still not picked
a contest winner?

352
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:47,967
- Ugh! Fine,
I'll just pick one at random.

353
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,980
It's Joren van der Sloot.

354
00:13:50,014 --> 00:13:51,782
- We can't fly someone
from Peru now.

355
00:13:51,817 --> 00:13:53,895
There's no time.

356
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,405
- Oh, Hazel, we need to talk.
- I'm busy, Liz.

357
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:00,241
Tracy wants me to page for him
in Las Vegas this weekend.

358
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:01,518
Is this dress appropriate

359
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:03,346
for watching pornography
with Penn Jillette?

360
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:06,168
- Okay, normally we don't
encourage Tracy to go to Vegas,

361
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,875
because of his gambling
addiction and his fear of magic.

362
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:11,719
But maybe a weekend away
from Razmig is a good thing.

363
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:14,004
- No.
Razmig's coming with me.

364
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:15,539
- [Armenian accent] What?
Who is this, Hah-zel?

365
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,268
I no permit you talk
other woman.

366
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:18,866
- Okay, I'm putting
my foot down.

367
00:14:18,866 --> 00:14:22,581
This guy is no good for you
and I order you, as your mentor,

368
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,647
to dump him.

369
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,639
- You don't know what you're
talking about, Liz.

370
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:28,414
Razmig is amazing.
He makes me laugh.

371
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:31,445
- Oh, where is toilet pail?
Razmig must make mud.

372
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,908
- [Chuckling] Razmig!

373
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,559
- Hazel, no.
I'm not letting you--

374
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,728
- [Jack's voice echoing]
Let her fail, Liz.

375
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:40,664
Let her get there on her own.

376
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:43,250
- You know what, fine.
You're right, I'm wrong.

377
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:46,236
Go, be with Razmig.
- Thank you, Liz.

378
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:50,458
It takes a big woman
to admit she's wrong.

379
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,625
- You are a big woman.

380
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:54,578
You have pictures?
Fat nudes?

381
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,920
- [Knocking]
I need your help, Ms. Maroney.

382
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:05,523
- Absolutely.

383
00:15:05,557 --> 00:15:07,385
Oh, I thought
you were someone famous.

384
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:09,352
You sound a lot
like Reese Witherspoon.

385
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:10,331
What do you want?

386
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:13,090
- I'm afraid if Mr. Jordan
goes to Las Vegas this weekend,

387
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:14,283
he's gonna die.

388
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:15,688
- I'm not hearing my name,
Kenneth.

389
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,651
- So I thought you--

390
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,904
- oh, thank God.
That took forever.

391
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:22,606
- I thought you could teach me
how to get around Hazel.

392
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:26,410
If I could just get one minute
alone with Mr. Jordan--

393
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:29,129
- you can convince him
he's wrong. Yes!

394
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:31,499
But how do you get
his attention?

395
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,385
All the world's a stage,
Kenneth.

396
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:37,054
Just play the part.

397
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:39,256
- Play the part?

398
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:46,651
+

399
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:49,913
- Ms. Lemon.

400
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,209
If it's not too late,

401
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,656
I would like the essay contest
to win a role

402
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:55,477
<i>on TGS with Tracy Jordan.</i>

403
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:56,953
- No, Kenneth, you can't enter.

404
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,851
The contest isn't open
to NBC employees.

405
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:00,631
- I know, ma'am-maw.

406
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:02,466
Which is why I just quit my job

407
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:04,269
at standards and practices.

408
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,137
- I may [Bleep] hate you
right now,

409
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:09,607
you little [Bleep], but
[Bleep] damn it I respect you.

410
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:10,942
- Kenneth,
you know this is just

411
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,643
to be a non-speaking extra,
right?

412
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:13,978
- I know.

413
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:16,781
But have you ever loved
something so much

414
00:16:16,815 --> 00:16:18,700
that you would sacrifice
anything for it?

415
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:20,084
- Nope.

416
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,253
But you know what,
this is perfect.

417
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,505
Because then I don't have
to pick some crazy person,

418
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,374
and I know you won't do anything
weird on the air.

419
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:27,709
- I'm Kenneth!

420
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,827
- Get to wardrobe,
contest winner!

421
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,929
This is gonna be a great show.

422
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,389
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Charles from the U.N.

423
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,724
We found your wife

424
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:44,692
and I dropped her off
at the office.

425
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,145
She should be there
right about now.

426
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:52,784
- Jack, it's me.
I'm home.

427
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:54,419
- No, you're not my wife.

428
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:56,204
- How could you say that,
darling?

429
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:58,873
I'm Avery jesbert.
- Jenna?

430
00:16:58,907 --> 00:17:00,825
- No, don't turn on the light.

431
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,327
Surprised?

432
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:06,581
- Let's set aside
how idiotic that plan was,

433
00:17:06,632 --> 00:17:09,083
and imagine a world
where it actually worked.

434
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:10,468
- I appreciate your feedback.

435
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:12,870
- If I had believed you
for one second,

436
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:14,922
I would've been devastated,
heartbroken!

437
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:16,924
- You wanna talk
about devastation?

438
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:19,227
How do you think I felt when you
told me I couldn't play Avery?

439
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:20,762
- You are a monster.

440
00:17:20,813 --> 00:17:24,265
What you have done here today,
it's--it's...

441
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:27,885
The second cruelest thing
that anyone has ever done to me.

442
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,237
Do you know what
the cruelest is?

443
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:30,705
- When I went to the bathroom
on the hood of your car

444
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,323
before I thought of this plan?

445
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,975
- Avery had me committed
to a mental hospital

446
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:35,393
so she and her college roommate

447
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:36,944
could use my yankee tickets
on opening day.

448
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:40,415
- That's a nice story, Jack,
but I don't hear my name in it.

449
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,333
- You--
- Finally.

450
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:45,620
- You may not have
Avery's grace and acumen,

451
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:48,506
but you do have the one thing
that makes her so special--

452
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,209
her ruthless pursuit
of self-interest.

453
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:53,244
It's the heart of capitalism.

454
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:58,216
And the beautiful black heart
of my wife.

455
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,220
Jenna, you have Avery's essence.
Congratulations.

456
00:18:02,254 --> 00:18:03,754
The part is yours.

457
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:06,391
- Oh! You won't regret this.

458
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,393
We're gonna get her home, Jack.

459
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:09,710
Now if you'll excuse me,

460
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:11,562
I have a female condom
to take out.

461
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:12,930
Unless...

462
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:14,732
Going once...

463
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:18,820
- Four, three--

464
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,571
[audience cheering]

465
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:22,123
- Ladies and gentlemen,

466
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:25,226
a message from the president
of the United States.

467
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,212
- Goo-goo, ga-ga,
my fellow ah-meh-ri-cans.

468
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:31,249
- Okay, he's never been worse.

469
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:33,251
Is Kenneth supposed to enter?

470
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:34,469
- I love you, sir.

471
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,670
- Ken, where have you been?

472
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:37,672
- Damn it.
- I've been here all along.

473
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:39,924
I never left.
And I never will.

474
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,225
- Go to commercial.

475
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,460
- They told us
we can't do that any more.

476
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:43,627
- What?

477
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,563
- I quit my job
to be here, Mr. Jordan.

478
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,515
It was the only way
I could get around Hazel.

479
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:49,767
- You quit your job for me?

480
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:53,855
- I'm not just gonna sit by
and watch you destroy yourself.

481
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:56,807
'Cause I would do anything
for love,

482
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,576
but I won't do that.

483
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:04,449
- The girl in that video was hot
in an early '90s kind of way.

484
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:08,436
- Now... Take your medicine.

485
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,804
- This has been a message

486
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:12,957
from the president
of the United States.

487
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,128
- Tough night?

488
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:18,629
Come on, Lemon.
The show was all right.

489
00:19:18,663 --> 00:19:20,097
What about the sketch
with the guy who was worried

490
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,766
about his sexual performance?

491
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,968
- That was a real commercial for
an erectile dysfunction drug.

492
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:25,669
- Well, I laughed.

493
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,939
So, uh, how did things
shake out with Hazel?

494
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:29,774
- Not great.

495
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:31,809
My way, which is still
the right way, didn't work.

496
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:33,728
So just to see,
I did your thing.

497
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,646
- Good.
You let her fail.

498
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,232
That's how the banking industry
learned its lesson.

499
00:19:38,283 --> 00:19:40,451
And now they're doing amazing,
and everyone's honest.

500
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:42,520
- Mm. Your thing
didn't work either.

501
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:46,240
- Are you sure?

502
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:55,166
Mentoring is not
an exact science.

503
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,584
- Why aren't there
more female serial killers?

504
00:19:56,635 --> 00:19:57,969
What does that say
about our society--

505
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,003
- Liz!

506
00:19:59,037 --> 00:20:01,539
- Oh, here she is.
She's here.

507
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,874
- Liz, I was watching the show
fall apart

508
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:06,710
while Razmig gave me
a prison tattoo of his face,

509
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:07,929
and I heard your voice.

510
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,048
I finally heard
everything you said to me.

511
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,050
"Hazel,
you're a beautiful flower.

512
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:14,902
"Let yourself bloom.

513
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:16,220
"What are you doing
this weekend, Hazel?

514
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:19,023
Are there still bath houses?
Let's go to one!"

515
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,358
- I never said any of that,
but--

516
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:21,742
- you were right all along.

517
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:24,328
You knew I was making
the wrong choices.

518
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:27,365
But you let me fail.
With Razmig, with Tracy.

519
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,250
- Yes, I was definitely
on top of that Tracy thing.

520
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,068
- You were teaching me
the whole time,

521
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:34,738
and all the while lighting
a fire with that hot ass.

522
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:37,425
- I'm... Jack.

523
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:41,712
I'm your grand-mentor.
Liz?

524
00:20:41,746 --> 00:20:44,966
She's beautiful.

525
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:52,843
This next lady is from White Haven,
Pennsylvania

526
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:56,744
Okay! Please welcome
