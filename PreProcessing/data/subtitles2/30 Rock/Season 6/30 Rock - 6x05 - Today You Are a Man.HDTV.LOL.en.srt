164
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:46,190
[Sighs] I was asking
myself that same question.

165
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:47,958
And I did not like
the answer.

166
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:49,326
So I made a change.

167
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,679
I'm Hazel Wassername,
and yes,

168
00:05:51,713 --> 00:05:54,331
you may recognize me
from one of my two

169
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:56,183
background acting gigs.

170
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,302
Dr. Lingard,
yesterday,

171
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:01,522
we heard your daughter
take full responsibility

172
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,674
for her roles
in these crimes.

173
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:04,809
Where's Kenneth?

174
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:06,811
He took my spot
<i>the Suze Orman show.</i>

175
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:07,812
[Groans]

176
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:08,913
What a first day.

177
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:10,981
But you got
to roll with the punches.

178
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:14,452
Just like my hero,
Ivan Drago, from <i>Rocky IV.</i>

179
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:16,187
This is pathetic.

180
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:18,189
Kenneth's trying to make us
beg him to come back.

181
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:20,157
Well,
we are not doing that.

182
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:21,542
I've learned
from having children

183
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:24,027
that when your kid throws
a tantrum and holds his breath,

184
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,229
you hold your breath too.

185
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:27,047
When you regain
consciousness,

186
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:30,601
believe me, he's ready
to leave the toy store.

187
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:34,872
Finally, my client
gets 5% gross merchandising,

188
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:37,725
where gross means
income before expenses

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,394
and not gross
like apples on a sandwich.

190
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,213
2% salary decrease
to keep up with deflation...

191
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:43,213
Thank Obama...

192
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:46,684
And merchandising is a...

193
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:47,885
Nonstarter.

194
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,886
This meeting
is over.

195
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,488
When you have
a serious offer,

196
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:53,324
email me at
tatertotfreak@hotmail.Com.

197
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:54,942
From now on,
you can deal with me directly.

198
00:06:54,993 --> 00:06:55,960
Simon, you're fired.

199
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:57,578
Where did
that come from?

200
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:58,796
Are you being coached?
Is it Pat Riley?

201
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,414
Tell him the funmeister
says, "hi."

202
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:01,432
He'll know
what that means.

203
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,700
No one's helping me.

204
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:04,502
Maybe you just weren't
giving me enough credit

205
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:07,404
when you said
this was beneath you.

206
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,507
Surprise.

207
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:11,625
That's what the Donaghy method
is all about.

208
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,744
Use my techniques
and I don't care

209
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,597
who you're negotiating
against.

210
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:17,615
You'll win.

211
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,082
I'm negotiating against you,

212
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,185
you magnificent bastard.

213
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:23,520
[Laughs]
You.

214
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,397
Charlotte Bob is in trouble.

215
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:32,724
This is the part of the movie
where I fell asleep.

216
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:35,427
Jazz is gonna get you
out of this.

217
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:38,530
Say, hey!
I am one slick brother.

218
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:39,531
This blows.

219
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:43,035
Be the robots
from <i>NFL on FOX.</i>

220
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:45,404
Boo!

221
00:07:45,438 --> 00:07:47,739
[Guests booing]

222
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:48,907
You suck.

223
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:52,228
Here's your tea,
Ms. Orman.

224
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:54,230
- There you are.
- Who are you?

225
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:55,498
What happened to Hazel?

226
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:56,649
Oh, I'm sorry,
Ms. Orman.

227
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,451
Hazel and I switched places.

228
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,770
She's over at "TGS" now,
but don't worry.

229
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:01,904
It's temporary.

230
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,656
I just want all
the actors and writers there

231
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:04,907
to realize
how much they miss me.

232
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:06,642
And why should
they miss you?

233
00:08:06,677 --> 00:08:08,144
Well, I'd like
to think on some level,

234
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:09,629
we're all friends.

235
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,314
Do you socialize together
outside of work?

236
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:12,748
Do you exchange gifts?

237
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,685
Do you vacation together
on nonjudgmental cruise lines?

238
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,053
Well, no, but...

239
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,321
Listen, girlfriend.

240
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:20,556
You're trying
to solve an emotional problem,

241
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:23,426
but what you have
is a money problem.

242
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,329
You want to be "friends"
with people like

243
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,030
Tracy Jordan
and Jenna Maroney?

244
00:08:28,065 --> 00:08:30,600
They're rich,
so show me the money.

245
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:31,601
How much do you make?

246
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:32,602
I'm not sure.

247
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:34,437
My church requires
a 110% tithe.

248
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,155
- How old are you?
- Don't worry about it.

249
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,523
How much have you saved?

250
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:39,008
Are you talking about
saving squirrels from hawks?

251
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,009
Zero.

252
00:08:40,043 --> 00:08:41,277
If you really
want to be friends

253
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,528
with people this,

254
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,647
you are going to have
to quit the page program,

255
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:47,166
and get a real job so that you
can earn for your future.

256
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,284
What?

257
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:51,521
No, I can't quit
the page program.

258
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:54,991
Well then, denied!

259
00:08:55,025 --> 00:08:56,893
You got the initiative.
How do you keep it?

260
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:00,179
By making
a second first impression.

261
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:01,631
You're going
to wear dark colors,

262
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:03,399
with a single power accent.

263
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:04,400
Every hair in place.

264
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,669
Hair movement...

265
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:07,870
Is a sign of weakness.

266
00:09:07,905 --> 00:09:09,906
And whatever you do,

267
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,407
don't speak first.

268
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:16,145
90% of negotiations are lost
by the person who speaks first.

269
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,748
Because what is speaking
a sign of?

270
00:09:21,518 --> 00:09:22,485
Weakness?

271
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,486
You, out.
Fired.

Oh!

Oh, are we starting?
Please.

[Laughs]
Oh, I'm sorry.

279
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,593
Are you on
some subconscious level

280
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:49,512
seeing this as me
toying with your manhood?

281
00:09:49,546 --> 00:09:50,546
Of course I am.

282
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:52,114

I'm sorry, Jack.
I have to take this.

Yes, may I please speak

Okay, fine.

No, no.

00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:12,101
This just levels
the playing field.

But he's not famous.

Why is the government
allowing this?

316
00:10:58,215 --> 00:11:00,166
Because today,
he's the star.

00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:16,232
what makes us happy?

326
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,300
When I'm acting out,

327
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:18,868
it's never
about the real problem.

328
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:19,969
Like all actors,

329
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:21,637
I'm not emotionally
mature enough

330
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,306
to deal with my feelings,
you fart-face.

331
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,440
I know you are,
but what am I?

332
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,692
Adam isn't upset
about us.

333
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:27,710
It's something else.

334
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:29,245
We just have
to find out

335
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,831
what it is
and save this Bar Mitzvah.

336
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:35,117
So you've lost the initiative,
perhaps by being a woman

337
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:36,118
or a shorter man,

338
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:37,670
but you can regain it

339
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:39,889
by fighting
on your home turf.

340
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:42,925
No one has ever
won a land war in Russia.

341
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,360
Not Napoleon,
not Hitler,

342
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:46,962
not even Balki
in the unaired ninth season

343
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,230
of <i>Perfect strangers.</i>

344
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,765
So where's your Russia?

345
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,734
What's your home turf?

346
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:55,171

where you cannot lose.

What are you doing?

349
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,375
This is the men's room,
Jenna.

350
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:07,177
Not the C-list skank's room.

That's solid,
but that's not why we're here.

352
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,448
Adam, we want to help.

353
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,949
You're the star today.

354
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,185
And we know
how hard that can be.

355
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:17,787
Look, we know you're not
really mad about us.

356
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,756
You acting out
is about something else.

357
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,957
You can tell us.

It's just...

361
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:27,180
Everyone expects me to
dance with a girl today.

362
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:29,149
And I don't know
about girls.

363
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,134
I mean, I've played
this Japanese video game

364
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:32,819
where you slap prostitutes
to death,

365
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,821
but you only ever dance
with this penguin

367

Adam, trust me.

368
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,409
Any girl would want
to dance with you.

369
00:12:39,443 --> 00:12:40,610
You're rich.

370
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:43,363
And you're fat, so you'll die young.
Women love that.

371
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,981
Ad-rock,
I'm going to tell you

372
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,484
the same thing
I tell my son.

in the girl's mouth.

is your real father.

why does my coffee order

Uh...

Did you put peanuts
on this?

Yeah,
it's delicious, hat guy.

I don't know.

When is that party you throw
that we never go to

392

'cause we don't know what to get
the man who has nothing.

Suze Orman was right.

00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:41,471
I need to quit the page program
and get a real job.

395

You know what
we did today?

396
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:52,015
An amazing rendition
of "What's the guy's name

397

who plays first base?"

No, we solved a problem

399
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:56,820
by just addressing it,
head on.

400

Tracy,

401
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:01,574
what if you and I dealt with
all of our problems that way?

402
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,060
What if we were honest at work
about what's bothering us?

403
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,096
That would make everyone's
lives a whole lot better.

Well played, Jack.

417

You anticipated
my counter move,

418
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,602
employing
"A shortness is weakness"

that I knew
to bring my own furniture,

422
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,277
so I also brought
my Jack Welch power pillow.

what's really bothering us.

It's not about
the air-conditioning, is it?

Okay.

510
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,397
It's just
that I see a new page,

511
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,731
and I'm not used
to change.

Tracy,
this new page is Hazel,

Kenneth's replacement.

519
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,153
Kenneth wants
to leave the page program

520
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:52,004
so he can go
make more money.

521
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:55,091
But you need him here,
don't you?

522
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,594
Yes, I do need you, Kenneth.
I depend on you.

523

But I'm telling you
to go,

524

that I'm being honest,

525

this job
is a dead end for you.

And it would be selfish
of me to make you stay.

Are you serious?

00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,274
Yes.
Now go.

Hey, your video says
that after a negotiation,

535
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,194
the winner should get
the loser a gift.

536
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:32,712
So I brought you
this popcorn tin.

537

There's no popcorn left,

538

but it makes
a great closet organizer.

I used to be a winner.

women wanted to sleep with me,

Now look at me.

544

I can't get my wife back.

and...

Go work
for a not-for-profit.

there's less pressure

why I lost earlier?

Because of our friendship.

I want you
to have everything.

And that made me
make a mistake.

570
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:38,628
In other words,
I lost because of emotion,

571

which I always thought
was a weakness,

572
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,732
but now I've learned
it can also be a weapon.

emotion could be a weapon?

the poetry of jewel?

00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,756
you had Liz's Jack
on your side.

he-me beat Kabletown Jack,

until me-I turned
the tables on you-you.

for me at the company?

to discuss those opportunities

no other skills.
