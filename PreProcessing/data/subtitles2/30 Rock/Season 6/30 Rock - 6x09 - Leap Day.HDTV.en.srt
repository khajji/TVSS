what it really means,

317
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:34,978
but I remember.

318
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:38,248
One Leap Day when I was a kid,
the Harlem River froze,

319
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:41,651
and I decided to cross it
carrying my brick collection.

320
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,652
I told him not to.

321
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,354
No one can hear you, Dotcom.

322
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,023
Then I fell through the ice.

323
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,991
They still don't know
who pulled me out.

324
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:49,092
I did.

325
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:51,395
Charlie Rangel gave me a medal.

326
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,630
I like to think it was
Leap Day William.

327
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,198
You really believe
in Leap Day William?

328
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,600
I used to.

329
00:12:56,634 --> 00:12:58,535
Then I tried to eat
all this benihana.

330
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,138
Now I don't know anymore.

331
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:03,306
I gotta take a walk.

332
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,691
Do some thinking.

333
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:06,610
But I can explain.

334
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:08,862
I'm Leap Day Williams!
[Cops laughing]

335
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:11,448
No, really!

336
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,183
Please, believe me.

337
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,517
Have a little faith.

338
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:16,486
Oh, boy.

339
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,288
I'm getting sleepy.

00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,527
Wow, you're famous.

342

I have screen grabs of
all your nip s.

343
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,630
[Both laugh]

344
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:28,665
You know what, Thad?
I was trying to remember.

345
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:32,202
What was the dance that Rolf
did for Liesl?

346
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,904
Did it go like this?

347
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,557
Oh, yes.

348
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,376
That's it.

349
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,062
That's how Rolf danced.

350
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:44,648
Mmm.

351
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:49,853
Why don't you go and get me
and Liz some drinks?

352
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:52,072
Very well.

353
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:55,108
Liz, a moment, please?

354
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:59,696
If you're really gonna do this,
you better get a move on.

355
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,564
Right now, there are
models waking up

356
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:04,117
from their coke binges,
multi-ethnic bartenders

357
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,620
with daddy issues, former
ballerinas who had to quit

358
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,271
because their boobs
got too big.

359
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,574
They're gonna hear about
the horny billionaire,

360
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:13,510
and Thad's gonna forget all
about his little crush.

361
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:15,879
They're coming Liz.
Click click.

362
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:18,932
That's their stilettos.

363
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:21,268
Click click.

364
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:23,320
Sir?

365
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:25,755
Sir, you don't look so good.

366
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,491
You shouldn't have eaten
those rhubarb leaves.

367
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,459
I can't be sick.

368
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,394
I won't lose money
on Leap Day.

369
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:34,430
I'm just gonna rest a second.

370
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,037
Please get better, sir.

371
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:43,073
I've dug too many graves.

372
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:51,447
Why the long face, son?

373
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:53,783
I do have a long,
elegant face, thank you,

374
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:56,987
but I can't enjoy your
compliment, because I'm sad.

375
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,456
I'm starting to think Leap Day
William isn't even real.

376
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,676
I reckon you may be right.

377
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:06,663
Leap Day William's probably
just a tall tale told to kids

378
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,464
to help sell candy.

379
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:12,185
But this old fool
still believes he exists,

380
00:15:12,236 --> 00:15:14,971
right here, inside all of us.

381
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:17,140
I am always coughing up blood.

382
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:19,943
Could that be Leap Day William
trying to get out?

383
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:23,997
Might could be, but I think if
he were here right now,

384
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,916
Leap Day William would tell you

385
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,870
everything's gonna
be all right, Tracy,

386
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:33,557
as long as you remember
where you come from.

387
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,325
Thanks.

388
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,660
Nice costume, by the way.

389
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:39,696
Right, costume.

390
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:47,520
So, what should we do now?

391
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,739
Stop pressuring me.

392
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:52,342
What are you?
An intercourse monster?

393
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:55,478
I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.

394
00:15:55,512 --> 00:16:00,016
Is sex like when the Na'vi
intertwine their hair braids?

395
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:01,384
Sure.

396
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,088
Yeah, Thad, that's exactly
what it's like.

397
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:06,907
Okay, look, if we're
gonna do this,

398
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,209
we kinda need to do it now,
okay, before...

Wake up.

Kenneth, is that me?

Oh, I'm not Kenneth.

407

I'm the spirit of Leap Day.

Welcome to your Leap Day past.

409
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:38,354
Jackie, we can't go
to the parade today.

410
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:43,859
I got called into work... at the
hospital... where I'm a nurse.

411
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:46,428
Why are you showing me this?

412
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,763
This is the kind of adversity

413
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,932
that made me the man
I am today.

414
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,767
Good. Cry.

415
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,969
Let your sadness
form a hole inside you

416
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:55,404
that can only
be filled with money.

417
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:58,440
Of course we're going to
the parade today, Jackie.

418
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,543
But you can't have
candy and cigarettes

419
00:17:00,577 --> 00:17:02,311
without a few tears first.

420
00:17:02,329 --> 00:17:03,779
How did I forget this part?

421
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,881
And when did we stop giving
children cigarettes?

422
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,033
It's the liberal war
on Leap Day.

It's time to go,
Mr. Donaghy.

Okay, I'll change
me eye color,

a waste of voodoo.

It's a good lesson.

That's Liddy.

I assume this
is her horse stable

that nail as a funny joke.

for humanity.

After you missed
all her leap days,

441

she started experimenting
with liberalism.

That's not her.
It can't be.

to go to citarella

449

and buy the biggest
rhubarb there is.

as big as me, sir?

Birdstein to the vet.

will be in the Czech.

she will never give you.

all this free food?
