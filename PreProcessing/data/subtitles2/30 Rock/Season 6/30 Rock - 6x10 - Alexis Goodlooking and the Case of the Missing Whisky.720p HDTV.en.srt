1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:05,702
There she is!
Whore of whores!

2
00:00:05,736 --> 00:00:07,536
My Frankie could have
any woman on earth,

3
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,339
- and he chose you?
- Ma!

4
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:11,057
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:13,209
Why can't you just be happy
that I'm happy...

6
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:14,978
- With Liz?
- Can I just say one sentence?

7
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:17,546
<i>Dio mio,</i>i'm an old fool.
What is wrong with me?

8
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,015
My boy's in love!

9
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:22,602
Come over for dinner.
Tonight.

10
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:26,105
Do you like ox, Liz?
I'll defrost an ox for you.

11
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:33,896
Look, if the situation
was reversed,

12
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,782
you know I'd pretend
to be your boyfriend.

13
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,234
I have a boyfriend.
In Canada.

14
00:00:38,269 --> 00:00:40,870
Seriously.
Chris is in Canada for the week.

15
00:00:40,904 --> 00:00:42,255
And I can't
be your girlfriend,

16
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,207
'cause I'm not
an old pedophile.

17
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:46,092
We prefer the term
adultophobe.

18
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:48,294
Lynn, what is
going on here?

19
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,713
Well, I'm hiding
from Sylvia.

20
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:52,715
I got really good
at hiding in prison

21
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:54,300
and making wine
in my toilet.

22
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:56,920
Does your mom not know
you guys are together?

23
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:59,355
It's been a year.
Sylvia doesn't approve of me.

24
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,257
No one can remember why
anymore.

25
00:01:01,275 --> 00:01:03,309
You were his teacher,
and you seduced him.

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,778
Look, here's what happened.
My mom was snooping in my room,

27
00:01:05,813 --> 00:01:09,399
'cause she loves me,
and she found a letter.

28
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:12,485
Look what I found
in your pornography collection...

29
00:01:12,536 --> 00:01:13,903
A love letter.
Who sent this to you?

30
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:15,121
Who is "L"?

31
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:17,106
So you told her "L" was me?

32
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,108
Liz, we just need you
to go along with this

33
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:20,977
until... I don't know,
my mom dies.

34
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:22,128
Or I die.

35
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:24,747
No. I'm not helping
to protect <i>this.</i>

36
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,083
- It's creepy.
- This is creepy?

37
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:29,252
In prison, I was part of a fake
family with a bald woman,

38
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:32,422
and our son was a basketball
with a wig on it,

39
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,424
but... okay.
This is creepy.

40
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,025
Frank, tell your mother
the truth,

41
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,144
'cause living a lie
will eat you up inside.

42
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:41,964
Like that parasite I got
from eating Sushi on AmTrak.

43
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:58,043
30 ROCK S01 Ep. 10 Alexis Goodlooking

Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

45
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,619
- That's quite a suit, Kenneth.
- Thank you, sir.

46
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:05,705
All my suits
are my late father's...

47
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:07,490
Mr...

48
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:09,325
That's weird.

49
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:11,461
Kenneth, since you've left
the page program,

50
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:14,297
finding you a new position here
has been

51
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,399
one of the most difficult
challenges of my career.

52
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,601
And I'm including
making it through the '80s

53
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,703
without having sex
with Belinda Carlisle.

54
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,205
I know, sir,

55
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,940
but I just couldn't work
in ad sales.

56
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:25,608
We have far too many sponsors

57
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:27,527
that make housework
easier for women.

58
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:30,313
That's why I'm putting you
in the standards department.

59
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:33,216
You'll be responsible
for keeping the airwaves free

60
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,901
of content that might
offend any group.

61
00:02:34,952 --> 00:02:36,886
It's a good starting place,
but Kenneth,

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,654
if you wanna make it
in the business world,

63
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,491
you can't be so...
Morally stubborn.

64
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,226
There are gray areas.

65
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,544
No, sir.

66
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,429
There's always a right
and wrong.

67
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:49,465
Before he died, my father
gave me a piece of advice.

68
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,301
"Son, if you wanna
get ahead in this world...

69
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:54,904
Oh, God, this hurts...
Tell your mother I'm gay."

70

Nerf rifle.
<i>Mass Effect 3.</i>

71
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,944
What else do we need
for, uh, research?

72
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,746
Well, I need the deutsche
grammophon box set

73
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:05,398
- for my opera sketch.
- An opera?

74
00:03:05,432 --> 00:03:06,733
Is there singing?
Because I sing.

75
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,217
Tracy doesn't sing,
so I should do it.

76
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:10,052
The audience expects it.
I'll sleep with you.

77
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,922
No, Jenna, none of this
stuff is really for sketches.

78
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:15,224
We're just saying that so we can
charge it all to the show.

79
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:18,361
It's the perfect crime...
As long as Pete never finds out.

80
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:19,779
Who drank this?

81
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,248
This is the scotch I was saving
for my birthday.

82
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,566
Someone with a key
to my office,

83
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:27,203
a janitor or a security guard
or some black...

84
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:30,139
Hearted individual,
probably white,

85
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:33,075
has ruined
the Hornberger hang

86
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:36,312
for all of us!

87
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:38,214
Let's get forensics in here.

88
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,615
Have the techs
lift a latent print,

89
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,467
and run it against AFIS.

90
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:42,885
Maybe the perp's
in the system.

91
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,604
J-Mo,
you sound like a cop,

92
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:45,788
and I should know.

93
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:47,890
My Uncle was a cop...
In a porno.

94
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,193
Tracy, every blond actress
in the business

95
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,612
has done a pilot about
a tough but pretty lady cop

96
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:53,963
with special abilities.

97
00:03:53,997 --> 00:03:55,648
Mine was called
<i>goodlooking.</i>

98
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,700
I played Alexis goodlooking

99
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,101
who was also good-looking,

100
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:04,791
and my special ability was being
good at looking for clues.

101
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:05,992
Let's get forensics in here.

102
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:07,210
Have the techs
lift a latent print,

103
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:08,311
and run it against AFIS.

104
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,613
Maybe the perp's
in the system.

105
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,715
Unlike my husband's killer,
who got away,

106
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,116
and it haunts me.

107
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,318
You know what?

108
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:16,552
We should use your skills

109
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:18,254
to solve the case
of Pete's missing booze.

110
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:19,788
That was a long time ago,
Tracy.

111
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,257
My detective days
are over.

112
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,391
You sure about that?

113
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:24,827
Because like all black actors,

114
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:27,513
I have a lot of experience
with playing a wise black fellow

115
00:04:27,564 --> 00:04:30,633
who gets reluctant white people
to do things.

116
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:32,635
Well...

117
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,037
I'm just an old fool,
of course,

118
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:37,607
and I don't know much about
politics or the like.

119
00:04:37,641 --> 00:04:40,843
But I do know
America's kinda like this here

120
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,979
crab apple tree...

121
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,664
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

122
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,782
All right, I'll do it.

123
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:50,786
Let's ride, partner.

124
00:04:51,922 --> 00:04:53,756
I have some real problems

125
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,324
with this
<i>Law & Order SVU</i> script.

126
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:58,327
We can't say
"dick wolf" on TV.

127
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,630
Listen up,
standards and practices.

128
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:02,598
I just had an emergency
meeting with legal,

129
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:04,167
and we can no longer use
the words

130
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:07,370
"hit, great show, fun,"
or "broadcast television."

131
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:08,804
Now, Kenneth...

132
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:12,058
Mr. Donaghy, Bradley Tarkin,
junior compliance associate.

133
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:14,644
We met last year at your
completely silent presentation

134
00:05:14,678 --> 00:05:15,745
on the power of eye contact.

135
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:20,183
Yes.
I believe it was entitled...

136
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:22,401
I was just an intern then,

137
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:23,619
but afterwards,
I got you to sign

138
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:24,787
my first edition
<i>Jack attack.</i>

139
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,073
You know, the first edition
has a typo.

140
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:29,208
When I took over microwaves,
I said to the team,

141
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:30,543
"by the end of this quarter,

142
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:32,528
"we're all gonna be
in the black... comma... guys."

143
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,730
Not, "we're all gonna be
in the black guys."

144
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:36,666
Anyway, nice to meet you
again, Bradley.

145
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,501
Kenneth, a word.

146
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:41,537
Balloon!

147
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:46,876
Kenneth,
you are now officially

148
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,477
in the business world.

149
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,479
Bradley is trying
to destroy you.

150
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,114
Destroy me?

151
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:54,483
He's the best friend
I've <i>ever</i> had,

152
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,185
tied with everyone
I've ever met.

153
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,955
Kenneth, if you learn
one thing from me, it's this:

154
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:00,590
In business,
you have no friends.

155
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:02,692
Let me tell you
a little story.

156
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,761
There was once a man named...
Henry Warren.

157
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:08,097
Henry pretended
to be my friend,

158
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:11,601
but he turned out to be
my very first Nemesis.

159
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,569
We got the contract!

160
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:15,238
We're gonna make
the bottles for new coke.

161
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:17,039
And I'm gonna make sure
you get all the credit.

162
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:18,424
Aces!

163
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,509
Let's do some cocaine.

164
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,712
My friendship with Henry
was a lie.

165
00:06:22,746 --> 00:06:25,514
We were just waiting for the
chance to destroy the other one.

166
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:27,516
But Bradley gave me
my nickname.

167
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:28,517
"Susan."

168
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,019
Like "lazy Susan,"

169
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:32,138
'cause I'm lazy
and effeminate.

170
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:34,523
Bradley is dangerous.
Last year he was an intern.

171
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:36,292
Now he's a junior
compliance associate.

172
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:38,694
How did he get promoted
so quickly?

173
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,697
I signed his book.
He had my signature.

174
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:44,867
He probably put it on a forged
letter of recommendation.

175
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:47,203
Sir.
That's awfully paranoid.

176
00:06:47,237 --> 00:06:48,771
Exactly.
"Paranoid,"

177
00:06:48,805 --> 00:06:50,706
from the Greek "para"
meaning "beside,"

178
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:53,159
and "noid,"
which is some sort of a...

179
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,278
Pizza demon!
No, that can't be right.

180
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,213
The point is, you've got
to be paranoid, Kenneth.

181
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:58,881
You've gotta go in there
and crush Bradley

182
00:06:58,915 --> 00:07:00,466
like I crushed Henry Warren.

183
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,952
But I've never
crushed anyone

184
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:04,587
except accused witches.

185
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:07,456
Get in there!

186
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,597
- Be cool, be cool, be cool.
- How did you get in here?

187
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,599
Frank said
you couldn't come to dinner

188
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:18,067
because you weren't
feeling well.

189
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:19,635
But I know the best
thing for a fever

190
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,605
is food, wine,
and cheek pinching!

191
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,156
So I packed everything up,

192
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:26,075
prayed to the patron
Saint of locked apartments,

193
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:28,611
- and here we are.
- No. Absolutely n...

194
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,830
You don't have a say in this!
Now, lie down.

195
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,682
While I'm here,
you do nothing.

196
00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:34,150
As we say in Italy...

197
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,791
Eat an arancine.

198
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,893
I love our little family.

199
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:53,868
Pete?

200
00:07:54,234 --> 00:07:55,902
Yeah, I saw him
earlier today.

201
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:57,203
Why?
Something wrong?

202
00:07:57,237 --> 00:07:58,571
Someone drank his scotch.

203
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:00,006
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

204
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,174
Why would I?

205
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,643
I was gonna drink it with him
on his birthday.

206
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,578
Okay, but if you think
of anything,

207
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,847
use this phone
as a reminder to call us.

208
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,415
I may not pick up,

209
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,217
'cause I lost my phone
just now.

210
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:13,352
If you think of anything,

211
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,354
call us.

212
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,523
Hang on.
This chair's been moved.

213
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:22,695
Read him his rights.

214
00:08:22,713 --> 00:08:24,881
I should tell my husband
I'm gonna be late tonight.

215
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:28,434
No, wait, I can't.
He's dead.

216
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:32,538
Hang on.

217
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,974
The trash was moved.

218
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:39,428
Hiding something,
Mr. Lutz?

219
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:42,849
Okay. I drank it.
We all drank it.

220
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:45,318
We wanted booze, but we didn't
wanna hang out with Pete.

221
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:46,719
It's the worst!

222
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,254
He always brings out
his guitar and sings.

223
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,606
He's got one story,
and it's about him

224
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:52,758
seeing Phil Donahue
at a mall.

225
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,778
Now comes the worst part.

226
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,830
The paperwork.

227
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:03,302
What's wrong, Susan?

228
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,905
Mr. Pfister
just took me to the woodshed,

229
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,090
which I didn't even realize
could be a metaphor.

230
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,543
I guess I signed off
on a script

231
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:13,946
where an Asian character
refers to "Rindsay Rohan"

232
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,932
posing for <i>"Prayboy."</i>

233
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,885
But I know
that's very offensive.

234
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,887
Especially because asians
are under-represented

235
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,388
- on this network.
- Exactly.

236
00:09:22,422 --> 00:09:23,389
If there are more
actors of Asian descent...

237
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:24,857
Shut up!
Just shut up, Roy!

238
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:26,442
- I am talking to Kenneth.
- I'm dealing with something!

239
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:29,228
No one wants
to hear from you.

240
00:09:29,262 --> 00:09:30,646
I don't even remember
reading that script.

241
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,816
It's... your signature
on the memo.

242
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:35,768
That does look like my "X."

243
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:37,153
Susan, as a friend,

244
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,989
quit before they fire you.

245
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:43,709
Your meatballs are <i>good!</i>

246
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:45,411
Like Ikea good!

247
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,496
Is there parmesan in this?

248
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,749
And Lemon.
And a little fennel?

249
00:09:49,783 --> 00:09:51,751
Are you sure you're not
Italian, Liz?

250
00:09:51,785 --> 00:09:53,285
Maybe from the North?

251
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,788
That's where the vampires
used to live.

252
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,924
What's the matter, Frank?
You're so quiet!

253
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,177
You're sitting at dinner
next to a beautiful older woman.

254
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:03,679
Eat something and kiss her!

255
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:10,853
No! I can't do this.

256
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:13,873
Ma, Liz isn't the "L"
in that letter.

257
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:17,810
It's...
Lynn Onkman.

258
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:20,546
Elizabeth,
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

259
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,615
But this is my...

260
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,185
I don't think Bradley's
my friend.

261
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:28,721
I hate to say, "told ya,"
because it reminds me

262
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,790
of my one-night stand
with Nikki finke.

263
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:32,992
He's trying to get me fired.
What do I do?

264
00:10:33,026 --> 00:10:34,694
Pray for a body switch
mix-up

265
00:10:34,728 --> 00:10:37,296
so we can see the world
from each other's perspectives?

266
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,498
No. You destroy him.

267
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:40,716
With this.

268
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,052
I did some research.

269
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:45,705
And unlike what he wrote
on his application,

270
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:48,641
Bradley never graduated
from Syracuse.

271
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:51,344
He's four credits shy
of a degree in bro studies.

272
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:54,213
You slip this transcript
under your manager's door,

273
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:55,381
and he's fired.

274
00:10:55,415 --> 00:10:57,083
No! I can't do that.

275
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:58,584
It's wrong!

276
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:00,219
If you don't get him,
he gets you.

277
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:01,587
And that little snake

278
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,072
keeps slithering up
the corporate ladder

279
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,557
instead of a good man
like yourself.

280
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,259
Kenneth, sometimes you've gotta
get your hands dirty

281
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:09,045
for the good of company...

282
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,696
And country.

283
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:13,866
My two favorite
kinds of music.

284
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:18,504
Hey, everybody's just
sitting around in there

285
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,473
waiting for you two
to shoot promos.

286
00:11:20,507 --> 00:11:22,708
Thank God I've got my awesome
Phil Donahue story.

287
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,111
Pete, there's been a
development in the whiskey case.

288
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,679
What? No!
Forget the whiskey!

289
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:29,148
Look, all I wanted to do
was hang with my friends,

290
00:11:29,182 --> 00:11:30,433
rock some jams,

291
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:32,618
and tell the story about
my cousin seeing Phil Donahue.

292
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:34,787
I mean me!
I-I'm the one who saw him.

293
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:37,189
We just wanted
to tell you...

294
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,558
We don't know what happened
to your whiskey.

295
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:43,946
What was that?

296
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:46,082
He doesn't need to know
how it went down.

297
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:47,399
It would hurt him too much.

298
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,635
I broke the number one rule
of being on the force.

299
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:50,970
Don't fall in love
with your car?

300
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,072
No.
I let it get personal.

301
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:54,290
You're right.

302
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:55,741
The car thing is stupid.

303
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:57,843
The thing is,
the writers got away with it.

304
00:11:57,878 --> 00:12:00,245
So what are we gonna do
about it?

305
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:02,314
We're goin' rogue.

306
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:04,283
Hey.

307
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:05,918
Sorry about last night.

308
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:07,103
Yeah.
I had to sleep here.

309
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:08,521
You know,
they turned the heat off.

310
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:10,523
If I hadn't found
that other blanket, I'd...

311
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,274
Wait, where'd it go?

312
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:14,026
Oh, God.
It was mice!

313
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:16,695
The blanket was mice!

314
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,948
So... what happened
with Sylvia?

315
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:20,116
You were right, Liz.

316
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,867
Lying to my mom
was stressing me out.

317
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:24,070
I mean, I haven't
gained weight in months.

318
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:25,204
It wasn't worth it.

319
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,006
So what,
you broke up with Lynn?

320
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,958
- Just promise me...
- Here.

321
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:31,443
That you'll take care of
yourself.

322
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,496
Don't let Liz work you
too hard.

323
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:35,447
I do really hate her.

324
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,216
I think
she's a terrible person.

325
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,168
First of all,
why were you in my bedroom,

326
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,504
and why would you tell me
that part of the conversation?

327
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:43,622
It's the only part where we
weren't having break-up sex.

328
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:45,691
- Come on!
- Look, I'm sorry.

329
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,494
And I appreciate
everything you did, so...

330
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:49,812
I made you some meatballs.

331
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:51,197
It's my mom's recipe.

332
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,032
- So you're sure you're okay?
- Yeah.

333
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:54,967
Definitely.
With all this behind me,

334
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,353
I'm... happy.
Thanks.

335
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:58,687
Eat them now!

336
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,840
Quiet.
I do the talking.

337
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:06,529
Henry.

338
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,980
Henry Warren?

339
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:09,665
Henry Warren-Chang.

340
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:12,585
I married a very bossy
Chinese lady.

341
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,753
What on earth
are you doing here?

342
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,872
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.

343
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:20,325
I haven't seen you since
the 1985 G.E. talent show

344
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:22,378
when I convinced you
to sing <i>Monster mash,</i>

345
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,829
knowing full well
that Jack Welch

346
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,881
is terrified of monsters,
and I ended your career.

347
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:27,433
Not "ended."

348
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,051
Doing quite well, actually.

349
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:32,054
In publishing now.
Encyclopedias.

350
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:34,340
I wanted to stop by
because a young man

351
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:37,776
named Kenneth parcell came
to my office this afternoon.

352
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,778
He did?
What did he want?

353
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,814
He wanted to find out
if my life turned out okay

354
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:43,382
after you took me down.

355
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,350
Because he's afraid he might
have to do the same thing

356
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:46,619
to someone else.

357
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,954
- And what did you tell him?
- I told him the truth.

358
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:50,289
I'm great.

359
00:13:50,323 --> 00:13:52,458
I lease a certified
pre-owned lexus,

360
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:54,059
both my sons are magicians,

361
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,427
and for my birthday,

362
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,796
wei-lin got me tickets
to the Broadway show <i>Memphis.</i>

363
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:00,699
So......

364
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:03,135
And I see that you've done
very well for yourself.

365
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,639
Well, that sofa
is made from sea biscuit.

366
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:11,760
Well...
We're both very impressive.

367
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:13,562
But at what cost, Jack?

368
00:14:13,597 --> 00:14:15,514
The first couple months
that we worked together,

369
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:16,765
we were good friends,

370
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:18,651
and then we turned against
each other and...

371
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:20,402
Come on, Henry.
We were never friends.

372
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:23,405
We were pretending so we could
learn each other's weaknesses

373
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,157
and then...
Exploit them.

374
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,725
But what about
all the dinners?

375
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,911
I mean, we talked for hours.

376
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,263
- I was gathering information.
- All right.

377
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:32,915
What about the drive
up to pittsfield

378
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:34,300
when we stopped
at sturbridge village?

379
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,668
Remember?
We had fun.

380
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,419
We saw a candle being made.

381
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:40,406
I didn't really care
about that candle, Henry.

382
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,141
I don't even remember
what color it was.

383
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,628
Regular white-tan
candle color, Jack!

384
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,346
You know what?

385
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,348
I really feel sorry
for Kenneth parcell,

386
00:14:49,382 --> 00:14:50,983
because you're gonna beat
all that's good out of him

387
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:54,253
and turn him into another
paranoid corporate killer.

388
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:58,123
I remember our trip
to Hilton head.

389
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,026
That wasn't me!

390
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:06,543
Take a sit 'cause no one
is going anywhere!

391
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,517
We know you all drank
Pete's scotch...

392
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:12,985
So here's how
we're gonna play it.

393
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,688
You're gonna hang out with Pete
every night this week.

394
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:17,156
Why would we do that?

395
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,024
'Cause we have you dead
to rights, you black bastard!

396
00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,075
And if you don't play along,

397
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,577
we tell Pete
about your little scam...

398
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:23,913
How the show's been paying
for your video games

399
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:25,831
and nerf rifles
and pornography.

400
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,316
That's right!

401
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,652
We know you ordered
a porn version of <i>Temple Grandin</i>

402
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:32,154
entitled
<i>ten poles rammed in.</i>

403
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:34,356
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

404
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,991
Let's get outta here,
Maroney.

405
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,128
The sight of these people
plus the crayons I ate earlier

406
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:42,264
make me sick.

407
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:47,386
<i>Sing us a song,
you're the guitar man</i>

408
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:50,005
<i>and this is
Pete's birthday night</i>

409
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:52,057
Any mysteries
that need solving, Liz?

410
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:53,876
- Actually, yes.
- What happened?

411
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,694
Who attacked you
and gave you that haircut?

412
00:15:55,729 --> 00:15:58,614
No, it's these meatballs.
They don't taste right.

413
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:00,115
There's an extra ingredient.

414
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,401
It's something familiar.

415
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:08,324
<i>P.S. I love you</i>
<i>is so sad.</i>

416
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,759
No one should have to be married

417
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:12,127
to Gerard Butler.

418
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:16,065
Or hilary swank!

419
00:16:18,969 --> 00:16:21,170
It's tears!

420
00:16:21,204 --> 00:16:22,972
Frank was crying
when he made these.

421
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:25,424
He lied!
He's miserable.

422
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:28,477
But I don't understand.
He seemed so happy earlier.

423
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:29,562
Forget it, Tracy.

424
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:31,981
It's midtown.

425
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:39,221
Kenneth, don't do it.

426
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:43,108
You can't destroy Bradley,
you... innocent goon.

427
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,427
You're the most remarkable
person I know,

428
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,896
and I've met
jaleel White.

429
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,497
Incredibly charismatic.

430
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:50,599
He makes Stefan urquelle
look like Steve urkel.

431
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,102
- But my career.
- Forget about your career.

432
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,371
I'd rather see you get fired
and lease a car

433
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,973
than watch you turn into
someone like me.

434
00:16:58,008 --> 00:16:59,408
Now, give me
that transcript.

435
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,577
So you're trying
to help me.

436
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:03,746
Of course I am, Kenneth.
I'm your friend.

437
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,515
It's just... the other day
you said in business

438
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:08,217
I have no friends,

439
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:10,319
and you were right
about Bradley,

440
00:17:10,353 --> 00:17:12,354
so what does that
say about you?

441
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:15,291
Maybe you're afraid
I <i>will</i> become you.

442
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,726
I'll climb
that corporate ladder

443
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:19,895
until I eventually
take your job.

444
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,497
And then where will you be?

445
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,998
Out on your ass

446
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,234
like stone Mountain's mailman

447
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:27,769
riding his trusty donkey
erasmus.

448
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:31,440
That is some
high-level paranoid thinking.

449
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:34,677
Like Hitler...
Or Willy wonka.

450
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,795
If you're thinking that way,

451
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,983
then I'm... already too late.

452
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:59,001
Why are you keeping me late
to write the cold open?

453
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,737
- Well, you know politics.
- I don't know anything.

454
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:04,239
I get all my news from the radio
in <i>Grand Theft Auto.</i>

455
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:05,691
Frankie! Are you okay?

456
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,976
<i>La Donna di scoregge</i>
<i>called and said you were sick,</i>

457
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:09,545
so I came by to make you
chicken soup.

458
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,031
- Where can I kill this?
- Wait... Liz called you?

459
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:14,416
- No. She called me.
- You!

460
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,703
How dare you?
Get out of my Liz's office.

461
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,521
You said Frank
wanted to get back together.

462
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,991
Why would you tell her that?
I said I was happy.

463
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:24,659
You lied... you're miserable.
You cried in my food!

464
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:27,496
Sylvia,
your son is not sick.

465
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,465
And Lynn,
Frank didn't actually say

466
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,933
that he wanted
to get back together.

467
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:33,669
So I wore my sexy underwear
for nothing?

468
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:34,870
I'll kill you!

469
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:37,439
Ma'am, I am in
a Mexican prison gang.

470
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:40,142
You kill me, Los Tiberones
will green-light a 1-8-7 on you,

471
00:18:40,176 --> 00:18:41,343
and you don't want
that kind of heat.

472
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:43,062
Sylvia,
your son is not happy.

473
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,913
And not that you care,
but neither is Lynn.

474
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,398
That's true.
When Liz called me,

475
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,517
I was getting this tattoo.

476
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:50,586
I'm not creative.

477
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,388
And believe me, I get it.
This shouldn't work.

478
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,289
I mean, how they met
is disgusting.

479
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:56,091
Their age difference
is just weird.

480
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:58,027
They shouldn't go together.

481
00:18:58,061 --> 00:18:59,428
But you know what else
shouldn't go together?

482
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:04,199
Veal, fennel, lemon,
cheese, and pork.

483
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:06,568
That's right.
Your meatballs.

484
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,604
Lynn and Frank...

485
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:13,375
Are just as good
as your meatballs.

486
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,061
That's it?
We're meatballs?

487
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,813
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

488
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:19,581
Do you have any idea

489
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,550
what I've been through
for love?

490
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,318
Public humiliation.

491
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:26,955
Johnny Carson in his monologue
said I was looking at 20 years,

492
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,825
but I'd probably
be more attracted to 12.

493
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:32,444
I mean, that's an okay joke,
but it hurt.

494
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:35,114
And then prison,
where we only had one movie

495
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:38,000
with dabney Coleman
and the kid from <i>E. T.?</i>

496
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:39,968
<i>- Cloak & Dagger?</i>
- Shut up, Liz.

497
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:42,454
I lost my house, my life,

498
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:44,506
but it has all been worth it.

499
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,342
I mean, even if I never see
Frank again, it was worth it.

500
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:50,646
And you call us meatballs!

501
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,947
Elizabeth,

502
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:55,017
I'm gonna ask you to leave.

503
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,854
Okay, but if you look
at my Internet history,

504
00:19:58,888 --> 00:20:02,791
I'm researching a movie about
two male centaurs kissing.

505
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,812
I was wrong.

506
00:20:06,863 --> 00:20:09,164
This isn't creepy because
you're dating your teacher.

507
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,200
This is creepy because
you're dating your mother.

508
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:13,102
You found someone
just like me

509
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:15,838
because I'm the woman
you really wanna be with!

510
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:17,473
'Cause you're the best!

511
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,476
Frankie, you're the best.

512
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:25,514
My big family.

513
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:29,784
<i>And Phil Donahue's
walking past cinnabon</i>

514
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:33,121
<i>and he's making
eye contact with me</i>

515
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:36,592
<i>I can tell by his smile
that he'll stay for a while</i>

516
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,194
<i>and say, "Pete,
you're who I wanna be"</i>

517
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,671

518
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:43,136
Well, maybe I never did
go to college

519
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,737
or travel around the world.

520
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:46,339
So I don't know much
about worldly things

521
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:49,375
like taco meat
and having all your fingers.

522
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,190
Lord knows some of my friends
are just shrubs

523
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,860
I put hats on
and get high with.

524
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:57,896
My wife had two
of the president's babies,

525
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,398
and you're one of 'em.

526
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,133
I can tell you one thing...

527
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,702
I'm gonna kill all y'all
in y'all sleep.

528
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:07,072
Now, I don't know nothing about
no literature or history,

529
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:09,057
but I'll tell you
what I do know.

530
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:11,977
This movie was written
by white nerds.

531
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:13,011
Cut!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
