00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:13,190
at Adrian Brody's unaccredited
acting school?

161
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:15,742
Jack, when Avery
does get back,

162
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:17,694
I don't think we should
tell her about us.

163
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:19,729
[Spits]

164
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,867
Oh, [Bleep]

165
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:33,355
I want to make sure
we all we're very clear

166
00:06:33,438 --> 00:06:35,639
about what my mother in law
said in my office.

167
00:06:35,673 --> 00:06:38,225
She said we shouldn't
tell Avery about Gus.

168
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,877
Gus is someone I've gone
into business with

169
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:42,879
and Avery wouldn't
approve of him.

170
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:45,048
Why would she disapprove?

171
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:49,453
Uh, well, uh, because
they dated... at Yale.

172
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:50,988
Gus was a Professor.

173
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:52,539
Of course you'll meet him.

174
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:55,826
We do business all the time.

175
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,628
Tracy,
I know you're planning

176
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:00,030
a big romantic
surprise for me

177
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:02,299
at the end
of the fashion show.

178
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,052
But Jack Donaghy is messing
with my special day.

179
00:07:05,086 --> 00:07:07,054
So whatever you were thinking
about doing, double it.

180
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:08,221
Call Mo'nique.

181
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:09,640
Do a dove release.

182
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:12,059
Parachute in and propose to me
all over again, you hear?

183
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,311
Angie, I wasn't even gonna
go to your fashion show.

184
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:15,595
It's at 8:00,

185
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:17,431
which is 9:00 am Tokyo time.

186
00:07:17,482 --> 00:07:19,766
That's when Takashi's parents
leave for work

187
00:07:19,817 --> 00:07:21,985
and we play
<i>mass effect 3</i> online.

188
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,603
[Laughs]

189
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,356
Mr. and Mrs. Tanaka
think he's at school,

190
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,660
but he's playing video games
with a drunk adult.

191
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:32,195
Now I know
you're just saying that

192
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,582
because you don't want to
ruin the surprise

193
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:37,901
'cause you're a good husband.

194
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:41,872
Oh, my God.

195
00:07:41,906 --> 00:07:44,875
Ned Stark is dead?

196
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,960
I love my wife.

197
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,795
I want her to be happy.

198
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:51,598
But more than that,
I'm gonna do nothing.

199
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,967
It's hard trying
to have it all.

200
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,388
You wait here, Bernardo.

201
00:07:58,422 --> 00:08:03,560
[Baby babbling]

202
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:05,612
She bit my [Bleep].

203
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:06,980
Eew.

204
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,765
My glasses.

205
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,901
It's work. It's work.

206
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:13,436
But she is at such a fun age.

207
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:14,905
You get so much out of it.

208
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:17,908
It's fine, I'm fine.

209
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:20,293
If everything goes
according to plan,

210
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:22,662
Avery will be back
in a few days.

211
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,664
In the meantime I have
a lot of work to do...

212
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:27,167
With Gus, my business partner,

213
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:29,803
whom Diana mentioned earlier.

214
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:32,672
Gus, there's Gus.

215
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:34,091
Why are you wearing the hat

216
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,926
I asked you not to wear
any more to our meetings?

217
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,310
We're higher up here,

218
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:40,097
so the sun's electricity
is stronger.

219
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,816
Well, uh, let's go over
the numbers, Gus.

220
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,635
As you can see,
the numbers look pretty good.

221
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:49,406
We're under budget and
in line with projections.

222
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,241
Great, well, uh, meeting over.

223
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:56,246
You probably shouldn't have even
filmed that, it was so boring.

224
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,782
Oh, Diana, you remember Gus,
whom you said we shouldn't tell

225
00:08:58,816 --> 00:09:01,368
Avery about because
she used to date him.

226
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,319
She was nasty.

227
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,338
She loved pee.

228
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:07,424
- Thank you, Gus.
- No, Jack.

229
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,159
I didn't say Gus.

230
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,428
I already explained
to them what I said.

231
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:16,833
I said I did not want Avery
to know about Rus.

232
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:20,971
In slavic myth, Rus is
the founder of Russia.

233
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,639
Why can't Avery know about

234
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:24,808
the mythological founder
of Russia?

235
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:29,863
Because Jack has invested a lot
of money in a restaurant

236
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:32,282
I'm opening called "Rus".

237
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:34,568
It is Russian cuisine.

238
00:09:34,619 --> 00:09:36,987
Who doesn't love
cold, purple soup?

239
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:38,905
Diana, we're talking
about the same thing,

240
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:40,207
because, as you know,

241
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:43,660
the restaurant Rus
is the business venture

242
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:45,879
I'm engaged in with Gus.

243
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:48,298
Right, he is the chef.

244
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:51,051
As I mentioned earlier,
he's a Professor at Yale.

245
00:09:51,085 --> 00:09:52,252
Which is funny,

246
00:09:52,303 --> 00:09:55,055
because he looks so much
more like a chef.

247
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,757
Oh, what's funniest...
Is that's he's both.

248
00:09:57,809 --> 00:09:59,843
And now he works
at the restaurant

249
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:03,647
we can't tell Avery about.

250
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:06,683
And the grand opening
is tonight.

251
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,822
Now he's opening up
a restaurant

252
00:10:11,856 --> 00:10:13,990
the same night
my line launches?

253
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:16,693
Oh, that is a bridge too far.

254
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:18,078
That's right.

255
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:20,614
I read World War II history,
mother-[Bleep].

256
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:23,399
Well, nobody's going to care
about his restaurant

257
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,786
when there's a fashion show
going on in the middle of it.

258
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:29,206
And a big surprise
from my husband.

259
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,009
Eliza Beth.

260
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:35,262
This is very, very easy for me

261
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:37,297
to say to you, but you can't
come in here right now.

262
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:39,015
Wha... l just wanna
drop off this

263
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:41,935
little crinkly book
that I got for Virginia.

264
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,386
I can't let you in.

265
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,805
After what happened
betwixt you this morning?

266
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:48,108
No, Virginia is not
having you.

267
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,093
What are you talking about?

268
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,395
I might bite these
fat little legs.

269
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,114
They're so fat and juicy.

270
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:55,198
Rude.

271
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,867
Whit was a compliment.

272
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,902
That's a thing people
say to babies.

273
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,704
You never talk about
a black woman's leg size.

274
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:02,706
Not on babies, not on
the Williams sisters,

275
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
not on a mannequin at Avenue.

276
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:04,875
We have come too far.

277
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:05,876
Now you know me, girl.

278
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,877
I don't, really.

279
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:08,328
I stay above these feuds.

280
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:09,880
Did I get involved
when Portia took

281
00:11:09,914 --> 00:11:11,748
the over-the-counter colon
health test in the bathroom

282
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:13,833
at Randi's domestic violence
costume ball?

283
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:14,968
I did, but I didn't want to.

284
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:16,086
Can I be honest?

285
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,888
I think I'm just anxious

286
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,289
for Virginia to love me because
I've been thinking

287
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:20,390
about motherhood lately.

288
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:22,259
I have a serious biend
right now and...

289
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:24,261
Lisa, D'Fwan doesn't talk
about people behind their backs,

290
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,645
so I'm just gonna tell
you straight to your face

291
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,181
that what you're saying
right now is very boring.

292
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,933
All I know is
I'm gonna stay out

293
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,101
of this fight between
you and Virginia.

294
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,686
That baby is a piece of work.

295
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:34,137
You know she should be
able to stack blocks

296
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:35,605
in a tower by now,
but she won't do it.

297
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,641
I thought you didn't talk
about people behind their backs.

298
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:44,447
Hi.

299
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:49,152
Go away.

300
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:52,155
Rude.

301
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:57,210
Down. Down.

302
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,095
Boom, right there.

303
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,964
God, these flower
arrangements.

304
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:04,467
You people are savages!

305
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:05,969
Just excited.

306
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:08,305
Wait, you're putting
spoons in those.

307
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,173
It's just knives and forks.

308
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:12,175
Why am I even doing this?

309
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:13,977
I still have to get the menus
from the printer,

310
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:15,779
go to the cony island
beet market.

311
00:12:15,813 --> 00:12:18,281
I've gotta pick up
Yakov Smirnov at the airport.

312
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:20,951
That's enough foil, Gus.

313
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,902
Jack, it's been a year
that we prayed

314
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:25,038
for this... restaurant opening,

315
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:28,625
and I should just feel
excited and relieved, but...

316
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,827
It's complicated.

317
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:33,463
When you open a restaurant
with your mother in law.

318
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:37,167
Hey, everyone knows you're not

00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,662
and last
all through next season.

481
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:47,698
Both: I'm cheating on you!

482
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:54,004
Virginia: Rude!

483
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,102
Next week on <i>Queen of Jordan</i>...

484
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:02,978
Hey.

485
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:03,719
I was in the neighborhood.

486
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,203
I thought I'd pop up
and say hello.

487
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:08,707
For God sakes, D'Fwan,
I'm working.

488
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:12,094
Fine. Come here.

489
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,600
You again?

490
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:20,719
I am so sorry.
Different cord.

491
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,942
You were two hours late,
you stole all my hangers

492
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,327
and, yeah, I'm drunk.

493
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:30,361
I'm on vacation.
