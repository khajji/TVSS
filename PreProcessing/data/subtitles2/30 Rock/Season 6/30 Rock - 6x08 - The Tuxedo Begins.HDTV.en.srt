00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:59,465
Len, commissioner Kelly
and I are friends.

161
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:02,618
We have competing columns in
<i>Irish arguments weekly,</i>

162
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,753
America's only
all-caps magazine,

163
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,582
but Ray hasn't returned
my phone call,

164
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,791
and I know that you were
once a police officer.

165
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:10,659
I was part of
a special task force

166
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:13,695
of very young-looking cops
who infiltrated high schools.

167
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,949
How do you do, fellow kids?

168
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,200
What?

169
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:19,701
So I'm glad you called me,
Mr. Donaghy.

170
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:22,287
I checked with my contacts
on the force

171
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:23,972
and got you this
free pamphlet.

172
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,041
Len, I don't want a pamphlet.

173
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:27,543
I want a show of force.

174
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:30,245
A demonstration of who's
in control of this city.

175
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,014
I want a cop on every corner.

176
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,882
Look,
that's not gonna happen.

177
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:35,184
It's just one mugging.

178
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:36,585
Wait a second.

179
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,653
Where did you get that suit?

180
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:38,971
I'm not embarrassed.

181
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,390
I get all my outfits
at Ann Taylor loft.

182
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:43,125
Their clothes fit
my body and my budget.

183
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,726
Exactly, budget.

184
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:46,395
You have no interest
in helping me.

185
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:47,496
You're one of them.

186
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,831
What do you make? 
Five figures?

187
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,699
40 grand a year.

188
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,935
But don't let the woman who's
blackmailing me know that.

189
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,270
And the police have no
interest in helping me either

190
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,973
despite the hundreds of dollars
I pay every year in taxes.

191
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,041
They think that I'm the enemy.

192
00:06:59,075 --> 00:06:59,989
We have no choice

193
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,194
but to take matters
into our own hands.

194
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:05,514
- I agree!
- You do? Oh, no!

195
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,683
[Coughing]

196
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:14,718
[Door chimes]

197
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:22,159
No, if I sneeze, I'll do it
like the president taught me.

198
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:36,540
I'm pregnant with a kitty cat.

199
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:39,576
Those are my popsicles!

200
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:46,433
[Chuckles]

201
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:53,123
Well, hello, sexy.

202
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:54,858
Hello, Paul.

203
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,393
I'm wearing
an edible nightgown.

204
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:59,296
It's breadstick flavor and it
comes with a dipping sauce.

205
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,397
[Yawns]

206
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:01,915
Oh, you poor thing.

207
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,400
You must be so tired.

208
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:04,501
Oh, no, no, no, not at all.

209
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:05,602
I have been thinking
about this night

210
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:07,754
for a long time.

211
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:11,141
[Yawns]
Uh-oh, yawns are contagious.

212
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:13,877
Like all the Thai STDs my
penis is about to give you.

213
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,812
Ooh.

214
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:20,083
Okay, well, give me five
minutes and then I'll unpack...

215
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:22,402
[Yawns]

216
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:25,238
The sex monkey
I bought in Jakarta.

217
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:26,273
Ooh.

218
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,067
What... what happened
last night?

219
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:40,587
We talked for a while
and then we fell asleep.

220
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,055
Without doing anything.

221
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,591
W... how is that possible?

222
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,059
We are Jenna and Paul.

223
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,462
Did we mix up our days
and accidentally

224
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:49,529
both roofie each other?

225
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,331
Or did we just fall asleep?

226
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,633
What like some boring,
normal, sit-com couple?

227
00:08:53,668 --> 00:08:55,836
Like, Mr. Brady
and tiger the dog?

228
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,237
Let's just think.

229
00:08:57,271 --> 00:08:59,172
We hate normal.

230
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:00,674
Normal is death.

231
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,543
But we didn't hate last night.

232
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:06,446
So, it must not
have been normal.

233
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:10,717
Paul, I think we just found
another level of sexuality.

234
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,153
It's a whole new fetish
called...

235
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,988
Both: Normalling.

236
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,691
So last night,
I napped on you

237
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,860
and you liked it,
you sick bitch.

238
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,194
Oh, yeah.

239
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:24,231
And I put that Afghan
all over you

240
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:26,833
because I thought
your feet might get chilly.

241
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,101
So chilly.

242
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,203
Oh, I just had
the sickest idea.

243
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,606
We go out as a couple
to bed, bath and beyond

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,141
and shop for home necessities.

245
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:38,211
[Whispers]
In front of everybody.

246
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:41,014
Normalling in public?
You delicious whore.

247
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,148
[Giggles]

248
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:45,352
Really, Trump?
My idea is stupid?

249
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:46,653
Well you make your
hair every morning

250
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:50,123
by sticking your head in
a cotton candy machine.

251
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,424
What are you guys doing?

252
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,260
The police can't be counted on

253
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:55,228
to protect the rich unless
they're rich too.

254
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:58,465
So we're gathering support
for a private police department

255
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,534
where the starting
salary is...

256
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:01,668
$5 million a year.

257
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:02,769
How's that going?

258
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:03,837
Slowly.

259
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:05,572
Even Tommy Hilfiger
turned me down

260
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:07,374
and you'd think that he,
of all people,

261
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,726
would understand the lower
classes can ruin something.

262
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,246
Plaxico Burress just called
our idea "poorly thought out".

263
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,165
Then hung up by
shooting his own phone.

264
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,399
This is a travesty.

265
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:19,252
The wealthy were once
the heart of New York.

266
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:20,737
I just don't understand
this city anymore.

267
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:23,640
That's funny, because I may
have just figured it out.

268
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:33,400
[Laughs]

269
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:35,051
I used to be like you,

270
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:37,487
thinking I could make the city
follow my rules.

271
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:40,556
I told off line cutters
and movie theater talkers.

272
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:41,908
And for what?

273
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:45,028
Did anyone cheer me,
or name a sandwich after me

274
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,896
that would maybe be Turkey,
pastrami, Swiss,

275
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:50,066
Russian dressing,
Cole slaw and potato chips?

276
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,903
You can't count on anyone else
in this city, Jack.

277
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:56,289
All you can do is sink down
into the filth.

278
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,307
[Clears throat]

279
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:59,342
Or rise above it.

280
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:01,144
If no one will help me,
I'll do it myself.

281
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,847
I'll remind New York
of what she once was.

282
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:06,466
Yes, a native American
paradise!

283
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:08,685
The greatest city on earth.

284
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:10,220
A city that needs a leader

285
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,855
who still believes
in order and justice.

286
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,807
Who'll shine a light
into all the tunnels

287
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:15,825
and police the police,

288
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,261
who'll make this city
into a beacon,

289
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,964
lighting the way
for an entire nation.

290
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:24,150
Anyhoo, Tracy,
in the dog boner sketch.

291

I hereby officially
announce my candidacy...

Slogan to come.

You know if we
got cloth place mats

296
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,690
then we could just
throw them in the laundry.

297
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:49,010
Well, these vinyl ones say
dishwasher safe, that's easy.

00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:51,379
Yeah, easy for the person
who never does the dishes.

What we're doing
is so sick, right?

have you climaxed?

302

be called Daryl Weenus?

Everything else
was already pornography.
