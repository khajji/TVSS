00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:49,098
when a busload
of drunk debutantes

322
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,566
tried to get on his boat.

323
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:52,351
It was named "Mr. water boat."

324
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,219
Did it sink?
Yes.

325
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,688
Because there were
too many people on it.

326
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:57,440
But the spirit of his words
lives on.

327
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:58,824
Okay, but are you sure...

328
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,559
I appreciate
your concern, Lemon.

329
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:03,279
But Avery and I don't quit.
Ever.

330
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,765
Hello, Kenneth.

331
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,533
How are things
with your new roommate?

332
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,652
Oh, are you talking
about Hazel or the raccoon

333
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,037
that won't let me
into my kitchen?

334
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:13,422
Either way,
the answer is "wonderful."

335
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:14,790
I'm talking about Hazel.

336
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,575
I know how she thinks,
Kenneth.

337
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:18,794
So I went down
to human resources,

338
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,429
turned on the old charm,

339
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:22,431
and got a copy
of the application

340
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:24,517
you submitted
to the page program.

341
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:29,188
This isn't my application.

342
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:31,190
This isn't even
my handwriting.

343
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:33,192
Do you know
whose handwriting it is?

344
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:35,027
Hazel's.

345
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:37,530
She sabotaged you
so you won't become a threat.

346
00:13:37,564 --> 00:13:41,117
And to think I thought
Hazel was a bitch!

347
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:44,620
Friendly and loyal
like a well-trained female dog.

348
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:46,622
But she isn't a bitch.

349
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:49,108
She's a meaniepants.

350
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,796
[Sighs]
This is gonna be a mess.

351
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,382
Police are reporting
that a bank on Jackson Avenue

352
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,584
was robbed this afternoon
by a lone suspect...

353
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,419
A white male in his 30s.

354
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:02,788
Security cameras caught
the getaway van heading West

355
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:03,789
towards Manhattan.

356
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,457
Nerf herder!

357
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,093
Nerf-herder!

358
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:09,311
Oh, come on, Tray.

359
00:14:09,346 --> 00:14:10,896
Are you telling me you haven't
found one person in here

360
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,231
who inspires you?

361
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,349
What about
Frederick Douglass?

362
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,801
A guy with two first names?
Next.

363
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,320
That dress belonged
to Rosa Parks.

364
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:19,572
She's one
of my personal heroes.

365
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,490
I think I found
my role model.

366
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:22,808
Good choice.

367
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:24,110
Sister Parks once said
each person must live their life

368
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:26,078
- as a model for others...
- Shut up, Dotcom.

369
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:28,330
I'm not talking about her.

370
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,366
I'm talking about me looking
funny in this reflection.

371
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,818
I'm gonna do a movie where
I play someone's fat old aunt

372
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:35,654
and I say stuff like,
"whoo-wee!"

373
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:38,624
And "sweet child,
sit yo' black ass down!"

374
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:41,343
No, Tray, that's exactly
what we're trying to avoid.

375
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:43,679
Questlove asked me
to find a role model.

376
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:45,715
I did.
It's Tyler Perry.

377
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,801
From now on,
my movies will be produced,

378
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:50,936
written, directed,
and seen exclusively

379
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:52,688
by African-Americans.

380
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,190
That's right.

381
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,559
I'm starting my own studio.

382
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:00,012
Hey.
Hey, beautiful!

383
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,314
You can't go to prison,
you idiot.

384
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:05,451
They will ravage you
and your beautiful woman face.

385
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:06,819
I'll say I did it.

386
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,154
I can handle prison.

387
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:09,905
I have a mean face
and I can will myself to sleep

388
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,457
in any environment.

389
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:13,125
Wait, what are you
talking about?

390
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,244
The heist.
They saw your van.

391
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,329
Why didn't you take out
the cameras

392
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:20,549
and kill all the witnesses,
you beautiful bastard?

393
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,752
I didn't Rob a bank, Liz.
God!

394
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:24,920
No, I sold the van
this morning...

395
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,672
To a really nice young guy
on Meth.

396
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,892
You sold Van Der Beek?
For me?

397
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:33,479
I sold Van Der Beek...
For us.

398
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:35,648
I don't wanna wait
for our lives to be over.

399
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:38,734
And now...
I can pay to redo the upstairs.

400
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,904
And I was gonna go
to prison for you.

401
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:44,056
Even when I thought
you had robbed a bank,

402
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:45,407
I wasn't gonna bail.

403
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,942
I won't bail on you!

404
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:49,061
You won't bail on me.

405
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,446
You won't bail on me.

406
00:15:50,497 --> 00:15:51,781
Have you ever had
a girlfriend

407
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,115
willing to <i>Thelma and Louise</i>
with you?

408
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,900
No. Never.

409
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:57,069
But come on, <i>Bonnie and Clyde.</i>
Okay, I'm a boy.

410
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:02,541
I'm a boy, Liz.

411
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:05,177
Also, I hear Pippa Middleton
couldn't come today

412
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:08,464
because Avery was borrowing
her ass.

413
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:12,134
[Laughs]

414
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,637
If anyone can show
just cause

415
00:16:14,688 --> 00:16:18,107
why Jack and Avery may not
be lawfully joined together,

416
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,693
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

417
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,698
[Groans]

418
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:28,433
Hey, Teresa.

419
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:33,322
I just want alereeb
to be happy.

420
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:38,327
Kim...

421
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,745
Where are you going?

422
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,947
You're the best waiter
I've ever seen.

423
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:46,051
I know, Mr. Stepanian.
I know.

424
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:49,505
Great!
So no one.

425
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:51,223
Are you people kidding me?

426
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:53,008
Seriously, no one
has anything to say?

427
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,560
You're all cowards.

428
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:57,229
He kissed my mother.

429
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,431
And she's in love
with Scott.

430
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,150
[Mouthing words]

431
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:04,320
How can you stay silent when
there's so much to object to?

432
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,938
What kind of friends are you?

433
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:08,407
I have something to say.

434
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,693
I played Avery Jessup
in "Kidnapped by danger,"

435
00:17:10,744 --> 00:17:12,278
now available
on Sega Genesis.

436
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,696
Thank you!

437
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:16,866
I forgot about the TV movie
that whitewashed our love story.

438
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,984
I was dating another woman.

439
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,836
And I wasn't ready
to get married.

440
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,421
Both:
We only did it because...

441
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:26,125
- She was pregnant.
- I was pregnant.

442
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,511
You truly are
an amazing woman, Avery.

443
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:31,213
The only thing you're bad at
is quitting.

444
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:33,465
I kept my sea monkeys alive
for 30 years.

445
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,100
We're both incapable
of failure,

446
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:36,435
so deep down we were hoping

447
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,187
someone else
would ruin it for us.

448
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:40,306
I mean, if we wanted
this thing to succeed,

449
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,391
why would we ask Liz
to officiate?

450
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:44,676
Because I'm good
at blending humor and heart?

451
00:17:45,812 --> 00:17:47,446
I'll always care for you.

452
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,199
We'll split assets
in custody equally.

453
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,151
I'll take our friends
"A" through "L."

454
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:53,786
You'll get "M" through "Z".

455
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,455
Liz, divorce us.

456
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:59,024
By the power vested in me

457
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:02,962
by the website
instaminister.Estonia,

458
00:18:02,996 --> 00:18:05,798
I now pronounce you
divorced.

459
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:11,637
[Laughing] Yeah!
Divorce!

460
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:13,839
Whoo!
[Chuckling]

461
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,758
[Applause]

462
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:20,062
[Door closes]

463
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,547
I thought
you were my friend.

464
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,984
But you were trying
to destroy me the whole time.

465
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:29,071
It started that way.

466
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:32,107
But then I fell in love
with you.

467
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,326
All you've done
is lie to me.

468
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:35,694
How can I believe you now?

469
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:38,530
Believe this.

470
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,449
Mmm!
Ah!

471
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,535
Don't you ever
do that again.

472
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:49,708
[Both moaning]

473
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:56,632
This would make a great room
for a baby.

474
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:59,418
You said, "baby,"
instead of "plant."

475
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,970
Now say, "man cave."

476
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:03,889
Never!
[Doorbell]

477
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:07,943
Wow.

478
00:19:07,978 --> 00:19:10,429
Didn't expect
to see you tonight.

479
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:11,447
In all the commotion,

480
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,597
I forgot to give you
this little...

481
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:15,901
Thank you for officiating
our event.

482
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,044
It's the remote control
holder you wanted from <i>Skymall.</i>

483
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,579
Yes! Yes!
Awesome!

484
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,631
Ah!

485
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:32,284
Ohh...
[Tools whirring]

486
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:36,121
Oh, Criss is doing
a little renovating upstairs...

487
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:38,924
Because we are thinking
about having a baby...

488
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,559
Together...

489
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:44,313
That will emerge
from my vagina.

490
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:46,482
Or a Chinese vagina.

491
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,967
Okay.

492
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:51,186
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

493
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:52,604
Wait, that's it?

494
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:54,189
You're not gonna give me
any advice?

495
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,242
I can't, Lemon.
I don't have any right to.

496
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:58,744
I've been, uh...

497
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:01,413
Divorced... twice.

498
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:02,865
Engaged two other times.

499
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,616
I'm... a mess.

500
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,086
But any child would be lucky
to have you

501
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,505
be the mother it loves
then hates for a few years,

502
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,156
then loves again,

503
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:12,925
then half-heartedly defends
to its spouse,

504
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,461
then puts in a home.

505
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,846
You don't need my advice.

506
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,549
But I still want it.

507
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,634
If you decide
to have child,

508
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:26,805
you going to make
an excellent mother...

509
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,440
As long as you follow
Jack Donaghy's

510
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,842
25 pillars of motherhood.

511
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,028
Number one,
don't overthink the names.

512
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:35,531
Stick to Kings and Queens
of England.

513
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:37,566
There will never be
a president Ashton

514
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:40,452
or a Dr. Katniss.

515
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,071
Or a non-sexually confused
Lorne.

516
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:43,655
Number two...

517
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:51,296
[Laughs]

518
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:53,854
Ah, we had a good time
tonight.

519
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:57,858
I wonder what will happen
to the gang next season.

520
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:59,860
Will Liz have a baby?

521
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:02,979
Will Jack become supreme leader
of Kabletown?

522
00:21:02,997 --> 00:21:04,164
Will Kenneth...

523
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:06,416
No, I don't care!

524
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:09,669
All I want is Jack and Liz
get together.

525
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:12,289
On <i>Friends,</i>
it was so satisfying.

526
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:15,842
They do on <i>Cheers,</i>
they do on <i>Moonlighting</i>.

527
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:17,210
Everybody do it!

528
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:19,496
Don't overthink it, writers.

529
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:21,664
Whoever you are.
