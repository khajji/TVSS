A couple months ago,

Because showing
is better than telling,

480
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:06,688
and my schedule
is light this week.

481
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:08,806
Thank you.

483
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:25,189
I never should have treated you
the way I did, Liz.

484
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:27,825
I need someone who has so little
going on in their life,

485
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,494
she lets me get
all the attention.

486
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:30,828
And I need someone in my life

487
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:32,964
who doesn't listen
to a word I say.

488
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:35,383
Thank you,
I just got it cut.

I do need you.

495
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:52,550
You had me at
"I was wrong, I do need."

496
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:53,985
I can replace just
about everything you do,

497
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:57,422
but no machine could ever
be the human wastebasket

498
00:19:57,456 --> 00:19:59,490
that I dump
my stupid mistakes into.

499
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:02,360
Dump, sir.
Dump all over me.

500
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:04,528
You thumb with a wig,

501
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,697
those gifts were supposed
to go to the 60th floor.

502
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:08,566
I'm sorry, sir.
It was all my fault.

503
00:20:08,601 --> 00:20:11,803
Good job, Jack.
Blame it on an albino.

504
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:13,871
Classic,
'cause it works.

I love you, presents!

508
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,682
Ooh.
I have that.

509
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,285
And that.

510
00:20:29,086 --> 00:20:30,405
Oh!

511
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,240
I've already got this.

Oh, my goodness.

513
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,329
I already have this.

514
00:20:38,364 --> 00:20:40,465
I definitely
don't need that.
