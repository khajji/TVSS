1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,997
Live television.

2
00:00:04,093 --> 00:00:05,192
Who cares?

3
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:07,337
Who cares? Everybody.

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:08,461
We love live TV.

5
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:09,628
Do we, Lemon?

6
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:12,130
Do you really love the
overzealous studio audience

7
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:13,515
who will applaud at anything?

8
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:17,500
Here in the greatest city on earth,
New York City, baby? Whassup?

9
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,465
Wait, what are you saying, Jack?

10
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,875
'Cause "TGS" is live.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,092
Not any more.

12
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,590
It's financially impractical.

13
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:32,234
From now on, you write and shoot
the whole season in two weeks

14
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:34,756
like "Wheel of fortune" or FOX news.

15
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:36,822
No.

16
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,075
I mean, I grew up on live TV.

17
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:40,743
In my paren't basement on a friday night.

18
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:42,476
A telethon and cheese steaks.

19
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:44,802
I can see it like it was yesterday.

20
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:52,949
Best sweet 16 ever.

21
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:56,337
I'm going to lose my
virginity in nine years.

22
00:00:57,888 --> 00:00:59,381
"TGS" has to be live

23
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:01,713
or it will lose all the
excitement and spontaneity.

24
00:01:01,886 --> 00:01:03,822
That's the beauty of live TV.

25
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:05,511
Anything can happen.

26
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,988
There's a bathroom in here

27
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:10,380
you can use, Cabletown
coworker Kim Kardashian.

28
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,935
See?

29
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:17,817
Awesome.

30
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:19,117
Yes.

31
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:20,718
But my way is cheaper,

32
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:23,026
and you only have to work
two weeks out of the year.

33
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,645
I want to go to there.

34
00:01:25,643 --> 00:01:26,394
So it's settled.

35
00:01:26,514 --> 00:01:28,788
Tonight is TGS's final live show.

36
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:29,481
What?

37
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:33,213
No, live television is
an American tradition.

38
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,426
You can't just throw it away!

39
00:01:34,546 --> 00:01:35,318
Sorry, Kenneth.

40
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:36,280
It's a done deal.

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,933
Our last live show?

42
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:40,987
No.

43
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:48,115
♪ Let's go it's a "30

s06 ep19 - Live from studio, west coast.

48
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:04,655
Sync and corrected by Sp8ky
for www.addic7ed.com.

49
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:09,518
There's a rumor spreading
around here like wildfire around here.

50
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,416
But unlike the wildfires
I've started,

51
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:13,660
this one doesn't sexually arouse me.

52
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,566
It's true, Hazel.

53
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,489
This is our last
live show but don't worry.

54
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,543
It won't affect you.

55
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,698
Unless my plan all along

56
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,414
was to run on stage during
the middle of a sketch

57
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:24,057
and get discovered by Hollywood.

58
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:32,265
Liz.

59
00:02:32,284 --> 00:02:34,139
An important me-nouncement.

60
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:36,872
Paul and I have decided
to get married.

61
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:37,942
Oh. Wow.

62
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:40,636
And I told him to propose tonight on TG.

63
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:43,021
- Absolutely not!
- You didn't let me finish.

64
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:43,660
S.

65
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,187
Come on Jenna, it's our last live show.

66
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:48,013
Exactly!

67
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:50,173
And if Jenna Maroney
is getting engaged,

68
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,994
it's going to be on live TV.

69
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:55,145
I've been working on my
reaction since I was 3.

70
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:56,563
Aaah!

71
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:05,299
It's happening, Liz.

72
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,691
Miss Lemon,

73
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:11,173
Mr. Jordan just discovered you
can get pornography on the Internet.

74
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,327
Oh, my god.

75
00:03:12,362 --> 00:03:13,667
He's going to die in there.

76
00:03:19,276 --> 00:03:20,108
What's going on?

77
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:22,028
You called a meeting, Lemon.

78
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,195
Actually, I called it.

79
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,390
Gasp!

80
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:29,671
Live television is sacred,

81
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,150
and we are not leaving this room

82
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:34,566
until the 12 of us have
agreed to defend her.

83
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:37,082
There is a great American play

84
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,660
that was first written and
performed for live television.

85
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,594
It's called "12 angry men."

86
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:44,777
No, we are not debating
this like a jury.

87
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:45,773
Shut him down, Jack.

88
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:47,979
"12 angry men" is
preposterous Kenneth.

89
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,960
11 decent Americans are swayed
by Jane Fonda's father?

90
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:52,691
Open the door.

91
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,119
How long do you think
you'll get away with this?

92
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,363
Jenna or Hazel will
notice we're missing.

93
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,382
Have an amazing show
tonight, everyone.

94
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:06,979
I love you all.

95
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,396
Tonight's the night, Hazel.

96
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,387
I do my surprise cameo

97
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:12,838
it goes viral, I take
medicine for it.

98
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,305
Next stop, Hollywood, Florida

99
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,873
to get the car from my mom.

100
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:19,389
Next stop, California,
pizza kitchen.

101
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,972
And tell my old boss, to suck it.

102
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:23,970
Next stop, Tinseltown,

103
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,984
because Christmas decorations are
really cheap this time of year.

104
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:31,641
Nothing brings our country
together like live television.

105
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:34,507
And studio 6h is
part of that tradition.

106
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:38,450
Why it was right here that NBC
broadcast the final episode

107
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,076
of the 1950s classic,

108
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,117
"The Lovebirds."

109
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,647
It's the grandpa replacement comedy hour

110
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:48,436
sponsored by Kraft Singles.

111
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,713
Made with milk, is the cheese
that won World War II. Don't ask how.

112
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:55,074
And now,
"The Lovebirds."

113
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:57,834
Starring Cubby Gilmore
and Loretta Fields.

114
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm home, baby.

115
00:05:02,588 --> 00:05:04,071
And I could eat a horse.

116
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:10,278
Don't you dare touch that
bacon till it's done, Larry.

117
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:11,912
Ooooooh.

118
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,735
Ooooo-boy.

119
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:20,764
Oh, brother,
now I'm cooking a Turkey, too.

120
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:22,275
That's rich.

121
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:25,927
One of these days, Doris, I'm
going to take a shot and blam!

122
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:27,222
Blow your face off.

123
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:30,753
It would still be
better than our honeymoon.

124
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,701
What was wrong with Niagara Falls?

125
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,010
Your mother found it chilly.

126
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:38,207
You're a real cut-up.

127
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:41,109
In fact, one of these days I'm
gonna cut you up in pieces

128
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:43,024
and feed you to the neighbor's dogs.

129
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:46,612
It will be the first time you've
taken me out for dinner in years.

130
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,307
Keep it up, Doris and bang, zoom,

131
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:54,208
I'm going to drown you in the bathtub
and say a mental patient did it.

132
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,588
Like I always say...

133
00:05:57,926 --> 00:05:59,006
Aaaaachh.

134
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:02,537
That's a funny thing to say.

135
00:06:02,657 --> 00:06:03,466
This is real.

136
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:04,743
Real heart attack.

137
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:08,183
Here, eat the bacon.

138
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,648
It'll lubricate your heart.

139
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:10,765
Ride it out.

140
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,728
Ride it to hell.

141
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,911
Come on now, Larry.
Don't be a sissy...

142
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,399
I'm having a heart attack, too.

143
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:21,296
My marriage is a sham.

144
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,235
I got syphilis from Orson Wells.

145
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:29,861
Hello

146
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,331
I'm doctor Harold Spaceman.

147
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:37,285
I'm known in the industry
as the "Gay doctor",

148
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,632
because I always have a smile on my face.

149
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,524
Because I had homosexual lovers.

150
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,870
Are you a modern woman
who is in the family way?

151
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,870
Smoke Chattertons cigarettes.

152
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,936
Your baby's lungs need refreshing
nicotine for science reasons.

153
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:56,164
And his growing bones need
tar to hold them together.

154
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:58,577
Nine out of ten doctors
surveyed said,

155
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:02,512
You have a lot of nerve calling here Spaceman,
after what you've tried on my nephew.

156
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:07,430
♪ Chattertons tastes so cool and mild

157
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,726
♪ a treat for you and
your unborn child ♪

158
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,373
Official cigarette of the
American heart association.

159
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:19,150
Jenna, remember that package

160
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:21,000
you made me take to
Singapore last summer?

161
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:23,338
I just got out of Changi prison.

162
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,657
Thank you.
Just portion control and exercise.

163
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,140
Paul!

164
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:37,586
Did you pick up the ring?

165
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,414
Liza Minnelli's baby tooth

166
00:07:39,534 --> 00:07:43,047
surrounded by rubies that passed
through a terrified Michael Kors.

167
00:07:45,345 --> 00:07:47,599
It'll look amazing on camera.

168
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:50,632
Look . I don't want
to propose on TV.

169
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,378
I want it to be private.

170
00:07:52,744 --> 00:07:53,993
What are you saying, Paul?

171
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,254
Rick Santorum is right Jenna.

172
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:59,625
Marriage is a sacred union
between a man and a woman.

173
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:02,047
Which is why I'm asking you right now

174
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:04,357
to make me the luckiest schman...

175
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:10,150
Look, I'm sorry to play the
biological woman card here,

176
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,786
but according to Roe v. Dwyane Wade,

177
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:16,232
I have a right to choose.

178
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,932
And I choose a televised proposal.

179
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:20,021
If you can't give me that,

180
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,190
I'm not sure what my answer will be.

181
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,965
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

182
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,134
Look, I am the man here, Jenna.

183
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,185
I may have a dress and a
wig and a gynecologist,

184
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,777
but I am the man.

185
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:38,949
Without live TV,

186
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,541
think of the amazing moments
we would have missed.

187
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:42,978
The moon landing.

188
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:44,039
The Beatles.

189
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,955
"The voice" results show.

190
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,827
That time Mr. Lutz was an extra

191
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:49,686
and he got so nervous he threw up.

192
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:50,804
No, don't remind him.

193
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:55,034
Oh, I had a lobster role and two yogurts.

194
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,599
And what about Joey Montero's

195
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,312
old variety show?

196
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:03,285
He was just like you, Mr. Jordan,

197
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,191
because he did not
want to rehearse

198
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:08,102
and he wanted to leave
as soon as possible.

199
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,555

Joey Montero.

You're invited too,
Deedee Stringbean

227
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,732
Bring half and half for
the morning though.

228
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:40,187
Oh, I just burped up some clams casino
which is weird because I didn't even have any.

229
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:44,531
Well, hello there glasess.

230
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:46,841
Glamour.

231
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:47,799
Excitement.

232
00:10:47,808 --> 00:10:49,733
What we today would call alcoholism.

233
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,724
Live TV had everything.

234
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,400
Well, not everything.

235
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:54,499
Where were the black people?

236
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:55,475
Oh.

237
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,607
Actually, Mr. Spurlock,

238
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:00,780
NBC had the first two black
characters on television.

239
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:01,701
Sort of.

240
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:03,674
For "Alfie and Abner," NBC hired

241
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:06,491
one African-American
and one Caucasian

242
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,228
because they thought two black
people on the same show

243
00:11:08,266 --> 00:11:09,683
would make the audience nervous.

244
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,256
A rule NBC still uses today.

245
00:11:17,696 --> 00:11:19,893
Abner, I'm home from work.

246
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:21,292
Where are you, my brother?

247
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:24,467
Here I is, Alfie.

248
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,077
Oh, hell no. I am not doing this.

249
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,465
NBC received a lot
of complaints...

250
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:39,188
That the show wasn't on often enough.

251
00:11:39,308 --> 00:11:42,333
So they forced Theodore Freeman
to honor his contract.

252
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,389
Alfie, I's done stole this catfish.

253
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:49,741
Sir, I am asking
you as a human being

254
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:52,042
so please stop talking like that.

255
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:55,382
I's gonna eat it
till I'm bellyful.

256
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:58,678
This is debasing to both of us.

257
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,772
I was a tuskegee airman.

258
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:03,549
Zip-a-Dee-goo-goo.

259
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:05,323
You may anger me,

260
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:08,168
but I believe nonviolence
is the path to change.

261
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,511
And I believes you can
catch a rainbow in your hat.

262
00:12:11,717 --> 00:12:13,519
I'll kill you, you ignorant...

263
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:19,577
believe it or not, they
did not stop doing the show,

264
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,967
which made for tense
but thrilling live TV.

265
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,343
Banjo...

266
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:41,340
Kenneth.

267
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:43,357
I've frankly lost track

268
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:44,692
of what you were trying
to convince us of

269
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,974
with these detailed descriptions
of TV shows.

270
00:12:47,464 --> 00:12:48,582
Thank you.

271
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:49,906
Come on Kenneth.

272
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,629
Times change.
Television replaced radio.

273
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,943
Cars replaced horses.

274
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:55,925
Not where I'm from.

275
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:59,683
Are you telling me the mayor
of your hometown is a car?

276
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,828
Pretty weird.

277
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,237
Why are you laughing at me?

278
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:07,316
Okay.
Let's all take a little break.

279
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:13,166
Hello.
I'm test tube adult doctor Leo Speceman.

280
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:16,349
Did your mother smoke Chatterton
cigarettes while pregnant

281
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:18,622
during the 1950s or 60s?

282
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:21,323
If she did, you
probably can't hear me

283
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,858
because of fetal
Chatterton syndrome.

284
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:25,999
Turn up the volume!

285
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,620
Recent studies have shown that

286
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:30,666
while pregnancy is disgusting,

287
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:33,652
babies do not need tar or nicotine.

288
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,821
If you are currently suffering
from Chatterton syndrome,

289
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,389
clap your feet, until your service
monkey dials the number below.

290
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:44,211
Then use the rectum you have
instead of a mouth

291
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:46,488
to say something like "wrulgh" or

292
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,423
"thunghth"

293
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:52,648
to signify that you wish to join a
class action suit against Chattertons.

294
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:56,796
♪ If your mother smokend Chattertons

295
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:59,942
♪ your sexual organs are covered in bone.

296
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,606
Oh, my God, Kenneth.

297
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:06,461
It's my period.

298
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,850
It's a-gonna blow.

299
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,691
We both know you're not
due for another nine days.

300
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,684
And I'm ashamed of you, Ms. Lemon.

301
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:18,219
Think about your hero,
Rosemary Howard.

302
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,201
She wrote for the edgiest live
variety show of all time,

303
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,717
"The Gruber Brother and Nipsey."

304
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,514
Hey, Nipsey, what do you get when you cross
a lady driver with a with a Vietcong

305
00:14:31,533 --> 00:14:32,688
I don't know, Dickie.

306
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,542
What do you get when you cross
a lady driver with a Vietcong?

307
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:38,527
A hundreed thousands senseless dents.

308
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:39,841
Do it to it.

309
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:42,762
Do it to it.

310
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,325
Do it to it.

311
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,119
Do it to it.

312
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,331
Now, as you know, Nipsey...

313
00:14:52,368 --> 00:14:54,274
I'm the first streaker.

314
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,471
Streaking's the new thing.

315
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:58,715
We touched penises.

316
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:04,339
We interrupt this program to bring
you an NBC news special report.

317
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:05,813
From Rockefeller center,

318
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,457
Chet Huntley and David Brinkley.

319
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:09,836
Good evening.

320
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:15,695
NBC news has learned that
less than an hour ago

321
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,456
there was an explosion aboard
the Apollo 13 spacecraft.

322
00:15:18,576 --> 00:15:20,419
- David?
- Thank you, Chet.

323
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:21,151
Chet?

324
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,072
Thank you, David.

325
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:25,339
We are awaiting further information.
David?

326
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:26,494
Thank you, Chet.

327
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,522
Let's go to the manned
space center in Houston

328
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,990
and our reporter on the scene, Mr.
Jamie Garnett.

329
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,732
Jamie?

330
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,816
Thank you, Chet and David.

331
00:15:34,936 --> 00:15:38,065
I'm sorry, sweetheart, could you
move out of the way of our camera?

332
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,349
We need to talk to our new
reporter there, Jamie Garnett.

333
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:42,054
Now, where is he?

334
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:43,725
I'm Jamie Garnett, gentlemen.

335
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:46,795
I spoke earlier with NASA
flight director Glynn Lunney...

336
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:48,920
Listen, doll, you're
not making any sense.

337
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,291
You're probably hysterical
from menstruation.

338
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,014
Go lie down and make sure
you get plenty of iron.

339
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,394
Maybe eat a ham salad...

340
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:59,684
Also I'm being told that
commander James Lovell...

341
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,049
Honey, you have a dynamite shape,

342
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,243
but you're going to have to shut up

343
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,848
and let a man tell
us what's happening.

344
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,926
Now, is your father or
a policeman nearby?

345
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,214
Now, where did you find
that microphone, sugar mouth?

346
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,497
Was it just lying
there on the ground?

347
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,194
Where is Jamie Garnett?

348
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,470
This just in, the NBC male news
reporter Jamie Garnett is missing.

349
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,534
I'm right here you mother...

350
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:27,970
Classic live television.

351
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:32,348
And while they never
found Jamie Garnett,

352
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:36,002
that woman who stole his
microphone went on to become

353
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:37,301
a wife.

354
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:41,587
Has Paul not come back?
He's not answering his phone.

355
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,565
What have I done?

356
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:44,161
Calm down.
Paul's gone,

357
00:16:44,162 --> 00:16:46,355
but you're getting proposed
to on the show tonight.

358
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:47,724
By me.

359
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:49,518
This is New York state bitch,

360
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:50,740
anyone can marry anything now.

361
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:53,166
What?
But...

362
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:55,905
Oh come on, think what
great TV this will be.

363
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:57,314
It's everything you want.

364
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,255
No, it's not.

365
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,593
Paul is everything I want.

366
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:03,593
He's the reason to get married,

367
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:04,898
not TV.

368
00:17:05,362 --> 00:17:07,015
Rick Santorum was right.

369
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,874
How could I have been so blind?

370
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,630
Because you're a horrible person.

371
00:17:10,827 --> 00:17:14,254
Thank you.
Just portion control and lots of water.

372
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:21,361
All in favor of
keeping "TGS" live?

373
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:25,343
It's still not unanimous.
And it never will be.

374
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,783
This is a business, Kenneth, and

375
00:17:26,903 --> 00:17:28,323
if live TV went away,

376
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,093
the only thing that would change
would be NBC's profit margin.

377
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:33,102
That's not true, Jackie D.

378
00:17:33,628 --> 00:17:35,741
Live TV changed my life.

379
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,444
In 1986 my church dance crew

380
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:40,266
performed on a regional telethon.

381
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:41,871
It was my big break.

382
00:17:42,341 --> 00:17:43,299
Flashback.

383
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:50,161
This is for you, Jesus.

384
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,583
♪

385
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,189
Ow, my coccyx!

386
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:01,828
It's not funny.

387
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,795
Coccyx is the scientific
term for your butt bone.

388
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:08,235
Why are you all laughing?

389
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:11,897
I like it.

390
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,049
Coccyx.

391
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:15,448
Coccyx.

392
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:17,270
Hey, what do you call this?

393
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,392
This is the garry-o-many core.

394
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,083
Oh, my God.

395
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:28,392
I remember that.

396
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:29,434
That was you?

397
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:32,194
That's when I realized
I was a ridiculous man.

398
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:34,518
Tracy, I was there.

399
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:36,640
As a lower-level GE employee,

400
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:38,668
I was answering phones
at that telethon.

401
00:18:38,788 --> 00:18:40,077
When you took off your clothes,

402
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:41,617
they cut to the phone banks.

403
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:42,514
Gasp.

404
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,648
I made a hilarious prank call

405
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:46,479
to that telethon.

406
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:48,206
Wait, did the man who answered

407
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:50,929
sound like he had the piercing
blue eyes of an ice dragon?

408
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:52,095
Yes.

409
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,701
Hello, I'd like to speak
to General Electric.

410
00:18:58,931 --> 00:18:59,616
Madam,

411
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:05,749
I'm afraid you're confused.

412
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:07,993
I was a nurse in the war

413
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,978
and I met him when he
was just a colonel.

414
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:12,885
He's the father of my child.

415
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,826
General Electric is not a person.

416
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:19,178
Toby, come talk to your father.

417
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:23,065
Daddy, it's your
son, Toby Electric.

418
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,282
Alright, whoever this is,

419
00:19:26,402 --> 00:19:29,568
no one, no one jokes down General Electric.

420
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,756
Yeah, except your mom last night.

421
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:35,464
If I ever get my thick,

422
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,503
manly hands on you,

423
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,358
I will roast you alive in
an oven I design myself,

424
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,428
using two, no, three kinds of heat.

425
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:56,552
I'm Jack Donaghy, damn it.

426
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:02,927
Watching you get
all red-faced on TV,

427
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:04,740
that was the night I
found my calling...

428
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,405
Sticking it to the man.

429
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:09,644
You know what?
That night changed my life, too.

430
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:11,146
Don Geiss saw my

431
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:13,297
loyalty/handsomeness and the next day

432
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:15,879
he promoted me out of poisons
and into microwaves.

433
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:19,851
Live TV made us all
what we are today.

434
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:21,635
No need to take another vote.

435
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:23,203
"TGS" is meant to be live.

436
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,105
To make it more profitable,

437
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,715
we'll just do more sponsor
product placements

438
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,052
you should do it with the
upcoming Warner Brothers movie,

439
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,278
"Rock of ages," based on
the hit Broadway musical.

440
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:33,390
Rocking a theater near you June 15th.

441
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,818
Tom Cruise sings.

442
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,642
Or I'll just pay you all less.

443
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:41,153
Kenneth, let us out of here.

444
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,195
Paul didn't come.

445
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,951
I ruined everything.

446
00:20:53,071 --> 00:20:54,134
Yeah, you blew it.

447
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,561
So I'll just jump out at some
point and lez it up with you?

448
00:20:58,147 --> 00:20:59,387
Okay.

449
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:02,382
We're on in five, four,

450
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,607
three, krang...

451
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:10,243
And now, "Prince William and Prince
time travelling fart detectives".

452
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,543
Ha, take that, The Man!

453
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:16,378
Prince, do you smell
something fishy?

454
00:21:16,406 --> 00:21:17,730
Who's that dude?

455
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,246
♪ Zou bisou bisou ♪

456
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:25,480

458
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:38,665
Jenna Maroney, you're the
woman I want to grow old with.

459
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,867
"Old" being an acronym
for oxylaprodexatrin,

460
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:45,874
a hallucinogenic plant extract
that makes sex terrifying.

461
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:49,648
I want to spend the rest of
my life making you happy.

462
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,606
That's why I'm asking you,
on TV, to marry me.

463
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,822
Oh, Paul.

464
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,916
No, no, a million times no.

465
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:02,079
Not like this.

466
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:04,605
I was wrong. You were right.

467
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,784
I don't want to get
married for publicity.

468
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:08,680
I want to get married for you.

469
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,507
And so you can't testify
against me in court.

470
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,279
I still don't know
what's going on.

471
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,006
Wow.

472
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:27,691
Wow, 2.5 million people just saw that.

473
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:30,109
And now 14 million people saw it.

474
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:32,767
You're welcome, oh and also
I broke your toilet.

475
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:44,880
Thank you to Lorne Michaels,
Jon Hamm, Kim Kardashian,

476
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:48,307
Brian Williams, Jimmy Fallon, Amy
Poehler, Fred Armisen...

477
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:57,733
SNL crew, I love you,
30 ROCK crew, I love you.

478
00:22:57,853 --> 00:22:59,264
Watch "Parks and Rec" tonight

479
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:01,189
