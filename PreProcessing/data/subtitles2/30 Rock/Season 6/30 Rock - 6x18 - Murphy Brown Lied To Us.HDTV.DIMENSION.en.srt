- what?
- My kindergarten teacher

4
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:08,883
was a former black panther.

5
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:09,761
Oh.

6
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:12,363
Hey, I'm gonna fix that
loose baseboard upstairs.

7
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,398
Wow, look at you,

8
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:14,933
all sweaty with your tool belt

9
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:16,334
and your '90s haircut.

10
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:17,803
You look like
you're in a gay porno.

11
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,938
Oh, yeah?
You're one to talk, buddy.

12
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,005
I'm Brent.

13
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:22,439
I'm the new guy on the crew.

14
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:24,575
I'm Rod.
I'm the boss.

15
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:28,045
And what I say goes.

16
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:30,414
I've never been
with a man before.

17
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:33,617
Looks like
I'm the boss now... Rod.

18
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:35,352
- Oh! What are we doing?
- I don't know.

19
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,254
Whatever! Let's wrestle!
It doesn't matter.

20
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,125
Liz, what is "adoption stuff"?

21
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:44,894
- Are you adopting a kid?
- No. Don't worry.

22
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,963
That's from a long time ago.
It's not happening.

23
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:50,700
You have a baby name book,
and you circled Adolf?

24
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:52,068
Actually, I borrowed that book
from my mother,

25
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,535
so be glad I'm not a boy.

26
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,739
Okay, well,
why'd you give up on it?

27
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,440
I have to work late tonight.

28
00:00:58,507 --> 00:01:00,408
What am I gonna do with Joshua?

29
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,410
I thought I could do this
by myself.

30
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:03,411
You know what?

31
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,313
Murphy brown lied to us.

32
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:06,381
She had Eldin.

33
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,751
Can you hold that, please?

34
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:10,752
You closed the door on her?

35
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,053
The point, Criss,

36
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:13,287
is I didn't want
to be that woman.

37
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:14,655
I didn't want to do it alone.

38
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:15,957
But let's face it.

39
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:17,358
Murphy Brown had
the whole <i>fyi</i> gang

40
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,492
in her corner...

41
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,394
Jim Dial, Frank Fontana, Corky,

42
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,929
even Miles, in his own way.

43
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:23,231
Yeah, but you're not alone now,

44
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,900
and if a kid is something
that you still want,

45
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:27,968
and you're in your 40s,

46
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:30,436
then...
We should...

47
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:31,638
we should have a...
we should have

48
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:33,273
a serious conversation
right now.

49
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,341
Oh, my God, relax.

50
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,110
This is my life, and I love it.

51
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:38,812
I've got my job,
and I've got you,

52
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,180
and I keep getting
my neighbor<i>allure</i> magazine.

53
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,783
If there's anything that needs
fixing in my life,

54
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,417
it's a certain loose baseboard.

55
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:49,421
Okay, well, I'm gonna fix it.

56
00:01:49,489 --> 00:01:50,956
And do not send Brent up there.

57
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:52,175
I won't.

58
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:56,232
Dude, I'm back

59
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,163
from the hardware store.

Sync and corrections by Sp8ky for
www.Addic7ed.Com

61
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:20,717
this country's taken
some hits lately.

62
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:22,953
But when we get hit
and are down,

63
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,822
we don't stay down.

64
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:26,857
We get up, and we hit back

65
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:29,692
with our fists
or our nunchakus.

66
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,962
And then, when we're done
hitting and we're tired,

67
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,364
'cause nunchaku-ing
can wear a guy out,

68
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,000
we sit down on a couch,

69
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,002
an American couch...

70
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,038
A Kouchtown couch.

71
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:45,874
Damn.

72
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,643
Lemon, do you know
you are sitting

73
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,378
on 5,000 new jobs?

74
00:02:50,446 --> 00:02:53,348
And not jobs that came
from some government bailout.

75
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,984
They came
from a rich white guy.

76
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,453
We have been creating and
solving this country's pRoblems

77
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,421
for 200 years.

78
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:02,022
Where's our history month?

79
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,023
It is a nice couch.

80
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:04,925
Good lumbar support.

81
00:03:04,993 --> 00:03:06,861
Absorbent fabric for nap drool.

82
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:07,895
That's just the prototype.

83
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:09,463
As we speak,
our fellow countrymen

84
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,031
are rolling the new
Kabletown couches

85
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,333
off the assembly line,

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,301
earning an honest day's pay

87
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:16,870
so they can go to the store
and buy milk for their families,

88
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:18,738
which costs...

89
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:21,941
I don't know, $90 a gallon?

90
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:24,443
I'm meeting
with the vendors tomorrow,

91
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:26,712
Raymour and his
conjoined twin, Flanigan.

92
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,115
Ashley of Ashley furniture
will be there,

93
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:32,585
and he is a genitally
androgynous pinhead.

94
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:33,752
Hmm.

95
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,887
It's a colorful industry

96
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:37,192
with a lot of fun characters.

97
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:39,724
Well, good luck fixing America.

98
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:43,579
I hope success
isn't far, far away.

99
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,230
What about<i>star wars</i>
<i>do you want to say, lemon?</i>

100
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:46,431
Let's just get to it.

101
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:47,799
I did some spring cleaning
this morning,

102
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:51,135
and I found this
baby princess Leia costume

103
00:03:51,203 --> 00:03:52,803
that I bought years ago,

104
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:53,825
and I thought
it might fit Liddy.

105
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,806
Oh, thank you, lemon.

106
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:58,042
It might be a bit small
by Halloween.

107
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,510
Halloween?
A girl can wear this anywhere.

108
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:02,246
School, church,
alone on the playground,

109
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:03,647
a child therapist's office.

110
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:05,882
Also, I thought you might want

111
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,052
this Nixon biography that my dad
gave me for my birthday.

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,486
It had just come out,

113
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,847
so as a joke,
my dad signed it as Nixon.

114
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,657
Yes, a joke.

115
00:04:14,725 --> 00:04:16,659
Nixon's been dead
almost 20 years,

116
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:19,329
not in cryogenic hibernation,

117
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:22,164
resting up for 2016.

118
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:23,432
I'm getting rid of all my junk

119
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:25,267
so Criss can redo the upstairs.

120
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:26,936
Wow, you two
are really nesting.

121
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,270
Yeah, all that's missing

122
00:04:28,338 --> 00:04:30,739
is the joint
answering machine message.

123
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:31,773
I'm thinking Sonny and...

124
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:33,575
Cher.

125
00:04:33,643 --> 00:04:35,477
Lemon, I know
how this will be received,

126
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,178
but before it's too late,

127
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:38,779
let me set you up with someone.

128
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,315
Oh, my God.
Come on, Jack.

129
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:42,350
My colleague is newly single.
His name is Kevin.

130
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,651
I'm gonna stop you at Kevin.

131
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,987
Has anyone ever known
a good person named Kevin?

132
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:48,089
Kevin garnett
helped me move once.

133
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,154
I'm good, thanks.

134
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:51,792
Kevin costner cooked me dinner
after a bad breakup.

135
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,794
Kevin Sorbo intRoduced me
to his podiatrist.

136
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,531
This is an outrage.

137
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,367
I didn't get to work
an hour late

138
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,868
just to be the first one here.

139
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:04,004
I'm sorry, tray.
I don't know where Jenna is.

140
00:05:04,072 --> 00:05:05,205
I'm sorry I'm late.

141
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:07,640
I was busy burning down
the panda express

142
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,041
that I had fallen in love with.

143
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,777
Oh, my God, Jenna.
Are you okay?

144
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,045
I'm fine, Liz.

145
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,147
I'm just having
a celebrity breakdown.

146
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,715
It's the new sex tape.

147
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,285
Something I wish I'd known
before I released my sex tape

148
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,486
with the six flags guy.

149
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,355
- So this is just for attention?
- Exactly.

150
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,056
Anyone who's anyone
has had a breakdown.

151
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,824
"Da-mi", "de-mi",
Heather, Lindsay,

152
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:28,360
Britney, Muammar...

153
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:30,528
so sad.
A life cut short.

154
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,064
He gave the best diamonds.
Okay, good.

155
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,466
I thought maybe you were
really losing it,

156
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,334
because, you know,
Paul's with someone else and...

157
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,870
oh, no.
This is for Paul.

158
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:40,205
You see,
when you have a breakdown,

159
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,006
all your old lovers
come out of the woodwork.

160
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,575
Justin and K-fed,
Bruce and Ashton,

161
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:47,244
Samantha Ronson
and Herbie the Lovebug.

162
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,013
This is how I get Paul back.

163
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,848
Wow, that is idiotic.

164
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,183
But as long as it
doesn't affect work...

165
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,786
what's that, celestia?
All right.

166
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:57,093
I'll do it.

167
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,731
Mr. Donaghy, hi.

168
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,032
I'm Stewart der.

169
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,767
I'm the chief engineer
here at Kouchtown.

170
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,468
Do you know the history
of this building, Stewart?

171
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,604
During world war ii,
the Bazooka Joe corporation

172
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,773
used a softer version
of their gum

173
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:20,475
to make armor-piercing
bullets... Here.

174
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:23,278
Years later,
the government took it over.

175
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:24,947
They turned it
into a training facility

176
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:27,449
for single mothers
to teach illegal immigrants

177
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,384
how to fill out
unemployment forms.

178
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:31,252
But then we took it back.

179
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,155
Ah, good morning,
fellow patriots.

180
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:35,289
Keep voting republican.

181
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,324
We've got your back.

182
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:38,927
Now let me have a look

183
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:41,395
at this marvel
of American industry.

184
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:45,066
Good God!

185
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,600
This doesn't look
like the prototype.

186
00:06:46,668 --> 00:06:47,668
Looks more like the prototype

187
00:06:47,735 --> 00:06:49,536
than most things in this world.

188
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:50,604
How could this happen?

189
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:52,405
The one in my office
was perfect.

190
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:54,274
Oh, we didn't make
the prototype.

191
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:56,009
We bought it at west elm.

192
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:58,439
Besides you,
whom do I fire for this?

193
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,080
I don't know. You?

194
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:01,647
I mean, you're the one
who insisted on hiring

195
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,148
American engineers.

196
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,417
All they teach us now is
how to build rollercoasters

197
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:06,852
and <i>survivor</i> challenges.

198
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,089
This is what we've been
making for the past month?

199
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:11,791
We have 10,000 of these?

200
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,159
I wouldn't know.
I'm not a math guy, really.

201
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:16,361
This is only a setback.

202
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:18,663
I just have to create a market
for terrible couches.

203
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:22,067
Besides, what did
Theodore "Bazooka" Joe do

204
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:23,668
when his eccentric
millionaire father

205
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,237
left him nothing
but a tiny pink rock quarry?

206
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:30,308
He baked those rocks
and sold them to children.

207
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,644
As gum.

208
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,715
Tracy, I need your input.

209
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:40,050
I cannot give it to you.
I'm a married man.

210
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,283
But more importantly,

211
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,952
I find you very unattractive.

212
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,954
No, I need your advice.

213
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,489
I'm having
a celebrity breakdown.

214
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:48,124
I've been there, j-mo.

215
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:49,325
What's the matter?

216
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,094
Partying too hard
with Christian slater?

217
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:53,529
Furious about Nafta?
Y2k panic?

218
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:55,231
My heyday was the '90s.

219
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:57,232
No, Tracy, I'm faking it

220
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,234
to get Paul to come back
and take care of me.

221
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,103
Fake breakdown.

222
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,085
Interesting.

223
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:04,172
I thought next I'd go nuts
on the<i>today</i>show,

224
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,174
really blow it out.
Jenna!

225
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:09,048
Did Hamlet start the play
by stabbing people?

226
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:09,978
No.

227
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:12,980
He started by being boring
and ruining my anniversary,

228
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:14,849
'cause Angie wanted
to take advantage

229
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,784
of "all the great theatre
in New York".

230
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,185
Okay, I get it.

231
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:20,121
You have to build
to the big breakdown,

232
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:22,456
like in
a c+c music factory song.

233
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:24,224
My heyday was also the '90s.

234
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:25,993
So what have you done so far?

235
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,494
Well, I've acted crazy at work.

236
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:29,529
And I think this blind item
in the <i>post</i>

237
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,997
is about me.

238
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,832
"What teenage a-lister..."

239
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,901
get serious!

240
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:36,536
We have work to do.

241
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:39,338
Hey, want to watch <i>Mythbusters?</i>

242
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:40,774
Mm. Can we have sex after?

243
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,475
'Cause those guys always put
fuel in my tank.

244
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:48,480
Who is
cigarfan@nbcuni.Com?

245
00:08:48,548 --> 00:08:51,616
"Avail 4 java<i>manana per Jack.</i>

246
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,504
Deets 2 follow. Kev"

247
00:08:53,624 --> 00:08:54,753
who is kev?

248
00:08:54,821 --> 00:08:58,037
Oh, my God.
He gave him my email?

249
00:08:58,056 --> 00:08:58,657
Who gave who your email?

250
00:08:58,725 --> 00:08:59,892
Okay, I know you're not
gonna be threatened

251
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,092
or jealous about this.

252
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,727
'Cause I got it going on?

253
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:03,728
Jack is trying to set me up

254
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,029
with some d-bag
he works with.

255
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,298
"Sent from one of
my four iPads"?

256
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:08,833
This guy sounds amazing.

257
00:09:08,901 --> 00:09:10,267
Obviously, I'm not going.

258
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:12,970
Let me just write him back
in his language.

259
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:15,684
"Broseph.
Sor-sor on the haps..."

260
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,540
no, you know what?
You should go.

261
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:18,902
What, are you kidding?

262
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:19,609
No, if you don't go,

263
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:20,744
you're not gonna be able
to tell Jack

264
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:21,945
how wrong he is.

265
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:23,814
If you do go just have coffee
with this guy,

266
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,481
maybe Jack will shut up,

267
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:27,084
and I'll finally get
the acceptance

268
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:29,285
that, you know,
every 39-year-old man craves

269
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,620
from his girlfriend's boss.

270
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:32,155
I do like telling Jack
when he's wrong.

271
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:34,523
And maybe Kevin
will insist on paying,

272
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:37,459
and I can get a jazz cd
and a ham sandwich.

273
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,863
"Dudely, let's make coffee
our bitch."

274
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:48,763
When did we get so soft?

275
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,070
You know what this country
used to sit on?

276
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:52,338
Logs.

277
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,606
Girders.

278
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:54,607
Poles.

279
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:56,242
Being comfortable?

280
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:00,212
That's not what America's
all about.

281
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,149
Kouchtown.
Sit down or get out of the way.

282
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:05,751
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

283
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,152
Help, I can't move.

284
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,722
Tell me, can you even look
at the television?

285
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,257
I can see the floor.

286
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:14,258
I can see the veins
behind my eyes.

287
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,193
Oh! I can see pain!

288
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,361
Come.

289
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,396
My whole body is asleep.
Oh!

290
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:21,298
That's a bad couch, Jack.

291
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,299
It is unfortunate.

292
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,235
The design forces the sitter

293
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:26,303
into what Israeli
military interrogators call

294
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,839
a stress position.

295
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:29,839
Oh.

296
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:31,440
It cuts off circulation
to the legs

297
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,843
while simultaneously
spreading out the ribcage,

298
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:35,522
making it difficult to breathe

299
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:38,114
while the body begs
for oxygenated blood.

300
00:10:38,182 --> 00:10:40,049
It comes in espresso,
dandelion,

301
00:10:40,117 --> 00:10:42,451
putty, and,
as you see here, lagoon.

302
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,888
So you're gonna just try
to sell discomfort?

303
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,155
I don't have a choice.

304
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:47,355
If I blow this,

305
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,891
Hank hooper will never give me
another shot.

306
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,059
I'll spend the rest of my career
behind this desk

307
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,828
trying to lure alf
back to television.

308
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:54,129
Okay, Jack.

309
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,731
Well, I'm gonna go meet
your buddy Kevin now.

310
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,667
Yes, he mentioned
you were getting together.

311
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,402
And you certainly are
dressed to impress.

312
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:01,770
You look like
a substitute teacher

313
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:03,370
who just got
her one-year a.A. Chip.

314
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,639
Well, I'm just doing this
as a formality, Jack.

315
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,648
Lemon, I know
you don't trust me,

316
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,676
but keep an open mind.

317
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:10,278
I'll do my best,
but I watched, like,

318
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,846
thr<i>Mythbusters</i> last night,

319
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,849
so I'm pretty exhausted,
if you know what I mean.

320
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:19,853
Our next guest has had
a troubling 24 hours

321
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:21,321
that has the tabloids talking

322
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:25,258
and her friends... Concerned.

323
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:26,392
Let's take a look.

324
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
Thank you.

325
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:28,895
Dhanalakshmi,
I'm happy for you,

326
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:30,663
and I'm gonna let you finish,
but I just gotta say,

327
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,465
Gurubarath Kurrupuswami spelled

328
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,000
one of the toughest words
of all time!

329
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,668
That's yesterday afternoon.

330
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:38,237
Here you are
earlier this morning

331
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:42,774
being asked to leave
dick Cavett's birthday party.

332
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:44,710
That's unfortunate.

333
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:48,881
Then a kleptomania relapse
ending in orgasm and arrest.

334
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,316
Wow, Jenna Maroney
has gone crazy.

335
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:53,751
She sure has,
said the second guy.

336
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:55,753
Jenna, I know a lot of people
are asking,

337
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,288
are you okay?

338
00:11:57,356 --> 00:11:59,357
Matthew, I'd really prefer
to just talk

339
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:01,125
about my upcoming project.

340
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:04,729
Me running through that window.

341
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,597
Aah!

342
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,667
Right this way, folks.

343
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,135
Mr. Donaghy will be with you
in just a moment.

344
00:12:12,203 --> 00:12:13,471
I'm so sorry.

345
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:15,272
Where I'm from,
Uncle Sam's mouth is sewn up,

346
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,576
and then he's set on fire,
so I don't know how he talks.

347
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,983
Greetings, gentlemen

348
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,718
and female eunuchs
of the furniture industry.

349
00:12:28,786 --> 00:12:32,622
I give you a new couch
for a new era,

350
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,259
designed and manufactured in...

351
00:12:35,326 --> 00:12:36,860
America.

352
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,450
It's a simple couch.

353
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,695
Oh, good God, my leg!

354
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,163
I can hack it.

355
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,398
Pain is in the mind.

356
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:43,599
Oh, sweet heaven.

357
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,451
It's like I'm full
of lightning.

358
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,765
Jack, it's Ethan Allen.

359
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:47,536
Are you all right?

360
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:48,670
What do you want to know?

361
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:49,872
I'll tell you anything
to make it stop.

362
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,241
You want secrets?
I'll give you secrets.

363
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,543
This couch...
Is a failure.

364
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:55,877
I hate golf.

365
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,812
One time in college,
I smoked a clove cigarette.

366
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,681
I keep buying candles as gifts
and keeping them for myself.

367
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:03,218
My natural hair color
is bright red.

368
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:04,386
Agh!

369
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:05,520
Amateur hour.

370
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:07,088
Ugh!

371
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:08,290
Agh.

372
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:09,824
Good luck finding
someone stupid enough

373
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,325
to buy those couches, Donaghy.

374
00:13:11,393 --> 00:13:13,326
Everybody loCate your buddy,

375
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:15,463
and let's make our way
to the subway.

376
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,566
I'm sorry, sir.

377
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:23,804
If I could buy your couches,
I would.

378
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,980
You know,
that's exactly what you'll do.

379
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:27,340
Okay.

380
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,642
And will you accept dancing
as money?

381
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,510
Kenneth.

382
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,647
Drag me to my office.

383
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,650
Agh!

384
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:44,656
I issued a statement
on your behalf using Twitter.

385
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,558
A media-savvy crackhead,
I know.

386
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,893
I said that you were being
treated for exhaustion

387
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,528
and that you wanted
to thank your fans

388
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,763
for all their support,

389
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,167
and also, you saw Tracy Jordan
do 11 pushups.

390
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,734
I just hope this works.

391
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,070
Well, some of your
former loved ones

392
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,236
are already here.

393
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,707
David Blaine.

394
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,909
I can see that you're
on a skateboard, David.

395
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,847
This is why we broke up, Jenna.

396
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,749
I know we only spent
one night together.

397
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,685
I don't know
what you're talking about.

398
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,619
That never happened.
Sure it did.

399
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,188
I ate a pizza slice
off your back.

400
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,123
At one point,
your veneers fell off,

401
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:21,291
and you had
these little baby fangs.

402
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,126
Thank you, Frank.

403
00:14:23,194 --> 00:14:25,228
It feels like only yesterday

404
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,963
you were in my gym class,
Jenna.

405
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:29,532
Now, you weren't the only
student I dated,

406
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,436
but you were the only one
who shot my wife.

407
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,438
Jmo, these are
from Mickey Rourke.

408
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:38,040
No! Tracy, put them down!

409
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,117
I don't know.

410
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:50,985
Maybe 'cause I'm
a season ticket holder?

411
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:52,920
Hi, you must be kevi...

412
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,456
no. No, let me fin...

413
00:14:55,524 --> 00:14:56,491
let me finish.

414
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:57,625
- Are you...
- He's my dad.

415
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,727
It's "take your daughter
to work" day,

416
00:14:59,794 --> 00:15:01,996
which I object to
on feminist grounds.

417
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:03,163
It's patronizing.

418
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:04,731
Like girls don't know
what jobs are.

419
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:05,899
I'm Liz, by the way.

420
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:07,634
I'm Catherine,
but everyone calls me Cat.

421
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:09,336
Although I'm trying to get
people at school

422
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:11,670
to call me scout,
like in <i>to kill a mockingbird.</i>

423
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:12,804
I love that book.

424
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,573
I had my first crush
on a shop teacher

425
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:16,342
who looked
just like Boo Radley.

426
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,245
Yeah, scout's not getting
much traction, though.

427
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:20,413
Well, it's hard
to force a nickname.

428
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,680
I tried to get
my high school tennis team

429
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:22,948
to call me ace,

430
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:24,616
but they wanted to call me
shorts accident.

431
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:27,085
So we settled on supervirgin.

432
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:28,553
Okay, so I might not get scout,

433
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,156
but I can negotiate up
from puked in thermos.

434
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,224
Well, then,
let me ask you this.

435
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,959
Would Jeremy lin be willing

436
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:37,995
to videotape a message
for my buddy's bachelor party?

437
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:40,098
Ugh.

438
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
Sorry. She's with me.

439
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,133
It's "take your daughter
to work" day,

440
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,135
and Kabletown's really
into all this family shiz.

441
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,770
So what have you learned today?

442
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:49,339
That people who talk
the most in meetings

443
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,374
often know the least.

444
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:51,943
She sat in two meetings
with me.

445
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,213
I crushed it.

446
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,811
So what's your deal?
You ski?

447
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,214
I don't. You know, if I'm
gonna fall down a hill and die,

448
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:58,481
I want to do it for free.

449
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:01,184
Brian. What is up, slick?

450
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,722
Do you think
I could pull off a haircut

451
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,914
like scout had in the movie?

452
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:04,919
I've been there, Cat,

453
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:05,821
and you should know

454
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:07,848
that people are gonna assume
that you're...

455
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:08,857
I'm a lesbian?
I know.

456
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,160
I just needed to hear it.

457
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:16,994
So, what do you want to
be when you grow up?

458
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,851
Either the wicked queen
in<i>Disney on ice</i>

459
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:20,872
or the third woman president.

460
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,440
Well played.
I am giving you gum for that.

461
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,609
Where is he?
Where is "kev"?

462
00:16:25,677 --> 00:16:26,677
It's game go.

463
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:27,844
What are you doing?
What...

464
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:29,513
game go is not a phrase.
I don't know.

465
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:31,047
I just got really wound up
at the thought

466
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,516
of you getting checked out
by some creep.

467
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:33,651
And he's in trouble, too,

468
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:34,851
'cause I watched
some boxercise videos

469
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,254
on demand
before coming down here.

470
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:39,322
Hi. I'm Criss.

471
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,491
This is Cat.
This is Kevin's daughter.

472
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:43,326
She's awesome, unlike Kevin,

473
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:45,161
who is wearing a rope bracelet.

474
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,362
And I did not give it to him.

475
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,764
People assume I gave it to him,

476
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,332
but I'm like, "you're not
pinning that on me."

477
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,000
I can't believe
you really came down here

478
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,302
to try to fight my date.

479
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:54,203
That hasn't happened to me
since senior prom,

480
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,405
when Rob Sussman tried
to fight Richard Sallatto

481
00:16:56,472 --> 00:16:58,206
because they had secretly
broken up with each other

482
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,141
the night before.

483
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:02,911
Why are you so out of breath?

484
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:04,346
'Cause I ran
all the way down here.

485
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:05,561
Why didn't you just take
the subway?

486
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,949
'Cause that's not romantic.
Watch a movie, Liz.

487
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,251
I wish my boyfriend
did stuff like this,

488
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,152
but I feel the passion is gone

489
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,555
since he left for college.

490
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:16,390
I'm totally messing with you.

491
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,458
Guys, I'm 11.

492
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:18,559
Oh, thank God.

493
00:17:18,627 --> 00:17:20,561
That is not funny, young lady.

494
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:22,062
It's a little funny.

495
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,698
I'm sorry, j-mo.

496
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,065
I called the front desk,

497
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,400
but there's
no one else down there.

498
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:28,468
Paul didn't come.

499
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:31,738
I guess I faked this
stupid breakdown for nothing.

500
00:17:31,806 --> 00:17:33,072
Jenna, I've been thinking.

501
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,374
Why? You're famous.

502
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,375
I know, but I don't think

503
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:36,509
you were faking anything here.

504
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,578
Maroney, you jumped
through a window.

505
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:40,179
You made out
with paz de LA huerta

506
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:41,581
at a children's museum.

507
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:44,049
You tried to dine at balthazar

508
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:45,451
without a reservation!

509
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:47,720
And you did all that to get
some guy's attention.

510
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:50,622
That's crazy.
That's a breakdown.

511
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,258
I think I've made
the biggest mistake of my life.

512
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,693
I've never made a mistake,

513
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,962
so I don't totally understand,

514
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:58,231
but I'm here for you, J.

515
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,764
Of all the crazy things I did,

516
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:01,399
you know what the craziest was?

517
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:02,800
Letting Paul go.

518
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:05,770
I was scared to be happy.
Now I never will be.

519
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:08,305
I'll take this regret
to my grave.

520
00:18:08,374 --> 00:18:09,506
You mean our grave.

521
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:13,745
Where we'll lie
on top of each other

522
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,346
in one coffin,

523
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,781
pelvis to face, for eternity.

524
00:18:17,849 --> 00:18:19,383
You were here the whole time,

525
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,784
taking care of me.

526
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:21,885
I was afraid too, Jenna.

527
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:23,460
I had to be sure
that you wanted

528
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,654
the same thing that I did.

529
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:25,722
And now I know.

530
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,157
You sick bitch.

531
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,428
Tracy, if you'll excuse us.

532
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:33,896
No, Paul.

533
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:36,465
If it wasn't for Tracy,
we wouldn't be here right now.

534
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,492
He can stay.

535
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:42,438
No, I'm cool.
I'm gonna leave.

536
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:50,211
- Lemon, how did your date go?
- It was amazing,

537
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,246
but not in the way
that you would expect.

538
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:53,615
Cat's a great kid, isn't she?

539
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,650
You really thought
I'd set you up with Kevin?

540
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,819
I've been trying to fire him
ever since he invited me out

541
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,487
on a Halloween party bus.

542
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,088
But his daughter's terrific.

543
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,857
So you set me up
on a play date?

544
00:19:02,886 --> 00:19:04,858
I thought Kat
would remind you why

545
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:07,428
you purchased
the princess Leia costume

546
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:08,462
in the first place.

547
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,930
Don't give it away just yet.

548
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:11,164
That's very nice of you, Jack,

549
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:13,233
but you need to learn
that some women

550
00:19:13,301 --> 00:19:16,202
choose to be childless
and are content with that.

551
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,370
This is not a choice.

552
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,239
Oh, you are being so
trans-vaginal right now.

553
00:19:19,307 --> 00:19:21,841
The past few days
have only confirmed my fear

554
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,342
that we're running out
of good Americans,

555
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:26,345
so honestly, your country needs

556
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:27,547
a few more Liz lemons.

557
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:29,348
Oh. Okay.

558
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,416
So this has nothing
to do with Criss?

559
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:31,617
I don't care how you do it.

560
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,352
I don't care
if you join the big sisters

561
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,720
and torture inner-city girls
about punctuation.

562
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:37,522
Any amount of lemon
is better than the crap

563
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,357
we're turning out lately.

564
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:40,926
Exsqueeze me, Mr. D.

565
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,160
Couches are ready to ship.

566
00:19:42,227 --> 00:19:43,662
In trucks.

567
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:45,831
Ship in trucks.
What?

568
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:49,554
Wait, you sold them?
To whom?

569
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:51,535
I just had to find a buyer
who has too much money

570
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:52,703
and loves to waste it.

571
00:19:52,771 --> 00:19:55,473
So every defective sofa
that Kouchtown makes

572
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,941
will be purchased
by your beloved

573
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,241
tax-and-spend government.

574
00:19:58,309 --> 00:19:59,276
What are they going
to do with them?

575
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,111
Sink them and make a reef

576
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,379
to protect gay turtles?

577
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,482
I don't know, lemon,
and I don't care.

578
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,418
Mr. wang,
we know you were spying

579
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:10,987
for north Korean intelligence.

580
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,989
Give me something
I can take back to Langley.

581
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:14,390
Then we'll get you
out of the couch

582
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,361
and send you home
with a CIA gift bag.

583
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,999
I totally blew off
that week of Korean we did.

584
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,968
Let's get the translator.

585
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:32,741
- I think maybe I still...
- I don't think you should...

586
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,511
- want to be a mom.
- Give up on having a kid.

587
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:37,245
Okay.
We're on the same page.

588
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:39,381
I think we've talked
about it enough.

589
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:41,148
Maybe we just put a pin in that

590
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:42,449
and have some fun.

591
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:43,618
I'll open a puzzle.

592
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:46,554
I'll make a stew.

593
00:20:52,995 --> 00:20:55,429
Life is happening.

594
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,858
When did gum get so soft,
you sons of bitches?

595
00:21:04,427 --> 00:21:06,060
You know what this country
used to chew?

596
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:07,262
Tree bark.

597
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:09,397
Glass.
Shotgun shells.

598
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:12,066
The broken swords
of our vanquished enemies.

599
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:15,369
That's why I buy
Bazooka Joe gum.

600
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:16,805
It's like chewing a Mountain

601
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,940
that someone shot
a freeze ray into.

602
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:22,042
What's wrong
with this country? Huh?

603
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,911
When did we lose our way?

604
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:24,912
Detroit?

605
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,980
Life is hard.

606
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:28,548
Shouldn't everything else
be harder?

607
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:30,417
Bazooka Joe gum!

608
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:34,157
