1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,481
Liz,

2
00:00:07,776 --> 00:00:08,977
there's something
wrong with Pete.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,435
Oh, my God, is he dead?

4
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,687
I... I don't know what happened.

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,862
Kenneth, I need a light bulb
replaced in my dressing room.

6
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:30,898
Easy as pie, Ms. Maroney.
What could go wrong?

7
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:34,702
Why would I even say that?

8
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:44,662
Hey, whatever
happened to TiVo?

9
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:46,080
Remember, you used
to fast-forward,

10
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:47,782
it'd make that sound?
Boop-boop, boop-boop.

11
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,335
Yeah. Yeah, then it'd
be all like, bung-bung.

12
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:52,670
- Boop-boop, boop-boop.
- Bung-bung, bung-bung.

13
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,489
- Bung-bung, bung-bung.
- Boop-boop, boop-boop.

14
00:00:54,523 --> 00:00:57,859
Boop-boop, boop-boop.

15
00:00:57,893 --> 00:01:00,628
What's this?

16
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:09,904
It's Terry, the gender-neutral
doll I had when I was a kid.

17
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:14,475
And he/she has his/her
baseball glove and baby.

18
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,744
And both sets of genitals!

19
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,212
That was hard to track down.

20
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,014
Today, almost all of them
are in police evidence lockers.

21
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:21,916
So, happy three-month
anniversary,

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,118
and happy two-week anniversary
of you going to the bathroom

23
00:01:24,153 --> 00:01:25,219
when I'm here.

24
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:26,754
You shouldn't
be buying me gifts.

25
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,155
You should be saving
for your business.

26
00:01:28,173 --> 00:01:29,891
Oh, I think
remembering our anniversary

27
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,492
is going to get
me some business.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,494
Aww, yeah!

29
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:37,932
There's a whole other hand
where that came from, big boy.

30
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,550
Not my best.

31
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:41,703
Hey, listen, why don't
you go in late today, okay?

32
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:43,204
I'll make pancakes
with M&Ms in them.

33
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:44,389
Fine, I'll stay!
Gyah.

34
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,723
All right.

35
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:46,874
Do you want a smiley face?

36
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,911
German flag, please.

37
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:55,516
Jordan's comments have
angered gay-rights groups

38
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,385
and are likely
annoying his co-workers

39
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:59,620
who thought they'd linger
over breakfast this morning,

40
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:01,372
perhaps with a new lover.

41
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:04,392
Wow, that is some detailed
reporting, curry.

42
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,719
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

43
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:25,096
When I say "NBC,"
you say...

44
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:26,097
Over it!

45
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,015
- NBC!
- Over it!

46
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,767
- NBC!
- Over it!

47
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,602
Word.

48
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:34,622
Ugh, look at that
old bag from <i>TGS.</i>

49
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,824
Okay,
I am a human being, sir.

50
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh, you mean my tote bag.

51
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:41,395
Yes, I need a new one.

52
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:43,664
Look, I'm sorry about Tracy.

53
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:47,251
He really is a good person.

54
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:50,421
Do you think I'm
pulling this hat off?

55
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:51,606
No.

56
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,459
- From the top!
- Over it!

57
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,629
Oh, my God, there you are.

58
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,931
We're losing sponsors, Liz.

59
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,149
Did you know that snuggles

60
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:03,251
the fabric softener bear
is gay?

61
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:06,521
He's dating the charmin cub.

62
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:10,191
I thought they were babies.

63
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:11,759
Unbelievable.

64
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:14,395
Tracy, do you know how many of
your hard-working and dedicated

65
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:18,282
co-workers are gay?

66
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:21,602
Him. Him.

67
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:25,006
Her when she's drunk.

68
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,108
I genuinely don't know.

69
00:03:27,142 --> 00:03:29,377
That one's a puzzler.

70
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:34,415
And why did you have
to offend the gay community?

71
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,885
It is the most organized
of all the communities.

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,304
They make the Japanese
look like the greeks.

73
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:43,391
How is what I said offensive,
and that's not?

74
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:45,893
Because no one
heard me say it.

75
00:03:45,928 --> 00:03:48,896
Look, I need to know what
we're apologizing for, Tray.

76
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:51,265
What did you say?

77
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,834
Being gay is stupid.

78
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,703
If you want to see a penis,
take off your pants.

79
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,405
If I got turned into a gay,

80
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,208
I'd sit around all day
and look at my own junk.

81
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:01,692
Oh, my God.

82
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:04,912
First of all, if you
"got turned into a gay"?

83
00:04:04,947 --> 00:04:07,114
Do you think the people of
Raleigh, North Carolina

84
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:08,983
turned Clay Aiken gay?

85
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,335
Why not?
The Bronx turned me dyslexic.

86
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,821
Look, you're a public figure,
and believe it or not,

87
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:17,358
the dumb things you say
may influence or hurt people.

88
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:18,559
You need to apologize.

89
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:21,045
I already called Glad,
Liz Lemon.

90
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:22,680
Thank you for calling Glad,

91
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:24,765
stronger trash bags
with less plastic.

92
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,634
This is Diane.
How may I help you?

93
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:29,036
Hey Diane,
it's Tracy Jordan.

94
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,471
Sorry about what I said.

95
00:04:30,506 --> 00:04:32,106
- Well, okeydokey.

96
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,908
That's the wrong
"glad," Tracy.

97
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:36,110
Whatever. I'm tired of
apologizing all the time

98
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:37,728
for just being myself.

99
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,047
Remember when I offended
stubborn people?

100
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,949
That took forever
to sort out.

101
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:42,950
Well, Tracy,

102
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,018
I know you don't want me

103
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,019
writing an apology for you.

104
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:46,737
That's terrific, thank you.

105
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,222
Aww.

106
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:52,076
Lemon.

107
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,195
I'm on top of the Tracy thing.
I just spoke to him...

108
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:59,083
Actually, I want to talk
to you about something else.

109
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:01,219
Because of my unfortunate
situation with Avery,

110
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:02,670
I'm alone.

111
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,005
And I know, of course,
that you're not seeing anyone,

112
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,208
therefore I've decided
that you and I

113
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:08,609
should become
friends with benefits.

114
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:10,778
No, thank you, please.

115
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,813
Aha! The only reason
you would reject that offer

116
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,248
is if you had
a secret boyfriend.

117
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:16,784
Right,
that's the only reason.

118
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,152
I saw you, Lemon.
At the movies, last night,

119
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:20,571
with your mouth on a man.

120
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,891
Why would you
keep this from me

121
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,326
after all
of our time together?

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,246
This is hurtful, Elizabeth.

123
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,263
What's his name?

124
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,998
I don't want to tell you.

125
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:32,166
Why?
Is it a stupid name,

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,268
like "Dakota" or "Barack"?

127
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:35,736
His name is "Chris,"

128
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:36,904
and I'm sorry,
but for my own reasons...

129
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:38,339
And "Chris" is spelled?

130
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:41,125
No "h" and two "s"s.

131
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,410
That! Right there, that's
why I didn't want to tell you,

132
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:45,613
because I knew you
wouldn't approve of him.

133
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:46,814
Why? What does
he do for a living?

134
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,349
Criss is trying to...

135
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,250
You can stop right there.

136
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:51,936
He's an entrepreneur.
He's currently meeting with

137
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,471
investors in the
hopes of starting an

138
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:55,423
organic gourmet
hot dog truck.

139
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:57,959
Lemon, I have said
"good God" to you before,

140
00:05:57,993 --> 00:06:00,461
but I don't think
I've ever meant it until now.

141
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:02,096
Good God!

142
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:03,297
Where does this person live?

143
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:05,766
- Don't worry about it.
- How bad can it be?

144
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:09,003
Jersey city?
His parents' apartment?

145
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:10,838
It's not a walk-up, is it?

146
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,641
He's actually been living
with me for the past month.

147
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:15,576
Ah.

148
00:06:15,611 --> 00:06:18,296
No, I am not engaging,
I am not inviting input, Jack,

149
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,463
because Criss is different.

150
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:20,748
How is he different?

151
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:21,816
Well, that's just
a stupid question.

152
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,651
I mean,
I'm more relaxed around him.

153
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:27,855
My jaw stopped popping.
Listen.

154
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,391
And for once I'm not
overthinking everything,

155
00:06:30,425 --> 00:06:32,960
which is why
I don't want you in my head.

156
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:35,730
Ah, but I'm already
in your head, Lemon.

157
00:06:35,764 --> 00:06:37,648
The fact that you felt
you had to keep "Chris,"

158
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:40,468
and I'm saying his name
with an "h" and only one "s",

159
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:43,704
the fact that you
kept him from me simply proves

160
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,339
that it doesn't matter
whether I meet him or not.

161
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,907
You already know
what I would say,

162
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,509
and you know I'm right.

163
00:06:48,543 --> 00:06:49,744
I'm ignoring you.
You're not here.

164
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:51,479
- Who's not here, Liz?
- I don't know, Liz.

165
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:53,664
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too.

166
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,315
So I might as well
meet him and get it over with.

167
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,450
I'll probably love him.

168
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:58,502
After all,
we're both Princeton men.

169
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,155
Princeton?
No, Criss went to... no!

170
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:03,257
I am on to you. I am not
going to talk about him.

171
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,676
You can't keep me out.

172
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,066
Oh, Ms. Maroney.
I'm afraid I have bad news.

173
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,483
- Jenny McCarthy died?

174
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,152
But who could have been
slowly poisoning her?

175
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,920
Was she poisoned?
I have no way of knowing,

176
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,054
because I'm
just hearing about it.

177
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,223
No, ma'am,
I spoke to maintenance

178
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:26,175
about replacing the
light bulbs in your room,

179
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,330
but Mr. Subhas is refusing
to do any work for <i>TGS</i>

180
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,899
until Mr. Jordan issues
an apology for his remarks.

181
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,467
He also said
that he thinks, quote,

182
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,769
"sexuality is a continuum,"
and he is but

183
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:42,007
a voyager on a vast
ocean of pleasure.

184
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,693
- This is unacceptable,
Kenneth.

185
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:45,111
Do you understand
how important

186
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,113
proper lighting
is to an actress?

187
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:49,582
Especially now that I'm
officially a "B-list" celebrity,

188
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,818
thanks to
<i>America's kids got singing.</i>

189
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:54,320
Oh, congratulations,
Ms. Maroney.

190
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:55,922
I just found out this morning,

191
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:59,091
Teri Polo and Ving Rhames
called me at home.

192
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:01,561
So what if a tour came by
and some Fanny pack fatty

193
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:04,997
took a picture of me in my
poorly-lit dressing room?

194
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,733
And then they put the
picture on the Internet?

195
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:10,887
That can't happen.

196
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:13,055
I need my special,
pink-gel fluorescents,

197
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,440
and I need them now.

198
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:17,209
But only maintenance
is allowed in the supply room.

199
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:19,712
Kenneth, do this for me,

200
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:21,814
someone I hope
you consider a friend,

201
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,566
and who in return
thinks of you

202
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,852
as sort of
an albino slave-monkey.

203
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,904
Aw, you think of me?

204
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:29,555
Mm-hmm.

205
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,490
But I don't have a key.

206
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,860
You think we need a key?

207
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:35,895
I guess someone's never been
locked in a dog crate

208
00:08:35,913 --> 00:08:39,866
and thrown overboard for
displeasing the sheikh.

209
00:08:43,537 --> 00:08:47,123
A statement from <i>TGS</i> head
writer Elizabeth Lemon, adding...

210
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:49,876
I gotta get a real headshot.

211
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,436
In other news,
after lots of high financial...

212
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,522
And now, I am
headed home for a "nooner,"

213
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:09,428
which is what I call
having pancakes for lunch.

214
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:12,064
Liz Lemon, did you just
call me an idiot on this TV?

215
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:13,065
Yeah, but...

216
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:17,837
And what exactly
is that supposed to mean?

217
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,372
It means you're someone
who should know better,

218
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:21,624
but you constantly
do stupid things.

219
00:09:21,658 --> 00:09:27,213
How dare you! I am nonplussed,
and that is the correct usage.

220
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:28,915
You have offended
and humiliated me.

221
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,149
Well, maybe now you
know how gay people felt

222
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,919
when you suggested
that they sit around all day

223
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:34,220
and look at their own junk.

224
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,972
Wait.
Why don't they do that?

225
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:40,626
Okay, you're right, L.L.
I do get how they felt.

226
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:44,864
Insulted, marginalized,
and outraged.

227
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:47,967
Which is why I'm going to do
exactly what they did

228
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:50,853
and organize
a protest of this network.

229
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,672
A protest? By whom?

230
00:09:52,706 --> 00:09:54,640
By idiots!

231
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,112
What an idiot.

232
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:02,365
All right, I'm out.

233
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,649
I've been dealing
with Tracy all morning,

234
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,451
and clearly this
is only going to get worse.

235
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,753
Time to go into
Hornberger crisis mode.

236
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:09,755
Is that when you cry
on the floor in your office?

237
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,957
Nope, I do that
when I see myself

238
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:12,291
in the mirror on my birthday.

239
00:10:12,326 --> 00:10:16,662
Crisis mode is when I down
a couple of sleeping pills

240
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,365
with scotch, pass out
in my secret napping place,

241
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,851
and hope I dream about
that latina security guard.

242
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,869
The one you always
kiss on the mouth.

243
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:25,504
That's normal in Guatemala.

244
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:27,056
Oh.

245
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:31,610
Picking a lock
is like riding a bike.

246
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:32,862
They're both skills you need

247
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:35,616
to escape the Atlanta Falcons'
equipment room.

248
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:38,868
Hurry, Ms. Maroney.

249
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,486
If Mr. Subhas
finds us in here,

250
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,988
I don't even know
what he'll say,

251
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,406
because I can't understand him.

252
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:45,992
There!
My pink fluorescents.

253
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:48,494
They're the same lights poultry
farms use to keep the birds

254
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:50,413
from pecking each
other to death.

255
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:59,705
Are you as turned on
as I am right now?

256
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,841
Oh,
we have to clean this up.

257
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,427
"Fluorescent lights
contain Mercury."

258
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:05,478
That's poisonous.

259
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:07,246
I'm well aware
of that, Kenneth.

260
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,415
I faked Mercury poisoning
to get out of my contract

261
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:10,816
- <i>- The musical.</i>

262
00:11:10,851 --> 00:11:14,820
"If broken, remove all people
and pets from the room"?

263
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:16,072
Why? Are there fumes?

264
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:18,324
Are we breathing
Mercury fumes right now?

265
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:21,911
Kenneth. I'm going to tell you
what I told Phil Spector.

266
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,529
"It's gonna be okay, baby.

267
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:24,864
"We just have
to get some trash bags

268
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:27,133
"and get back here
before anyone's the wiser.

269
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,035
Then we can keep
recording my album."

270
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,084
Oh, come on, Subhas.

271
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:49,588
Got to keep daddy's
special sleepy-place clean.

272
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:54,110
Hey, so check this out.

273
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:56,729
I think I saw Billy Dee Williams
in riverside park this morning

274
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:57,763
when I was meeting dogs.

275
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,234
Now that seems like a good use
of time for a busy entrepreneur.

276
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:06,772
Hello, Lemon.
Chew with your mouth closed.

277
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:08,908
So, question about
Lando Calrissian...

278
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:10,142
Is that an Armenian name?

279
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,644
Is he a space Armenian?

280
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:13,045
I don't know.

281
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,880
The Kardashians are Armenian,
they're into black guys,

282
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,116
so there's something to it...

283
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,818
I like how his voice goes up

284
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:21,520
at the ends of sentences.

285
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,456
That's very masculine.

286
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:28,027
Oh, my. Is that a tan line
on Criss' thumb?

287
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:30,362
Did Criss used
to wear a thumb ring?

288
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:36,335
Oh, better hold on
to this one.

289
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,138
He's getting
a free muffin soon.

290
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:44,343
Wow, I've never seen a
sunglass hut credit card before.

291
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,649
Oh, a ukulele with an
Obama sticker on it.

292
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:55,004
Hmm.
 this guy might suck

293
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:57,339
That was a gift
from Criss' kickball team.

294
00:12:57,374 --> 00:12:58,491
Well,
I think I've seen enough.

295
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:02,995
Which totally supports your
theory that the phillie phanatic

296
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,547
is biologically a female.

297
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:05,764
Oh, yeah,
if you watch those games,

298
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,000
that thing definitely
has a menstrual cycle.

299
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:10,853
- Right?
- You gonna put on pants today?

300
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:13,672
Eh.

301
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:16,358
I'm in your head.

302
00:13:27,383 --> 00:13:30,851
We're here, we're proud,
I came up with this rhyme!

303
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:33,662
You brought this on yourself,
Liz Lemon.

304
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:36,495
The so-called idiot community
will not be silenced.

305
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:38,165
For God's sake, Tracy.

306
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,868
We are legion.
We are America.

307
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:44,905
Frat guys, DJs,
loud-mouthed old bitches,

308
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,708
investment bankers,
the tramp-stamped,

309
00:13:47,742 --> 00:13:50,544
parrot-heads,
anti-vaccination crusaders,

310
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:53,597
and people who won't
shut up about scuba diving.

311
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,599
It's a whole
other world down there.

312
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,801
And our celebrity
spokesperson,

313
00:13:57,852 --> 00:13:59,469
actress Denise Richards.

314
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:06,977
That's right.
I'm an idiot. Surprised?

315
00:14:07,028 --> 00:14:10,464
Well, I am.
For all "intensive purposes."

316
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:12,983
Our community
is mobilized now, L.L.

317
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:14,701
And we're not leaving
until we're heard.

318
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,605
You can't ignore us,
Liz Lemon.

319
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,826
We will be out here every day,
misremembering movie quotes.

320
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:25,412
Because as Braveheart said,

321
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:28,632
"you can take our freedom,
unless you take our lives."

322
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,820
Say you approve
of Criss, Jack.

323
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:35,689
Am I in your head, Lemon?

324
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:37,290
Yes, but don't be so proud.

325
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:38,992
I also have a lot
of imaginary arguments

326
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:40,427
with the couples
on <i>house hunters.</i>

327
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:42,663
Why can't people
look past paint color?

328
00:14:42,697 --> 00:14:44,231
Lemon, obviously
I can't approve of someone

329
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,532
I've never met.

330
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,833
Yeah, well, I'm not
letting you meet Criss,

331
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,335
because you
won't approve of him.

332
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,304
Well, then I guess
this is a catch-22.

333
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,322
Although I don't know for sure,
because I refuse to read

334
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:54,324
literature that questions
the morality of war.

335
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,910
Look, clearly
I hurt your feelings.

336
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:59,363
You're upset that
I didn't tell you about Criss.

337
00:14:59,414 --> 00:15:01,665
No, no, no, I'm quite
over your subterfuge,

338
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,868
although I do expect
a note of apology.

339
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,454
And don't try to make it funny.
Just apologize.

340
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:09,172
But I feel like
people expect comedy...

341
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,357
They don't.

342
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:13,043
It's exhausting.

343
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:14,461
However, you're right that I am
having an emotional reaction.

344
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,563
It's very frustrating
to watch someone I care about

345
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:19,533
do something she clearly
knows is bad for her,

346
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:22,002
like that week you wore
those blue contact lenses.

347
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:25,472
I looked like Adriana Lima.

348
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:26,840
And you don't know
that Criss is bad for me,

349
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:28,191
and you never will.

350
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:30,177
So you better get
on board the Criss train.

351
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:33,397
Criss-a, Criss,
Criss, Criss-a,

352
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:35,782
Criss-a, Criss-a,
Criss-a, Criss-a,

353
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,684
Criss-a, Criss-a,
Criss-a, Criss-a,

354
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:41,555
Criss train!

355
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:42,556
Do you have any water?

356
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,491
You know what, Lemon?

357
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:49,863
Fine. You are
technically an adult.

358
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:54,668
You can do
whatever you want.

359
00:15:54,702 --> 00:15:57,471
Really? So I won?

360
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:58,755
With the train thing?

361
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:01,375
I won't ask any
questions about Criss again.

362
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,927
You promise?

363
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:07,614
Promise.
With two "s"s.

364
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,068
I would, however, like
to ask you why Tracy is outside

365
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,420
cursing this network
on a megaphone.

366
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:14,855
It's a good one, Jack.

367
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:18,525
Tracy has organized a protest
of NBC by his fellow idiots.

368
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,395
He what? No, no, no, no, no.
We need idiots.

369
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:24,414
You certainly need idiots.

370
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:25,949
Who do you think
is watching your show?

371
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,702
Funky taste-makers?

372
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:29,970
Black nerds,

373
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:33,173
jet blue passengers
who fall asleep with the TV on,

374
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,575
pets whose owners have died,
and, uh, idiots.

375
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:36,943
You need to fix this.

376
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,596
I don't know
what to say to those people.

377
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,215
You wrote "remember
to DVR <i>Kendra"</i> on your hand.

378
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,484
I think you can handle it.

379
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,937
Ah, no, damn it.

380
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:49,156
Now I gotta
pray for a marathon.

381
00:16:56,431 --> 00:17:01,568
Jiminy Cricket, copyright
Walt Disney company, 1940!

382
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:06,289
Mr. Hornberger? Sir?

383
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,509
Pete!

384
00:17:09,544 --> 00:17:13,296
It's Jenna!
The woman you're in love with!

385
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:14,614
What's wrong with him?

386
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,000
Is this because
of the Mercury?

387
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,804
What does the box say?

388
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:22,789
"For a complete catalog
of our lighting products,

389
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:27,427
visit our website."
We need a computer.

390
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:28,595
Poor Mr. Hornberger.

391
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:30,497
He came in here to do
something for the show,

392
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:32,298
something important,
and now look what we've done.

393
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:35,369
What you've done.
You broke the lights.

394
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:38,989
We have to get help.

395
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:44,995
Are you out of your mind?

396
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:47,547
We need to call security,
and an ambulance.

397
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:48,882
Think, you fool.

398
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:51,218
Imagine what the Internet
would do with this.

399
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:53,920
"Maroney found in closet with
unconscious married man

400
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:55,889
and inbred virgin."

401
00:17:55,923 --> 00:17:59,793
Again? No way.
I have too much to lose now.

402
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:01,011
I am this close to becoming

403
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:04,264
the spokeswoman for
the vaginal mesh industry.

404
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:08,969
Vaginal mesh.
Nice try, prolapse.

405
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,804
Now, if you want to take the
fall for this, be my guest.

406
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:12,722
But I can't be
connected to it in any way.

407
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,141
Take what fall?

408
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,559
Oh, please.

409
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,344
You said it yourself
how many rules we've broken.

410
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:20,230
"B" and "E", theft and
destruction of company property.

411
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,549
And who knows
what we've done to Pete.

412
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,518
If anyone
connects you to this...

413
00:18:24,552 --> 00:18:26,586
I'll get fired.

414
00:18:26,621 --> 00:18:28,054
They'd kick me out of
the page program faster than

415
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:31,158
a fella can come up
with folksy similes.

416
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:39,166
No one can know
this was our fault.

417
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,418
But we have to help
Mr. Hornberger.

418
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:42,419
What do we do?

419
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,503
I don't know.

420
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:47,373
But I know someone who does.

421
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:50,410
Talk to me.

422
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:52,212
I'm on my way.

423
00:18:52,246 --> 00:18:54,047
Any idea what bus
I take to get there?

424
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,284
'Cause I'm in Chinatown,
baby.

425
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,052
Hi, this is
Tracy's cell phone.

426
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:00,353
Dot com,
hold the steering wheel.

427
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:02,522
I've got to leave
my outgoing message.

428
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:04,291
What did I just hit?

429
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,560
Was that a person?
Is that paint or blood?

430
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:08,562
Dot com,
this did not happen.

431
00:19:08,596 --> 00:19:11,698
We take this to our graves!

432
00:19:11,732 --> 00:19:15,085
Tracy, uh, this is Liz.
Please call my office.

433
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:17,120
My extension,
as you have pointed out,

434
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:18,905
spells "anus" with an "I".

435
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,511
- Hey, what's up?
- What time you coming home?

436
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:29,449
Because I'm...
 taking you out to dinner

437
00:19:29,484 --> 00:19:30,884
What?

438
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:33,620
I called sunglass hut and got
my credit limit raised to $80,

439
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:35,989
plus, they told me I only needed
5,000 more shades points

440
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:37,357
to get free lens wipes,

441
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:38,825
and I haven't even gotten
to the good news yet.

442
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,794
That's all awesome.
What happened?

443
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:42,229
I got an investor
for the truck.

444
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:44,981
I went over my whole business
plan, guy gave me ten grand.

445
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:46,149
Oh, my God.

446
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,667
Okay,
if you got it in cash,

447
00:19:47,702 --> 00:19:48,935
we can spread the money out
on the bed

448
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:50,036
and kiss on top of it.

449
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,788
But nothing more.
And I have a cold sore.

450
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:54,074
Damn it.
No, it's a check.

451
00:19:54,108 --> 00:19:59,629
But look at it.
It's beautiful.

452
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:05,151
It's him.

453
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:08,788
Not cool.

454
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:14,457

455
