The shower principle is
a term scientists use

to describe moments
of inspiration that occur

37
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,252
when the brain is distracted
from the problem at hand.

38
00:01:22,286 --> 00:01:24,254
For example,
when you're showering.

I finally got the title

Exactly.

43
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,679

is distracted,

483
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:06,173
and a black family
tried to buy me.

484
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:09,610
Let's do it!
Let's make us some couches.

485
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:10,844
You won't
regret this, Hank.

486
00:18:10,862 --> 00:18:13,147
I only have three regrets
in my life, Jack.

487
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:16,117
Not buying the Phillies,
not marrying my wife sooner,

488
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:18,352
and not surprising you
any quicker with this hug.

489
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,821
Ooh!

490
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:28,412
Yup, same as last year.

491
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:31,048
My situation has progressed in
an interesting way, Liz Lemon.

492
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,500
I don't want to hear it.

493
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:34,802
To solve my tax problem, I
called the treasury department

494
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:37,304
and told them I won't
pay my taxes until I see

495
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:39,039
your president's
birth certificate.

496
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,375
They told me if I did that,
they would arrest me.

497
00:18:41,393 --> 00:18:42,476
Things got heated,

498
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:44,261
so I said I had a bomb.

499
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:46,263
Hazel is trying
to destroy me.

500
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:48,432
Really? Now Hazel
is trying to destroy you?

501
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:51,185
Jenna, do you know how
crazy you sound right now?

502
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:54,855
Liz and I, or "Lazel,"
are really worried about you.

503
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:57,491
Oh, my God.
Doesn't matter what I do,

504
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:59,160
- nothing ever changes.
- Ms. Lemon,

505
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:01,061
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need to get

506
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,496
a recommendation from you

507
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:06,066
to reapply
to the NBC page program.

508
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,535
We've already done
that, Kenneth.

509
00:19:07,569 --> 00:19:08,786
We've done all of this!

510
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:11,255
All I wanted was
one shred of evidence

511
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,073
that my life
is moving forward.

512
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,842
Baby doll, what about me?

513
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,410
- I'm new.
- Are you, Hazel?

514
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,762
You're just another
weird page,

515
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,079
and I already have
one of those.

516
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:20,714
Aw, thank you.

517
00:19:20,748 --> 00:19:22,416
You people,
you are the reason

518
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:25,302
my life is a stagnant,
monotonous hell!

519
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:27,521
Oh, no, that reminds me.

520
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:30,257
My stand-up tour.
Add another zero, Ken.

521
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:36,313
Jack?
Why did you invite me here?

522
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:39,483
Oh, you're gonna murder me,
aren't you?

523
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:41,402
- Eh, it's okay.
- Up here, Lemon.

524
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:43,954
I haven't secured that
level from the rats yet.

525
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:46,490
[Gun clicks]

[Pellet fires]
[Rat squeaking]

527
00:19:49,544 --> 00:19:50,911
What the hell is this place?

528
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:54,114
This is where
I remake Kabletown.

529
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:56,417
And where Americans,
and for cost reasons,

530
00:19:56,451 --> 00:20:00,421
quite a few "foreign Americans,"
will make couches.

531
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:02,756
To watch TV on.

532
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,558
Do I finally understand
vertical integration?

533
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:05,926
Yes.

534
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,796
Well, at least one of us
got out of their rut today.

535
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:10,797
Eh!

536
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:12,900
Lemon, what are you doing?

537
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:16,153
I realized today that I cannot
do my job without you.

538
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:18,272
This is all because of you.

539
00:20:18,306 --> 00:20:20,191
You're admitting
you need me,

540
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:22,142
and all my nonsense.

541
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,911
You haven't done that since...

542
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:25,196
[Sitar music playing]

543
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,064
You've never done that.

544
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,083
I wanted a new G.E.

545
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:31,919
I got a couch factory,
but it's a start.

546
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:34,988
Baby steps, Lemon.

547
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:36,957
- To new beginnings.
- Lemon?

548
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,045
The cycle is broken.

549
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:43,764
Jack, the rats have
my meditation stool.

550
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:45,499
Ah!

551
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,551
Help! Shoot it free!

552
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,170
Let her go, you bastard!

553
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,606
Tomorrow, and tomorrow,
and tomorrow,

554
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:55,041
creeps in this petty
pace from day to day

555
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:57,877
to the last syllable
of recorded time.

556
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,429
And all our yesterdays
have lighted fools

557
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:02,247
the way to dusty death.

558
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:04,249
Out, out, brief candle.

559
00:21:04,267 --> 00:21:06,052
Life's but a walking shadow,

560
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:09,805
a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage,

561
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,973
and then is heard no more.

562
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,170
It is a tale told by an idiot,

563
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:17,201
full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.

564
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:20,338
Would you like to try our apple dippers?

565
