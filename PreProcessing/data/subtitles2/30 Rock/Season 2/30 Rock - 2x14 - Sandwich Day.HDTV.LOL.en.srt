00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,070
*******other ways of life,

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,970
"it had to originate somewhere as a modus
vivendi common to whole groups of man."

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,040
Nothing? Hello?

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,900
Hillary clinton is president,sir!

8
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,230
I-I thought I would just
try to scare you out of it.

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,880
I-I need you to wake up.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,300
Sir,your son-in-law has
taken over the company.

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,130
He's installed your daughter as the ceo.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,390
Don't get me wrong.
She's a wonderful girl.

13
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,870
I've been stripped of
all my responsibilities

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,140
********

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:10,040
********* on 12.

16
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,500
12! You've got to
wake up-- please!

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,990
- marcus schenkenberg was there.
- who?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,360
Okay,the craziest thing
happened this morning.

19
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,660
I was home on my treadmill, and the phone
rings, and you will not believe who it was.

20
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,040
Liz? It's,uh,floyd.

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,400
oh,my god, floyd called?

22
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,740
You were using your treadmill?

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,730
Yes. And,yes,pete. I use it every day.

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,050
What did floyd want?

25
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,180
He's in town.He was only
supposed to be here for a day,

26
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,770
but there's some big storm coming,

27
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,760
and his flight on jetfun got cancelled.

28
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,220
Jetfun--is that the
one with the footbaths?

29
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,570
Oh,no,that's airbike.

30
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,910
They also have in-flight
pornos and nbc news.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,760
Jetfun's the one that
hands out fresh popcorn.

32
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,030
Listen to me!

33
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,260
Floyd wants to know if he
can crash at my apartment--

34
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,450
so?What's the big deal?

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,900
I haven't seen floyd since
he left for cleveland.

36
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,950
The last time I tried to get in touch with
him, some rust-belt tramp answered the phone.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,000
And now he's here,and I
don't know what crash means.

38
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,670
I just don't wanna embarrass myself.

39
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,010
I wanna be top dog for
once instead of just... dog.

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,760
Then you need to make
him regret ever leaving.

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,420
You need to pretend you're doing great.

42
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,590
I am doing great.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,450
for once,I am not gonna be jan brady.

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,100
I'm gonna be marcia, damn it. My nose!

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,870
my bad!

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,020
See? It's starting already!

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,050
Look out,floyd. There is a new
liz,and-- Ooh! Sandwich day.

48
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,220
what's that?

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,140
You've never heard of sandwich day?

50
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,830
Why,it's the most wonderful day of all.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,540
Once a year, the teamsters go to this
italian sandwich shop in brooklyn.

52
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,140
No one knows what it's
called or where it is.

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,650
It's a teamster secret.

54
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,230
But they buy us these sandwiches...

55
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,230
oh,sus********

56
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,250
God bless us,every one!

57
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,130
Well,I wish you the very
best with the office,kathy.

58
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,700
By the way, you know who hates unicorns?

59
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,040
Wahlberg.

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,350
Kathy geiss's office.

61
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,690
please hold.

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,520
Mr. Donaghy,you're not really
going down to 12, are you?

63
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,860
I have to.

64
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,140
Of course it's humiliating.

65
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,790
Banks is trying to
shame me into leaving.

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,270
But where else am I gna go?

67
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,360
I've been sleeping with the cindy awford
of corporations for the last 22 years--

68
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,300
what am I supposed to do, st l dowwi san

69
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,610
what about washington?

70
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm sure your friends in
the bush administration--

71
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,870
Bush? Has it gotten that bad?

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Good god,I'd rather work for an american
car y than jon that sinking ship.

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,190
- Made you this.
- ******

74
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,400
Well...

75
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,370
* I will remember you *

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,060
* will you remember me *

77
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,290
* Dooby-do,dooby-do don't
let your life pass you by *

78
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,060
Oh--hold
it!

79
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,170
Hey,jack.

80
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,560
I got a company-wide email from the new ceo
that was just a link to cats wearing bowties?

81
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,580
Is everything okay?

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,830
Everything's great.

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,910
Yeah,I'm really... crushing it.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,270
Why you going to 12?

85
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,430
12? Did I hit 12? I wanted,uh...

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,320
40... 12, which is 52. Where I work.

87
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,880
Business.

88
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,050
I can't believe sandwich day is over!

89
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,830
Hey,look. Lutz is still eating.

90
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,570
you're savoring it?

91
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,360
What,you think you're better than us?

92
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,790
No,that's not it at all.

93
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,610
Since my surgery, I have to eat
slowly or my insides might explode.

94
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,110
Gimme it!

95
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,770
It's like knives!

96
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,510
Look,z lemon's sach
is still on her desk!

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,950
Taking liz's foodot good.

98
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,690
E'my aheese?

99
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,400
But as far as liz lemon
knows, her sandwich never came.

100
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,120
U-uh,liz?

101
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,070
Floyd,I didn't see you there.

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,530
You look great.

103
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,840
Do I? I'm pretty tired from
playing as hard as I work.

104
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,750
okay,now, bring up 23...

105
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,220
and give me some air.

106
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,240
My key.

107
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,050
Thank you. Thank you
so much for doing this.

108
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,700
can I take you out to dinner tonight?

109
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,940
You know,maybe we hit that
barbecue place you puked at.

110
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,640
You'll have to be more specific.

111
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,970
Well,I'll see you back at... your place.

112
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,480
Somebody get me ouof thidress********

113
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,770
you guys are working hard,for once.

114
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,720
Where's my sandwich?

115
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,750
Lutz made us do it!

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,290
- No,it was frank!
- It was jordan!

117
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,710
stop it!

118
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,790
This is all my fault, miss
lemon, because I let it happen.

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,560
And the only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is for good men to do nothing.

120
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,330
please ask my permission
before you quote me,kenneth.

121
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,870
I don't know how...

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,060
but you're gonna get
me another sandwich,

123
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,810
or I'm gonna cut your face
up so bad, you'll have a chin.

124
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,960
You'll all have chins!

125
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,720
floor 12.

126
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,060
door closing.

127
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,010
It's me again,sir.

128
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,440
I thought you'd like to know that it's
snowing out, the city all silent and white.

129
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,470
Wake up!

130
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,390
Wake up!

131
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,740
wow,snow in may.

132
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,080
Thank you,global warming, for
extreme,unpredictable weather patterns.

133
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,740
There was actually a tornado
in cleveland last week.

134
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,220
Destroyed an entire city bck.

135
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,280
Three bowling alleys, a liquor
store, and the liquor store museum.

136
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,250
So do you have time to grab dessert?

137
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,710
Yikes! Did you know it is 4:30?

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,890
I haven't stayed up
this late since college.

139
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,360
And behind this trap door, more orcs.

140
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,310
That'll really piss off samir.

141
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,440
My flight's in two hours.

142
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm sorry,I gotta go.

143
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,330
You know,sometimes I really
regret leaving new york.

144
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,360
Like... right now, for instance.

145
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,990
Well,what does new york have
that cleveland doesn't have?

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,910
I read that you guys
are getting an ikea.

147
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,020
Yeah. I'll believe it when I see it.

148
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,280
Well,we've just been burned before.

149
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,140
It was really great seeing you,liz.

150
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,210
I'll see you.

151
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,780
now,turn and look back at me.

152
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,090
Atta boy. Eat it up,cleveland.

153
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,570
Oh,god. Youths!

154
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm losing it,don.

155
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,220
I mean,I been walking the
streets in this crazy snow,

156
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,330
trying to figure out
who I am, where I fit in.

157
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,830
I even stopped to catch a
snowflake with my tongue,

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,010
butly,that'sort of signal in C.

159
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,180
Just give me a sign.

160
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,420
I've given everything to this company,
but now I feel that maybe I should...

161
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,760
quit.

162
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,840
You have to leave.

163
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,750
What?

164
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,930
Visiting hours were over some time ago.

165
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,220
What happened to your voice?

166
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,760
I was hit by lightning as a child.

167
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,910
They made a movie about me.

168
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,980
You have to leave ge.

169
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,390
What did you say?

170
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,900
Geriatric extended care.

171
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,730
That's what... this wing
of the hospital is called.

172
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,810
I have to leave ge.

173
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,820
after last night's freak
snowfall, it's 90 and humid.

174
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,360
In other global warming ws, a tornado t
downtown detroit, putting out several fires.

175
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,840
Hello?

176
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,220
How did it go with floyd?

177
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,580
The poor guy got lemoned. Hard.

178
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,000
Started babbling about how he
wished he'd never left new york.

179
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,530
Did you do that thing I showed you?

180
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,620
No,jenna,I did not come back from the
bathroom and hand him my underwear.

181
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,320
That's how I met that mobster.

182
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,940
Next time floyd brings some corn
pone tranny back to his apartment,

183
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,620
all he's gonna be thinking about
is me, standing there in the snow,

184
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,270
looking like the one who got away.

185
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,000
Crone!

186
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,810
We'll get liz lemon her sandwich.

187
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,360
An inational superstar.

188
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:07,060
The teamsters will be honored
that I'm even talking to them.

189
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,970
* That old soft shoe *

190
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,360
* is comin' around the bend *

191
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,230
that's enough.That's
enough. Now,you two--kiss.

192
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,790
You with the sport
coat, you're the girl.

193
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,500
What are you doing?

194
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,520
All we want is one more sandwich.

195
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,690
Or just the name of the place

196
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,850
now,why would we want ouecome
public knowledge get ovn

197
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,620
by a bunch of sissies?

198
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,420
I know what driving
the long haul's like.

199
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,510
After my junior year at oberlin, we
road-tripped to south by southwest!

200
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,080
You lads got a lotta nerve.

201
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,680
You gotta earn that information,girls.

202
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,120
On our terms. In competition.

203
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,850
- Bible trivia?
- Drinking contest.

204
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,560
Here. Tonight.

205
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,160
Uh,a band-aid just
fell out of your hair.

206
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,710
Well... this is fun.
You're back! What happened?

207
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,990
Good morning. I'm checking in
for flight 1876 to cleveland.

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,720
Oh,no,no. We're cancelled.

209
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,590
Cancelled? You gotta be kidding me!

210
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,350
Oh,I would have
checked my flight,but--

211
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,380
oh,no,no.The airline is cancelled.

212
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,570
We're not an airline anymore.

213
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,370
Wait,wait,wait. One
storm? That's all it takes?

214
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,230
We're still gonna make popcorn.

215
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,460
Just no more airplanes. I'm sorry.

216
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,270
Hey,karen. I hate your guts.

217
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,770
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.

218
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,170
You know, my cell was dead
'cause I didn't bring my charger.

219
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,690
Who was that bitch that answered
your phone eight months ago?

220
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,260
So this girl, what's
her lower back tattoo?

221
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,920
A chinese character that she thinks means
peace, but it really means "I have chlamydia"?

222
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,080
Oh,my god,liz,I'm so glad
you're bringing this up.

223
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,170
Really? You are?

224
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,160
Yeah,I-I feel bad how we
never got to talk about it,

225
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,990
and I didn't bring it up last night
because we were having so much fun,

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
and I didn't want to ruin it.

227
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,340
Okay,well--
okay.

228
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,020
I-I've been thinking about this a lot, and
it's just-- oh,shoot. Hold on. I'm sorry.

229
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,950
I got a flight. In 40 minutes.

230
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,550
No,no,no,no. This is more important than me getting
home or my partner meeting with peter venkman.

231
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,390
No,don't do that. Just
go. But you call me.

232
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,590
I will. I-I will.

233
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,780
O-or you could ride
to the airport with me.

234
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,610
No,it's okay. You go,and we'll talk.

235
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,330
Okay. And I thought you
were cool last night.

236
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,740
I do rock.

237
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,140
A drinking contest?

238
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,760
What am I,12 and at my
boyfriend's frat party?

239
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,990
We need you,jenna!

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Lutz can't drink because of his
operation, kenneth doesn't drink.

241
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,920
Drinking's against my beliefs.

242
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,590
Like gambling or freeway driving.

243
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,760
And I can't drink--I still
got my hollywood sock on.

244
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,800
And I can't have booze because I'm on
antibiotics after having some skanky club sex.

245
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,580
He's on antibiotics because he lost his lucky
penny and assumed it fell in his ear again.

246
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,580
Shut up,lutz.

247
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,750
Your surgery was for
an undescended testicle.

248
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,670
Wrong again! It was for
two undescended testicles!

249
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,180
Okay,wait,so no one else is drinking
against the teamsters? It's only me?

250
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,950
I'll do it. But only for the attention.

251
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,090
Yes!

252
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,520
- Is lemon around?
- I haven't seen her, sir.

253
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,810
Tell her I need her. I'll
be on 12 the rest of the day.

254
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,000
That's a joke.

255
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,580
Hey,can you make the teamsters tell
us where they get those sandwiches?

256
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,980
Only if you beat them
in a drinking contest.

257
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,130
It's in their contract.

258
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,250
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover I'm a child,

259
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,770
I'm a--
mother!

260
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,510
Floyd?

261
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,290
Oh,boy. Oh,no!

262
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,580
Why aren't you at the airport,floyd?

263
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,910
There was no flight, was there?

264
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,320
Not at the time,no.

265
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,190
But I do have one tonight,so...

266
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,350
you lied to me.

267
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,840
I just didn't want to
talk about that stuff.

268
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,420
Can't we just fast-foward to
being friends again? You know--

269
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,110
Your cell phone was dead!

270
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,030
You faked that email!

271
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,310
Peter venkman! That's
from ghost busters!

272
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,990
You used ghost busters for evil!

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,850
I'm glad we didn't talk about
that girl, because you're a liar!

274
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,340
Okay. Okay,fine, you want some honesty?

275
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,610
I don't know what girl
u're talking about,liz.

276
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm single. I'm a
lawyer. I wear ne coats.

277
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,840
I'm the michael clayton of cleveland.

278
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,760
Well,I hope your car blows up!

279
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,760
Look,you made a choice!

280
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,850
I asked you to come to
cleveland with me, you nut job!

281
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,450
I'll move to cleveland when
you get that ikea-- never!

282
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,030
Oh,you-- don't you deprive the
good people of cleveland an ikea!

283
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,760
You are vindictive, liz lemon!

284
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,540
Smooth.

285
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,280
Oh,come on,you guys.

286
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,530
You guys do one.

287
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,850
I've had ten shots.

288
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,300
You've only had five shots.

289
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,140
No,today. I've had ten shots today.

290
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,810
You fought a hell of
a good fight,blondie.

291
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,990
But you can't win.

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,480
We failed.

293
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,880
I found my lucky penny.

294
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,580
It's not in my ear.

295
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,620
battery's dead.

296
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,930
I got a half hour before
they track me down.

297
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,720
Alcohol? This smells just
like hill people milk.

298
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,740
I been drinking this since I was a baby!

299
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,320
- It's on,y'all.
- Yeah!

300
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,270
Oh,boy.

301
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,010
How'd they do that?

302
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:37,930
* I'll be here in sunshine *

303
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,760
* or in shadow *

304
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,610
* oh,danny boy...*

305
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,620
so should I ask why you're
showing up for work at 6:30?

306
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,560
I'm not gonna lie to you,jack.

307
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,240
I was... working from home.

308
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,490
Lemon,we should talk.

309
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
Fine. Floyd was in
town, and it was awful.

310
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,880
And it started out great, and then
it was awful, and now it's over.

311
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,650
What happened?

312
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,930
He lied about going to the airport.

313
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,910
And?

314
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,300
And I said I hope he
dies in a car explosion.

315
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,760
Lemon,life is about minimizing regrets.

316
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,750
You never know when someone's
going to slip into a coma

317
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,540
and leave you regretting
all the things you didn't say

318
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,540
or get in writing from
the company's lawyers.

319
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,240
What I'm trying to
say is you're...young,

320
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,530
and you still haven't
blown it completely.

321
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,090
So don'T... start now.

322
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,750
I hate going to the airport.

323
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,490
Floyd. Floyd! Sorry.

324
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,970
I need the cheapest ticket
you have going anywhere.

325
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,910
What's that in your bag?

326
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,680
Uh,a sandwich and dipping sauce.

327
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,380
That's more than 3 ounces.
You can't bring that past here.

328
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,500
Really?

329
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,830
No,look,I just need to catch up with this
guy before he gets on a plane to cleveland.

330
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,230
That's sort of a cliche.

331
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,400
You're sort of a cliche.

332
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,920
One-way ticket to montreal.

333
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,920
Crazy eyes. I should detain you.

334
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,290
Look,please,I just need to talk to him before
he takes off and I never get the chance again.

335
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,140
Fine. Just leave the
sandwich and go through.

336
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,820
Leave the sandwich?

337
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,620
- Leave the sandwich.
- Boarding call for flight 254 to cleveland.

338
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,180
You're choosing a sandwich over a guy.

339
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,860
- That is less cliched.
- I can do it!

340
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,230
I can have it all!

341
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,920
God,lady, you're eating foil!

342
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,750
Floyd. Floyd!

343
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,480
Liz. What are you doing here?

344
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,300
I don't want your car to explode, and
I don't want you to go into a coma.

345
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,310
And I don't want to stab you
in the face with a giant fork.

346
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,200
What?

347
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,060
Oh,that's not you. I've been
threatening a lot of people lately.

348
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,900
Look,liz,I'm really sorry
about what happened,you know.

349
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,060
Are we at the part where we
just become friends again?

350
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,430
I-I came to the airport, didn't I?

351
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,680
And I wolfed my teamsters sub for you.

352
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,960
Wait. No. Is that a saying?

353
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,160
- Don't worry about it.
- Final boarding call for flight 254...

354
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,670
I gotta go.

355
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,260
Oh,I-I still have your key.

356
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,990
You should keep it. I mean,if
you want to. You never know.

357
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,880
Yeah,yeah,yeah. Yeah,you never know.

358
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,480
I'll see you around, liz lemon.

359
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,890
msnbc has confirmed that former ge executive
jack donaghy will be named by president bush

360
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,920
as the new homeland security director
of crisis and weather management.

361
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,080
Flight 31 to montreal is now blurghing.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
