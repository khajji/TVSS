1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,530
This is it, Lemon. Government. 

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,320
The true seat of American power. 

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,760
This is all happening so fast. 

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,390
I mean, last week you were
at ge, and this week you're--

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,570
what are you in charge of exactly?

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,070
We're sharing the load. It's
a bit of homeland security. 

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,100
they still have that?

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,220
Extreme weather preparedness
and the war on the poor. 

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,450
You mean the war on poverty. 

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,820
Yeah, okay, let's go with that. 

11
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,240
So you're never coming back. 

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,580
I'm sorry, Lemon, but there's
nothing left for me at ge. 

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Sure, Geiss could come
out of the coma and say, 

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,630
"Jackie boy, you're the next
ceo, " but that's not likely. 

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,590
The cryogenecists are already
sharpening their head saws. 

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,270
Oh, this is all so weird. 

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,750
It's making me sick to my stomach. 

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,030
Lemon, it's 8:00 in the morning. 

19
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,920
Are you eating those
Mexican cheese curls?

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,020
Hey, donít knock my ìSabor de Soledadî. 

21
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,710
I found a prize in here
the other day... I hope. 

22
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,550
Lemon, I have to go. 

23
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,100
It's time for my freedom search. 

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,730
Liz Lemon, do these look
like wizard nipples to you?

25
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,060
Well, I donít know. Are the 
lightning bolts suppos *** in or out?

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,860
Exactly. Is all wrong.
This world is so clear in my head.

27
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,410
oh, are these the characters
for your porn video game?

28
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,180
The working title is goregasm, colon, 
the legend of dong-slayer. 

29
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,860
sorry about the wizard, Tracy. 

30
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,540
I'll call the Korean animators. 

31
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, you fixulate this!

32
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,830
I'm sorry. 

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,630
Liz Lemon, do you know what it's like to
be the only one who cares about your job

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,020
when everybody else around is
goofing off like a bunch of goof-offs?

35
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,860
Yes. 

36
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,270
Emotions. 

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,530
- You having your woman times?
- What? No!

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,730
I just had my woman
times last-- oh, boy. 

39

42
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,090
why donít I cross out the
days like people in the movies?

43
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,830
I think you're supposed to
take all of them. Like, in a row. 

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,270
Thank you, cerie, but I've been
sexually active since I was 25. 

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,770
Mr.Hornberger?

46
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,320
I was wondEring if I could ask you
to write a recommendation for me

47
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,820
to be a page at the x-x-I-x
summer olympics in Beijing. 

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,580
Sure, Kenneth. 

49
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,380
Have you ever wanted to go to
the olympics, Mr.Hornberger?

50
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,880
I almost went once. 

51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,500
Bad news, archers. 

52
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,580
President carter has decided
to boycott the Moscow games. 

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,330
Peanut farmer. 

54
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,100
Anyway, I was wondEring when you
were gonna come to me for this. 

55
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,810
You know the applications are due today. 

56
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,160
Today, sir?

57
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,540
The memo I got said they
were due in two weeks. 

58
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,500
No, it's today at 5:00. 

59
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,910
I have to write my personal essay!

60
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,260
Donny?

61
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,970
Parcell. Thought you'd be
coming out of that door. 

62
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,830
Did you get my memo about the olympic
applications being due two weeks from now?

63
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,010
Saboteur!

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,510
Looks like you'll be staying
here in New York all summer--

65
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,840
fighting the crowds, 
smelling the hot garbage, 

66
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,090
while I travel to
beautiful, breezy Beijing. 

67
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,930
The day's not over yet. 

68
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,680
Hey, you must be Jack Donaghy. 

69
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,230
Cooter berger, vice chair of farm
subsidies, acting head of fema, 

70
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,330
temporary acting head of the fbc
while the acting head is on trial. 

71
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,470
Wow, you've had a lot of shake
ups around here lately, huh?

72
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,910
I couldnít disagree with you more. 

73
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,940
The administration has been streamlined. 

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,100
And the media are so obsessed with the current
election, they've completely forgotten we're here. 

75
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,510
It's an exciting time. 

76
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm glad to hear it. I donít like to
think of this president as a lame duck. 

77
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,140
I like to think of him as a lame eagle. 

78
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,650
The ceiling appears to be leaking. 

79
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,910
No, it's not. We've looked
into it and it's not. 

80
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,710
If you have any questions, I'll
write down my extension for you. 

81
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,230
Do you need a pen?

82
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,840
Nope, I've kind of gotten used to it. 

83
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,010
You donít have pens?

84
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,190
We're not in a recession. 

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,480
Boy, we've got to crack the
whip around here, cooter. 

86
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,330
You donít have pens. 
The roof is leaking. 

87
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,720
No, it's not. I'll show you the study. 

88
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,460
Hey, we have a meeting with the
appropriations committee, like, now. 

89
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,770
Oh, no, I'm not prepared. 

90
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,650
I know. I'm not drunk
either. But we'll manage. 

91
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,910
Mother!

92
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,880
oh, I'm sorry. 

93
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,570
I donít know why I even came up here. 

94
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,880
I mean, I know Jack's not here. 

95
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,600
Boy, I am really going a little crazy!

96
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,290
I donít supposed you want
to be my sounding board. 

97
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,530
You're busy. I'll
come back another time. 

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,770
Warrior, you have defeated the snake elf. 

99
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,350
Now join me in the orgy chamber. 

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,850
The poets will sing of this night. 

101
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,990
Stop, stop! It's not working. 

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,900
It's not--not you, grizz. 
You're doing great. 

103
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,370
I memorized all my lines at home. 

104
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,820
But, Jenna, you're not doing good acting. 

105
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,590
Donít overthink it. I donít need
another judi dench situation. 

106
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,220
Now let's just skip ahead to the
list of player sensuality options. 

107
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,270
These avatars need to be able
to do anything to each other. 

108
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,480
Touch my cheek. 

109
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,230
- Touch my chest area. 
- Now give me a little robot. 

110
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,320
- Touch my butt. 
- Now like it's a secret. 

111
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,310
Touch my knees. 

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,290
- Sexy, yes. 
- Touch my knee spot. 

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,120
- Good. 
- Touch my feet with your knees!

114
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,560
Now that we're in the zone, I want
you to give me some random sex sounds. 

115
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,030
wonderful, wonderful. Let's
take it again from the top. 

116
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,740
This time, let's record!

117
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,650
Hey, Jack, it's Liz. 

118
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,380
Um, maybe you're busy spreading
democracy. Anyway, give me a call. 

119
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,970
Things are happening!

120
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,760
Our first order of business, 

121
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,950
the city of portland has requested
$9 million to shore up its dam system. 

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,050
I canít support that. 

123
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,210
"Damn" is a swear word. 

124
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,470
I'd support it if instead of
dam we called it a "god finger. "

125
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,360
Randall, must you bring
religion into everything?

126
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,910
We need pens. 

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,010
Excuse me?

128
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,750
Gentlemen, madame, we all know
that rome wasnít built in a day. 

129
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,160
Well, that's one theory. 

130
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,920
But. . . 

131
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,550
we have a chance to make
this country great again. 

132
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,790
We need hope. We need change. 

133
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,480
We need experience. 

134
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,840
We need pens. 

135
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,870
Kenneth, where have you been?

136
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,890
I had to put on my jeans by myself. 

137
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,870
I'm sorry, miss Maroney. 

138
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm trying to finish this
application for Beijing. 

139
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,450
Did someone say "donny?"

140
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,840
- No. 
- No. 

141
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,460
Oh, it's pretty muffled in there. 

142
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,850
You'll never get that
application done in time, Parcell. 

143
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,880
You should just give up!

144
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,610
I will not fail, Chief
Errand Boy Donny Lawson!

145
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,830
I was told there would be no nudity!

146
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,530
That's the only thing i
know how to say in chinese. 

147
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,320
Four and a half hours, hee-haw. 

148
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,760
Donny's right. 

149
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,060
I'll never finish this
application in time. 

150
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,370
The personal essay is
way harder than I thought, 

151
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,640
'cause it' not in my
nature rag on myself. 

152
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,980
Not even a backdoor brag?

153
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,140
What's a backdoor brag?

154
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,650
It's sneaking something wonderful about
yourself into everyday conversation. 

155
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,990
Like when I tell people it's hard for me to
watch "American Idol" because I have perfect pitch. 

156
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,970
Now you try. 

157
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,070
It's hard for me to watch "American Idol"

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,280
because there's a water
bug on my channel changer. 

159
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,260
It's no just?

160
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,920
Oh, no. 

161
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,740
Someone's gonna get
more attention than me. 

162
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,930
That was amazing. 

163
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,480
"Give us pens. " I mean, how do you do it?

164
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,580
Cooter, I used to work
for a man named don Geiss. 

165
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,900
He taught me how to be proactive. 

166
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,210
I'm going to teach you the same thing. 

167
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,850
I'm so happy you're here. 

168
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,630
I havenít felt this energized at work since the
two weeks where they tried to teach us farsi. 

169
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,620
- Cool phone. 
- Excuse me. 

170
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,030
Jonathan. 

171
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,930
- Geiss spoke. 
- What?

172
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,940
He's not out of the coma, but he spoke. 

173
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,930
What did he say?

174
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,650
He said, "Jackie boy. "

175
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,770
Cooter, this is my letter of resignation. 

176
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,450
Would you make sure that it
gets into the right hands?

177
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,930
What? No, no way. 

178
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,320
What do you want to do that for?

179
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,940
I just received a very important
phone call. I've gotta get back. 

180
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,940
But we were gonna do
great things together. 

181
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,280
Look, the leak's stopped. 

182
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,580
I have to get back to new
york. This is my only chance. 

183
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,750
Resignation denied. 

184
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,210
You canít deny my resignation. 

185
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,190
Actually, I can. 

186
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,500
As acting head of the fbc, I oversee the
ewpc, and I'm denying your resignation. 

187
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,220
You'll stay here and serve your country. 

188
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,200
The head of ge serves this country. 

189
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,270
He provides jobs. Fuels innovation. 

190
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,340
He brings good things to light. 

191
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,680
Cooter, I'm begging
you. Please let me go. 

192
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,080
Hey, it's not up to me. 

193
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,440
Even if I let you
resign, my boss wouldnít. 

194
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,680
They donít want people
leaving here anymore. 

195
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,380
You're not going anywhere, buddy!

196
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,860
Hey, the pens are here!

197
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,790
USA! USA! USA! USA!

198
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,650
Hello, friend. 

199
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,680
- Oh, my god, you're pregnant. 
- What?

200
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,460
Yes. How can you tell?

201
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,780
I just can. 

202
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,620
People always underestimate my
instincts because of my looks. 

203
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,830
This is no time for backdoor bragging. 

204
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,410
I'm just so happy for you. 

205
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,730
- This is what you wanted. 
- Yeah, but not like this. 

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,730
Why not like this, Liz?

207
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,340
As my mom used to say, "you
never want this to happen. "

208
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,090
- Have you called Floyd yet?
- What?

209
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,440
Floyd--you couldnít ask for a
better guy to make a mistake with. 

210
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,380
Oh, no. It is Floyd, right?

211
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,780
Those margaritas were strong. 

212
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,620
Can you come inside? I need
a couple light bulbs changed. 

213
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,640
Pfft, yeah!

214
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,370
oh, my god. 

215
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,320
How could you have slept with Dennis?

216
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,030
It was before he tried to
throw me under the subway train. 

217
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,490
Oh, my god!

218
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,160
Oh, so you're the only person in the
world that's allowed to make sex mistakes?

219
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,530
You had a three-way with
Roseanne and tom Arnold. 

220
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,050
That was two years ago. 

221
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,170
Fine, so I made one extremely
unfortunate coupling decision. 

222
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,310
So what are you gonna do?

223
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,010
Well, obviously Dennis canít be involved
because he is a class "a" moron. 

224
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,650
So I am just gonna be
a kick-ass single mom. 

225
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,140
Like Erin Brockovich or Sarah Connor. 

226
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,850
Listen to you.
You're actually excited about this. 

227
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,120
Yeah, I am. 

228
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,900
Even though it's Dennis', 
I must really want a kid. 

229
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,640
Go to the doctor and get a
blood test so you know for sure. 

230
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,390
And while you're there, 
try get me some adderall. 

231
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,350
I'm trapped here. I canít believe this. 

232
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,310
Well, I canít believe the best friend
I've ever had would try and leave me. 

233
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,580
Cooter, look at this place. 

234
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,270
This canít be what you want in life. 

235
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,690
Havenít you ever thought of leaving?

236
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,460
Of course. Every day. 

237
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,970
Every day for two years. 

238
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,350
Look at these resignation letters. 

239
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,470
They're written in ketchup, 
dirty rock, leak water. 

240
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,270
And now you're here. You're here
and everything's gonna be better. 

241
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,450
Now we've got pens. Glorious pens!

242
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,690
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. They're caps. 

243
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,850
Nothing but caps. 

244
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,280
- Cooter- -
that's not my name!

245
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,420
My name is James Reilly. 

246
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,360
Cooter berger? What do you
think I am, a cartoon dog?

247
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,730
The president named me that. 

248
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,980
He gave you two nicknames?

249
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,800
"Cooter" because I look like a turtle

250
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,600
and "berger" because he saw
me eating a hamburger one time. 

251
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,680
We have toet out of here. 

252
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,100
Now that's the spirit. 

253
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,970
But if they're not taking
resignations, there's only one way out. 

254
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,530
We have to work together to get fired. 

255
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,200
It wasnít even a hamburger. 

256
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,440
It was a sandwich. 

257
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,680
- Hello, Elizabeth. 
- Dennis, what are you doing here?

258
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,870
I donít have to explain myself to you. 

259
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,250
Look, I told my mom I got a job, 

260
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,480
so I've been coming here for the
past couple weeks during the day. 

261
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,010
- What?
- How come you're not at work?

262
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,180
Because foot my computer--
no, why am I-- this is my apartment. 

263
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,680
- There something you want to tell me?
- No. 

264
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,920
Elizabeth, this is Melinda
from Dr. Bouvier's office. 

265
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,160
We'll try to reach you again later. 

266
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,120
I know that message
and I know that tone. 

267
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,210
Every one of my sisters got that message
junior year in high school-- you're pregnant!

268
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,640
- What? No!
- Really? All right. 

269
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,990
Prnatal vitamins. Yeah, I
know what "prenatal" means. 

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,250
Pre, "before";  Natal, "ruined".

271
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,950
- Oh, my god. 
- All right, first things first. 

272
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,100
We're gonna have this baby at the same hospital
i was born at on Coney Island. All right?

273
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,300
Oh, my god!

274
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,700
Secondly, if it's a boy, we're gonna name
him Morpheus like that guy in the Matrix. 

275
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,850
If it's a
girl--ooh, yeah. 

276
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,550
I used to boff this chick named
Judy, and I would love to honor her. 

277
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,760
Get out of my apartment. 

278
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,170
Donít talk to me like that. 

279
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,810
- Morpheus hears everything that you say. 
- Out!

280
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,860
Your boobs are gonna get bigger. 

281
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,730
You must have been such a pretty monkey. 

282
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,270
What's that, miss Maroney?

283
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,340
It's your personal essay, Kenneth. 

284
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,120
Ohhello. I didnít see you there. 

285
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,670
I was just thinking about
my friend, Kenneth Parcell, 

286
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,090
and how much he personifies
the olympic spirit. 

287
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,950
He's involved in charity work. 

288
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,480
- You needed me, miss Maroney?
- Yes. 

289
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,770
Kenneth, can you take this money to the
many charities I support anonymously?

290
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,370
Of course. Oh, miss
Maroney, this is empt--

291
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,240
he knows the importance
of physical fitness. 

292
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,810
I mean, he can lift almost 100 pounds1

293
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:24,770
* Mind, body, spirit Kenneth, *

294
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,160
* I see myself in you *

295
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,610
* so brave *

296
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,540
* so ready to be all that you can do *

297
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,600
* so beautiful in every way *

298
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,520
* I see myself in you *

299
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,940
miss Maroney, thank you!

300
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,450
I have 20 minutes. I'm gonna make it!

301
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,320
I see myself in you. 

302
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,460
Oh, Kenneth, someone was looking for you. 

303
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,980
They need 12 boxes of
copier paper on stage one. 

304
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,750
Duty before self. 

305
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,770
I will not fail you, Rainbow Chicken. 

306
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,530
whatever we come up with
has gotta be wasteful, 

307
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,620
embarrassing to tion, and
upsetting to the voters. 

308
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,500
Holy smoke!

309
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,770
What have you got?

310
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,130
In 1994, the pentagon explored the possibility
of a non-lethal chemical weapon thque, 

311
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,950
uce enemy soldiers coosture by
making them totally gay-nes for eaer. "

312
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,070
How gay?

313
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,150
It doesnít say. The project was
abandoned in the planning stages. 

314
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,210
Of course it was. 

315
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,100
It would've been expensive, impractical, 

316
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,880
and offensive to both the red
states and the gayer blue states. 

317
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,540
This is exactly what we're looking for. 

318
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,290
A guaranteed disaster. 

319
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,050
Like eating a burrito before sex. 

320
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,340
But where would we get the money?

321
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,700
No congressman in his right
mind would support this. 

322
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,580
Donít worry, I've got
a friend in congress. 

323
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,150
But not your best friend, right?

324
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,590
Yo, Frank. 

325
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,160
Oh, my god. 
Is that--

326
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,660
yes. It's just the prototype. 

327
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,970
But I want you to be
the first to play it. 

328
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,710
- Tell me what you think. 
- This is such an honor. 

329
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,340
I got anadal filth by" credit. 

330
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,390
You earnt. 

331
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,550
Good job, Parcell. 

332
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,080
Too bad it cost you a trip to China. 

333
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,120
Wait a minute. Who's this paper for?

334
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,910
No one!

335
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,130
Looks like you only have 30 seconds to
get your application to the 27th floor. 

336
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,150
And you're not gonna make it. 

337
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,630
Run, Kenneth, run!

338
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,460
Oh, mommy!

339
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:05,820
He knows!

340
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,950
Oh, god, call me, Jack! This is a disaster. 

341
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,460
This baby's gonna have a father. 

342
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,440
Look out!

343
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,110
What?

344
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,550
A gay bomb?

345
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,410
You dragged me out
of a meeting for this?

346
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,980
I was gonna meet bono. 

347
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,810
C. C. -- Representative
cunningham. 

348
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,760
We'll keep this professional. 

349
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,810
I did certain things for you in bed
that you were going to reciprocate, 

350
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,200
but then we broke up before my birthday. 

351
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,480
So you owe me. 

352
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,080
This could take weeks to get approved. 

353
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:20,910
I'll take my chances. 

354
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,850
And that would mean I'd be
spending my birthday here, so. . . 

355
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,770
all right, I will help you ged. 

356
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,970
Yes! I am so on a roll. 

357
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,660
No crying in my bath tonight. 

358
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,540
hey, Jack, it's Liz. 

359
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,820
Um, maybe you're busy
spreading democracy. 

360
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,520
Anyway, give me a call. 

361
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,720
Things are happening!

362
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,780
Hey, it's Liz Lemon. Funny story. 

363
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,600
I think I'm pregnant
with Dennis Duffy's baby. 

364
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,070
Thought you'd be super proud. 

365
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,770
Oh, in a way, it's what I wanted. 

366
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,130
Yeah, it's gonna be fine. 

367
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,140
He knows! Oh, god, call
me, Jack! This is a disaster. 

368
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,080
This baby's gonna have a father!

369
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,220
What--Kenneth just did
a flip into the elevator!

370
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,280
Jack, I've spent the last
hour looking at cribs online. 

371
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,880
It's crazy. Even with all this Dennis
stuff all I can think about is baby hair

372
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:26,620
and converting my laundry and
newspaper pile into a nursery. 

373
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,640
So I donít want you to worry
about me, because, um, I'm happy. 

374
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh, and yes, you hear me eating ìSabor de
Soledadî 'cause I can eat whatever I want now. 

375
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,650
Oh, hang on. That's my doctor. 

376
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,250
Never mind. I am
not, um-- never mind. 

377
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,790
Lemon, how are you?

378
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,750
- It was the cheese curls. 
- Pardon?

379
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,020
Causing the false positives
on my home pregnancy tests. 

380
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:08,150
Apparently, ìSabor de Soledadî gets its special
tangy flavor from evaporated bull semen. 

381
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,950
Oh, that explains your
hair's thickness and shine. 

382
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,720
I guess in Mexico women use it to stop
their periods before cinco de mayo. 

383
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,810
I'm a little afraid to ask
if you're still eating them. 

384
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,560
They're so good. 

385
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,110
Lemon, I'm sorry you had to
go through this by yourself. 

386
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,670
No, it's okay. 

387
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,270
I was actually ready to
have Dennis Duffy's baby. 

388
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,740
I guess I'm getting to that age where
I donít care what anybody thinks of me. 

389
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,290
If you're going to want to get a
very short haircut, resist that urge. 

390
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,320
And I know now that
I'm definitely ready. 

391
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,090
I want to adopt. 

392
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,000
Are you sure? What about
artificial insemination?

393
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,410
No, I canít go to a sperm bank. 
The Duffy men use those like atms. 

394
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,010
Then, Lemon. . . I want to assist you. 

395
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,740
What?

396
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,210
With an adoption! Oh, good
lord, Lemon! With an adoption. 

397
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,090
I know a lot of well-connected people. 

398
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,500
Okay then, yeah. Help me, thanks. 

399
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,240
Um, how was your day?

400
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,620
Oh, it was good. 

401
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,510
The president gave me a nickname. 

402
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,660
The Jacker. 

403
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,240
Yeah. 

404
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,500
Three Months Later

405
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,350
The Pentagon

406
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,880
Gentlemen, I regret to inform you that the
gay bomb could not be effectively weaponized. 

407
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,030
The chemical dissipates harmlessly
in open tactical environments. 

408
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,960
And Frankly, could only work if somehow we could
get the enemy into a closed, unventilated space. 

409
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,150
Ooh, pens!

410
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,210
I feel weird. 

411
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,540
Let's do this. 

412
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
30 Rockefeller Center

413
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,260
Dude, I played this
thing for a couple hours. 

414
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,470
It's okay, I guess. 

415
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:46,670
Frank, you've been in your
office for three months

416
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,980
What?

417
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,360
Yes, I'm gonna be a billionaire!

418
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,610
Hotel Room, Beijing



9999
