1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,915
are you makin' waffles?

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:04,025
No,quiet.

3
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,755
Somebody is,and the maple
syrup smells delicious.

4
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:07,875
jack russell terrier?

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,925
no,I can't get a dog.
- you should.

6
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,660
A dog'll change your life.

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,065
Hey,I just wanted to make sure

8
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:17,345
you're practicing your rerun dance
for the what's happening sketch.

9
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:20,055
I'm trying,liz lemon,but
I can't concentrate.

10
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:23,785
Somebody on my block is making
waffles,and it's makin' me horny!

11
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:25,185
Wait,you smell
maple syrup too?

12
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:26,815
You live all the way in jersey.

13
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:27,665
That's weird.

14
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:28,520
Hold on.

15
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,355
Hello?

16
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:32,995
Do you smell maple syrup?
- Yes!

17
00:00:33,095 --> 00:00:35,505
Don't panic,lemon. It's
probably not a chemical attack.

18
00:00:35,605 --> 00:00:36,965
What do you mean "probably"?

19
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:40,885
It's probably just a strange wind pattern
coming off those factories in staten island,

20
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:42,650
where food flavors are made.

21
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,105
I don't think
it's northrax.

22
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:45,615
What's northrax?

23
00:00:45,715 --> 00:00:48,455
It's a chemical agent we sold
to the saudis in the 1980s.

24
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,635
It smells exactly
like maple syrup.

25
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,405
But I don't think this is it.

26
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:53,775
Well,how do you know?

27
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,890
Because northrax kills
you within ten seconds.

28
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,120
Okay,I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

32
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,215
Make me look like this.

33
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:29,020
Right,like that's a stretch.

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,865
Hey,jack,thanks for
that call last night.

35
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:34,775
I get really nut burgers over
this homeland security stuff.

36
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,125
Always check with me first,lemon.

37
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:38,350
I have nsa connections.
- Good.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,585
Didn't you just get a
haircut two days ago?

39
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:42,125
I get my haircut every two days.

40
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:44,415
After all,your
hair is your head suit.

41
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,545
I'm going to a party tonight
honoring robert novak.

42
00:01:46,645 --> 00:01:48,745
It's being thrown by john
mccain and john bauer.

43
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:50,395
Um,I don't think he's real.

44
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:53,425
Oh,I assure you,lemon,john
mccain is very real.

45
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:54,525
I have to look perfect.

46
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:57,915
When it comes to hair,no one is
more bitchy than conservative males.

47
00:01:58,015 --> 00:01:59,555
Good lord,donaghy.

48
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:02,830
Did you comb your hair
with a chicken bone?

49
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,195
They can be brutal.

50
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:07,435
Well,have fun.

51
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:10,185
Don't get peer pressured
into invading iran.

52
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:14,070
Oh,uh,before you go,I'd
like you to put this on.

53
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,085
Sheinhardt wig
company? What's this?

54
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:18,165
A way to show support
for our parent company,

55
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:21,158
which is having a little
p.R.Hiccup right now.

56
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:21,798
{\a6}NOT POISONING RIVERS SINCE 1997

57
00:02:21,897 --> 00:02:22,920
All right. Thanks.

58
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,015
Picked up your tuxedo from
the cleaners,mr.Donaghy.

59
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:26,045
Just like you asked.

60
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:26,995
Thank you,kenneth.

61
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:29,435
Let me just take
this plastic off.

62
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,775
'Cause I saw on martha stewart how
we're all doing everything wrong.

63
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,755
Where are the pants?

64
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:36,585
Sweet peaches!
What have I done?

65
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:38,635
Somewhere along the way,they
must have slipped out the bottom.

66
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,730
It's all right,kenneth.
These things happen.

67
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,725
Uncle butch was right.

68
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:46,095
I'm just a stupid country bumpkin
with great skin and soft hands.

69
00:02:46,195 --> 00:02:47,945
I'll just have jonathan
bring over another pair.

70
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:49,885
No,sir. This is my mistake.

71
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:51,605
I will replace your pants.

72
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,495
They cost $2,500.

73
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,140
I will find your pants!

74
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,870
All right! My
prescription shampoo!

75
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,465
who is it?

76
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:11,260
Hi,I have your mail.
I live across the hall.

77
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,175
H- hi,I didn't even realize
anyone had moved in over here.

78
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:16,990
Welcome.

79
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,225
I'M...liz. What's your name?

80
00:03:25,325 --> 00:03:26,340
Raheem.

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,045
Raheem. That's-
that's my mother's name.

82
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,595
No,it- no,I'm
just kidding.

83
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:33,390
Give me my package,please.
- okay.

84
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,480
Well,it was nice to meet...

85
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,355
coming up next,candace van der
shark,a lifetime intimate portrait.

86
00:03:44,455 --> 00:03:46,095
Have you met the
guy across the hall?

87
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:47,385
Raheem? Yeah,he's a good egg.

88
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,395
He's weird. He
wouldn't shake my hand.

89
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,525
And I think it's
because i'm a woman.

90
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,725
And get this-he's got
maps all over his walls.

91
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,910
Maps.
- Maps?

92
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,720
You mean like that one?

93
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,225
That's different,that's-
that's an antique.

94
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,655
And I'm a white lady.

95
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,255
What are you saying there,liz?

96
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:06,035
Pete,you know me.

97
00:04:06,135 --> 00:04:08,175
I never make assumptions about race.

98
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:11,295
Remember,I asked that black
guy if he had seen sideways?

99
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:12,425
But this guy...

100
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:13,345
I don't like him.

101
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,495
You're being paranoid.
Raheem is a really nice guy.

102
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:16,825
And he's always helping.

103
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,825
He rewired the
toaster oven,and...

104
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,655
he showed me a back
way to the airport.

105
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:21,705
Listen to yourself,pete.

106
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:26,320
I don't want to sound racist,but
that pita pocket might be a terrorist.

107
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,495
That sound racist?

108
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:31,170
this rich chestnut color is natural?

109
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,160
Excuse me.

110
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,155
Whiskey,straight up.

111
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:39,485
I'll have a white rum with diet
ginger ale and a splash of lime.

112
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:43,525
Wow,I never would have pegged you for
a university of tennessee sorority girl.

113
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:44,885
Well,you've got to pace
yourself with these things.

114
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,885
We go all night.
- That's good advice.

115
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:50,210
Unfortunately,I promised bill
frist the next slow dance.

116
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,270
I'm C.C.
- Jack.

117
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,990
Nice haircut.

118
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,740
Sir,here's your nancy drew.

119
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,650
For men,it's called a hardy boy.

120
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,965
Hey,kk,how's it hangin'?

121
00:05:17,065 --> 00:05:19,135
Very low,sir. Very low.

122
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,735
I lost something real important.

123
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:22,405
You know what I do
when I lose something?

124
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,405
I yell real loud
until I find it.

125
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:26,525
So what is it that you lost?
- Pants.

126
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:31,735
Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants!Pants!

127
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:32,645
How 'bout the sean johns?

128
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:34,440
Were you chafing again,tray?

129
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,645
I don't think that's gonna
help me find mr.Donaghy's pants.

130
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:39,375
Well,did you retrace your steps?

131
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:40,495
Or go back to
the drycleaners?

132
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,545
Yes,obvious twins.

133
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:44,795
And I tried looking in the
last place you'd ever expect.

134
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:49,915
And,no,mr.Donaghy's pants are not in the ladies'
room at that laser tag place on 12th avenue.

135
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,355
It's no use.

136
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:52,905
I'm just gonna
have to replace 'em.

137
00:05:53,005 --> 00:05:55,325
But where am i
ever gonna get $2,500?

138
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:59,480
Well,why don't you just do like I do
and sell your autograph at the car show?

139
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,625
* What the worid
needs now is love *

140
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:12,785
* sweet love it's
the only thing that *

141
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:16,395
* there's just
too little of *

142
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:19,190
* what the worid needs now *

143
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,910
What the what?

144
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,320
IF YOU SEE SOMETHING,SAY SOMETHING

145
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,240
IF YOU SUSPECT
ANYTHING,DO EVERYTHING

146
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,220
WE DON'T POISON THE
WORLD.TERRORISTS DO.

147
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,745
Thank you for an
incredible night.

148
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:12,235
Really? Did you
have a good time?

149
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:13,475
'Cause I really did.

150
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:14,455
Unbelievably good.

151
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:17,355
And thank you for letting me
try the thing I tried. I'M...

152
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:18,625
sorry I dropped you.

153
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:20,355
Oh,no,it was great.

154
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:23,080
I mean,who knew that
ottoman had wheels,right?

155
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,690
Well,I gotta get to work.

156
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,935
Uh,when can i
see you again?

157
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,930
Anytime. You name it.

158
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,025
congressman cunningham,it is a
pleasure to have you on our program.

159
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,700
Hi,dan. Thank
you for having me.

160
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,260
Celeste cunningham.

161
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,350
C.C.

162
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,485
You didn't tell me
you're a congresswoman!

163
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,600
I just ended my first year.

164
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,425
but also on some
of your constituents.

165
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,155
"D"?

166
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:00,135
Vermont?

167
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,615
Big business is
out to get us again.

168
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,365
The sheinhardt wig
company has dumped

169
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:09,315
thousands of gallons of auburn fantasy
dye #260 into the chickotagua river,

170
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:12,525
turning the children
of chickotagua orange.

171
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,335
And I will not
rest until this company

172
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:18,090
and all of its subsidiaries are
held financially responsible!

173
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,225
Why do you have this?

174
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:23,795
I run a sheinhardt wig
subsidiary called nbc.

175
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:24,985
Oh,my god.

176
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:26,655
You're jack donaghy?

177
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:29,035
What were you even doing
at that party last night?

178
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,945
Oh,my god. This was a mistake.

179
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,505
Forget about what I said. I can
never be seen with you again.

180
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,455
You're right.

181
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,765
We have to pretend that
this never happened.

182
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,660
Yeah,I have to
get out of here.

183
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,435
Damn it,the worst part is...

184
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:43,690
I really liked you a lot.

185
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,115
I gave her the
ottoman,and she walked out.

186
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:53,735
Sir,I typed up that letter.

187
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:54,935
Hey,uh...

188
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,145
what do you need,lemon?

189
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,015
Nothing,I just,uh...

190
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,295
it can wait.

191
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:03,130
Lemon,there's nothing you could say to me
that you can't say in front of jonathan.

192
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,745
I think my middle eastern neighbor is
a terrorist,and I don't know what to do.

193
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:07,535
That's ridiculous,lemon.

194
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:10,425
Some of our greatest patriots have
been of middle eastern descent.

195
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:14,300
And I'm appalled to hear you engage
in racial profiling like that.

196
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,745
I'm kidding.

197
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:20,155
Be an
american-call it in.

198
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:23,885
This is the number of a friend of mine in a
very high-level position at homeland security.

199
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,265
Oh,no,not- now
I don't know.

200
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,635
Maybe I'm just
being paranoid.

201
00:09:26,735 --> 00:09:29,265
If a bleeding heart liberal
like you has any suspicions...

202
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,240
I know,right?

203
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,455
Nice ring tone,jack.

204
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:35,765
That's not my ring tone.

205
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,835
I hate that san
francisco sound.

206
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,095
How am I calling myself?

207
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:41,890
This isn't even my phone.

208
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,615
Jack?
- C.C.?

209
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:45,105
I think I have your phone.

210
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:48,085
Yeah,you must have
grabbed it by accident.

211
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,720
After our night of doing it.

212
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,060
Take the freight elevator to the
sixth floor,and I'll be right down.

213
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,695
are you all right?

214
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,620
Well,last night I...

215
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,915
never mind.

216
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:02,895
These verizon wireless
phones are just so popular.

217
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:05,835
I accidentally grabbed one
belonging to an acquaintance.

218
00:10:05,935 --> 00:10:08,805
Well,sure,'cause that verizon
wireless service is just unbeatable.

219
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:10,385
I mean,if I saw a
phone like that on tv,

220
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:14,485
I would be like,"where is my
nearest retailer so I can...get one?"

221
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:16,580
Can we have our money now?

222
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,270
Come on... big money.

223
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,670
This ketchup expired two years ago.

224
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,915
Dude,how much would I have to
pay you to eat this whole bottle?

225
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:34,000
Honestly?

226
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,555
I got all the way to harlem when I
heard wagner coming from my phone.

227
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:46,435
Harlem?

228
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,515
I'm working out of the clinton
offices for a few weeks.

229
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,375
I'm helping hillary retool her
universal health care platform.

230
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:55,105
God,I wanna kiss you on the mouth to stop
you from saying such ridiculous things.

231
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:56,575
Here's your phone.

232
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:58,605
Obviously,we can never
be seen together again.

233
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,155
Obviously-I'm up for the
chairmanship,and I don't wanna risk that.

234
00:11:01,255 --> 00:11:02,555
They give you a
helicopter,you know.

235
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:03,485
What about me?

236
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,665
How can I look those little
orange children in the eye?

237
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,545
They have no other documented
health problems,you know.

238
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:10,185
They're orange!

239
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:11,685
This is why I got
into politics-

240
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:14,005
to stop big companies from
hurting the little guy.

241
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,980
What happened to you
that made you this way?

242
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,425
In 1998,I got shot in the
face by my neighbor's dog.

243
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:23,595
Oh,C.C.,I'm
so- wait,what?

244
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:27,105
My neighbor had a riverton hunting
rifle with a faulty trigger safety.

245
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,675
One day,his jack russell
terrier started chewing the area,

246
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,315
the gun went off,and
shot me in the face.

247
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:32,620
No.

248
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,355
A terrier?

249
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:37,805
So I did what was right: I sued
riverton,my neighbor,and the dog.

250
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,035
C.C.,I'm so sorry.

251
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,995
Well,don't be.

252
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:43,815
After six reconstructive surgeries, I'm
much better-looking now than I used to be.

253
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:45,915
Plus,they made a
lifetime movie about me.

254
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:49,865
tonight on lifetime,candace van der
shark stars as celeste cunningham

255
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:53,995
A dog took my face and gave me a
better face to change the worid:

256
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:56,135
The celeste cunningham story

257
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:58,825
You know,I thought you
made love like an ugly girl.

258
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:01,660
So present,so grateful.

259
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,675
Who's that?

260
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:26,565
Nobody.

261
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:27,735
Don't lie to me,jack.

262
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:30,305
I've had plenty of women
mad at me the morning after.

263
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:33,105
Just don't let her light your
sneakers on fire in the bathtub.

264
00:12:33,205 --> 00:12:34,975
Oh,she would never do that,tracy.

265
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:36,555
She's a very special woman.

266
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,065
So then what's the problem?

267
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:40,715
Well,we're just on
opposite sides of a feud.

268
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:43,455
Oh,I get it: Romeo and juliet.

269
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,915
Capulets and romulans.

270
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,535
Mm-hmm,I've been there.

271
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,895
I'm black,she's white.

272
00:12:47,995 --> 00:12:49,745
I'm black,she's
light-skinned black.

273
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,785
I'm black,she's 17.

274
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:55,285
Hey,listen,if she's your
soul mate,you go for it.

275
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:56,775
Tracy,I don't
believe in soul mates.

276
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:59,845
I worked too hard to get where I
am to sacrifice it for some woman.

277
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,035
I don't care if she
is beautiful,brilliant,

278
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:04,600
and she does it like
her dad's a minister.

279
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,385
Sir,that was impressive!

280
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:13,795
My feet are puffed up real bad.

281
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:16,985
Dude,let us give you the rest
of the money for donaghy's pants.

282
00:13:17,085 --> 00:13:18,565
No,mr.Rossitano.

283
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:23,175
We parcells are neither wealthy
nor circumcised,but we are proud.

284
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:25,035
I have to earn that money.

285
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:27,185
All right,I got a job for you.

286
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,970
Every night after dinner,lutz falls
asleep on the couch in our office.

287
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,020
Can I help you?

288
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,885
Pete!Pete!

289
00:13:45,985 --> 00:13:46,860
Pete!

290
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,700
Raheem!

291
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,875
Ready to go?

292
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:51,805
You guys are going out?
- Yeah.

293
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:55,495
My buddy,raheem,invited me
out with him to celebrate.

294
00:13:55,595 --> 00:13:57,825
He just completed some big
project he's been working on.

295
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:02,130
Soon everyone will know
the name raheem haddad.

296
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,475
Hi,I'm not
sure,but-

297
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:27,070
who is he,and
where can we find him?

298
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,145
Hey,C.C.

299
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:34,405
We're having a barbecue
tonight. You're welcome to come.

300
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:36,370
Thanks. Maybe I will.

301
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,435
Get the gun away from the dog.

302
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:42,635
Hey,hon,have you
seen my hunting rifle?

303
00:14:42,735 --> 00:14:45,125
Last time I saw
it... the dog had it.

304
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:47,310
What is wrong
with you people?

305
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,990
I'm going to get into politics!

306
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,580
Got him!

307
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,490
Ape attack!

308
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,525
Ape attack.

309
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,550
Smarts!

310
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,040
Are you okay?

311
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,375
Okay,that went too far.

312
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:32,690
I still need $700.

313
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,370
What's next?

314
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,505
You know that old
lady in accounting...

315
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,065
who thinks you're her
husband who died in the war?

316
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,270
What about her?

317
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,225
I do believe in destiny.

318
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:49,990
And I know that i should
hate you,but I can'T.

319
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,595
I love you.

320
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:52,915
And I don't care
what people say.

321
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:55,830
We were meant to be
in each other's lives.

322
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,590
You're right,C.C.

323
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,900
Some dudes took
raheem last night.

324
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,035
sounds like an american hero
saw something and said something.

325
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:14,555
Elizabeth lemon,I can't
believe you did that.

326
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:15,995
Raheem is a good guy!

327
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,145
You seem to be defending
raheem an awful lot.

328
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,405
I'd hate to have to
make another phone call.

329
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:21,335
No,we're cool.

330
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:23,025
Uh,I renounce raheem.

331
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,960
Raheem's a bad guy.

332
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,970
Usa number one!

333
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,615
Tracy,I need your help.

334
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:33,875
I've gotta go somewhere,and I can't
be seen,and cabs don't go there.

335
00:16:33,975 --> 00:16:35,370
Sure,where is it?

336
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,205
Clinton's office in harlem.

337
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:38,285
I know where that building is.

338
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,820
I get my jamaican meat pies there.

339
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,130
Finally,my scalp rx.

340
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,795
I know you are in the media.Please
get this in the right hands.Raheem

341
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,620
Oh,my god.

342
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,355
I am raheem haddad.

343
00:16:57,455 --> 00:16:59,425
And this is my
brother hakim.

344
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:05,115
And these are the reasons you should choose us
to be the next contestants on the amazing race!

345
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:06,615
Amazing what?

346
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:09,800
THE AMAZING RACE****

347
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,575
We love to travel.

348
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,425
Look at all the
places we have been:

349
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:20,560
Toronto,munich,london,the
hoover dam,the cleve.

350
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,215
Oh,boy.

351
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:26,740
we are in good shape for
the road blocks and detours.

352
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,315
Come on,go!

353
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,465
Oh,no,oh,no.

354
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,240
we love america!

355
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,420
Oh,no.

356
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,610
Oh,no.

357
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,370
jonathan...

358
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,880
I purchased a replacement
pair of mr.Donaghy's pants.

359
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,440
You must love
him as much as I do.

360
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,490
C.C.,Look out the
window onto 125th street.

361
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,595
You shouldn't be here.

362
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:11,005
I know I shouldn'T.
I can't help myself.

363
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,185
I wanna be with you!

364
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:15,105
Tell her you want your privates
and her privates to do a high-five.

365
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:16,495
Okay,tray,I got this.

366
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,145
Jack,we hardly
know each other.

367
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:21,105
This could be career suicide
for both of us,and you know it!

368
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:22,485
I don't care anymore.

369
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:25,595
I saw your movie- what you said
to that dog about soul mates.

370
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:27,865
I think I might be the dog.

371
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:31,375
Tell her her butt look like a
apple and you wanna take a bite.

372
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:33,285
Buzz me in,okay?

373
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:36,725
Tell her she got some tig ol' biddies
like the dallas cowboy cheerleaders.

374
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,625
Tell her you want her to donate
her body to science,and you science.

375
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:41,160
Tell her,jack!

376
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,935
I've been going crazy these last few
days,thinking about our night together.

377
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:48,755
How you wanted to brush
my hair as foreplay.

378
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:51,575
How you made me that
western omelet at 4:00 A.M.

379
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:53,405
I never met anyone like you,jack.

380
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:54,885
Be with me,C.C.

381
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:58,055
We'll ignore our differences till
the sex goes bad,then we'll...

382
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:00,300
walk away bitter and angry.

383
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,895
Nobody can know
we're together.

384
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:04,815
Not even your friend
tracy jordan out there.

385
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:06,595
I don't think you have
to worry about tracy.

386
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:10,065
Stop eatin' people's old french
fries,pigeon. Have some self-respect.

387
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:12,210
Don't you know you can fly?

388
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,180
I don'T...

389
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,800
I've never had a
secret affair before.

390
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,880
What do you say we go find
a spot and defile this place?

391
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,005
Raheem. Hey,buddy!

392
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,875
Where ya been all week?

393
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,335
They put electrodes
on my testicles,liz.

394
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,375
Who did?

395
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:48,940
Oh,you... remembered my name.

396
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,965
America's government shocked my nuts.

397
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,365
No,I'm pretty sure they're not
allowed to do that type of thing.

398
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:58,445
They say,"raheem...why
you no shake hands?"

399
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:01,285
I say,"because I don't want
sickness before amazing race."

400
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:03,725
They say,"raheem,why all
the trips to the airport?"

401
00:20:03,825 --> 00:20:06,040
I say,"because I'm practicing
for the amazing race!"

402
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,955
And then,"zzt!Zzt!"
In my underpanties!

403
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,960
Do you have any idea
who... turned you in?

404
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,130
No...

405
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,085
but I am just
so angry now.

406
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:18,035
I have so much anger inside.

407
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,530
I want to do something
spectacular with it.

408
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,650
Northrax.

409
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,970
Hey! I made waffles.

410
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,380
thank god.
- Yeah.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
