1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,595
Hey,I wanted to come say merry christmas
before we all leave for the break.

2
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:10,445
Oh,thank you,lemon.
That's very thoughtful.

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:12,545
Help yourself to a gift.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,060
It's our new handheld photo
scanner/paper shredder.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,045
Oh,well,won't people just
end up shredding their photos?

6
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,375
No,no,it's very to use.

7
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:23,795
If you want to
pto-scan,you flip the stc.S.

8
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:26,680
And if you want to paper
shred,you flip the switch to--

9
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,810
I'd like to make
an announcement!

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,345
I just want to say that I'm really sorry for
whatever I'm going to do at the party tonight.

11
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:42,815
And I forgive all of you in advance for leaving
me passed out by the elevator in my own gravy.

12
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:45,035
Merry ludachristmas,everyone!

13
00:00:45,135 --> 00:00:47,685
Are you gonna do horny
santa again,frank?

14
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:51,210
That was so funny last
year when I sat on your lap.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,570
Yes,funny.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,555
So big plans for the holidays?

17
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,395
Yeah,my parents are
coming with my brother,

18
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:59,885
and we're gonna go see
jersey boys on broadway.

19
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:02,715
And we're gonna go to that restaurant
where they pretend it's mars.

20
00:01:02,815 --> 00:01:04,755
God,you must be a ball
of anxiety right now.

21
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:05,755
No,I'm really excited.

22
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:06,745
What are you trying to say,lemon?

23
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,525
That your family's perfect
and you never fight?

24
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:12,685
No,I remember them arguing a
lot during the gas crisis of '79.

25
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:15,895
But since carter left office,it's
been pretty smooth sailing.

26
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,295
You got that right.

27
00:01:17,395 --> 00:01:19,085
So is your mom
coming up from florida?

28
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:22,065
No,I invited her out of
my paralyzing irish guilt,

29
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,370
but her plane was grounded
because of hurricane zapato.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,345
Look at that!

31
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:30,460
That's where she lives.
Jupiter,the eye of the storm-

32
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,785
So are you alone for christmas?

33
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,885
No,I was gonna drive up to
vermont and surprise C.C.

34
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:37,210
Sir!

35
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,445
Your mother is here.

36
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:39,865
She took a bus to atlanta.

37
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:42,775
She got jet blue to accept an
amtrak ticket. - Tell her I'm--

38
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,675
jingle bells,jingle
bells,jingle bells surprise!

39
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,410
It's your mother. Merry christmas.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Jack...

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,755
isn't this the
office you had before?

42
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:56,465
I thought you were up
for a big promotion.

43
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:59,635
I am,mother,and there are only two
nicer offices in the whole building.

44
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:01,735
Only two? I don't like the odds.

45
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,560
I think you better
let that dream go.

46
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,990
Hello,liz!

47
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,385
What the hell was th?

48
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,475
It's a message on my
phone from a friend.

49
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:12,825
Oh,jackie,please. Who is she?

50
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:13,905
Her name is C.C.

51
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:14,925
Is she spanish?

52
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:16,035
What if she was,?

53
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,925
She's very smart,colleen.
You'd like her.

54
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:20,500
My thanks to the peanut gallery.

55
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,605
Jack,this coat isn't
going to take itself off.

Ludachristmas is tonight?

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,085
Well,I guess I can make it.

61
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:53,565
I just hope i don't get drunk and sing
christmas carols like I did last year.

62
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:56,975
Well,I'm not going,because my parents
and my brother mitch are in town.

63
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,490
Mitch is here?
- Yes.

64
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,635
For those of you who
don't know my brother,

65
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:04,835
mitch was in a skiing accident
his senior year of high school,

66
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,060
and he has what's called
trauma-induced niveaphasia.

67
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,790
Basically he's just stuck in
the day before his accident.

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,730
Oh,tomorrow's the big day!

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,925
It's gonna be totally rad!

70
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,150
Yeah,mitch,rad!

71
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,805
He thinks it's 1985. So if
you meet him,just be cool.

72
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:30,265
It should be mentioned that
sexually mitch is very much an adult.

73
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,515
No,it should not be mentioned.

74
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:36,210
Merry christmas from
sheinhart-universal,everyone.

75
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,905
Merry christmas.
- Thank you!

76
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:39,295
Merry christmas.

77
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:40,915
Merry jewish.

78
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:42,425
Merry christmas.

79
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,495
What is this?

80
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:46,450
It's a ps-575
photo shredder.

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,505
Well,that's not
the christmas spirit.

82
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,335
Christmas is about
gratitude and togetherness.

83
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:58,780
Sitting with friends and family around a
crackling fire waiting for the owl meat to cook.

84
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,440
Sometimes I don't think you
people understand christmas at all.

85
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,705
Hi,I think I'm early.

86
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,770
I'm here to have christmas meats
eaten off my chest at some party.

87
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,375
Merry christmas,ms. Lemon.

88
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:19,475
Oh,thank you,kenneth.

89
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,855
Well,fancy suits. How was court?

90
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:26,155
Not great,beth.

91
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:27,835
Oh,you really
were in court?

92
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,905
all tray had to do was sign
his community service papers.

93
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,485
But he makes a stop
for breakfast first.

94
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:37,205
So it's my fault diners can
serve alcohol in new york state?

95
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:38,885
That's on me now?

96
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:40,935
Now I have to
wear this for 30 days.

97
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:41,895
Oh,my goodness.

98
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,245
If I even had a drop
of alcohol in my sweat,

99
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:48,610
a signal goes to ankle bracelet
headquarters in denver,and I go to jail.

100
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,165
And now? This
time of the year?

101
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:57,395
Ludachristmas?
Nude year's eve?

102
00:04:57,495 --> 00:05:00,105
Martin luther king day?
All you do is drink.

103
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:02,885
No,tracy,you are not going
to ludachristmas. - But--

104
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:05,415
the three of you are in charge
of keeping him from drinking.

105
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,310
Okay. But who's
project manager?

106
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,830
Hmm,that bad,huh?

107
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,645
Oh,these aren't for me.

108
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:19,275
I'm sending them to my mother's hotel room
because the room service there is too salty.

109
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,695
Family stuff can be tough.

110
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:22,165
Lemon party!

111
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:24,295
Permission to land!

112
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:26,475
Permission granted!

113
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:28,650
There's my baby!

114
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,035
Hey,liz,you want to go skiing
up at piper's peak tomorrow?

115
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:33,405
It's gonna be rad.

116
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:35,095
Psych! You can't go!

117
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:37,055
It's the senior class trip!

118
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:39,880
Oh,psych! You
got me,mitch!

119
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,675
Jack,these are my parents.

120
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,055
Dick lemon. This
is my boy mitch.

121
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,525
And my first wife margaret.

122
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,595
First and last,hi!
- Jack donaghy.

123
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,995
You are a very,very handsome man.

124
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:54,705
He looks like an
arrow shirt model.

125
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:59,555
So,jack,is this beautiful
genius the best employee

126
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:02,070
you've ever had or what?

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
No.

128
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,125
I like this guy's honesty.

129
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:13,595
Yeah,me too.

130
00:06:13,695 --> 00:06:15,885
Show us what you've been working on...

131
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:17,985
wilma shakespeare.

132
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,495
Oh,I'm just so proud of you.

133
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh,you boota boota boota!

134
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,350
Nice to meet you,sir.
- Yeah.

135
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,810
Would you wrap these up and send
them to the ritz-carlton,please?

136
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,325
Oh,my goodness!

137
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,425
Look at this!

138
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:50,580
They built all of this because
of your words you wrote.

139
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,830
Thank you,thank you.

140
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,485
Hey,liz,guess who's
going skiing with me?

141
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:58,340
Chris stanek,your boyfriend!

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,575
Aw,what? Shut up!

143
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:01,700
I don't like him! Boys are gross!

144
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,075
Did you hear that chris
stanek got divorced?

145
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,375
When? Is he dating again?

146
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,135
lemon,could I have a word
with you for a moment?

147
00:07:08,235 --> 00:07:10,235
Oh,excuse me.

148
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,185
Is,uh,everything okay?
- Yeah,why?

149
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,505
Your family is strange.

150
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:19,065
Oh,mitch? No,he was in a skiing
accident,and he thinks it's 1985.

151
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:21,720
No,I get it. I'm talking
about your parents.

152
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,945
What did your mother mean when she
said that you were a beautiful genius?

153
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,285
Was she taunting you?

154
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:29,265
No,they're just super supportive.
They've always been like that.

155
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:33,255
Even I when I sued the lower white haven
school district to let girls play football.

156
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:35,355
Hut!

157
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,380
Feminism!

158
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,380
What?

159
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,155
We didn't make the playoffs that year,but
I think we led the league in bravery.

160
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:53,565
My god,I've never seen such
relentless blind encouragement.

161
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,825
No wonder you're a sexually
frightened know-it-all.

162
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:58,225
hey,dad,take my picture,look.

163
00:07:58,325 --> 00:07:59,945
I'm the lady from flashdance.

164
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:03,050
that's a good
flashdance,honey.

165
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Good flashdance.

166
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,505
The holidays without drinking is rough.

167
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:12,505
Turns out football is boring.

168
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:15,325
My wife's sister ain't as
cute as I thought she was.

169
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,465
And I cannot play the guitar.

170
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:20,345
Mr. Jordan,I know
how difficult this is.

171
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:23,770
I was pretty addicted to coke
back in my wall street days.

172
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,985
But you can get through this.

173
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,645
The first night
is the hardest.

174
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:35,535
But tonight is
ludachristmas.

175
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:40,425
No,tonight you and i are gonna
have some real christmas fun.

176
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:41,815
We can play party games.

177
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:42,995
Like murder!

178
00:08:43,095 --> 00:08:45,565
First,everybody takes a
slip of paper out of a hat.

179
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:47,505
And one person's
slip says "murderer."

180
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:49,635
And another person's
slip says "inspector."

181
00:08:49,735 --> 00:08:51,545
Then everyone
puts their head down.

182
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,415
Except the murderer.

183
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,020
He's the inspector.

184
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,585
No,that's not right.

185
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,685
K,thanks for trying to help.

186
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,075
But I'm gonna go
home,do some thinking,

187
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:04,080
and tell my wife's sister
to disregard all my emails.

188
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,485
That hotel was
a disaster,jack.

189
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:10,985
The tv had over 100
channels,for god sakes.

190
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,065
I'm only gonna be
here for three days.

191
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:14,995
Fine,mother. You
can stay with me.

192
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:17,885
No,I will not let you
do that. Are you sure?

193
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:19,715
Yes,mother,I'm quite sure.

194
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,695
All right,then,that's settled.

195
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,365
Jack,do you have a bathroom
that I can get to in a hurry?

196
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,455
Yes,right in here,mother.

197
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,455
Well,that is close,isn't it?

198
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,555
I'll be right out.

199
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,685
She should've been there.

200
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:40,105
Knock knock!

201
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,825
It's just the lemons.

202
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:45,315
We've come to drop off a
little good-bye present.

203
00:09:45,415 --> 00:09:47,020
Oh,thank you!

204
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,395
Oh,my goodness!

205
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:51,255
What a beautiful office.

206
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh,your mother must
be so proud of you.

207
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,345
wow,look at this carpet.

208
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:57,885
I feel like we should
take off our shoes.

209
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:59,535
Should we take
off our shoes?

210
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:01,155
No,please sit down and
make yourselves comfortable.

211
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:02,925
Well,we don't
want to bother you.

212
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:05,095
We know you must have big plans.

213
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:07,905
Well,I was going to drive up to
vermont and visit my girlfriend C.C.

214
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:09,515
Oh,I love that name.
- C.C.

215
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:12,335
Ooh,I'll bet any girlfriend
of yours is a real winner.

216
00:10:12,435 --> 00:10:13,695
Well,she is a
congresswoman.

217
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,630
Oh,my goodness!

218
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,245
And she does have her
own lifetime movie.

219
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:19,320
Lifetime!
- Wowsers!

220
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,480
Why don't we cut the charade and you two
tell me what exactly it is you want from me.

221
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,570
now,alfonso,let's find where
you should put the keyboard.

222
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:38,785
Open,open hommina,hommina,hommina
open pit barbecue sauce

223
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:40,365
yes,this is the sweet spot.

224
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,915
Oh,and no chitchat
between songs this year.

225
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:45,480
People don't watch
letterman for paul shaffer.

226
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,745
Excuse me,ma'am,do you
know where the bathroom is?

227
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,095
Hi there,mitch.

228
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,895
It's jenna. Maroney.

229
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,795
We know each other.

230
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,595
Are you,like,a friend
of my mom's or something?

231
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:01,010
I mean,I'll tell
her you said hi.

232
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,365
What's up? Do
you like wham?

233
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:12,825
'Cause I'm kind of like the
george michael of my school.

234
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,265
Oh,you're mitch.
- Yeah.

235
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:16,495
Coming to the
party tonight?

236
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:18,240
Oh,I wish.

237
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,215
I gotta rest up for my
big ski trip tomorrow.

238
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,975
You know,maybe you and i could
do something together next week.

239
00:11:24,075 --> 00:11:25,105
Definitely.

240
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:29,790
My parents are
away next ********

241
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,230
******

242
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,290
that's a filthy
christmas miracle.

243
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,075
There you guys are. I'm sorry
they just barged in like that.

244
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:46,005
On,not at all.

245
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,805
They were just dropping
off this christmas present.

246
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,830
Oh,and look at this.

247
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,155
It got cheese and butter and
caramel. All my favorites.

248
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:54,975
How did you know?

249
00:11:55,075 --> 00:11:56,425
Well,we will let you go.

250
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,345
We've got a lot of
window shopping to do.

251
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,345
Jack,why don't
you come with us?

252
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,745
Come on,you can talk to
mitch about president reagan.

253
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:05,555
Oh,in his mind reagan
is still president.

254
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:07,125
You lucky bastard.

255
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,225
What?

256
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,445
I would love to go with you.

257
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:13,545
Good,good,good!

258
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,670
jack?

259
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,965
Hey,dude,I thought you left.

260
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:21,145
Yeah,I mean,what are you guys
doing? Going to ludachristmas?

261
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:22,885
Yep,we heard you can't drink.

262
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:23,835
You still coming?

263
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,415
No,no,I can't go because
of the ankle bracelet.

264
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,745
But maybe I could
go and just not drink.

265
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,465
Hey,maybe I'll compromise.

266
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:33,890
I'll go to the party,cut off
my foot,and drink all I want.

267
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,095
Luda-christmas!

268
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:39,555
Luda-christmas!

269
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:40,985
Luda-christmas!

270
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,485
Luda-christmas!

271
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:43,945
Luda-christmas--

272
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,705
grizz,dotcom,shut the doors.

273
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,530
Some people need to
learn about christmas.

274
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,335
Hey,watch out
for her,jack.

275
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:57,145
She's a natural athlete.

276
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:59,175
Played high school football.

277
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:01,445
It was just one game,dad.

278
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,505
Although I did kind of
change everything forever.

279
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,635
I'll never forget that day.

280
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:08,895
Jack,you laced those
up like a professional.

281
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,590
Good for you!

282
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,035
It's nice to have some
positive reinforcement,isn't it?

283
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:15,545
Well,it's only positive
reinforcement when they say it to you.

284
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:18,035
In my case,they're
just stating the facts.

285
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:21,465
I do look like the arrow shirt man,I
did lace up my skates professionally,

286
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,965
and I did do a fabulous
job finishing my muffin.

287
00:13:24,065 --> 00:13:26,500
You wish you were in my family.

288
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,385
Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:31,055
So this disney cruise in
march,are you in or out?

290
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:31,985
hey,huddle up.

291
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:33,715
We're gonna take a picture.
- Yeah.

292
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:34,985
Oh,thank you.

293
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:36,245
Say "lemon!"

294
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:37,775
lemon!

295
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,875
jack!

296
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,830
Having fun?

297
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,090
Under the bridge,under the bridge,woo!

298
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,505
Jack,what the
hell are you up to?

299
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:53,655
Mother,I'm sorry,but the lemons
invited me out,and I couldn't say no.

300
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,415
They're very nice people.

301
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:57,695
oh,nice. I'll
show you nice.

302
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,315
Let's all meet down at the soda shop
while this country turns into mexico.

303
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:03,105
Now,you see,they don't
say things like that.

304
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:04,725
They're very polite to each other.

305
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:08,745
I suppose you think that
they're more nurturing than I am.

306
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:12,585
Mother,there are terrorist cells
that are more nurturing than you are.

307
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,500
Be careful. I'll cry.

308
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,625
You give me ten minutes
with the lemon family

309
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:23,250
and I'll have them tearing at each
other like drag queens at a wig sale.

310
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,515
Mom,dad,this is jack's mom.

311
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,255
We have heard such
great things about you.

312
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:30,695
Have you?

313
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,465
You must join
us for dinner.

314
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:33,955
no,no,no! No,we can'T.

315
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,055
We have plans.

316
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,715
Uh,had plans.

317
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,295
An evening out
with the lemons.

318
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,500
Who could ask
for anything more?

319
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,980
great!

320
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,635
Thank you,reverend gary.

321
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:51,735
That was both entertaining
and educational.

322
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:54,565
Christmas has gone off
the rails around here.

323
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:55,655
Look out there.

324
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:57,775
That is not a
christmas tree.

325
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,955
It's a way to lure tourists into
the basement to buy $20 salads.

326
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:05,315
We've lost track
of what's important.

327
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:07,075
So now we're gonna
go around the circle,

328
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:10,350
and every one of us is gonna
say what christmas means to them.

329
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Let's start here.

330
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,035
It's so hard to choose.

331
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:28,210
The photos of the
food look so good.

332
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,300
I am gonna have the fried
onion tower for two for one.

333
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,275
Good for you!

334
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,445
You must be so proud of liz.

335
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:39,450
Making it on her own
so far away from home.

336
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,635
That gives us an excuse
to visit new york.

337
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:44,330
I see.

338
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,430
Any grandchildren?

339
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,245
Oh,what a shame.

340
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,945
Must eat you up inside.

341
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:55,935
Oh,well,champy,our
spaniel,keeps us pretty busy.

342
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:58,685
See,mother,not all
species eat their young.

343
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,445
Let's change the subject.

344
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:02,545
Politics.

345
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,975
We don't discuss that stuff.

346
00:16:06,075 --> 00:16:08,360
Life is too short.
- really?

347
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Life is too short?

348
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,670
Because your life seems endless.

349
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,050
thank you,reverend gary.

350
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,875
It was to the tune of american
pie,but so much longer.

351
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:27,705
Listen,we done learned our lesson
about the big tree or whatever.

352
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:29,485
This has got to stop now!

353
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:32,265
Yeah,who care abobout the
true meaning of christmas?

354
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,695
It's about getting crap
and eating too much!

355
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:35,415
Yeah!

356
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:39,585
It's about getting drunk and hugging your
cousin until your mom says,"frank,enough."

357
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:40,455
That's right.

358
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:45,915
Well,now seems like a good time for reverend gary to
show the video of his mission to guatemala last year.

359
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:46,605
What?

360
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,470
Is this a culture where
toplessness is common?

361
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,885
Pieces of wood!

362
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:56,610
Just like I prayed for!

363
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,770
And here is what you did
with your christmas presents.

364
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,865
We take so much for granted.

365
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:15,995
Instead of having a party,we should
donate the money to those kids.

366
00:17:16,095 --> 00:17:18,925
We should tell all our family and friends
we don't want any presents this year.

367
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:19,705
yeah!

368
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,315
We should volunteer at a soup kitchen
instead of shopping for stuff no one needs!

369
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:24,625
Yeah!

370
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:27,495
We should go downstairs
and chop down the big tree!

371
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:29,595
yeah!

372
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,240
No! No,wait!

373
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,535
No,no,no,no,no,no,no!

374
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,355
your mother is killing me.

375
00:17:43,455 --> 00:17:45,805
Have I ever kissed a
woman? What is that about?

376
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:47,495
Welcome to my world,lemon.

377
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,685
She's trying to break your spirit.
- Why?

378
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,175
Because she's trying to prove that
your family is as screwed up as mine is.

379
00:17:52,275 --> 00:17:54,230
Well,that's ridiculous.

380
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,115
Oh,mitch found a newspaper.

381
00:17:56,215 --> 00:17:58,305
Mitch,that's a
joke newspaper!

382
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,405
What?

383
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,685
Why can't you just
leave well enough alone?

384
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:07,085
Because the lemons are
not what they appear to be.

385
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:11,395
I mean,I may be heavy furniture,but
I did a pretty good job raising you.

386
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,645
I mean,look at you
today and look at them.

387
00:18:13,745 --> 00:18:14,825
They look happy.

388
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,315
They're in denial.

389
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:18,415
I mean,come on!

390
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,060
Now,dick,let me
get-- - ah-ah,jack!

391
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,370
It's on me. Wouldn't be a
lemon party without old dick.

392
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,905
Easy on the fried food,honey.

393
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,655
Oh,come on,I can eat whatever
I want. I'm a teenager.

394
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:38,005
Mitch,don't you ever get tired of liz getting
all the attention her being the baby and all?

395
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,015
Oh,no,my folks make
a lot of time for me.

396
00:18:40,115 --> 00:18:42,890
I mean,just yesterday we
went to see goonies together--

397
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,235
You weren't supposed
to know that,liz,sorry.

398
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,335
Wait,you saw goonies yesterday?

399
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,855
Does he mean 1985 yesterday?

400
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:57,095
Yeah,december 6,1985. I mean,what
else would I mean by yesterday?

401
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:59,375
Well,that was the day
of my football game.

402
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,870
Did you not go to
my football game?

403
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,705
We were a little
embarrassed,liz.

404
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:07,805
Dad,did
you--

405
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:10,755
it's white haven football,for
god's sake,elizabeth.

406
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:12,365
It means something.

407
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,365
I wore that uniform.

408
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:16,365
I was taking a
stand for women.

409
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:19,755
Are you taking a stand now
by not giving us grandkids?

410
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:23,255
Oh,you want grandchildren,margaret? Why
don't you ever bother mitch about that?

411
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:25,215
Because he's 17!

412
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:27,425
He's 40!

413
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,525
What?

414
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,695
Oh,my god,the
accident. I hit the tree.

415
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:34,985
no,don't remember.

416
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,885
Oh,I'm so old!

417
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:39,135
Thank you,elizabeth lemon.

418
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:41,465
You are so self-centered,young lady.

419
00:19:41,565 --> 00:19:43,355
You didn't even offer
to pay for this dinner.

420
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:45,635
I'm on a fixed income.

421
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:47,575
Could I have another drink?

422
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,675
Bingo.

423
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,015
This is not what I meant!

424
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,435
Yes,it is.

425
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:59,370
We're sending a message to all of those who
have forgotten the scruples of christmas.

426
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,780
'Cause in order to stay
sane,you have to go crazy!

427
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,950
I had a couple of drinks
before the meeting.

428
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,360
Hold that,kenneth. This is a flask.

429
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,200
So y'all probably shouldn't
be listening to me.

430
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,760
* have yourself a
merry little christmas *

431
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,690
* Make the yuletide gay *

432
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:42,390
* from now on our troubles
will be miles away *

433
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,180
* here we are as
in olden days...*

434
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,755
do you know why i
stay with you,dick?

435
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:55,515
Yes,I do know.

436
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:58,255
Because you have no income
of your own,that's why.

437
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,655
I could've been
drinking these for years!

438
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:05,030
Explain to me again how gay marriage
is gonna tear this country apart!

439
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,430
Merry christmas,mother.

440
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,835
Merry christmas,jackie.

441
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:13,815
tomorrow night I'm gonna
take you to a cathouse.

442
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:14,695
I hate cats.

443
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,480
you'll learn to love them.

444
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
it was ridiculous to lie
to him that long anyway!

445
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,140
my life is ruined!



9999
