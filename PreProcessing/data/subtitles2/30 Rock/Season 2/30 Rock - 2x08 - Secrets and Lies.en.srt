1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,760
Oh, are you sure this is a good idea?

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,260
What if someone sees us?

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,660
Don't worry, it's too early
for the creative types.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,090
And I sent my assistant to a
nonexistent italian bakery out in queens.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,840
This is the address he gave me.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,510
He never makes mistakes.

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,420
I can't go back there
without sfogliatelle!

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,870
We can't keep sneaking around, jack.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,850
It's too dangerous.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,100
I'm trying to get the united states
government to sue your parent company.

11
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,750
- Take off your pantsuit.
- Right back at ya.

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,030
Workplace!

13
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,820
lemon, you're here early.

14
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,710
Well, I gave up caffeine, so
I've been going to bed at 5:30.

15
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,890
But I will leave now.

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,010
oh, don't be silly.

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,370
Uh, liz lemon, I'd like you to
meet a business associate of mine.

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,850
Uh, lakeesha.. gurez..arafat.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
I like your necklace.

20
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,600
Oh, thanks. It's actually a rape whistle.

21
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,890
But the whistle part fell off, 

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,960
and I just liked how it
looked, so I.. Kept it.

23
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,670
I will leave you to it.

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,750
It being business.

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,620
Of course.

26
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:04,440
I call the movie risky business risky
"it" because "it" means business.

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,610
Lemon out.

Take that off. You didn't go to harvard.

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
I went to harvard.

41
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,610
I did standup there this weekend.

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,440
Very funny.

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,110
You were not graduated
from that institution.

44
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,320
Well, I got a squeezer from
an indian girl on a bunk bed.

45
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,140
So I think I got the
full harvard experience.

46
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,460
That does sound pretty accurate.

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,230
You're just trying to
get a rise out of me, sir.

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,150
And you do not wanna
make a harvard man angry.

49
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,750
- Lemon.
- Hey, jack.What's up?

50
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:25,390
That woman you met this morning in
my office is not a colleague of mine.

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,640
We are lovers.

52
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,950
That word bums me out unless it's
between the words meat and pizza.

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,940
Her name is C.C., Which
stands for celeste cunningham.

54
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,950
Wait! Isn't she that
congresswoman that's--

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,270
trying to destroy this company for
allegedly turning some children orange.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,360
Yes. And therein lies the dilemma.

57
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,860
This corporation has a vy
strict bros before hos policy.

58
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,580
So you must really have some
serious feelings for her.

59
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,730
Okay, if I can't say
lovers, you can't say feelings.

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,360
But, yes, it is serious.

61
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,540
And, in spite of everything, I want
her to meet some of my friends.

62
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,930
So I'm going to hold a dinner
party, and I would like you to come.

63
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,820
Oh, that's very nice. Thank you, jack.

64
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,440
I just want you to be discreet.

65
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,100
And try not to dress
like a small-town lesbian.

66
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,160
Well, lemon, that was a good chat.

67
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,140
Good luck with that, uh, alopecia
problem of yours.

68
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,720
Aw, come on!

69
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,430
I don't have that.

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,930
Very hairy.

71
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,920
hey, you guys, sorry I'm late.

72
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,730
I'll take one of those. Sorry.

73
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,330
Hey, guys, good news.

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,420
We won an award.

75
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,380
We did?

76
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,490
Well, I did.

77
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,580
Do you remember when I filmed that movie
version of the mystic pizza musical?

78
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,300
Do I! I don'T.

79
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,860
Well, the ny city critics
association just sent me this--

80
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,670
"best actress in a movie based
on a musical based on a movie."

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,030
Hey, that's great!

82
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,810
okay, enough!

83
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,360
How long are we gonna talk
about this stupid award?

84
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,340
We have more important
things to worry about, 

85
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,820
like where are the french
fries i did not ask for?

86
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,410
You guys need to anticipate me!

87
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay, forget it.

88
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,770
I can't rehearse today.

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,220
it's gonna be one of those weeks.

90
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,750
Oh, no, I talked to him last time when he wanted
to change his name to wise greasy bastard.

91
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,810
Fine.

92
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,860
Oh, monsters, why did I create you?

93
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,580
Okay, tracy. What's wrong?

94
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not fair, liz lemon.

95
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,830
Everybody wins awards but me.

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,540
Even shaquille o'neal got a kid's choice
award for that animated movie we did.

97
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,290
boy, I hope we rescue the
starfish king on this adventure.

98
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,500
It'll be a slam dunk.

99
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,690
Would you call what
we did last night sex?

100
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,000
I spent two days making
that movie for my homey.

101
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,790
What did I get?

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,650
A million dollars, a
yellow bentley, and nothing.

103
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,310
I never win anything.

104
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,910
Look at this coffee cup my
kids got me for father's day.

105
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,310
I'm a failure, liz lemon.

106
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,790
Maybe I should just give up and try this
crystal meth i've been hearing so much about.

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,670
No, no, no! You don't have to do that.

108
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,420
You won an award!

109
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,530
Did I not tell you?

110
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,070
- Come on, lemon.
- Yes!

111
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,240
You are getting.. A..

112
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,850
lifetime achievement award from the..

113
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,890
pacific rim emmys.

114
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,620
Pacific rim?

115
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,300
I love the pacific rim.

116
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,550
I spent nine months in japan
shooting samurai I am-urari.

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,450
I fell in love with their
culture, especially sharking.

118
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,180
What's sharking?

119
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,940
It's when you run up
on a lady on the streets

120
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,990
and pull her tube top down
while your friend videotapes it.

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,430
It's considered a crime here.

122
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,090
Thanks a lot, puritans.

123
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,270
Right. So are you ready
to hit some rehearsal?

124
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,330
Hell, yeah!

125
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,910
I do not want to disappoint
my japanese public.

126
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,470
Especially godzilla.

127
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,090
I'm just kidding.

128
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,950
I know he doesn't care what humans do.

129
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,220
All right, I'll see you out there, winner.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,530
He's fine.

131
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,950
I just need you to make
him a pacific rim emmy.

132
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,750
Props has an old basketball trophy
we could solder some wings onto.

133
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,960
I love it.

134
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,180
It is unbelievable the lengths
you go to to keep that guy happy.

135
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,140
I know.

136
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,600
I don't get that kind of treatment.

137
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,080
I don't have to treat you that
way, because you're the sane one--

138
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,350
you're my rock.

139
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,850
It is amazing how grounded i've been
able to stay despite my celebri-tay.

140
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,010
'Sup, dude?

141
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
I went to harvard.

142
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,450
I lived in lowell house and was
a member of the signet society.

143
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,810
If you were actually a member of the signet
society, you would be wearing this pin.

144
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,890
You mean.. this pin?

145
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,480
Your lame thing is on his pants.

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,230
Hey, liz lemon, when am
I leaving for japan?

147
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,020
'Cause I have to arrange
for a snake nanny.

148
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,520
Oh, I didn't think you were
actually gonna go to japan.

149
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,600
I mean, the award ceremony is tonight, so
I told them to mail it to you.

150
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,590
No!

151
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,090
I told my kids they could come
see their dad get an award.

152
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,860
So it has to at least
be live via satellite.

153
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,850
Ah, yeah, but it's a really
big time difference.

154
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,400
It'll be like 4:00 in the morning here.

155
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,990
Perfect! Just when I get
back from maiden voyage, 

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,270
newark's first offshore
gentleman's barge.

157
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,250
I'm gonna get the kids, and
we coming straight here.

158
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,480
okay. I'll..

159
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,580
set that up.

160
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,000
Really? You're gonna do that?

161
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,310
Liz lemon know who keeps
the lights on around here.

162
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,690
But I couldn't do it without
my background players.

163
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,700
That's why I want you and
josh to be there for my award.

164
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,250
And then afterwards, maybe
I let you hold it.

165
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,910
Then you can check out my award.

166
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,230
Banter!

167
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,820
He's an idiot.

169
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,100
No, don't blame him.

170
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,630
You're the one who
rewards his bad behavior.

171
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,830
U give him anything he wants.

172
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,650
Me, I can't even get a real exterminator to
get that squirrel out of my dressing room.

173
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,710
no.

174
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,790
No, don't move like that.

175
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,550
Good evening.

176
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,620
Y I take your coat?

177
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,010
Uh, yes, thank you.

178
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,520
I'm sorry I'm late.

179
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,610
The other guests have already
arrived and are in the dining room.

180
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,890
- Oh, hipyz.
- Lemon!

181
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,130
Is this.. ev?

182
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,950
Well, we had a longer invite list, but
we thought, for the sake of discretion--

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,170
we had to eliminate anybody with any
influence or connectio or stature, 

184
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,710
so that pretty much left you.

185
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,880
And then we added kenneth so you
would have somebody to talk to.

186
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,140
"What's your favorite pizza topping?"

187
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,880
Mine's plain. But I like others.

188
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,170
I have to say.

189
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,930
You are the most beautiful
woman in this room right now.

190
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,580
Liz, "tell me a painful story
about your teenage years."

191
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,120
- Okay, let's fake this candle.
- Okay.

192
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:28,570
okay, tracy, they are ready for
your acceptance speech in 3, 2, 1.

193
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,170
People of pacific rim, how you feel?

194
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,150
All right!

195
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,440
I'd like to thank my wife, my two
sons, tracy jr., And george foreman, 

196
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,710
this josh dude, liz lemon, uh..

197
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,090
baldheaded pete for
setting up the satellite, 

198
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,950
and of course, a very
special blonde lady.

199
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,640
Shelly long, you're truly an
inspiration to me! I know that!

200
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,300
And finally, I'd like to
thank you, pacific rimmers, 

201
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,980
for all that you've given us.

202
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,330
Karaoke, karate, and most of all..

203
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,540
wanizame atakku!

204
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,520
Shark attack!

205
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,190
Okay, so you got sharked.

206
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,520
That's not great.

207
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm so humiliated.

208
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,390
- How could tracy not thank me?
- What?

209
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,700
I drag myself out of bed at 4:00
in the morning, go home, get dressed, 

210
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,380
come in here, and he doesn't
even mention my name?

211
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,160
Jenna, the whole thing is fake.

212
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,890
Yeah, but he thought it was real.

213
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,120
Listen, I'm sorry. Tonight was crazy.

214
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,400
But I did hear the janitor saying
that your boobs looked good.

215
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,040
I don't want to hear it, liz.

216
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,500
Apparently, the only way to get respect
around here is to act like tracy.

217
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,500
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

218
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,220
Now, please, get out of my dressing
room so I can lock myself in it.

219
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,480
The squirrel!

220
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,720
It's not afraid of people!

221
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,250
Oh, hi, C.C.Are you looking for jack?

222
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,870
No, actually, I was hoping to talk to you.

223
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,440
I hope you had fun last night.

224
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,130
I did.

225
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,040
Boy, you and jack make a
hell of a celebrity team.

226
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,120
- This is that chick
who-- - venus williams.

227
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,150
- Remember that time you fell asleep?
- Captain beefheart.

228
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,100
It's like we share a brain.

229
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,040
I'm sorry you got stuck with kenneth.

230
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,720
Okay.

231
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,590
This is not a character
from a television program.

232
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,680
Okay, this is not a
character from the bible.

233
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,040
Pass.

234
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,330
You can't pass, you hillbilly.

235
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,880
No, I'm sorry.

236
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,020
I don't normally slap people.

237
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,950
Liz, I hate to put you on the spot, 

238
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,610
but you know that I can't talk
to any of my friends about jack.

239
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,780
We can't keep sneaking around.

240
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,600
This is getting ridiculous.

241
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,020
I'm-A.. the plumber.

242
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,130
I'm here-a to fix-a
the washing machine.

243
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,170
Come right in, mr. Spunatelli.

244
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,550
If jack and i are gonna stay together, one
of us has got to give something up.

245
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,920
I just--I mean, is
jack worth it?

246
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,160
What would you do?

247
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,830
I don't think you want to
take advice from me on this.

248
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,530
I mean, I ate a three musketeers
bar for breakfast this morning, 

249
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,290
and this bra is held
together with tape, but-- .

250
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,590
oh, liz, please

251
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,250
well, jack is great.

252
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,060
And he's crazy about you.

253
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,290
But have you ever
compromised for a man before?

254
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,580
No.

255
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,750
Me either.

256
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,420
Oh, god, it was my birthday yesterday.

257
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,660
I'm gonna talk to jack.

258
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,580
Yeah, I think you should.

259
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,760
Hey, guys, it's me, frank.

260
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,630
Oh, no! Escalation!

261
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,690
Okay, that hat's not cool, jackass.

262
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,970
My mom's a great lady.

263
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,630
Oh, was it her greatness
that made your dad leave?

264
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,160
He didn't leave.

265
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,330
He's a submarine
commander running silent.

266
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,940
Let's watch this instead of working.

267
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,160
Take off that costume.

268
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,330
Take off yours!

269
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,680
Never.

270
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,400
C.C., What are you doing here?

271
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,890
Jack, I convinced the sheinhardt
wig plaintiffs to settle.

272
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,050
That's fantastic news.

273
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,980
What did they end up getting?

274
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,030
5 million each.

275
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,870
5 million.. each.That'S..

276
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,850
nba sexual assault money.

277
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,270
They deserved more.

278
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,880
The point is, now you
and I can go public.

279
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,360
We don't have to sneak around anymore.

280
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,280
Slow down, C.C.It's not that simple.

281
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,430
Well, what do you mean?

282
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,150
I'm still up for a big promotion.

283
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,530
My colleagues still revile you.

284
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,510
But maybe in a year or
so, we could reassess.

285
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,320
Don't you understand what
I have given up for you?

286
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,940
Those little orange children
deserved their day in court.

287
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,680
They got 5 million. Each.

288
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,670
But they deserved to be heard, jack.

289
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,200
And I was ready to speak for them.

290
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,870
We were going to go on oprah.

291
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,390
Oh, so this is not about those kids.

292
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,960
It's about you getting some publicity
to get a leg up on your political career.

293
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,110
I'm not going to apologize
for being ambitious, jack.

294
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,350
Well, you shouldn'T. I like
when a woman has ambition.

295
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,660
It's like seeing a dog wearing clothes.

296
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,430
I was willing to give
all that up for you.

297
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,310
But you're obviously not
willing to do the same.

298
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,290
I just need more time.

299
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,500
I should never have listened to a
woman who tapes her bra together.

300
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,690
Lemon.

301
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,530
Don't worry, jack.

302
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,680
I will sneak out through the
freight elevator like I always do.

303
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,530
I won't embarrass you.

304
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,550
Everybody looks good in a sheinhardt.

305
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,120
something's going down with jenna.

306
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,330
She told an nbc tour that she
was gonna get them all pregnant.

307
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,100
So now I have two
tracys--perfect.

308
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,110
- Will you trade jobs with me?
- Okay.

309
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,610
But jenna wants this
done a specific way.

310
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,730
She's in her dressing room.

311
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,940
Godspeed, liz lemon.

312
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,210
liz, we have a serious crisis.

313
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,140
- We're mad at each
other-- - what?No.

314
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,020
I have legitimate problems
to deal with right now.

315
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,670
But the toofer/frank
rivalry has finally exploded.

316
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,580
No one cares.

317
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,780
Move, you're blocking me.

318
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,920
I'm trying to get somewhere real.

319
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,980
Is jenna in there?

320
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,590
Bitch, are you in here?

321
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,190
Jenna, why are you noat rehearsal?

322
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,580
My entourage says I look tired.

323
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,540
I'm sasha.

324
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,850
This is patrice and master alexei.

325
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,800
And your name i
probably something like..

326
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,070
melissa.

327
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,570
Okay. I get it.Fine.

328
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,810
What do I need to do to make you feel
appreciated and get them out of here?

329
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,650
Too late.

330
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,930
You had your chance.

331
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,010
Ooh, melissa! Pick up your face, girl.

332
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm going to get my eyeballs whitened.

333
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,870
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

334
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
If I feel like it.

335
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,210
What? No!

336
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,420
We have work to do.

337
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,760
This is what you get for taking
me for granted all this time.

338
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,320
Deal with that.

339
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,720
Oh, melissa!

340
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,080
Your face is on the phone.

341
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,370
Soccer practice is over, and
you need.. to pick it up!

342
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,980
All right, that's a
pretty good burn, patrice.

343
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,830
Well, lemon, I hope you're happy.

344
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,050
I'm not. Why?

345
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,270
C.C.Is demanding thate go
public with our relationship, 

346
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,010
which is impossible, and you
put the idea in her head.

347
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,020
I'm sorry, jack.

348
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,910
You know, I'm just saying
what everybody's thinking.

349
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,520
You just don't understand
what I'm going through.

350
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,950
Nobody understands
what I'm going through.

351
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,100
I'll take the next one, carville.

352
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,780
Uh, actually-- have
you got a minute?

353
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,870
How do you and mary
matalin make it work?

354
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,630
I mean, she's a brilliant
patriotic republican strategist, 

355
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,230
and you--let's face
it-- are a pinko nut job.

356
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,200
You know, mary and I proved that
true love can weather any storm.

357
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,080
Even desert storm.

358
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,880
But if it's the opinion of your
peers that you're worried about, 

359
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,610
you ed to get out in front
of the story-- "cajun style."

360
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,530
Break the news on your own
terms, before your enemies find out.

361
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,660
Cajun style.

362
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,530
Dating a democratic congresswoman?

363
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,720
These guys will destroy me for this.

364
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,730
Jack, is it really the opinion
of others that you worry about, 

365
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,910
or are you learning
something new about yourself, 

366
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,650
and you find that a little scary?

367
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,060
Cajun style.

368
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,950
What are we gonna do?

369
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,640
If we give up our feud
now, we'll be ridiculed.

370
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,080
Remember when lutz cried
during that diamond commercial?

371
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,210
It'll be worse than that.

372
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,810
Oh, but I can't keep dressing like you.

373
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,620
The new yorker festival is next week.

374
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,800
We're trapped in a political minefield.

375
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,710
How are we gonna get out of it?

376
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,980
you boys need to change your story.

377
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,830
Like karl rove did in the last election when
he made it about gay folks and swift boats.

378
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,500
What's your swift boat?

379
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,580
You didn't hear this from me, but josh is
starting to do something new with his hair.

380
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,820
Are you james carville?

381
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,750
Drop me an email and
let me know how it goes.

382
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,200
Trying to steal candy
from a vending machine?

383
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,700
Let me show you how it's done.

384
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,840
Cajun style.

385
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,860
Excuse me.

386
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,530
What office should I put
miss maroney's new writer in?

387
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,870
What? No!

388
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,470
Who said this guy gets an office? No!

389
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
You let jenna take off
in the middle of the day?

390
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,060
If she gets to do that, then I'm doing
this week's show as my altar ego--

391
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,710
Profsor cosmotosis.

392
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,670
Where is jenna?

393
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,870
I'm gonna take a nap.

394
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,240
Wake me up if andy dick calls.

395
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,260
Is this fun for you, being difficult?

396
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,260
Oh, it is--I should have
been doing it the whole time.

397
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,560
You have been, jenna.

398
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,510
You have always been difficult.

399
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,650
You think tracy gets special treatment?

400
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,310
I don't think. I know.

401
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,950
Well, I coddle the crap out of you too.

402
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,060
Your online fan
club-- that's me.

403
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,670
I made frank set that up as a
punishment after he farted in my chair.

404
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,230
And when you did that morning
radio show the other week?

405
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,090
Every caller was me.

406
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,950
I am loving all of your characters.

407
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,710
thanks for calling, sanjay.

408
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,990
I really believe in karma.

409
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,840
And this award you just got..

410
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,190
it's a cookie.

411
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,380
I don't wanna do this stuff, bui
have to because you're so insecure, 

412
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,350
you get jealous of babies
for their soft skin.

413
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,840
And how much attention they get.

414
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,470
I have lost years of my
life taking care of you.

415
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,420
I lie awake at night wondering
what fresh hell tomorrow will bring.

416
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,270
I don't sleep.

417
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,210
I don't eat right.

418
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,450
Thanks to you and tracy
jordan-- mostly you.

419
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,870
Oh, liz.

420
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,590
That's all I wanted to hear.

421
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,240
I'll be onstage in ten.

422
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,820
And I'll wait till tomorrow to talk
about you firing melon ball lady.

423
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,410
All right.

424
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,140
Not in front of the gays.

425
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,010
hey, look who bailed on their lame feud.

426
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,820
Hey, what's up with josh's new haircut?

427
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,710
yeah, dude, you got a frohawk, man.

428
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,650
What do you think, you're better than us?

429
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,820
No, I don'T.

430
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,370
I got a new nickname for josh.

431
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,700
Dr.Haircut.

432
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,180
It's not even my normal barber.

433
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,760
My mom did it.

434
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,490
Dr.Haircut!

435
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,260
Dr.Haircut!

436
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,180
Doctor..

437
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,740
are you gonna cry?

438
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,330
Here's your john legend cd.

439
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,840
I don't know why it was so
urgent you have it before noon.

440
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,910
It was just an excuse.
Have lunch with me.

441
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,670
But I have a plan.

442
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,910
Do you trust me?

443
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,070
Oh, god. I don't know.

444
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,970
I'm 43, and you have great hair.

445
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,750
I can let this play out a little longer.

446
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,360
Then come with me.

447
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,650
Jack, this is your executive dining rm.

448
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,400
Are you trying to get me killed?

449
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:20,500
C.C., These people are my peers, my
heroes, my past and future secret santas.

450
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,400
Their approval is the most important
thing in the world to me-- or..

451
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,460
so I thought.

452
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,530
Gentlemen, token ladies, I have
an important announcement.

453
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,230
Some of you may or may not recognize
the woman standing beside me.

454
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,290
Her name is celeste cunningham, and
she is a democratic congresswoman..

455
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,420
From the state of vermont.

456
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,290
And she is my lover.

457
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,560
That's right.

458
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,570
She's my liberal hippy-dippy mama.

459
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,090
My groovy chick, my old lady.

460
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,030
She was our chief adversary
during the sheinhardt wig hearings.

461
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,380
She wants to tax us all to death and make
it legal for a man to marry his own dog.

462
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,460
But I think what we have is special.

463
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,400
And I'm proud of her.

464
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,230
And I'm not going to hide it any longer.

465
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,960
I'm jack donaghy, damn it..

466
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,850
and this is my woman.

467
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,020
I.. gave to npr last year.

468
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,160
My children go to public school.

469
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,650
I'm gay.

470
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,420
I'm black.

471
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,320
Oh, jack, thank you so much!

472
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,550
And I just want you to know that
in 1984 i voted for ronald reagan.

473
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,120
I murdered my wife.

474
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,020
