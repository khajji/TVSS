1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,900
Liz, Lutz and I are gonna walk around
Times Square and pretend to be foreign.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,800
I am from Homburg, yah.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,680
Wanna come?

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,880
Oh, I can't. My cousin is in town.

5
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,770
All right.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,600
See ya though.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,180
Liz, I'm getting drinks with
recently-divorced camera guy. You in?

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,210
Legally separated sound
guy's gonna be there.

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,180
I-I don't feel well.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,480
Okay.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,430
Hey, Liz Lemon.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm going to an animals-only
strip club. Interested?

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,590
Does that meane animals strip, or
the animals are the customers?

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,740
Animal customers? That's ridicous.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,810
Well, um, I have got a date.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,510
So... I... yeah.

17
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,700
Order, please.

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,470
- Hi, order for pick-up.
- Yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,990
Yes, I would like a meatball
sub with extra bread.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,830
- And my name is-- 
- Liz?

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,820
Yeah, that's me. Okay.

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,740
Big night, Lemon?

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,410
Let me guess.

24
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,070
Meatball sub, extra bread.

25
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,650
Bottle of NyQuil.

26
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,440
TiVo top chef.

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,920
A little Miss Bonnie Raitt. Lights out.

28
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,230
No, I have something to do tonight, Jack.

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,410
Then you won't mind when
I tell you that, uh...

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,240
Casey gets voted off tonight.

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,260
You monster!

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,060
Why are you like this?

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,490
Sir, Tracy's here with a bunch of kids.

37
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,360
He wants to know if you have
a minute to meet with them?

38
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,560
Absolutely not.

39
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,120
J.D.!

40
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,260
There he is.

41
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,190
I want you to meet the
baseball team I'm coaching.

42
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,130
A group of fine young
men and one special lady.

43
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,070
Dijonaise is a boy's name?

44
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,170
Pardon me.

45
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,140
Tracy, this is wonderful.

46
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,170
I had no idea you were
interested in baseball.

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,930
I wasn't.

48
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,440
My motorcycle hit a police horse.

49
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,110
This is community service.

50
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,910
These kids come from Knuckle Beach, the
worst neighborhood in New York.

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,180
They are poor as hell.

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,110
Baseball is a wonderful sport, boys.

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,240
I remember when my high school team
won the Boston city championship.

54
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,170
Everyone told us we were gonna
lose, because our team was all white,

55
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,900
and the other team
was completely--

56
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,810
anyway, we won, and I learned
that anything is possible.

57
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,540
Baseball taught me how to win.

58
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,390
Baseball taught me how to dream.

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,490
What are your dreams?

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,040
When I grow up, I'm gonna do
vending machine maintenance.

61
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,830
I'm gonna get shot by
a cop and sue the city.

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm a be a talkative doorman
with a drinking problem.

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,350
That's right. You shoot for the stars.

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
No, no, no, no, no.

65
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,670
These are not the dreams of winners.

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,090
These aren't winners.

67
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,430
They're 0 and 17.

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,460
Damn, we supposed to be
at the game right now.

69
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,220
0 and 18!

70
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,180
That one's on coach Tracy.

71
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,220
Someday I'll have an office
like this... to clean.

72
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,870
You could have an office
like this of your very own.

73
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,990
All you need is someone to
point you in the right direction.

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,800
A role model.

75
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,050
Like R. Kelly and Michael Vick.

76
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,050
Faves.

77
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,400
- Thanks.
- There you go.

78
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,470
Uh, grandy?

79
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,980
Oh, my God. Who ordered the veal?

80
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,080
Am I right, guys?

81
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,560
Ugh, Jenna, that guy is a baby.

82
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,300
- Uh, Lutz?
- I'm Lutz.

83
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,140
You ordered a Venti chocolate mocha blast
with half and half and brownie chunks?

84
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,520
Thank you. Jamie.

85
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,930
I like your blond streaks.

86
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,330
It's very Simon LeBon.

87
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,300
Who?

88
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,540
Oh, you're young.

89
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,380
Give it up, Jenna.

90
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,220
You're talking to an ultrasound.

91
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,540
Now I'm getting attitude from
the sexy librarian over here.

92
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,160
What? Sexy? You are. Shut up.

93
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,720
Wow, that guy is adorable.

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,530
Frank's gay.

95
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,070
Maybe I am gay...

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,470
for that little peach.

97
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,350
You wanna kiss him?

98
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,220
I do.

99
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,340
I wanna kiss him on
the mouth. And hold him.

100
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,910
What are you talking about?

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,460
Something just happened, Liz.

102
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,150
Come on, you read Boobs magazine.

103
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,080
I want Jamie.

104
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,780
Yeah, you're gay.

105
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,050
He's totally gay for--

106
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,900
Why isn't this any fun?

107
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,600
come on! Gather 'round!Circle up!

108
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,950
Everybody, circle up!

109
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,360
All right, circle up. Circle up.

110
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,620
Around me! Around me!

111
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,390
All right, isten, that's enough.

112
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,010
There's a weird dude
standing over there.

113
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,050
And I don't wanna get shot today, so
great hustle, great practice.

114
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,090
Okay, the weird dude is gone. Go home.

115
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,870
Hey, you guys! It's that king we met.

116
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,130
Good afternoon, boys.

117
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,320
I've been thinking a lot about you,

118
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,950
and I decided that I wanna help.

119
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,880
Starting with some new uniforms.

120
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,610
Compliments of the
Sheinhardt wig company.

121
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,970
You wanna be a bunch of winners?

122
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,850
You've gotta dress for success.

123
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,800
That's why I sponsor a charity that
gives away tuxedos to homeless people.

124
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,420
It was a beautiful ceremony.

125
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,650
Mazel tov.

126
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,900
That's right. Put them on.

127
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,330
You don't get these kids, Jack.

128
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,430
They don't care about winning.

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
They just wanna be able
to go outside for once.

130
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,270
You know, our first practice
they asked me what the sun was?

131
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,310
Hey, Jamie!

132
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,880
Did you just come from working
out, or are you naturally veiny?

133
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,340
Pull it together, Frank.

134
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,480
All right. Okay.

135
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,640
Good to see you, man!

136
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,760
Thanks.

137
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,890
So I don't want to
interrupt or anything,

138
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,940
But, um, are you doing
anything saturday night?

139
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,040
Just gellin' like Magellan.

140
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,030
Okay, well.

141
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,150
Uh, my friend's DJing
at this gallery opening,

142
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,990
and, um, he can get us in if you wanna go.

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,860
Oh, no, I don't think so.

144
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,440
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

145
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,770
Jamie, how old do you think I am?

146
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,960
I don't know. Uh, 29?

147
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,620
Wow, you are good at guessing ages.

148
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,950
I am exactly 29, but you're a baby.

149
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,070
No, I'm not. I'm 25.

150
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,330
- Really?
- Yeah.

151
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,710
I thought you were younger.

152
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,300
And I'm 29, so...

153
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,700
so you'll go?

154
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,690
Awesome.

155
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,830
Dude. I totally forgot.

156
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,550
I bought you a sweater.

157
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
It's slim fitting.

158
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,230
They call it a French cut.

159
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,530
And it wasn't on sale or anything.

160
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,480
Woe, thanks.

161
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,710
Do you need help trying it on?

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,530
No.

163
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,690
So I'll pick you up around 10:00?

164
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,640
At night? Okay.

165
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,460
That sounds great.

166
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,230
Great. Where are we going?

167
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,750
Frank.

168
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,370
- Stop it.
- I can't.

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,210
I'm gay for Jamie.

170
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,080
No, that's not a thing.

171
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,640
You can't be gay for just one person, 
unless you're a lady, and you meet Ellen.

172
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,340
Well then, 
I got some real thinking to do.

173
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,510
It's scary.

174
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,710
But also exciting.

175
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,740
I can't believe I did that.

176
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,990
I told myself I would
never lie about my age.

177
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,660
These things happen, Liz.

178
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,450
I had my "No sex with Asians" rule,

179
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,500
but then one day you walk into
Sharper Image, and there's Quan.

180
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,060
Forget it. I'm gonna
order some more coffee,

181
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,050
and then he'll come
back, and I can cancel.

182
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,170
No, this is a good thing.

183
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,570
A hot guy thinks you're 29.

184
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,840
He is cute.

185
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,860
He looks like Zac Efron.

186
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,310
That's a thing, right?

187
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,660
Oh, go for it, Liz.

188
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,470
I always roll with it
when hot guys think I'm 22.

189
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,410
What can we do?

190
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,510
We're cougars.

191
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,210
- We're what?
- Cougars.

192
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,580
Hot older ladies pouncing
on their young prey.

193
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,670
There was a whole article
about it in Vanity Fair.

194
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,860
The one with the Crisis In Africa cover.

195
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,490
God, it makes me so sad that more
people don't know about cougars.

196
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,740
Why am I looking for
something to wear in wardrobe?

197
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,850
Why don't you go to
Abercrombie and Fitch?

198
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,460
Oh, no. It's too loud in there.

199
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,580
No, don't say that.

200
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,280
Cougars have to act young.

201
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,670
You should get a ring pop to suck on.

202
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,930
What are you doing?

203
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,010
Figuring some stuff out.

204
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,260
Sorry, Jenna, I'm probably gay now.

205
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,520
It's never gonna happen between us.

206
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,750
You wanted to see me?

207
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,830
Hello, coach.

208
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,250
I thought we'd have a little
meeting before today's practice.

209
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,190
Practice? Meetings?

210
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,560
What is this? A marriage?

211
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,730
Phil Jackson likes to give books
to his players to inspire them,

212
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,770
so which biography of Winston Churchill do
you think would improve Rashid's bunting?

213
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,480
Jack, have you ever
been to Knuckle Beach?

214
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,610
It's a totally different world.

215
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,250
A world where orange soda's an
acceptable substitute for breast milk.

216
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,440
Tracy, I don't have to understand
their world in order to help them.

217
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,230
It's like this great country of ours.

218
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,550
We can go into any nation, impose
our values, and make things better.

219
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,410
It's what Bush is doing
all over the globe.

220
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,580
Bush!

221
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,520
Now, I don't wanna go off on a rant here.

222
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,450
So I suppose the next step would be to
bring our superior resources to bear.

223
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,110
Kenneth, show him the
drawing of the new field.

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,410
Sorry.

225
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,460
This is my dream journal.

226
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,270
They've all come true so far.

227
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,930
FUN TIMES ACCOMPLISHED

228
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,000
What the heck is going on out here?

229
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,590
You didn't get behind grounders.

230
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
You didn't work the pitch count.

231
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,710
There was nothing Churchillian
about that performance.

232
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,880
And where are their uniforms?

233
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,130
You can't wear blue in
Knuckle Beach, which is hard

234
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,570
because jeans go with everything.

235
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,000
Tracy, your failure of
leadership is unacceptable.

236
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,540
Now you gonna blame this on me?

237
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,290
I told you this was gonna happen.

238
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,140
Extly.

239
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,710
I need somebody who believes
in what we're doing here.

240
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,900
Tracy, you're fired.

241
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,960
Kenneth, you're in charge.

242
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,240
So you like the music?

243
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,030
Yeah, speaking of music I
like, how about Gnarls Barkley, huh?

244
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,390
That guy's great.

245
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,950
Have you been to his
official website? It's really--

246
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,090
Oh God, is it only 1:00 am?

247
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,830
Yeah, so after this I
figure we hit up Marquee.

248
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,430
They only serve drinks till 4:00,

249
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,600
but I can get us into this great
after-hours club in Brooklyn.

250
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,360
- I'm 37.
- What?

251
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,300
I'm 37. Please don't
make me go to Brooklyn.

252
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,170
I'm 20.

253
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,520
Oh, boy.

254
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,680
This just went from a senior dating a freshman
to Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau.

255
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,860
Are those friends of yours? Or...

256
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,400
Oh, when will death come?

257
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,150
Lemon, what happened, did you take an Ambien
with your Franzia and sleepwalk here?

258
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,970
No, I am out on a date.

259
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,590
I know you. You deliver my coffee.

260
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,090
You're here with Lemon?

261
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,820
Yes, sir.

262
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,380
I'm Jamie, Mr. Donaghy.

263
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,590
Oh, what a polite young man.

264
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,090
Ooh, they just changed bartenders. I'm
gonna go see if this guy'll serve me.

265
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,120
Where did you two meet, an amber alert?

266
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,290
I just found out that he's
17 years younger than me.

267
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,640
I knew I shouldn't have done this.

268
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,940
I look ridiculous.

269
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,390
Oh, nonsense. You've never looked better.

270
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,060
Do I look ridiculous when you
see me with a younger woman?

271
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,120
Boy, the art in here
is hung really level.

272
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,740
A youthful companion is the
ultimate status accessory.

273
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,900
Well, maybe you can pull
that off. You're a man.

274
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,080
It's different for women.

275
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,020
That is so sexist of you.

276
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,130
To that clueless boy over
there, you're a very powerful woman.

277
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,420
Technically you're a catch.

278
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,810
You've got money, status, naturally
thick hair, a decent set.

279
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,680
All right.

280
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,810
Tell me, have you been
on a date since Floyd?

281
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,600
No.

282
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,480
Why are you so against
having fun in your life?

283
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,580
I'm not against fun.

284
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,410
I went up on my roof the other day.

285
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,780
Stop fighting this.

286
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,800
He's hot, poor, and eager to please.

287
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,290
Just buy him a few gifts and never
give him your home phone number.

288
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,350
And if you set a curfew, stick to it.

289
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,960
Oh, gosh. Okay.

290
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,990
Hey, coach. How did practice go today?

291
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,610
Sir, conditions have deteriorated.

292
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,650
I made DeMarquis captain like you said.

293
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,950
But having a kid from Trinidad in
charge made the latinos real mad.

294
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,820
And they all seem to
really hate my grandpa.

295
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,490
'Cause they keep yelling, "Kill, whitey."

296
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,010
And I'm, like,"what do you
think you are, alcohol?"

297
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,420
All right, Kenneth, calm down.

298
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,290
There was bound to be some
unrest once we removed Tracy.

299
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,290
They're testing our resolve.

300
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Stay the course.

301
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,080
Kenneth!

302
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,860
Mr. Jordan. About what
happened--

303
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,190
I don't wanna talk about it, Ken.

304
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,080
You'll hear all I have to say about
Jack Donaghy in my tell-all book,

305
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,830
betrayal, colon, what really
happened with my baseball team,

306
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,660
comma, disaster at Knuckle
Beach, question mark.

307
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,860
What the hell is going on?

308
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,400
It's chaos, sir.

309
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,660
They've turned on each other.

310
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,170
And they won't listen, especially
when I'm saying,

311
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,220
"Don't hit me with my own shoes."

312
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,490
I think things may have
been better under Mr. Jordan.

313
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,830
We're not gonna look back now, Kenneth.

314
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,610
Tracy didn't understand
what needed to be done.

315
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,150
He had to go.

316
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,810
They're destroying all the
things I bought for them.

317
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,660
Everything but the bats, sir.

318
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,660
Oh, god. They see us.

319
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,860
You kids put those bats down!

320
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,910
For the love of God.

321
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,630
Oh, Liz.

322
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,720
Did I see you saturday at Marquee?

323
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,210
I was there. Yes.

324
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,420
So what were you doing there?

325
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,310
Is it like that time they found
my grandpa at the bus station?

326
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,790
No, I was there with
Jamie, the coffee guy.

327
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,350
And we had a great time.

328
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,340
Coffee guy?

329
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,770
That'll really make
your ex-husband jealous.

330
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,330
Cerie, for the last time, I
have never been married.

331
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,090
That's the spirit!

332
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,380
Hey, Liz. This is Aidan.

333
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,900
Guess you're not the
only cougar in town.

334
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,710
Aidan's a freshman at nyu.

335
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,740
Aren't you, Aidan?

336
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,270
Sure. Do you have any change for a soda?

337
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,780
But you just had one.

338
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,870
Whatever.

339
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,760
Don't you whatever me.

340
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,610
Hey, hey, what did I say about
you wearing your heelies inside?

341
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,270
Aidan! Wait up, Aidan.

342
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,890
There she is.

343
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,260
The cradle robber.

344
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,230
Yeah, that's right.

345
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,800
I have a boy toy, and we
look awesome together.

346
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,380
That's great, Maude.

347
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,540
How's Harold?

348
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,640
His name is Jamie.

349
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,980
And you know what?

350
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,390
I don't spend a lot of time
worrying about his feelings.

351
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,220
I just know he's super-cute, and
he laughs at all my jokes.

352
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,220
Coffee's here.

353
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,360
Hey there!

354
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,730
I had fun the other night.

355
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,100
Your roof is awesome.

356
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,910
Oh, thanks. I go up there all the time.

357
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,980
So, uh, you wanna get some lunch?

358
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,700
Oh, I can't. I have a lot of work to do.

359
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,460
Okay.

360
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,740
'Cause I already got
Randy to cover my shift.

361
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

362
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,550
But I bought you a video game.

363
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,920
Bioshock? No way!

364
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,280
Hey, chatterbox.

365
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,700
I thought I heard your voice.

366
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,920
How was your weekend?

367
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,470
It was great.
Liz and I--

368
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,750
I made you a painting.

369
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,320
It's called one-armed mermaid
that's part unicorn with big foot.

370
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,310
Thank you.

371
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,310
Are we still on for tomorrow night?

372
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,240
- Yeah, I can't wait.
- No, he can't.

373
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,760
We're working out.

374
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,250
I'll see ya tomorrow night.

375
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,440
Yeah, I'll take it. Thank you.

376
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,700
Liz, be good to him.

377
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,060
What do you want, Jack?

378
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,650
Tracy, I wanna talk to you.

379
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,320
It's hard for me to admit
when I've made a mistake...

380
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,840
so I won't.

381
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,320
Mr. Jordan, I have made
a terrible mistake.

382
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,090
Because of my arrogance, the
team is now in chaos.

383
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,020
Pedro and Fontanelle quit because
I tried to put them in the outfield.

384
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,430
Of course they did!

385
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,620
They're afraid to go
north of 245th street.

386
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,420
Next you'll be telling me you let Reshon
have contact with his birth mother.

387
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,430
Which Reshon?

388
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,360
Jack, I told you, you did not know
what you were getting yourself into.

389
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,600
Tracy, I only wanted to help.

390
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,750
And now things are out of control.

391
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,600
We have two options.

392
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,260
One, we can cut and run and betray the
people that we made this commitment to,

393
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,080
or you and I can form a coalition.

394
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,260
No way, JD.

395
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,470
Tracy, I thought you
cared about these kids.

396
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,770
Just because I don't support Jack
donaghy, doesn't mean I don't support the kids.

397
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,610
But sir, every one of them wrote you
a letter asking you to come back.

398
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,900
Jack.

399
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,190
If I come back to the team, can I throw
these things away and not have to read 'em?

400
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,810
Tracy, I'll pay somebody
to read them for you.

401
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,260
With your know-how and my resources, we
can turn these kids into winners.

402
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,740
All right, Jack.

403
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,930
What's the plan?

404
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,890
One word: Surge.

405
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,770
That's two words!

406
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:38,960
Jamie...

407
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,430
Look, Jamie, I can't take this
sam and diane thing anymore.

408
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,140
I need to know what we're doing here.

409
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,840
Nothing, Frank. I'm not gay.

410
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,390
I'm not gay either.

411
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,950
That's why it's perfect.

412
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,550
We're just two straight guys who
wanna enjoy each other's bodies.

413
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,980
I gotta go.

414
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,080
Damn, I can't believe we're winning.

415
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,160
I knew the surge would work.

416
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,160
Way to go, Manuel!

417
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,530
That one goes out to W.S.Churchill.

418
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,270
Hey, there's no way that those
batters were born after 1993.

419
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,030
These dominican birth
certificates say otherwise.

420
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,110
Esteban! You're up.

421
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,400
This is just embarrassing.

422
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,220
You look nice.

423
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,070
Oh, thank you.

424
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,360
Oh, I got you that leather
bracelet that you were looking at.

425
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,400
Oh, that's so ill. Thank you.

426
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,720
It is ill.

427
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,950
All right, we should get going
because we're gonna be late.

428
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,950
No we won't, baby.

429
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,430
We're takin' a cab.

430
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,650
Really?

431
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,950
I've never been in a cab
with less than seven people.

432
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,020
Well, stick with me.

433
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,300
I will.

434
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,740
Look at us.

435
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,910
We look awesome together.

436
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,810
Yeah, now I know why
demi moore does this.

437
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,140
I get that reference.

438
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,660
All right, mom. I'm takin' off.

439
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,890
Mom?

440
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,120
Yeah, I'm 20.

441
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,390
I can't afford this place.

442
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,750
All right, honey, have a good time.

443
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,480
I'm beth.

444
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,080
Yep, that's what we look like.

445
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,960
Shut it down.

446
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,550
Oh, hey, Jamie.

447
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,870
That is so awkward now.

448
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,510
Oh, don't worry about it. 
You had your fun.

449
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,480
- But the end was humiliating.
- Of course it was.

450
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,700
All may-december relationships end
in humiliation, sexual incompatibility,

451
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,330
social faux pas, meeting
their parents, it's classic.

452
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,570
I'm not sure it's worth it.

453
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,960
Don't be silly. Jamie was good for you.

454
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,370
A younger companion
makes you feel more alive.

455
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,190
Opens you up to new experiences.

456
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,430
Fresh points of view.

457
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,730
Stimulating conversation.

458
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,050
- Stop repeating what I say--
- stop repeating what I say.

459
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,880
- Look, Aidan, I swear to God--
- Look, Aidan, I swear to God.

460
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,810
- You know what? This is over.
- You know what? This is over.

461
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,300
Of course, there are some exceptions.

462
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,650
Thank God I'm off the market.

463
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,120
Oh, are you seeing someone?

464
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:15,860
What? No.

465
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,780
I mean this company is my girlfriend.

466
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,750
She gives me all the loving
I'll ever want or need.

467
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,100
That's gross, Jack.

468
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,350
- Stop hitting yourself, Jenna!
- Oh, God!

469
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,040
Why are you like this?

470
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,700
Guys! This isn't working!

471
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,460
I'm not gay-gay.

472
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,620
I'm just gay for Jamie.

473
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,050
Frank, I don't think that's a thing.

474
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,210
It is.

475
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,990
Look, you dudes are great, a
lot of fun to dance with,

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,820
and you smell awesome.

477
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,280
Enjoy your night.

478
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,170
Bye, sexy bear!

479
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,920
Terence! You make us all look so bad.


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
