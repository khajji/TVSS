This cappuccino machine
is my way of saying sorry

30
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,200
for what happened the other day.

31
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,660
Tracy, your father is here.

32
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,140

Hey, what's up?

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,860
Are you looking at porn?

39
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,530
I know a good site that's
dirty without sacrificing story.

40
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,090
It's by women for women.

41
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,850
No, I'm looking at real estate.

42
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,160
Jack got it into my head
that I should buy something.

43
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,960
You don't own any property?

44
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,770
No. Do you?

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,990
I own my place here.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,220
My condo in clearwater.

47
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,540
And I bought some land in
the ninth ward after katrina.

48
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm leasing it back to the
government as a prison. Ka-ching!

49
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,880
I gotta get my act together.

50
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,570
Even frank owns that
chicken ranch in nevada.

51
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,250
He thought he was buying a whorehouse.

52
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,530
Look, if you're serious, I do have a lead.

53
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,810
My business manager
says he needs cash fast, 

54
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,200
so he's selling his apartment.

55
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,500
It's gorgeous.

56
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,580
Okay, I'll check it out.

57
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,050
Oh, you're gonna love it.

58
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,140
Oh, if you're interested, A.J.'S also selling
a speedboat and a truck full of cigarettes.

59
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,180
the machine is mankind's
madness and disfigurement.

60
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,840
Industry castrates art.

61
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,730
The only honesty is in suicide.

62
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,290
I can't watch any more
of these german sitcoms!

63
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,100
Try a game show.

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:22,930
Hello.

65
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,040
I got your message.

66
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,400
I really can't come up tonight.

67
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,100
I got a mountain of work to do.

68
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,620
Look, the president is only going
to veto your crazy social programs.

69
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,530
The founding fathers never intended
for the poor to live into their 40s.

70
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,250
Jack...

71
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,900
I know it's my turn, but I'm swamped
with this deutschetelewelt stuff.

72
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,170
If this is gonna work, we
gotta meet each other halfway.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,440
Are you ready to play?

74
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,380
Interrogation bear!

75
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,740
Now-To Buy Your First Apartment

76
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,000
Lemon, you speak german, right?

77
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:49,670
I do.

78
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,250
I spent my junior year
abroad in frankfurt.

79
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,830
I partied so hard over
there, it was cr-azy.

80
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,140
So many different types of sparrows!

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,970
Well, I have to, um...

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,220
delegate some important work to you.

83
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,300
As part of the due
diligence for the dtw deal, 

84
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,580
I need you to watch th television
shows and tell me what you think.

85
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,550
Thank you.

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,370
C.C.And I are trying to meet halfway, which
means balancing work and love and life.

87
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,500
I honestly don't know
how kelly ripa does it.

88
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,170
Look at us--you and
C.C.Are meeting halfway.

89
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,150
I'm going to see an apartment later.

90
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,280
And the community center
is going to stage my play.

91
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,900
- I have thing that night.
- I have a thing that night.

92
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,940
Mr.Jordan, I cannot work
with that machine at my desk.

93
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,170
But you can have
coffee anytime you want.

94
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,860
I don't drink coffee, sir.

95
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,610
I don't drink hot liquids of any kind.

96
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,150
That's the devil's temperature.

97
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,180
Ken, this is new york, the big easy.

98
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,660
Live a little!

99
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,590
Boundaries are made to be tested.

100
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,740
That's why my wife and i
stopped using a "safe word."

101
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,950
But I don't wanna do
anything I'll regret.

102
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,240
Regrets are for horseshoes and handbags.

103
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,510
Oh, my!

104
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,090
How was the apartment?

105
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,640
It was... incredible.

106
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,820
river views. New kitchens.

107
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,850
Party perfect. The windmere.

108
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,350
An oasis from the vile
obscenity ondition.

109
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,280
I made an offer, and they accepted!

110
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,800
- What?
- I know, it's crazy.

111
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,280
I guess i have to get a loan.

112
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,710
Call A.J.But ask for "mike."

113
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,590
I can't believe you bought an apartment.

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,560
Well, not yet.

115
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,890
I still have to get
approved by the co-op board.

116
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,150
I'm all nervous.

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,160
I have to dress up and smile
and try to get them to like me.

118
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,300
It's gonna be like
going on a blind date.

119
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,960
Oh, no, it's so much better.

120
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,580
'Cause an apartment never waits till you get in the
shower then steals the necklace your mother gave you.

121
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,670
the windmere: If you lived
here, you'd be home now!

122
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,520
Hey, slow down there, ken.

123
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,500
Coffee is not like alcohol.

124
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,020
It's pretty addictive.

125
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,790
I love how it makes me feel.

126
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,080
It's like my heart is
trying to hug my brain.

127
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,410
You know what we've never done, grizz?

128
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,230
Fight each other!

129
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,710
Easy, ken.

130
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,490
You guys are my best friends.

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,790
Jack, what the hell is this?

132
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,820
Why are we meeting here?

133
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,420
You said you wanted
me to meet you halfway, 

134
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:46,000
and this betting parlor in the pennsylvania coal mining country
is exactly half the distance between my office and yours.

135
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,400
It's our special place.

136
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,800
Well, technically, that corner is exactly
halfway, but I'm not going over there.

137
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,120
All my life, work came first.

138
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,100
I missed so many
weddings, funerals, karate demonstrations.

139
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,590
Birthdays, lilith fairs.

140
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,630
But not anymore.

141
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,330
You're my new night job.

142
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,120
And I'm gonna love you
like my boss is watching.

143
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,920
Say, what do you think they
do for fun around here?

144
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,750
Smack around nosy
out-of-towners.

145
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,040
Also, we have a lovely doll museum.

146
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,750
Gladys knight to the
stage, please, gladys knight--

147
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,050
hey, kenneth, I need to watch these
dvds, but I haveery important meeting.

148
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,940
That's great!

149
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,700
Now, I've heard you speaking
german to some of your tours.

150
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,450
Oh, yes, sir.

151
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,260
If you're not reading
the bible in german, 

152
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,100
you're not getting the real
versteckte bedeutung of it.

153
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,100
- Okay, well, this is very important.
- You are.

154
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,820
- I need you to watch these shows...
- watchy, watchy.

155
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,620
And write a summary of each one.

156
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,620
It's for mr. Donaghy, and it
has to be done by tomorrow.

157
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,720
And I am delegating it to you.

158
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,020
Your last name is weird.

159
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,580
Are you okay?

160
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,230
Who wants coffee?

161
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,450
let's do it.

162
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,040
Let's move here. We'll get
a little cabin in the woods.

163
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,860
I'll plant heirloom tomatoes.

164
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,420
We'll ride our bikes into town.

165
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,740
I'll grow a beard.

166
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,520
People from my old life
will pass through town.

167
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,660
They won't even recognize me.

168
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,760
They'll just say, "thanks, pap, " and
then they'll buy some of my cider.

169
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,690
The real world calling.

170
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,970
Oh, my god!

171
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,480
I'm in looooove!

172
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,130
God, I wish this town weren't
halfway between d.C.And new york.

173
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,450
And I don't know why i lied to you
guys about having read that book.

174
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,860
I'm just nervous.

175
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,470
Anyway, I didn't read the lovely bones.

176
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,460
This is empty.

177
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,430
So... we have so much in common.

178
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,500
we're all white.

179
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,220
Funny story.

180
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,430
I was on a plane once
with brett favre's cousin--

181
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,390
it says here...that you still
have an outstanding student loan?

182
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,980
Yes. It is outstanding.

183
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,210
No. I can explain that.

184
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,150
The theater program at my
school lost its accreditation, 

185
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,670
so I thought I didn't
have to pay for it anymore.

186
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,090
Look, I didn't think i was
ready for this, but I am.

187
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,890
There's this... connection
that I feel to the apartment.

188
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,730
And I am a great neighbor.

189
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,290
Just ask anyone in my building.

190
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,630
Except raheem.

191
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,570
I turned him in to homeland
security. By accident.

192
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,890
I love your building. There.

193
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,560
I said it. Love.

194
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,300
There's, uh... something
coming out of your nose.

195
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,540
You missed gladys knight's sound check.

196
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,100
Did you know they replace the ps
every five years, just like menudo?

197
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,650
Oh, hey, how did the meeting
with the co-op board go?

198
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,240
Good. Bad.

199
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,400
Really bad. But good.

200
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,530
They said they were gonna let me know.

201
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,800
- Should I call them?
- No.

202
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,560
You have to wait fothem to call you.

203
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,350
Yes. I'm going to play it cool.

204
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,660
That's what homeowners do.

205
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,760
Act like adults. Playing it cool.

206
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,310
The germans are here!

207
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,770
I am going through something right now!

208
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,720
They're a day early.

209
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,790
Jack went to see C.C., And he hasn't come
back yet, and he's not answering his phone.

210
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,720
What? He's not?

211
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,380
This deal has to go through.

212
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,260
Then jack will be ceo, and I
will be king of the assistants!

213
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,980
Please put on some decent
clothes and go talk to them.

214
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,250
You're the only one who's
seen all their shows.

215
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,770
Where's kenneth?

216
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,580
Gentlemen

217
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,580
Mr.Donaghy is not in the positions

218
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,140
to worry himself this occurrence

219
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,050
But your bussiness makings

220
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,830
are much importance to his heart

221
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,770
Return Germany...

222
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,440
Tell the...

223
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,420
Time...

224
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,560
Hubcap(?)

225
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,520
I think they're gonna walk.

226
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,130
Super.

227
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,940
What happened?

228
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,150
I just bought a german
television studio.

229
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,980
That's what I call a country breakfast.

230
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,290
Although I've never been to a place before
where they kill the pig in front of you.

231
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,970
It's so quaint.

232
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,300
It's strange we didn't get any ham.

233
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,020
Morning shift change at the mine.

234
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,780
Oh, boy.

235
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,120
We'd better get back to work too.

236
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,970
Oh, yeah, right.

237
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,110
God, I haven't thought about
work once this whole time.

238
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,410
I know. It's weird.

239
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,750
Good weird or last night weird?

240
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,440
Good weird.

241
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,240
I'll see you tomorrow.

242
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,900
love... a urine mirage
in a desert of fear.

243
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,490
What's happening? Where
are they taking her?

244
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm getting rid of the
machine, ken, for your own good.

245
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,560
No. No, please, don't do that.Come on!

246
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,740
I'll make you feel good.

247
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,530
Get a grip! Look at yourself!

248
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,870
What's happened to me?

249
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,560
You rode the brown serpent.

250
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,500
But the important thing
is you survived, ken.

251
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,090
No.

252
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,550
I made two promises to my mother
before i left for new york.

253
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,860
One, if I found any mackenzies
living up here, I would kill them.

254
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,390
And two, I would not
let this city change me.

255
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,360
So you had a little bender.

256
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,050
It's not just the coffee.

257
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,120
I also went to a pg-13 movie.

258
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,260
I-I bought a pair of sunglasses.

259
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,260
I tried a jewish doughnut.

260
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,910
I'd always been told that
new york wasthe 21st centu.

261
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,180
And look what's happened.

262
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,370
I've become one of them.

263
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,250
I've been sodomized.

264
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,910
Hey, it's liz lemon.

265
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,970
This message is for
the co-op board, I guess.

266
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,230
This is the number you gave me.

267
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,280
I hope it's not fake.

268
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,370
'Cause you accepted my bid, and
I haven't heard from you.

269
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,690
But I'm doing great.

270
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,940
I bought a german
television studio today.

271
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,130
Does everyone know that you're a bunch
of liars, or should I tell them myself?

272
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,950
Because I know a lot of people.

273
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,430
You know what? I'm fine.

274
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,830
Because I know who I am.

275
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,650
You--I feel sorry
for you, co-op board.

276
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,980
I am going to the hospital, and
I hope you're happy!

277
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm just... confused.

278
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:44,520
It seems weird to me that you would still be
advertising the apartment after you accepted my offer.

279
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,780
And I am here to remind

280
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,600
you And you know what? I've moved on.

281
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,090
I bought a whole bunch of apartments.

282
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,810
I bought a black apartment. So...

283
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,480
Yes, sir, but I
think if you--

284
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,290
Lemon, how do you say
"buy" and "sell" in german?

285
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,740
Verkaufen and kaufen.

286
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,460
So close.

287
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,740
Other way around.

288
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,730
Oh, yeah. I always got confused by that.

289
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,220
{\a6}SALE OF NBC TO GERMAN FIRM RUMORED

290
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,520
Blurgh!

291
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,470
Yes. Blurgh.

292
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,120
- But it's a
misunderstanding. - Perfect--

293
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,370
I'll just tell don geiss that I let a subordinate
with an unaccredited theater tech degree

294
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,920
do a billion-dollar handshake deal while my
girlfriend and i showered together at a red roof inn.

295
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,640
{\a6}Hockassin is for lovers

296
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,630
oh, boy, I'm sorry.

297
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,050
No, lemon, it's my fault. Lied to you.

298
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,940
About what?

299
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:45,640
All this time i've been telling you that
we can have it all-- success and happiness.

300
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,350
The big office and true love.

301
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,090
- Wait--we
can't? - No.

302
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,860
Because they both require everything
of you. You have to choose.

303
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,410
So which are you gonna choose?

304
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,090
Uh, excuse me.

305
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,050
Could you turn off the race announcer
and put on some gladys knight?

306
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,720
And what is the
champagne situation here?

307
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,030
Okay, thank you.

308
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,710
What are you still doing in washington?

309
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,410
I can't come to hockassin, jack.

310
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm afraid if I see
you, I'll change my mind.

311
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,790
Change your mind about what?

312
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,960
When I was with you the other day, 

313
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,510
I missed the vote on a bill to
legalize recreational whale torture

314
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,540
We only have one speed, jack.

315
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,210
That's what I love about us.

316
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,900
The drive, the ambition.

317
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,170
Our belief that sex is a competition.

318
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,810
It's what we have in common.

319
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,000
And it's why it's
impossible to pull this off.

320
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,270
No, no, no, you're wrong. It is possible.

321
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,320
I know we can't do all
of this at full speed.

322
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,250
We have to choose. And I choose you.

323
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,990
- Oh, jack.
- Oh, come on.

324
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,100
Get in that ridiculous electric
car of yours and get up here.

325
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:57,480
Look, we are both at a place in our lives right
now where we can't really spend this time--

326
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:04,570
When I was a kid, I was raised in a pretty
religious household, and I remember the one time...

327
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,630
You know, I think it goes
back to my mother's mother.

328
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,150
She was in a loveless
marriage for 40 years...

329
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,060
Yes, sir.

330
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,750
I agree.

331
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,630
Well, if we look at
the larger trend--

332
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,560
well, I'll have it for you
first thing in the morning.

333
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,830
Thank you.

334
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,710
Children, so... do you agree or not?

335
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,910
Oh, boy, uh...

336
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,990
when you think about
it, there's really... no answer.

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,580
Did you take another
call while I was talking?

338
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,560
Yes, but never forgetting that
you were on the other line.

339
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,340
For whatever it's
worth, C.C., I do love you.

340
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,770
Me too.

341
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,710
But we can't do this.

342
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,810
Maybe in another life
we'll get it right.

343
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,300
Sure. In another life.

344
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,960
Thanks, pal.

345
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,020
Mr.Jordan, I just wanted to thank you
for everything that you've done for me.

346
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,390
It's been an honor being your friend

347
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,600
and learning about the non-reproductive
aspects of human sexuality from you.

348
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,120
But this is good-bye.

349
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:27,810
I let my mama down, and
I'm going back to georgia.

350
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,870
What?

351
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,530
No, you can't leave, ken!

352
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,390
Who's gonna help me
tell white people apart?

353
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,340
And what about our tickets to spamalot?

354
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,860
And who'll be my
wingman at speed dating?

355
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,500
Oh, grizz, I'll miss you most of all.

356
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,040
New york, mm

357
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,080
proved too much for the man

358
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,410
too much for the man

359
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,080
he couldn't make it .

360
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,450
so he's leaving the life

361
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,480
he's come to know

362
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,830
he's leavin' leavin'

363
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,580
on that midnight train to georgia

364
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,270
leavin' on a midnight train well, well

365
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,240
liz

366
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,620
The board.

367
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,770
You look... good.

368
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,120
Thank you. So do you.

369
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,690
Liz, this is charlotte.

370
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,050
She's, uh, buying the apartment.

371
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,760
Congratulations.

372
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,130
If you blow out the kitchen wall, you
can make a very nice breakfast nook.

373
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,770
Yes, he's leavin'

374
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,530
yes, he's leav-iiiin'

00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,680
leavin' on a midnight train

377
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,180
and you shouldn't torture whales.

378
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,270
I'm sorry about C.C.

379
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,540
Thanks, lemon.

380
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,730
Wanna get drunk?

381
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,110
No. There's too many phones in here.

382
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,060
You should have gone for it, you know?

383
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,960
You made the same choice
that C.C.And I did.

384
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,440
You chose your career over floyd.

385
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,340
My world her world

386
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,680
his world, our world

387
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,350
mine and his alone

388
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,650
I've got to go, 

389
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,150
I've got to go

390
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,210

misinformed about the time

397
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,470
misinformed about the time

398
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,630
didn't even get to stand in line

399
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,190
