1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,930
Oh,hey,I,uh,I found your lipstick.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,790
Oh,no,this isn't mine.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,820
This is sunset blush.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,290
I wear tiger orgasm.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,920
But it was in my apartment.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't know why I told
you about the pop-tart.

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,980
But that's weird.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,040
It's just me and pete at my place.

9
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,390
Hello,ladies.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,350
Pete's having an affair.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,880
What?

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,530
The lipstick,the spring in his step.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,320
The sexy justin timberlake hat.

14
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,810
No,no,he's still married.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,880
I don't know what to tell you.

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,130
The only reason men start
taking care of themselves is

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,000
if they're getting someone
to have sex with them.

18
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,550
If it wasn't for that,they'd just
sit at home in their own filth.

19
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,580
Hey,Liz.

20
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,550
We're out of string cheese,so
I think i'm gonna take off.

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,600
What sketch is that for?

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,090
It's not for a sketch.

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,470
It's part of our new company-wide
global eco initiative.

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,770
We're going green,Lemon.

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,810
And do you know why?

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,750
To save the earth?

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,290
So we can drain the
remainder of its resources.

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,860
Don Geiss is a genius.

29
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,440
He's pitting all of the divisions
of the company against each other

30
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,150
to see who can make the most money
from this environmentalism trend.

31
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,130
And I am going to win with...

32
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,560
greenzo!

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,540
Saving the earth while
maintaining profitability.

34
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,480
That's right,jared.

35
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,910
Greenzo is america's
first non-judgmental,

36
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,780
business-friendly
environmental advocate.

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,010
The free market will
solve global warming,

38
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,120
- if that even exists.
- My boy.

39
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:31,630
Greenzo?

40
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,990
Is that the first name
that came to your head?

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,690
Can you believe it? I mean,it
just popped rightthere.

You're gonna be great,jared.

46
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,890
I'm just so excited about this gig,sir.

47
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,100
I mean,what a--
what a sweet gig.

48
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,210
I've got a gig.

49
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,690
Yeah,you're saying "gig" a lot.

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,280
Oh,I'm so sorry.

51
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,530
I haven't worked in a while.

52
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,590
My last real job was an ad for rick
lazio's new york senate campaign.

53
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,700
Hillary clinton wants
an all-homosexual army.

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,700
How will that affect my family?

55
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,630
Well,thankfully,those
days are behind you.

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,600
Your billboard's going
up in times square.

57
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,940
You're releasing an endangered falcon
during halftime at the knicks game. And...

58
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,670
you're booked on the today show.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,870
Oh,wow,the today show!

60
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,030
I just wish my mom were still alive
so I could rub it in her fat face.

61
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,140
Uh,come with me.

62
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,940
He's having another party.

63
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,100
Howdy.

64
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,810
Hope you can make it.

65
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,030
See ya there.

66
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,640
What's up,Lemon?

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm hiding from Kenneth.

68
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,030
I don't wanna get roped into
another one of his terrible parties.

69
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,020
I'm always the only person who shows up.

70
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,940
Happy halloween,baby.

71
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,560
How could no one go to ken's party?

72
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,780
He's such a great dude.

73
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,050
Will you come,please?

74
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,420
No,I can'T.

75
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,880
I only go to a-list events.

76
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,430
Ohh,I don't wanna be stuck
there alone with him again.

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,770
Don't sweat it,'cause
I'm gonna bail you out.

78
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,730
I'm gonna turn ken's
jam into a major event.

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,530
Good luck with that.

80
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,450
See,all a hot party needs is mystique.

81
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,280
A buzz.

82
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,280
See,people are like lemmings.

83
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,230
Harvey lemmings,my lawyer,who
never misses a party.

84
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,120
That's not a real peon.

85
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,870
You made that up.

86
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,510
I just have to start a little rumor.

87
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,790
Who are the biggest gossips on tgs?

88
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,900
grizz and dotcom.

89
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,690
So,greenzo,what else can kids and
parents do to protect the environment?

90
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,530
well,kids,you can tell your parents to buy a
G.E.Front-loading washing machine to save water.

91
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,370
'Cause if the earth's not here,where
else is greenzo gonna dance?

92
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,070
Thanks for getting the
message out,greenzo.

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,860
You're saving the world.

94
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,410
Did you hear what mary said
about me saving the world?

95
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,340
Sorry,everybody,that's meredith viera.

96
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,740
The today show wants to give
us a recurring segment now.

97
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,970
Lemon,I want you to write them up.

98
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,720
I want the sketches to be
punchy and entertaining,

99
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,210
so don't treat it like your show.

100
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,800
All right,but only because I like earth.

101
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,140
Jared,we'll send you some stuff.

102
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,190
Oh,I'd like to sit in and give notes.

103
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,560
Make sure it's got that greenzo voice.

104
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,870
It's wry and wise,but--but
also very sexual.

105
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,100
Walk with me,Lemon.

106
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,430
Look how greenzo's testing.

107
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,090
They love him in every demographic.

108
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,470
Colored people,broads,fairies,commies.

109
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,120
Gosh,we gotta update these forms.

110
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,160
Yeah,well,greenzo seems
to love himself too.

111
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,300
So does don Geiss.

112
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,320
He sent me a personal
card congratulating me.

113
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,230
With a real signature!

114
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
Wow,if you licked the
envelope,you could clone him,

115
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,200
and then you'd have two Geisses.

116
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,240
Yeah,right,Lemon.

117
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,440
I'm gonna clone Geiss,then compete
with a Geiss clone for the ceo position?

118
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,430
Think it thr

119
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,440
Ms.Lemon,mr.Donaghy,I'm just
a simple pig farmer's son.

120
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,530
But I would be honored if you'd
come to a party at my home.

121
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh,whatever,fine. I'll come.

122
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,630
Super. Mr.D?

123
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,780
Uh,no. I could make
up some excuse,Kenneth,

124
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,390
but I have too much respect for you.

125
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,980
During your party,I'll be
home,listening to some schubert.

126
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,370
And,uh,ironically,viewing
some canadian pornography.

127
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,910
Hope you're ready to
party like it's 1999.

128
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,290
Which,according to my
bible,will be in seven years.

129
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,420
Oh,what is that smell?

130
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,270
That is the body spray that
came with my new leather Jacket.

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,130
Oh,my god.

132
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,430
Are you having an affair?

133
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,300
What? No.

134
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,450
Why would you say that?

135
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,940
Because you're acting all
happy and full of life.

136
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,020
Liz,you're crazy.

137
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,180
Yeah,and you're married,remember,pete?

138
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,790
Your beautiful wife paula.

139
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,390
And your sons,robert and Jack.

140
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,020
And that creepy little one who's always
rubbing himself against the carpet.

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,080
Liz... I'm not cheating on paula.

142
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,090
You better not be!

143
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,060
Oh,great,now I smell
like midlife crisis!

144
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,540
Here's a tip,cerie.

145
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,850
Decide what you want before
you open the refrigerator.

146
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,130
You just released enough hydro
fluorocarbons to kill a penguin.

147
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,070
This penguin.

148
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,530
You ever take off that costume?

149
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,370
You ever take off yours?

150
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,710
Greenzo out!

151
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,230
Did he just talk to me like I'm ugly?

152
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,280
Hey,fellas.

153
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,340
I heard a secret about Kenneth's party.

154
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,970
Ken went to high school in
georgia with the rapper T.I.

155
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,300
And,boys...

156
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,920
T.I.Might show up.

157
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,030
But listen...

158
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,050
we can't let anyone know. Anyone!

159
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,280
Got it? Right.

176
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,170
Well,Kenneth is having this
really,really big party.

177
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,660
Yes,that's right,you heard me!

178
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,760
T.I.Is gonna be at Kenneth's party!

179
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,130
You're my publicist. Get me in!

180
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:22,200
Oh,also,could you try to kill that
story about my mom being meless?

181
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,980
I love T.I.

182
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,120
Please,respect celebrity privacy.

183
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,860
It's a party?

184
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,640
Yes,but don't tell anybody.

185
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,360
That was Geiss's social
secretary. What did he say?

186
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,610
He was talking about some
epic party at Kenneth's!

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,670
He claims he needs an
invite for mr.Geiss.

188
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,800
You're saying Geiss might
be at Kenneth's party?

189
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:44,840
- Our Kenneth?
- Yes!

190
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,180
Why would he go to that?

191
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,150
What else do you know?

192
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,340
T.I.Is going to be there.

193
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,920
Bob logan from texas
instruments is gonna be there?

194
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,990
Logan must be in contention
for the ceo spot as well.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,870
Sir,if there's any chance that
mr.Geiss is going to be at this party

196
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,250
Thanks,jonathan. Think
I should try to go?

197
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,130
I...

198
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,100
I've gotta find Kenneth.

199
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,810
I,uh,haven't had a chance to
get to that greenzo stuff yet.

200
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,490
Hey,did you leave your
computer on all night?

201
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah,it just takes a really long
time to reboot in the morning.

202
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,130
Hey,you know what
else takes a long time?

203
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,890
Building a new earth.

204
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,660
- Listen,jared-
- greenzo.

205
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,570
I'm working with you as a favor.

206
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,140
You know what? You people make me sick.

207
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,050
You act like you
care,but you do nothing.

208
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,490
Do you even bother to
compost your own feces?

209
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,070
Look,I got a lot of real work
that I have to do right now.

210
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,460
So I'm not really interested
in having some actor lecture me.

211
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,150
Are you saying actors
can't change the world?

212
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,220
I guess nobody bothered
to tell sharon stone.

213
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,780
Look,I always knew i
can make a difference.

214
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,630
And now I finally have my platform,

215
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,090
so l's have a little less yappity
yap and a little more kity clack.

216
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,180
All right,that's it. I'm telling Jack.

217
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,720
- This is not working.
- Wait.

218
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,550
What's in that styrofoam cup,huh?

219
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,830
The earth's blood?

220
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,900
- Give me that.
- No.

221
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,430
You jag! I just got
this,like,eight years ago.

222
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,760
Good job.

223
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,070
Leave all the lights on
for the invisible people.

224
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,760
Gross!

225
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,590
- Liz!
- Paula?

226
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
You're cheating with your wife?

227
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,550
Why didn't you te me about this!

228
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,090
That's my fault.

229
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,600
I get off on the sneakin'
around. Who knew,right?

230
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,020
So how are your parents?

231
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,090
No,no,no. We'll catch up later.

232
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,250
I just came to get a clean sweater.

233
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,630
Why is there a pop-tart in the bed?

234
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,170
What do you do with the pop-tart?

235
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,690
Hey,did you hear about
Kenneth's insane party?

236
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,980
T.I.'S gonna be there.

237
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,080
I'm surprised to hear that
because that is new information.

238
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,190
Yeah,and he's gonna perform.

239
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,760
He is?

240
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,080
And fall out boy will be there too.

241
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,660
And there's gonna be foxy boxing!

242
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,140
Foxy boxing? I love foxy boxing!

243
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,270
It combines my two favorite
things: Boxing and referees!

244
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,880
I got to get into that party man.

245
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,760
Get me harvey lemmings!

246
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,940
You dummy,first of all,you
didn't dial that cell phone.

247
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,720
Second of all,that is your own rumor.

248
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,620
People are gonna show up
expecting all this great stuff,

249
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,340
and they're gonna be
disappointed and angry.

250
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,960
Just like colonial williamsburg.

251
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,570
You need to nip this in the bud.

252
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,600
Tell Kenneth what you've
done and cancel the party.

253
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,930
Kenneth,thanks for letting
my cousins come to your party.

254
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,310
I'm just horny to be in New York

255
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,700
Hey,Kenneth,you know how much
i like to joke around,right?

256
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,000
Not really,mr.Donaghy.

257
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,590
Well,before,when I told you i
didn't wanna come to your party,

258
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,450
I was just kidding!

259
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,590
Isn't that a fantastic joke?

260
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,560
I don't understand what's happening.

261
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,180
Well,the point is that I have good news.

262
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,840
I may be able to stop by now.

263
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,720
Oh,mr.Donaghy,you don't
wanna go to my silly party.

264
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,480
so that's the way you wanna play this?

265
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,510
Whip 'em out,measure 'em.

266
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,480
Kenneth,as an executive vice
president at general electric,

267
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm ordering you to give me
one of those pink cupcakes.

268
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,370
Ld love it if you came to my party.

269
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,500
Yeah.

270
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,370
You would.

271
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,280
Sweet.

272
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,870
Everyone's coming.

273
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,030
You're just in time,Lemon.

274
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,030
Greenzo's segment on the
today show is about to begin.

275
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,560
Yeah,I didn't write
anything for that guy.

276
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,100
He has gone off the deep end.

277
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,870
You gotta replace hi

278
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,130
don't mess with success,Lemon.

279
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,360
Viewers love green Geiss loves greenzo.

280
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,690
We're not changing anything.

281
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,530
Hey,kids,can you hold your breath?

282
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,930
Good. Now do it forever.

283
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,410
'Cause the air is gonna be poisoned
unless we switch to green technology.

284
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,860
Sold by our company.

285
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,650
I love this guy.

286
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,670
You know,greenzo,I read that
television sets actually draw power

287
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,020
even when they're turned off.

288
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,040
Meredith just taught us a
very important lesson,kids.

289
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,970
It's rude to interrupt people.

290
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,150
Can greenzo get real here for a second?

291
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,730
Did you know that there are people out
there with the power to heal mother gaia,

292
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,010
but they're paralyzed by greed?

293
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,950
I'm talking about big companies and
their two-faced,fat cat executives.

294
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,190
What is he doing?

295
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,980
Stay calm.

296
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,410
Did you kids know that we could actually
end global warming in five years,

297
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,420
if we just raised taxes on
the super-rich by just 2%?

298
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,440
Wow,is that true?

299
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,450
It doesn't matter if it's true.

300
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,220
He works for that money.

301
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,060
We've lost control of greenzo.

302
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,980
I knew we should have
gone with angie harmon.

303
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,850
kill trees?

304
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,270
Hey,Liz.

305
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,230
Look,obviously what happened in
your bed last night was a violation.

306
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,760
So much hair.

307
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,230
Sorry,she likes me natural.

308
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,290
Listen,I am glad that
you're back with paula.

309
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,770
But when are you moving out?

310
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,340
No,no,no,Liz. I can't move out.

311
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,220
Look,paula and I got
married our sophomore year.

312
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,900
She was pregnant 20
minutes into the first date.

313
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,960
This is the first chance we've
had to just... be a couple.

314
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,380
And our relationship
has never been better.

315
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,870
We did it on your kitchen table.

316
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,710
I shouldn't have told you that.

317
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,050
Liz,please.

318
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,650
Please let me be your
roommate so I can date my wife.

319
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,670
Oh,I can't believe i'm saying this.

320
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,010
- Okay.
- Yes!

321
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
Oh,Liz,you're the best.

322
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,860
Oh,hey,could you come
home early tonight?

323
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,030
Paula wants to get caught again.

324
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,050
Got it.

325
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,340
Hey,you catch me on today,Jack?

326
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,840
Mary was totally digging me.

327
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,600
Dude,have you hit that?

328
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,170
Jared,I'm a little concerned that
we're losing our message here.

329
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,350
It's
non-judgmental,business-friendly.

330
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,760
Oh,no,no,no,no. We're
way past that,Jack.

331
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,720
While you're out there destroying
the earth,I'll be saving it.

332
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,190
And history will remember me.

333
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,260
When I die,they'll wanna
put my face on money.

334
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,760
If there were money in the
future instead of just hugs.

335
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,200
Okay,you listen to me,redzo.

336
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,170
You either get on board,or
you're gonna wake up on that

337
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,120
island with phil donahue
and the electric car.

338
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,890
You understand me?

339
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,590
I made you what you are.

340
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,980
No,I've always been greenzo.

341
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,490
You're crazy.

342
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,270
And you're fired.

343
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,430
Really?

344
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,600
Can you fire the wind,Jack?

345
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,050
Can you fire a hurricane?

346
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,190
We're developing that technology!

347
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,840
hey,Liz,you going to Kenneth's party?

348
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,200
Is this party still on?

349
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:53,980
Oh,it better be.

350
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,650
The harlem globetrotters
are gonna be there.

351
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,190
The girl from heroes
is gonna take a shower.

352
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,380
Now Jack is going to
this party?This is nuts--

353
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,640
you said you were gonna shut it down.

354
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,770
I couldn'T. This means too much to ken.

355
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,930
And when everyone shows up and it sucks?

356
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,080
It's not going to.

357
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,750
This party's about to
become a tracy jordan joint!

358
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,950
And what does that entail?

359
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,470
Here we go!

360
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,660
I've called this meeting to discuss what
happened last night at Kenneth's party.

361
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,930
******Kiss me.

362
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,550
We all went in with
certain expectations.

363
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,530
The evening took a nasty left turn.

364
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,600
Now we must face certain
facts in the cold light of day.

365
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,910
Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves.

366
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,310
Mr.Lutz,you ate all my
parakeet's medication.

367
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,190
And thanks to you,sonny crockett
has been having seizures all morning.

368
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,100
Mr.Hornberger,I would thank you to
come pick up your wife at some point.

369
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,400
Mr.Jordan,I saw you steal my sink.

370
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,600
Harlem globetrotter...

371
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,700
does that name mean nothing to you?

372
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,310
And ms.Lemon.

373
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,290
I will have you know
that before last night,

374
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,040
I had never,ever seen
grizz or dotcom cry.

375
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,020
I want you all to think
about what you did.

377
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,330
Congratulations.

378
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,860
You were all present at Kenneth
parcell's last party ever.

379
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,880
Mr.Donaghy,uh...

380
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,720
they are ready for you downstairs.

381
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,540
I'm gonna,uh...

382
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,870
need a moment.

383
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,090
What is this for?

384
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,200
The today show was expecting
another green segment.

385
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,190
Don Geiss is expecting it.

386
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,390
It's gonna happen.

387
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,240
But you fired jared,so who's gonna...

388
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,530
oh,my god. That's al gore.

389
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,060
Is he gonna be the new greenzo?

390
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,890
Uh,not exactly.

391
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,070
I may have gotten him
here under false pretenses.

392
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
Hey,Jack,good to see you again.

393
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,810
Mr.Vice president.

394
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,840
Hi,how are you?

395
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,810
I'm Lemon.

396
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,910
So I'm excited to see this
trash-powered car of yours.

397
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,630
How do you two even know each other?

398
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,600
We met when Jack was an
intern for senator ted kennedy.

399
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,280
Let me tell ya,Jack was
the most liberal guy--

400
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,850
The thing is,the G.E.Garbage
car isn't quite ready yet.

401
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,890
But while you're here,what do you say you
throw on a pair of green tights and a cape,

402
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,120
and tell the kids how big business
is good for the environment?

403
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,440
I have no interest in doing that.

404
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,340
Al,we're with you on
this whole planet thing.

405
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,240
I mean,look at the set we built with the
smiley-face earth and some green things.

406
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,090
Jack,look,we're way beyond that.

407
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,920
If your network really wants to
demonstrate a commitment to the environment,

408
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,890
why don't you start by,for example,

409
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,740
having an entire week with nothing but
environmental themes on all the programs?

410
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,910
Use entertainment for substance.

411
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,960
You could have a character in prime time

412
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,470
making a passionate argument
to the american people

413
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,070
that we need co2 taxes to
replace the payroll taxes.

414
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,280
Your parent company could lobby congress and the
president to pass the treaty and save the climate.

415
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,720
Yes,or...

416
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,420
you could put on a silly
hat and tell the kids

417
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,590
how outsourcing means
cheaper toys at christmas.

418
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,470
This is not working for me,Jack.

419
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,650
All right,let's do this!

420
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,320
Jared,what are you doing here?

421
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,270
Al gore?

422
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,650
What's up?

423
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,740
Jared,it's time for you to go.

424
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,120
No,no!

425
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,040
The show must go on!

426
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,250
Back off,Jack!

427
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,010
Or you'll be greenzoed!

428
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,010
You'll all be greenzoed!

429
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,420
Jared! Jared!

430
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,300
I--I am so
sorry,mr.Vice president.

431
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,730
- This all started
when Jack- - Quiet!

432
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,710
A whale is in trouble.

433
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,420
I have to go.

434
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,700
Give it to me

435
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,630
Oh,boy,okay. This earth is
ruined!We gotta get a new one.
