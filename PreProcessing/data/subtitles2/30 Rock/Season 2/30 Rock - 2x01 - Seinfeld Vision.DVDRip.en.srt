1
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,409
Hey.
How was your summer?

2
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,239
Hey, Gary.
How was your summer?

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,779
Hey.
How was your summer?

4
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,314
Hey, Jack!
There's my buddy.

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,012
Walk with me, Lemon.

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,814
You look great.

7
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,388
I can't believe
I haven't spoken to you

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,490
since your
heart attack.

9
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,285
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,291
Nobody from corporate
knows about my cardiac event,

11
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,520
and I want to leave it
that way.

12
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,526
I'm back, Lemon.

13
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,029
I've had the most productive
summer of my life.
Me too.

14
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,726
All of my summer
replacement shows were big hits.

15
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,463
"America's Next Top Pirate."
"Are You Stronger Than a Dog?"

16
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,334
"MILF Island."
"MILF Island"?

17
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,805
"25 superhot moms.
50 eighth-grade boys.

18
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:43,874
No rules."

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,068
Oh, yeah,
didn't one of those women

20
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,269
turn out
to be a prostitute?

21
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,904
That doesn't mean she's not
a wonderful, caring MILF.

22
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:54,209
Well, I had a great summer, too.
And, um...

23
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,219
Did you redecorate, or...

24
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,620
Sir, I have all the latest
"Seinfeld-Vision" promos.

25
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,986
Oh, wonderful.

26
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,991
What's "Seinfeld-Vision"?

27
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,221
Well,
I realized that NBC owns

28
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,798
hundreds of hours
of footage of Seinfeld

29
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,834
from his massively successful
television series, "Seinfeld."

30
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:12,938
So my old tech guys were able
to digitally capture Seinfeld,

31
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,565
and now we can basically make
him do or say whatever we want.

32
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,869
So for the month
of October,

33
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,569
all of our prime-time shows
will feature

34
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,806
a computerized guest appearance
from Mr. Jerry...

35
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,211
Seinfeld.

36
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,750
If you didn't kill her,
why didn't you stay?

37
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,012
Quit grilling me!

38
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,485
"Seinfeld-Vision"?

39
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,988
Save the cheerleader,
save the world.

40
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,194
Yeah!
That's what I said!

41
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,819
"Seinfeld-Vision"?

42
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,330
Deal or no deal?

43
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,867
I'll take that deal!

44
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,431
Does Jerry Seinfeld know
you're doing this?

45
00:01:47,574 --> 00:01:49,269
Jerry's in Europe
with his family right now.

46
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,569
But by the time
he gets back,

47
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,200
"Seinfeld-Vision" will be
a monster hit.

48
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,176
His kids will go to school,
and their friends will say,

49
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,782
"I really loved your dad on that
episode of 'Medium' last night."

50
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,043
And he's...
he's gonna love it.

51
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,812
Uh-huh.

52
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,546
Well, I had
a great summer, too.

53
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,453
I started a quilt.
I did yoga twice a week.

54
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,116
I wore flip-flops
in public.

55
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,285
I really feel like
this is gonna be my year.

56
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,057
"Biggest Loser."
So, uh, what's up with Floyd?

57
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,063
Uh, we broke up.

58
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,498
We agreed that it was crazy
to try it long-distance.

59
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,001
And I feel great
about it.

60
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,002
Oh, come on.

61
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,663
Lemon, if there's two things
I'm certain of,

62
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,638
one is you will never finish
that quilt...
I know.

63
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,299
...and you are not
over Floyd.

64
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,468
No, I really am, Jack.

65
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,546
I'm telling you,
this is my year.

66
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,375
I feel like
the show's gonna be great.

67
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,144
And I'm very positive that
I'm gonna meet someone else.

68
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,650
Lemon, women your age

69
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,016
are more likely to be mauled
at the zoo than get married.

70
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,681
Good to see you.
Bye.

71
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,759
Glad we're both doing
so great.

72
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,521
Put Floyd's name
on that quilt.

73
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,041
Yo, Ken, I'm gonna use

74
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,810
this whole kitchen area
as my bathroom.

75
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,815
Spread the word.

76
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,249
What is this?

77
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,615
Mr. Jordan's wife
kicked him out.

78
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,655
She froze my credit cards,
Liz Lemon.

79
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,314
And she got custody
of Grizz.

80
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,449
Can I keep my cockatiel
in your office?

81
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,824
No. Go home and apologize
to your wife.

82
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,261
What?
I'm not apologizing.

83
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,697
'Cause for once in my life,
I haven't done anything wrong.

84
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,426
How many years
have you known me, Liz Lemon?

85
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,332
One.

86
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,371
So you know I like to minister
to transvestite prostitutes.

87
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,168
I don't think
I did know that, no.

88
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,708
It's true.
He doesn't mess with them.

89
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,538
He just tries to get them
into computer school.

90
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,169
So Labor Day weekend,

91
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,374
I see this young she-dude
at the Dumpster by the 40/40.

92
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,848
I pull over and I say,

93
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,681
"You don't have to live
your life like this.

94
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,051
You can be a freaky-deaky
and do data entry."

95
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,158
Sure.
"What about
court reporting?

96
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,283
Believe in yourself!"

97
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,122
Right.

98
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,787
So as I reach in the trash
and pull this dude out,

99
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,399
a paparazzo jumps out
and takes a picture of me.

100
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,196
"Tracy Jordan
and his wife, Angie."
Oops.

101
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,601
So not only are you holding
a transvestite prostitute...

102
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,798
They confused shim with
Mrs. Jordan... Yes, ma'am.

103
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,465
And they think
she looks better here

104
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,237
than she did
at the 2004 Grammys.

105
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,970
Who's gonna do
my banking?

106
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,546
Who's gonna write my blogs?

107
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,478
Who's gonna do the cooking
on taco Wednesdays?

108
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,450
Okay, Kenneth, you are now
in charge of helping Tracy

109
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,487
with any of the nonsexual things
that Angie would do for him.

110
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,887
So he's, like,
my office wife?

111
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,788
Sure.
Let's go with that.

112
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,922
Kenneth Parcell,
would you take this ring...

113
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,931
and sell it in the Jewish part
of Midtown

114
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,899
and use the money to get us
a Nintendo Wii?

115
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,097
Yes. Yes!
A thousand times, yes!

116
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,008
Liz, how was your summer?

117
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,205
Good.
Floyd and I...
'Cause my play
was amazing.

118
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,337
There is nothing
like the thrill

119
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,747
of doing a live show
on Broadway.

120
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,582
You know, Jojo...

121
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,123
When life
keeps handing you anchovies?

122
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,353
Just cover them up
with some extra cheese?

123
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,225
And make a pizza?

124
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,527
I'm sorry I missed it.
It sounds just like the movie.

125
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,533
What happened to you?
Do I look fat?

126
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,763
Liz, I had to eat
four slices of pizza

127
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,236
onstage
at each performance.

128
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,534
Jenna, that's 32 pieces
of pizza a week!

129
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,143
No.
That can't be right.

130
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,245
Liz, it's like I flipped
the eating switch,

131
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,539
and I can't flip it back.

132
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,773
You have to help me.

133
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,282
Well, how am I su...
Oh, it's worse from behind.

134
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,477
I'm on it.

135
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,055
She needs to lose 30 pounds
or gain 60.

136
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,987
Anything in between
has no place on television.

137
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:27,956
I can't believe
I missed you.

138
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,455
Did Jack say anything
about my weight?

139
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,463
No, he didn't even mention it.
He's not noticing.

140
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,726
No one is noticing.

141
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,836
Oh! Whoa!
Oh, damn! Yowza!

142
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,904
Hey, Mr. Michelin,
I love your tires.

143
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,133
Okay, everyone.
Welcome back.

144
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,368
Some of you may be wondering

145
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,536
what happened between me and my
boyfriend, Floyd, this summer.

146
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,171
The answer is, we did break up,
but I am doing fine.

147
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,442
Was Floyd
the black guy?

148
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,484
Okay.
You don't care.

149
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,519
I don't care, either.
So, great.

150
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,249
I want a packet of 50 ideas from
each of you by tomorrow morning.

151
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,552
What?
Come on! Oh, boo!

152
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,926
Hey, I need
to ask you guys something.

153
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,089
Move away from me.
Don't stand near me.

154
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,863
Will you guys be bridesmaids
in my wedding?

155
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,470
Oh, that is very sweet.

156
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,132
But I think I might be
past bridesmaid age.

157
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,173
Oh, I'm sorry.

158
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,005
Is it hard for you
because you just broke up

159
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,476
with that Floyd guy?

160
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,547
No! What? No.
That's...

161
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,513
You know, I would love...

162
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,050
We would love
to be your bridesmaids.

163
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,518
Great. We need to go
dress shopping tomorrow, then.

164
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,555
So meet me at Les Fesses
at 10:00 a.m.

165
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,682
Yay!
Yay!

166
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,321
Ohh.
Now I have my "something old."

167
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,530
Rise and shine,
Mr. Jordan.

168
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,801
I couldn't sleep at all
last night.

169
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,410
Angie kept
my Sharper lmage

170
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,740
white-noise
aromatherapy machine.

171
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,475
She knows I can't sleep
without the sound of the ocean

172
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,675
and the smell of bacon.

173
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,911
Well, hurry up
and get your second wind,

174
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,715
'cause I've got our day
all planned out.

175
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,585
We'll start
at Bed Bath & Beyond

176
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,216
and get all the things
that you're gonna need in here.

177
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,794
Then an old friend of mine
from college

178
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,556
is having her baby shower
out on Long Island,

179
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,164
so we'll swing by there.

180
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,164
And for dinner,
I thought we could just stay in

181
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,326
and have the rest of that soup
that I made yesterday.

182
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,131
I'm not doing any of that.

183
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,432
Okay. Fine.

184
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,135
I went with you
to your black vampire movie,

185
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,643
but I guess
I'll just tell my friends

186
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,746
that you have
a migraine.

187
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,314
Great compromise,
office wife.

188
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:32,911
Okay.

189
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,403
Hey, you know where I could find
that Jack Donaghy?

190
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:57,036
I got a bone to pick
with that guy.

191
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:58,837
I don't know which bone
I'm gonna pick.

192
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,969
But he's got some bones,
and I'm gonna pick one.

193
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,481
Really?

194
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,720
Weddings are so weird.

195
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,830
This veil costs
more than my couch.

196
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,491
Is that comedy, or do you
really have a $300 couch?

197
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,601
Both.

198
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,028
What, you never pretended
to be a bride

199
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,196
when you were
a little girl?

200
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,865
I did.
I just never romanticized it.

201
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,274
This is my husband,
Sol Rosenbear.

202
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:37,348
And this is his son, Richard,
from a previous marriage.

203
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,247
And then he cheated on me
with a lamb.

204
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,253
Oh.
Liz,
this dress is amazing.

205
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,583
They don't have it
in my size.

206
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,352
Can you try it on for me
so I can see how it hangs?

207
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,257
Yes. You're closer, Liz.
You do it.

208
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,421
I mean,
I could do it, but...

209
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,931
Fun.
This is fun.

210
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,268
Sir, Jerry Seinfeld
is here to see you.

211
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,067
You told me he was in Europe.
Does he look upset?

212
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,769
He looks the way you did
when I tried to hold
your hand on the jet.

213
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,106
Stall him a few minutes,
Jonathan,

214
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:08,270
till I get
my ducks in a row.

215
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,574
And get Legal
on the phone.

216
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,419
Oh, my God.

217
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,488
If I cover my good eye,

218
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,954
you look just like
Courteney Cox.

219
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,390
This one is really nice, Cerie.
And it's 40% off.

220
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:23,290
Oh, no.

221
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,125
Aris would kill me if I ever
bought a dress on sale.

222
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,426
I can't.

223
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,232
It really is nice,
isn't it?

224
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,307
You should buy it
and save it for your wedding.

225
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,171
No, no.
I'm... I'm single.

226
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,243
Doing great.

227
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,108
But don't you think you will
ever get married to anyone?

228
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,011
You are trying
to make a sale.

229
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,914
I know how this works.

230
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,350
Oh, thank you.

231
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,889
Hi. Jack?

232
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,356
No, of course I'm at the office.
Yeah.

233
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,653
Stall who?

234
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,888
This is
our control room.
Uh-huh.

235
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,726
There's nobody in there.
Sorry there's nothing to see.

236
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,800
We just got back
from summer hiatus yesterday.

237
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,562
Yeah.
Everybody's summer good?

238
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,865
Oh, mine was great!
I read, like, two books.

239
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,098
I broke up
with my boyfriend.

240
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,707
But I'm doing great.
I'm totally over it.

241
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:10,968
Mm-hmm.
Still talking?

242
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,168
Oh, no, no, no, no.

243
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,109
I haven't talked to him since,
whoa, I don't know.

244
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,148
August 9th, 4:17 p. M?

245
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,342
Mm-hmm.
It's not over.

246
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,952
Oh, no, it's over.
I'm over it.

247
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,851
No, it's not over
till you pick up the phone,

248
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,423
you say,
"I don't love you anymore."

249
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,458
They say, "I don't love you
anymore, either."

250
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,254
You go, "Great.
I'll pick you up in 20.

251
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,487
Let's grab a scone."

252
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,562
A scone. Yes!

253
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,392
I want that.
I'm gonna call him.

254
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,056
Liz Lemon!

255
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,566
I need you
to go to my house

256
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,296
and pretend you're doing
a survey for the Ranford Group.

257
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,998
And then ask my wife if she's
sleeping with D.L. Hughley.

258
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,574
No, I'm not doing
any of that.

259
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,733
J.S.!

260
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,174
Oh, Tracy.

261
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,040
What's up?

262
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,046
Liz Lemon, me and this dude
used to do stand-up together.

263
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,049
Remember that night we had the
three-way with Elayne Boosler?

264
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,153
I don't think
that was me.

265
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,118
Oh, yeah.
You know what?

266
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,655
I think that was a mirror.

267
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,621
Ah.

268
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,885
J.S.,
this is my Kenneth.

269
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,497
Ah, yeah. You again.
Hello.

270
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,496
Jonathan, when is he gonna meet
with Jerry?

271
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:08,565
This is taking forever.

272
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,862
Mr. Donaghy left.
What? When?!

273
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,369
Just a few minutes ago.

274
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,171
Jack?

275
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,903
Jack?

276
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,244
Jack?

277
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,407
Jerry?
Is that you?

278
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,542
Nobody told me
you were here.

279
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,847
Oh, I'm here,
Jack.

280
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,354
Kenneth, why didn't you tell me
Mr. Seinfeld is here?

281
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,884
What's wrong with him?

282
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,570
Hello?

283
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,103
Hello? I'm sorry.
May I speak to Floyd, please?

284
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,903
Oh, he's in the shower.

285
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,343
Well, I am conducting a survey
for the Ranford Group,

286
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,880
and, uh...

287
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,483
How old are you?

288
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,312
And your weight?

289
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,251
And when was the last time
you had intercourse?

290
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,823
Who is <i>this?</i>
Who are <i>you?</i>

291
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,756
I'm your worst nightmare
is who I is!

292
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,128
He's got some girl
over there already!

293
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,732
Wow.

294
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,664
That is so embarrassing
for you.

295
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,938
So how can I help you,
Jerry?

296
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,063
Jack, I was vacationing
with my family in Europe

297
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,233
in a country
only rich people know about.

298
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,468
Svenborgia?

299
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,135
No.
Better.

300
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,439
But I can't tell you.

301
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,811
Anyway, my mother called
to tell me

302
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,577
that I'm gonna be on
"Law & Order."

303
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:33,844
And "ER."

304
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,715
So I called my agent
to find out...

305
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,652
when did I shoot
these things?

306
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,087
That's the beauty of this,
Jerry.

307
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,351
It's all done
with computers.

308
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,892
When you see it,
you're gonna love it.

309
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,791
<i>25 sexy moms,</i>
<i>50 sweaty eighth-grade boys,</i>

310
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,398
<i>and one beloved</i>
<i>American comedy star.</i>

311
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,364
<i>This Wednesday</i>
<i>on "MILF Island."</i>

312
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,096
Really?
Is that really your pitch?

313
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,967
Okay. I get it.

314
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,767
This is a two-way street.

315
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:56,772
All right, Jerry.

316
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,106
What NBC shows do you want to be
digitally inserted into?

317
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,680
I like "Lost."
Is that you guys?

318
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,615
Jerry,
don't be difficult.

319
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,650
The fact of the matter is

320
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,220
that "Seinfeld-Vision"
is perfectly legal,

321
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,822
and there's nothing you can do
to stop us.

322
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,119
I'm sorry, but...
it's business.

323
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,227
Here's some business...

324
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,192
How 'bout I buy NBC

325
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,526
and turn it into the biggest
Lane Bryant in Midtown?

326
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,132
Jerry, come on.

327
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,669
You're gonna buy NBC?

328
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,000
Like you've got $4 million
just laying aroun...

329
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,009
Jerry, I'm sorry.

330
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,633
Give me two days,

331
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,177
and I'll come up with something
you'll really be proud of.

332
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,541
Besides, you owe me.

333
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,943
Remember? St. Barts?

334
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,242
I saved your life
from that shark?

335
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,851
All right, Jack.

336
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,976
I'll come back.

337
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,521
But I still think
you shot a dolphin!

338
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,359
Hi, I'm here to drop off
the inspiration photos.

339
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,830
And you are the mother.

340
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:55,956
Bridesmaid, yes.

341
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,335
Th... That's my dress.

342
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,133
Don't buy that.
That looks ugly on you.

343
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,609
Yeah,
you'll thank me.

344
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,574
Is that dress
still on sale?

345
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,043
Yes.

346
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,740
You know, a lot of women
buy their perfect dress

347
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,180
when they see it

348
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,684
and then just trust the fact
that the husband will come.

349
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,152
Yeah.
Well, this is my year.

350
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,587
I mean, Floyd's moving on.
I'm moving on, too.

351
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,522
I'm just doing it
in my own order.

352
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,686
I'm gonna get the wedding dress,
and then I'm gonna have a baby,

353
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,990
and then I'm gonna die,

354
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,065
and then I'm gonna meet
a supercute guy in heaven.

355
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,100
Yeah.

356
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,137
Yeah, I'm not kidding, blondie.
Get out of the dress.

357
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,336
I'm gonna need to spread it over
a couple different credit cards.

358
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,578
Lemon, I am
in full-blown crisis mode.

359
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,307
I've already sold $20 million
worth of ad time

360
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,417
for "Seinfeld-Vision,"

361
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,950
and now Jerry wants
to pull the plug.

362
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,917
But I don't care,
because I thrive in crisis mode.

363
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,112
It's when I'm really
at my best.

364
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,190
And the fact that I do not have
one idea how to solve this

365
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,655
only energizes me more.

366
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,350
I've been brainstorming
all night. Here we go.

367
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,859
Number one...
Kill Seinfeld.

368
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,486
Number two... Kill Seinfeld,
then kill myself.

369
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,598
Number three...
Kill Seinfeld,

370
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,427
flee to Svenborgia,
then kill myself.

371
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,125
Jack, I'm not having
the best day either.

372
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,827
Number 70...
You seduce Seinfeld.

373
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,938
Now, why is me seducing Seinfeld
all the way at 70?

374
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,539
Number 71...
I fake a hurricane

375
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,642
and all regularly scheduled
programming is preempted.

376
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,073
These are terrible ideas.

377
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,338
There are no bad ideas
in brainstorming, Lemon.

378
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,471
I'm sure I'll come up with
something at the eleventh hour.

379
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,140
I always do.
'Cause I'm just that good.

380
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:23,882
Mmm.

381
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,594
It was on sale.

382
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,821
Oh.

383
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,492
I'm mad at you, Ken.

384
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,625
I seen the way
you was looking at Seinfeld.

385
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,795
You used to look at me
like that.

386
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,669
What, am I not a big enough star
for you anymore?

387
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,801
I am not even gonna dignify that
with an answer.

388
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,413
Especially after
I picked out

389
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,946
all these throw pillows
for in here,

390
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,982
and you didn't even notice!

391
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,018
Hey, everyone.
I know what you're thinking.

392
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,351
How did I lose 25 pounds
in one day?

393
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,516
I didn't.
It's visual trickery.

394
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,218
Drawing the eye up.

395
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,125
Hey, Liz,
you got to see this.

396
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,927
Jenna looks bananas...

397
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,798
Nope.
The real crazy is in here.

398
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,133
Liz lost it.

399
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,172
It was on sale.

400
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,366
I thought
you and Floyd broke up.

401
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,307
We did.
And I am doing great with it.

402
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,879
I just bought a dress.

403
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,346
Because, you know, I don't need
society's permission

404
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,882
to buy a white dress.

405
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,610
Who says this is
a wedding dress anyway?

406
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,482
In Korea they wear white
to funerals.

407
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,145
All right, uh,
I'm in charge now.

408
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,723
Everyone go home.

409
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,257
No.
I'm not crazy, Frank.

410
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,417
I am making a statement...

411
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,995
that, if need be,
I will marry myself.

412
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,791
And I am not embarrassed

413
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,695
that you guys
are seeing me wearing this.

414
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,395
So you're intending
to wear that all day?

415
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,767
Yeah, Chocolate Rain,
maybe I am.

416
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:51,069
Liz, um, Seinfeld's here
and Jack's not ready for him,

417
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,768
so you need to give him
another tour.

418
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,448
Wonderful.

419
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,646
Hello, Jerry.

420
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,121
Well, well, well.

421
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,725
So you called
that boyfriend.

422
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,760
Yes, I did.
And it went well?

423
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,624
No.
It didn't, Jer.

424
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:12,890
A woman answered.

425
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,466
Another woman already?
What did you say to her?

426
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,761
I did a fake survey.

427
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,096
You did the fake survey?!

428
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,068
I know!
I'm not over it!

429
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,766
And now I'm wearing this!
What is the deal with my life?!

430
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,399
Are you imitating me?

431
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,408
No!

432
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,706
This is what I sound like
when I cry!

433
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,314
I think
I'm a little insulted.

434
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,679
You're insulted?
I'm crying!

435
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,498
I got nothing.

436
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,000
Mr. Seinfeld's here.

437
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,001
I got nothing.

438
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,198
Oh, Jerry, wonderful.
Please, come in. Come in.

439
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,740
Can get you some water?

440
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:58,740
No, thank you.

441
00:17:58,877 --> 00:17:59,809
Would you like some tea?

442
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,242
Some coffee?
Some iced coffee?

443
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,813
We have iced tea.
We have some juice.

444
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,937
All right.

445
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,778
Give me a water
if that just moves it along.

446
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,148
Okay. Boy, have I got
a presentation for you.

447
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,779
This presentation is going to,
uh, knock your socks off.

448
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,323
Here, let me close
this window

449
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,256
so we don't have any glare
on the monitor.

450
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,055
How was your weekend?
It's Thursday.

451
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,561
Well,
I mean last weekend.

452
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,664
It was very nice.

453
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,732
Can we just move this
presentation along, please?

454
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,095
It's "Seinfeld-Vision"...

455
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:27,638
and giving America
the programs they like

456
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,297
with the star
that they love

457
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,935
for one incredible month
of television.

458
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,205
What the hell
are you doing?!

459
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,508
God!
Oh, God, Jerry!

460
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,708
God, Jerry!
I got nothing!

461
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,978
I got nothing!

462
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,554
You've got to do this for me,
please!

463
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,714
Oh, God,
I've already sold the ad time.

464
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,622
What is wrong
with you people?

465
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,159
What's happened
to this network?

466
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,621
Call off your goons!

467
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,562
All right, Kenneth.

468
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,669
All right, listen,
Seinfeld.

469
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,327
I'll give you $1 million

470
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,803
and five free commercials
for your animated feature,

471
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,066
"Bee Movie."

472
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,732
And you let me run this
for one week.

473
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,311
$2 million
to the charity of my choice,

474
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,970
10 free commercials
for "Bee Movie"...

475
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,412
opening November 2nd...
and I do nothing.

476
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,211
You let me run "Seinfeld-Vision"
for three nights,

477
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,321
I give you $1.5 million
for the charity of your choice,

478
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,855
unlimited free promotions
on the "Today" show,

479
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,016
and you give me the name
of that country you went to.

480
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,253
One night.

481
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,555
Doctors Without Borders.

482
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,664
Roker in a bee costume.

483
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,596
Grenyarnia.

484
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,465
Oh, God.

485
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,412
Oh, no!

486
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,880
Did a Korean person die?

487
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,077
No, Tracy.
It's a wedding dress.

488
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,913
Don't do it, Liz Lemon.

489
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,823
I know what me and Kenneth have
looks perfect on the outside.

490
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,124
But it's work, damn it.
It's work.

491
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,266
How'd it go with Seinfeld?

492
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,638
I think
I pulled it off.

493
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,110
Good God, Lemon.
What's happened to you?

494
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,079
I thought this was
going to be your year.

495
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,208
I couldn't even
hold it together one week.

496
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,478
I'm not you, Jack.

497
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,918
I can't have a heart attack and
pretend like it never happened.

498
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,388
I can't break up with someone
and immediately recover.

499
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,753
I'm not you.
I'm just me.

500
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,521
Lemon, don't ever say
you're just you.

501
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,254
Because you are better
than you.

502
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,388
And I am not
going to let you give up.

503
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,865
This is going to be
our year.

504
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,962
Now give me the ham.

505
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,267
I like the ham.
Come on.

506
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,942
$4,000 ham napkin.

507
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,649
I look pretty, though,
right?

508
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,258
Don't push it, Lemon.

509
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,593
When life
keeps handing you anchovies?

510
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,703
Just cover them up
with some extra cheese?

511
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,466
And make a pizza
with what you've got?

512
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,873
Life is a pizza
with everything on top?

513
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,741
Pizza?

514
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,177
With what you've got?

515
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:27,479
Life is a pizza
with everything on top?

516
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,450
Pizza?

517
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,453
What you've got?

518
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,821
Pizza with everything on top?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
