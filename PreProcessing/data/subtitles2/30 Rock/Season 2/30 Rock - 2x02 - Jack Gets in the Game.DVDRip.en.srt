1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,636
You wanted to see me?

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,672
Yes, I did.

3
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,934
This is a $54 steak.

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,340
Congratulations.
It looks really good.

5
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,343
Yes, it does.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,607
But, of course, I can't eat it
because of my recent...

7
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,773
Heart attack.

8
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,042
Secret heart attack.

9
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,881
No strenuous activity,
no red meat, no booze.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,115
But I thought perhaps
you might enjoy it.

11
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,316
Oh, okay. Thanks.

12
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,120
This'll make
a great sandwich tomorrow.

13
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,161
No. I would like you
to eat it here.

14
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,957
Right now.

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,297
You want to watch me
eat this steak in front of you?

16
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,735
That's what I want.

17
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,138
Okay.

18
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,210
This is a time of new beginnings
for me, Lemon.

19
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:50,009
And, of course, that means
new opportunities.

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,777
Have you read the interview
with Don Geiss

21
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,943
in this month's issue
of "Yachting Illustrated"?

22
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,920
No. I subscribe
to "Giant Boats."

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,549
"'The ocean,' says Geiss,
'like business

24
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,684
or the pillowy abyss
of a lover's bosom,

25
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,126
seems infinite.

26
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,198
But all things must end."'

27
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,822
"Pillowy abyss"?

28
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,161
Ignore that part.

29
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,361
"All things must end."

30
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,665
Geiss is sending signals
about retirement,

31
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,671
about succession.

32
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,504
By talking about sex
in a sailing magazine?

33
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,202
That's exactly
how Margaret Thatcher did it.

34
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,940
Geiss' job is the most coveted
position in the free world.

35
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,675
You're in the running for it,
right?

36
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,979
I would like to think so.

37
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,452
But I've got to do something
to raise my profile,

38
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,456
to distinguish me
in some way.

39
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,718
And I have to do it soo...

40
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,124
You ate that whole thing?

41
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,856
A dog took it.

42
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,159
He came out of nowhere.

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,081
Hey, Jenna.
What's up?

44
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,450
Pretty good.

45
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,614
Are you okay?

46
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,725
I'm fine, Jenna.
I'm just a little light-headed.

47
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,556
I'm on a crash diet to get back
to my old weight by Friday.

48
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,027
What diet is gonna do that?

49
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,927
It's the
Japanese Porn Star Diet.

50
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,397
I only eat paper.

51
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,332
But I can eat all the paper
I want, so...

52
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,528
Hey, there.

53
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,730
Hi.

54
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,139
Jenna,
this isn't healthy.

55
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,745
Maybe you're just fighting
your natural shape.

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,541
When did your mom gain
all that weight?

57
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,512
Oh, God!

58
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,448
My point is, don't let people
make you crazy about this.

59
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,487
You are just as beautiful
and talented as you ever were.

60
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,319
No. No, no, no.
You are fat.

61
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,986
Go and see Dr. Spaceman right
now and get this taken care of.

62
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,062
How come men can be heavy
and be respected?

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,725
Like James Gandolfini
or Fat Albert?

64
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,029
It's a double standard,

65
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,368
and America needs to get over
its body-image madness.

66
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,769
Oh, come on.

67
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,467
What are we, back in college,
freshman year?

68
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,703
Let's go to the common room
and talk about apartheid.

69
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,679
I'm sorry if I care about making
the world a better place.

70
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,077
You should be.
It's a complete waste of time,

71
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,879
and it prevents you
from dealing with this.

72
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,353
Excuse me. What about "this"
do I have to deal with?

73
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,457
How's your love life going?

74
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,583
I believe that love comes to you
when you're not looking for it.

75
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,217
Did you return that
wedding dress you bought?

76
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,058
I'm gonna sell it online,
but my Internet is being weird.

77
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,530
How about the furniture
for your "home office"?

78
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,601
Have you even
set that up yet?

79
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,233
I'm not making excuses, Jack.
But "this" is taken care of.

80
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,239
Ow.

81
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,900
Ah, nerds!

82
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,138
I missed a dentist appointment
this morning.

83
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,907
WOMAN ON P. A:
<i>Josh to the stage, please,</i>

84
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,710
<i>for "llleana Dougla</i>s<i>
Talk Show."

85
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,078
Son of a bitch.

86
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,811
Banks.

87
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,080
What are you doing in town?

88
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,918
Were you drawn to the phallic
nature of our skyline?

89
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,083
Very funny, Jack.

90
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,058
How gay is this?

91
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,129
I'm here visiting
my fiancée.

92
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,822
What?

93
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,830
Kathy...

94
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,902
this is Jack Donaghy.

95
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,628
Banks,
have you lost your mind?

96
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:02,832
Oh, did I forget to mention
that Kathy is Kathy Geiss?

97
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,672
As in Don Geiss' daughter.

98
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,911
Can you believe that Don thought
she'd never get married?

99
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,012
You can't.
You're gay.

100
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,710
No.
Not anymore, friend.

101
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,754
Are you familiar
with the Church of Practicology?

102
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:18,857
You mean the cult that
was invented by Stan Lee?

103
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,721
No,
I mean the religion founded

104
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,294
by the alien king
living inside Stan Lee.

105
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,590
You see, it's my faith
in Practicology

106
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,327
that has helped me uncover
my true straight self.

107
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,470
It's definitely working.

108
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,301
I can totally feel the gay
draining right out of me.

109
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,137
By the eye of Zolnak,
right, guys?

110
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,644
You're going to be
Don Geiss' son-in-law?

111
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,974
That's right.

112
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,844
And if you read
his recent interview

113
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,473
in the "Harvard
Gay Business Review,"

114
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,984
you know that he's thinking
about retirement.

115
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,887
But I guess I'll find out more
about that tonight at dinner.

116
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,957
With Geiss.

117
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,653
At a restaurant.

118
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,206
<i>Josh to the stage, please.</i>

119
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,105
Yo, Ken.

120
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,644
Angie and Grizz is coming by
to drop some of my stuff off.

121
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,804
Oh. Okay.

122
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,609
But I want her to know I'm
having a good time on my own,

123
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,240
so you should go get us
some party hats.

124
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,046
The pointy kind.

125
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,678
Mr. Jordan,
can't you just apologize to her?

126
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,223
No! Things have been said
that cannot be taken back.

127
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,419
She called my vanity
license plate inscrutable!

128
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,090
"I see you ate one.
Am l"?

129
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,597
Hilarious!

130
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,702
Angie is in the past,

131
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,861
like Dracula
and broadcast television.

132
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,997
I think you're letting
your pride get in the way.

133
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,006
I mean, if you saw Angie
with another man...

134
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,007
With who?

135
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,805
That guy Mike
that redid our driveway?

136
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,345
Nah, whatever.

137
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,849
She should find
someone new.

138
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,612
Doesn't bother me.

139
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,789
Dot Com, I have an idea.

140
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,722
Well, I don't know,
but it's worth a shot.

141
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,124
Are you even listening
to me?

142
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,754
Now, Jenna, medically speaking,
for your height,

143
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,357
your weight puts you in what
we call the disgusting range.

144
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,336
Fortunately,
there are solutions.

145
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,931
For example, crystal meth has
been shown to be very effective.

146
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,437
How important
is tooth retention to you?

147
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,775
It's pretty important.

148
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:23,882
Okay.

149
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,543
What about my crazy surgical
options, Dr. Spaceman?

150
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:28,881
Please.

151
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,457
"Dr. Spaceman" is my dad.
Call me Leo.

152
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,289
And there are some wonderful
crazy surgical options.

153
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,990
Are you familiar
with the Bradshaw Clinic?

154
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,899
Am I? That's where
the Olsen twins were separated.

155
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,630
I've sent a number
of my famous clients there.

156
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,298
I can make a call,
get you in as soon as possible.

157
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,240
Oh, thank you, Leo.

158
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,575
I can't be on television
looking like I just had a baby.

159
00:06:55,715 --> 00:07:00,015
This, right here,
is why I got into medicine.

160
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,011
Devin's a genius.

161
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,818
A genius? Isn't he just living
a lie to get ahead at work?

162
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,186
We all have our secrets.

163
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,953
Devin's pretending
to be straight.

164
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,722
I'm trying to keep
my heart episode under wraps.

165
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,160
And Alan Garkel
in legal?

166
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,629
I don't think he needs
that wheelchair.

167
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,290
No!

168
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,269
Aah!
Uh, Mr. Banks.

169
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,380
I didn't see you there.

170
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,312
I've been following you for the
better part of an hour, Kenneth.

171
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,385
Does Mr. Donaghy know
you're here?

172
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,352
I don't need Jack's permission,
Kenneth.

173
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,150
I'm gonna be running this place
soon.

174
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,691
And there are gonna be
some changes

175
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,194
to the pages' uniforms,
certainly.

176
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,026
Mr. Banks, Mr. Donaghy
eats guys like you

177
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,360
as part of
a healthy breakfast.

178
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,163
And I'm sure you think
he's weak right now,

179
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,864
but he's only gotten stronger
since his heart attack.

180
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,205
Heart attack?
Really?

181
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,106
Right, Mr. D?

182
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,269
High five!

183
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,016
Not now? Okay.

184
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,151
What is this?
Liposuction?

185
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,188
Plus bone shaving
and organ reduction.

186
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,188
Ugh!

187
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,917
Liz, you don't understand.

188
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,085
People look at me differently
now.

189
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,323
Jack, the writers,
the manager at Forever 21.

190
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,899
That is their problem,
not yours.

191
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,661
Is this clinic on a boat?

192
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,829
Hey, I've got a character
for Jenna called "Me Want Food."

193
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:31,034
She's in a supermarket, and
she keeps going, "Me want food!"

194
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,405
What? No.

195
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,240
We are not treating Jenna
any differently.

196
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,745
She's gonna play all the
characters she usually plays.

197
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,713
Like Hillary Clinton.

198
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,317
That's awesome.
"Fat Hillary."

199
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,249
She can be like,
"Me want food!"

200
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,015
No one is saying,
"Me want food," Frank.

201
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,624
We are going to showcase
Jenna's talents.

202
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,919
Can I sing a song
on the show?

203
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,220
Yes.
That's a great idea.

204
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,057
Can I sing and rollerdance?

205
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,858
Yes.

206
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,399
Yeah, because we are going to
dare America

207
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,594
to change their own attitudes
about body image.

208
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,069
Why do you have to make
everything into an issue?

209
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,798
Don't you have things to do
in your own life?

210
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,568
At least I don't live
with my mom. Ow!

211
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,573
Hey, my mom's cool.

212
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,940
I've got my life together,
okay?

213
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,911
Holy crap!
Did your tooth just fall out?

214
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,607
That's not great, huh?

215
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,720
Oh, check this out.

216
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,914
My key to the city
of Gary, Indiana.

217
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,922
Mm! Look at this.

218
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,119
My gold record
from that novelty party song.

219
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,957
<i>Werewolf bar mitzvah</i>?

220
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,758
<i>Spooky, scary</i>?

221
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,594
<i>Boys becoming men</i>?

222
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,258
<i>Men becoming wolves</i>?

223
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,268
Well, I'm going now.

224
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,169
Is there anything else
you want to say, Tracy?

225
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,240
Yeah.

226
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,036
I miss you, Grizz.

227
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,774
Ugh!

228
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,273
Hello, Angie.

229
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,909
I hear you're single now.
That's cool.

230
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,521
What?

231
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:53,216
I like your top.
I'm a real good sex person.

232
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,951
I do it
all the different ways.

233
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,755
Uh-huh.

234
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,093
Well, I don't have a husband
anymore.

235
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,133
So you can come over
anytime.

236
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,670
Oh, I will.
I'll come over at night.

237
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,572
Good job, Kenneth.

238
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,775
You should see my A-game.

239
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,519
So, Dad...

240
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,355
Can I call you "Dad"?

241
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,396
Why not? I have a grandkid
who calls me "Don."

242
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,896
Next time he does it,

243
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,831
I'm marching that little bastard
to a recruiting station.

244
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,460
Great story, Dad!

245
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,368
Don! Devin!

246
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,499
Jack! Small world.
Join us.

247
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,168
Are you sure?
I wouldn't want to intrude.

248
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,472
This is Manal.

249
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:50,673
I never should have said
we were going to a restaurant.

250
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,450
She got big.

251
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,727
Ooh, her center of gravity
is a little different.

252
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,699
Me want food!

253
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,974
Did you happen to tell Geiss
about my little episode?

254
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:26,710
Come on, Jack.
I'd never rat you out.

255
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,911
Wouldn't want to let you off
that easy.

256
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:29,919
Here.

257
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,581
Why don't you take
some of my steak?

258
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,215
I could never eat
this much meat.

259
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,419
That's not what I hear.

260
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,189
Jack, we're having
a little get-together

261
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,888
up at the house on Saturday.

262
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,964
You should come.

263
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,126
That would be my pleasure,
sir.

264
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:45,904
Yeah, you should come.

265
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,099
It's gonna be a whole day
of team sports and beer.

266
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,301
Get the ol' heart rate up.

267
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,504
Maybe pound a cheeseburger
in the sun.

268
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,081
Throw some butter on it.
You're gonna love it.

269
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,949
I'm gonna make your heart
explode.

270
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,187
Hey, Ken.

271
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,729
You're up early,
Mr. Jordan.

272
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,425
I only got 11 or 12 hours sleep
last night.

273
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,160
I got something
on my mind-grapes

274
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,361
I need to talk to you about.

275
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,438
Oh.
What is it, sir?

276
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,734
I saw you hitting on Angie
the other day.

277
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,810
Seeing you with her,
it opened my eyes.

278
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,310
Good for you, sir.

279
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,880
Yeah. All those years
fooling around,

280
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,983
it wasn't fair to her.

281
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,381
So you got to make it fair.

282
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,251
I want you to go to my house
and make love to my wife, Ken.

283
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,982
Jiminy Christmas!

284
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:42,594
My home address is in the GPS
under "DaCrib"

285
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,423
'cause we live
on DaCrib Avenue.

286
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,554
Now, you go to Angie.

287
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,099
And you make sure
you pleasure her.

288
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:53,698
Well, they did laugh.

289
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,534
<i>At</i> you, Jenna. <i>At.</i>

290
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,198
Right.
The bad kind.

291
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,607
You just can't be a real woman
in this country.

292
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,714
God! It's like those Dove
commercials never even happened.

293
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,840
Hey! Oh!
"Me want food"!

294
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,954
This woman was a Mouseketeer,
ma'am.

295
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,453
Let it go, Liz.

296
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,523
<i>Me want food!</i>

297
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,862
Oh, my God.

298
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,588
My own T-shirt!

299
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,995
Hey!
I am wanting the foods!

300
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,657
Very good. Very nice.

301
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,268
Thataboy!

302
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,534
Yes!

303
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,836
Thanks, Jack!

304
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,002
You earned me a grand!

305
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,637
Thank you.

306
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,884
How's the heart holding up,
buddy?

307
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,045
You know,
you ought to just quit.

308
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,156
Geiss loves quitters,

309
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,383
if I understood
his autobiography correctly.

310
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,015
Oh, wait.
I didn't.

311
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,152
You know what?
It's all right, Jack.

312
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,095
When you're dead
and I'm CEO...

313
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,825
Oh, my.

314
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,667
Winthrop!

315
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,035
How do you do it, man?

316
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,369
You're always in
such great shape.

317
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,205
Same weight as when I wrestled
at Yale, Jack.

318
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,142
Winthrop here wrestled
at Yale.

319
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,577
With other dudes or...

320
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,478
Banks here
says he can pin you.

321
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,709
Well, I don't know...

322
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,185
Okay.
You're so strong.

323
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,483
Oh, God.
You're having your way with me.

324
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,149
Your back is like a barrel
of snakes.

325
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,920
Oh, God!
I'm just your doll.

326
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,893
I think I love you.

327
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,497
We're joking.
It's all jokes.

328
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:31,160
This is
no ordinary love?

329
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,668
What have I done?

330
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,466
Kenneth
should be back by now.

331
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,598
What's going on
over at my house?

332
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:43,604
<i>This is no ordinary love</i>?

333
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,685
<i>No ordinary love</i>?

334
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,065
No!

335
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,725
No!

336
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,497
I got to stop this!

337
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:17,110
Wow.

338
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,443
There she is.

339
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,314
Me Want Food.

340
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,819
Did you know,
scientifically speaking,

341
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,424
that humans want food
but don't need it?

342
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,584
I'm really having second
thoughts about all of this.

343
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:34,324
Oh, don't worry.
Dr. Wally is the best there is.

344
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,627
In a few hours, you'll be
back to your old self.

345
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,136
It'll be like none of this
ever happened.

346
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,610
I'm keeping it!

347
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,238
Uh, what?

348
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,749
The fat.
I've decided to keep it.

349
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,583
Because people recognize me
and I get off on it.

350
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:58,690
If you're gonna do this,

351
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,157
it's got to be because we are
proving a point to the world.

352
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,592
Ugh! I'm not trying to prove
anything.

353
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,460
And you've got to stop telling
people how to run their lives.

354
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,089
That's not what this is.

355
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,599
And it's kind of hard
to take life advice

356
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,034
from a single woman
who is using her treadmill

357
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,935
as a hanger
for a wedding dress.

358
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,598
Oh, I'm supposed
to put it in the closet

359
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,936
with ham fat all over it?

360
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,137
And who's wearing a one-piece
swimsuit instead of underwear.

361
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,043
I have to do laundry.

362
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,483
There he is!

363
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,218
Hey, Jack.
Want a hot dog?

364
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,555
Oh, right.

365
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,162
The sodium.

366
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,457
Bum-bum.

367
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,656
Bum-bum.

368
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,198
Ka-boom!

369
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,470
Just so you know, if you hear
this sound at your funeral,

370
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:49,665
it's just me laughing.

371
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,519
I can't hear you, Banks.

372
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,093
Are you saying
you want me to help you?

373
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,094
Oh.

374
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,928
And if I do, you'll stop trying
to destroy me in front of Geiss?

375
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,461
Oh.

376
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,868
That is what you're saying,
right?

377
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,633
Here we go.

378
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,840
You're insane!

379
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,542
That's it.
I quit.

380
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,652
No more football.

381
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,952
Jack wins.

382
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:40,956
Quitter!

383
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,561
Oh, God!
Just like the Greeks.

384
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,690
I'm gonna kill you,
Kenneth the Page!

385
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,735
I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan.
I couldn't do it.

386
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,737
This boy comes to the door,
tries to kiss me,

387
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,602
then he throws up
and starts crying.

388
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,200
My body wouldn't let me violate
the sacred bonds of marriage.

389
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,973
It was a gesture, Angie.

390
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,639
I'm saying I'm sorry!

391
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,081
I'm at the end of my rope,
Tracy Jordan.

392
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,083
But, baby!

393
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,084
Mnh-mnh.

394
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,054
No more jewelry
with my name misspelled.

395
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,683
No more sexually explicit
skywriting.

396
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,820
And no more white boys
throwing up in my damn foyer!

397
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,591
What do you want?

398
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,994
I'm willing to try anything.

399
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,901
Okay.
Here's what I want.

400
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,941
From now on, I'm on you
like white on rice.

401
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:35,137
You are not to leave my sight
for one second. Ever.

402
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,578
All right.

403
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,078
If that's what it takes.

404
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,380
If that's what it takes.

405
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,683
This grilled cheese
has mayonnaise in it!

406
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,792
What?

407
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,744
Hmm.

408
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,012
Is it really worth it?

409
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,015
I wonder.

410
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,245
I almost let a man die today,
Caitlin.

411
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,251
And for what?

412
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,515
For a bigger office?
For more money?

413
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,554
Jack.

414
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,630
So, how's the ticker?

415
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,892
Devin told me.

416
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,229
He said
you're not a well man.

417
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,838
Why don't we forget
about Devin for the moment?

418
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,167
Are you concerned
about my heart, sir?

419
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,300
No, not at all.
Not after today.

420
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,605
You were out there with
those boys in your condition.

421
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,510
Talk about heart.

422
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,676
Take care of yourself,
Jack.

423
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,550
I've technically died
twice.

424
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,351
It's not fun.

425
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,086
But I'm not going to be around
forever.

426
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:00,324
At some point, I want to spend
more time with my grandkids.

427
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,559
Take my boat
down to the islands.

428
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,399
Get to know my secret family
up in Canada.

429
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,140
But I want you to know
you're on my list.

430
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,169
Jack, you might run this company
one day.

431
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,249
Thank you, sir.

432
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:30,592
You mind if I watch you
eat that?

433
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,095
Okay.

434
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,070
<i>Werewolf bar mitzvah</i>?

435
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,572
<i>Spooky, scary</i>?

436
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,404
<i>Boys becoming men</i>?

437
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,444
<i>Men becoming wolves</i>?

438
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,244
<i>Werewolf bar mitzvah</i>?

439
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,413
<i>Spooky, scary</i>?

440
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,051
<i>Boys becoming men</i>?

441
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,562
<i>Men becoming wolves</i>?

9999
