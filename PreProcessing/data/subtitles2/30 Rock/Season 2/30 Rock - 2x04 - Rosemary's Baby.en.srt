00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,670
It is with great pleasure I
would like to announce that

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,150
the recipient of this year's prestigious

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,650
ge follohip award is none
other than our very own.

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,300
liz lemon.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,330
Wait,how could liz
win a fellowship award?

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,560
She doesn't like people.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,140
No,followship.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,260
Presented annually to the woman.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,630
sorry,person,who best
exemplifies a foller.

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not a follower.

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,720
It also comes with ten grand.

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,610
I accept this proudly on
behalf of followers everywhere.

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,030
When I think of the free.

14
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,330
spirited liz lemon I
met just one year ago.

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,350
So resistant to product
integration,cross.

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,880
It pleases me to see how
well she's learned to follow.

17
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,870
Uh,is this because of that ge sketch?

18
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,880
He has a microwave for a head!

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,710
But it's such an excellent ge microwave.

20
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,190
You said i didn't have a choice.

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,590
So what are you gonna do with
your money,put it into a 401k?

22
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,370
Yeah,I gotta get one of those.

23
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,440
What?

24
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,100
Where do you invest your mo ms.

25
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,910
-***
-***

26
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,680
***I can't believe how
fast you lost the weight.

27
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,940
If I can't be monique fat,I
have to be teri hatcher thin.

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,410
Either way,you're laughin'.

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,700
My uniform!

30
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,290
Let me get that off.

31
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,890
Turn around.

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,240
It just needs a little bit of water.

33
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,570
Oh,god,it hurts!

34

00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,960
You're honestly telling me you
don't know who rosemary howard is.

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,090
Is she one of the ladies who
tried to shoot gerald ford?

39
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,150
No!She's the first female
writer for laugh.in.

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,460
She wrote all the political
stuff for donnie and marie.

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,120
I grew up idolizing her comedy.

42
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,550
Pardon me.

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,520
Pardon me.Pardon me!

44
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,840
Pardon you?

45
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,510
You were already pardoned!

46
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,380
It's funny 'cause it's true.

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,320
Hi,I don't wanna sound
like a weirdo fan，

48
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,560
but Iam obsessed with
everything you have ever done.

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,080
And I used to make my friends
act out your skits the next day.

50
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,200
When I say my friends,I
mean my fisher price.

51
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,430
my friend dolls.

52
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,220
Because I didn't have a lot of friends.

53
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,830
Oh,boy.***

54
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,110
You're gonna kill me,aren't you?

55
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,270
No,that's.

56
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,720
Oh,you are great!

57
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,260
I grew up wanting to be you.

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,790
I grew up wanting to be
samantha stevens on bewitched.

59
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,010
Closest I got was being married
to a gay guy for two years.

60
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,460
Oh,thank you.

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,950
Um,you are my heroine.

62
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,190
And by heroine,I mean lady hero.

63
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,460
I don't wanna inject
you and listen to jazz.

64
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,450
Good lord.

65
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,600
- Are you hungry?
- Always.

66
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,850
Well,I'm gonna let you take me to lunch
later and get all this out of your system.

67
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,960
That would be great.

68
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,150
I would love that.

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
But you're supposed to
take me hat shopping.

70
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,680
Hey jack!

71
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,010
Could you hold on a second?

72
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,650
If you desecrate something,is that bad?

73
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,780
Tracy,what happened now?

74
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,000
I doubt if anybody noticed.

75
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,870
Who brought stars and bright stars

76
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,050
to the party last night

77
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,310
for the rascals we fought

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,730
who wouldhave ever known
there was so many words?

79
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,290
It was like a mos def cd.

80
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,830
Tracy,it's all right.

81
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,790
You're a star,you can
do whatever you want to.

82
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,100
That's your job.

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,100
It's our job to make it go away.

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,820
I love this country.

85
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,260
You go forth and be crazy.

86
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,500
I think I can manage that.

87
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,980
You do anything you wanna do.

88
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,760
Except no dog fighting,okay?

89
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,590
That seems to be the one thing
that's off limits these days.

90
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,140
What's on your mind,tray?

91
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,360
You've been curiously
quiet for 20 minutes.

92
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,320
We gotta start doing dog fights.

93
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,390
Dog fighting?

94
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,070
I know it's repulsive and hideous.

95
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,400
But it's the only thing jack
donaghy told me I cannot do.

96
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,170
So I gotta do it!Understand?

97
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,510
No no no no no no no!

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,550
Dog fighting is the most disgusting,vile
thing a human being can do.

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,780
You cannot do it!

100
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,350
Dog fighting it is.

101
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,030
Make it happen.

102
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,630
Man,this is phil spector's
entourage all over again.

103
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,130
And his foot lingered.

104
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,290
Ah,that is such an upsetting story.

105
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,110
I'll never watch happy
days the same way again.

106
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,740
But you know,I miss live tv.

107
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,910
It's like sex,you know?

108
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,390
It's almost better when
everything goes horribly wrong.

109
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,700
Well,you know,we do hire guest
writers every now and then.

110
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,380
I mean,I don't know if that'S.

111
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,320
something you would
ever be interested in.

112
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,520
That'd be great.

113
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,080
God,I haven't been in
that building in so long.

114
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,980
Does everyone still do blow
in joe garagiola's office?

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,970
Which one is blow again?Is that cocaine?

116
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,410
Hello?Where's the head page?

117
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,330
You may enter.

118
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,410
You're a machine.

119
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,760
No,I wish.

120
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,450
This is a prop from the classic
nbc series supercomputer.

121
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
1975 to 1975.

122
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,810
Look,you obviously know who I am.

123
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,860
But what you don't know is that I accidentally
damaged kenneth parcell's page jacket and.

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,830
Really?

125
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,250
Mr. Perfect,Mr. Jesus loves
me parcell finally messed up?

126
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,240
Do you know how long i've been waiting to transfer
that thumbhead to cnbc in paramus,new jersey?

127
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,280
But you can't transfer
someone without a demerit.

128
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,480
- But now.
- oh,boy.

129
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,170
Here's what we're gonna do.

130
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,010
You've probably never
seen breasts before.

131
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,200
So I'm gonna lean over this desk,and
you're gonna give me a new page jacket.

132
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,720
Please,I breast fed 'til I was 11.

133
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,550
So I've forgotten more about a
woman's chest than you'll ever know.

134
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,470
But.I'm on tv.

135
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,030
I said,"good day.

136
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,270
" No,you didn'T.

137
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,000
Well,I meant to.

138
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,730
Kenneth parcell is finished.

139
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,280
Finished!

140
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,680
All right,what's in the
news this week,everybody?

141
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,490
Any ideas?

142
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,680
I have an idea.

143
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,240
We open on a new
orleans abortion clinic.

144
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,100
A beautiful mulatto.

145
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,670
uh,I don't think we're allowed
to use any of those words.

146
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,470
Why not?

147
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,160
It's live television.

148
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,340
I mean,we used to say And .

149
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,160
no,you didn'T.

150
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,370
-Did you?
-We did.We pushed the envelope.

151
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,630
Remember.

152
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,250
the mailbox sketch that shocked america?

153
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,600
There's nothing wrong here.

154
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,390
Don't you get it?

155
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,370
The mailbox was haldeman.

156
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,710
Is that a person who lived?

157
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,540
What about race?

158
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,260
I mean,I say that is the last taboo.

159
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,820
We get josh in blackface,right?

160
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,470
And then we get tracy to call him a !

161
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,180
I'd watch that.

162
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,060
No no,you can't do race stuff
on tv.It's too sensitive.

163
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,560
We would have done that
on the mandrell sisters!

164
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,650
Look,I want the show to be edgy too.

165
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,620
I mean,but my boss,jack donaghy.

166
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,730
let me talk to him.

167
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,270
- I am great with suits.
- No,we don't talk to him.

168
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Liz,you're not a cog in their machine.

169
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,540
I know.

170
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,450
I'm not some.

171
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,830
follower.

172
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,640
I just.

173
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,590
we are very subversive on this show.

174
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,320
Frank,what do you have this week?

175
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,220
Uh,barry the humping dog is
shopping for a ge washer and dryer.

176
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,260
Have not seen that before.

177
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,040
Sharp idea.

178
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,970
Yo,I got the dogs outside.

179
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,450
Well,bring them in!

180
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,880
I feel sick to my stomach
about dog fighting.

181
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,430
But what can you do when
they tell you not to?

182
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,010
This could get ugly.

183
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,800
What?

184
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,370
No!

185
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,870
You idiots!

186
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,750
I built a dog fighting pit
in my basement for this?

187
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,810
Tracy.

188
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,070
Can I speak with you privately?

189
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,610
Tray,what's the one thing
i asked you not to do?

190
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,130
That 227 movie new jackee city?

191
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,600
Dog fighting!

192
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,500
What is it about your wiring that compels
you to do exactly what you're asked not to?

193
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I don't know.

194
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,410
Always been this way.

195
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,110
Tracy,don't play with matches!

196
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,220
You're not my dad!

197
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,410
Tracy,don't stare directly at
the sun.It'll make you crazy.

198
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,640
You're not my dad.

199
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,990
Tracy,you're not going out
the house dressed like that.

200
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,440
You're not my dad.

201
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,140
I'm beginning to think this has
something to do with your dad.

202
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,840
You're not my dad!

203
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,030
You can't tell me what it's about.

204
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,010
Hey,props gave me a bunch of
dog penises for you to look at.

205
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,610
Oh,great,thanks.

206
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,160
Liz!

207
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,000
Your grandmother is in jack's office.

208
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,720
You better do something.

209
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,410
Nana lemon?That's weird.

210
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,730
Oh,no.

211
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,140
Rosemary.

212
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,230
Lemon,rosemary here was just telling
me some of her fantastic sketch ideas.

213
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,850
Liz,he totally gets it.

214
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,230
He understands that what we do is
far more important than what they do.

215
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,800
I do.I really do get it.

216
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,720
Rosemary,thank you so very much.

217
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,160
Oh,no,my pleasure.

218
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,960
What a pleasure.What
fun catching up with you.

219
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,910
You too.

220
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,000
- You take care now.
- You too.

221
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,470
Fire her.

222
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,930
And don't ever make me talk
to a woman that old again.

223
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,530
I can't fire rosemary.

224
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,870
Yes,you can.It's easy.

225
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,320
Observe.

226
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,210
Jonathan,you're fired!

227
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,600
What? No! God,no!

228
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,580
No,I won't fire her. It's mean.

229
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,420
And I like her. And she's right,we
should be pushing the envelope.

230
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,660
Oh,god. Push the envelope.

231
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,320
People who don't have the guts or
the brains to work inside the system.

232
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,410
Letter writers,radicals,howard dean.

233
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,190
You just don't get her. You're
like the talking mailbox.

234
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,510
I'm going to assume that's a haldeman
reference. In which case,I thank you.

235
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,290
I got into this business to be
like rosemary. To make people think.

236
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,300
No. No no no,lemon.

237
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,110
You got into this business because you're funny
and you're weird and you're socially retarded.

238
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,720
And you also got into it because it pays well,which
means you are not like rosemary; you are like me.

239
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,450
No,I'm not. You are a suit.

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,890
You feed off the creativity and hard work of other people and
turn it into commercials and pie charts and triangle graphs.

241
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,810
What's a triangle graph?

242
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,800
I don't know! It sounded real.

243
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,240
-This is my show.
-No,this is my show.

244
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,790
And once a week I rent it out to the good
people at the erectile dysfunction companies.

245
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,970
Be that as it may,rosemary is my idol.

246
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,270
And if you wanna get rid of
her,then you will fire me also.

247
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,800
suck it up,nerd.

248
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,180
Oh,my god!

249
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,140
Rosemary,that was such a rush
standing up to jack like that.

250
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,730
And I never would have done
it if it weren't for you.

251
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,710
I am so proud of you!

252
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,100
He heard you roar and now things
are gonna change around here.

253
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,530
Jack says you're both fired.

254
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,510
Yes!

255
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,640
Hey tray,whatcha doing?

256
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,150
Just some heavy thinking.

257
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,270
This spotlight is the only place that
I could go to get away from it all.

258
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,590
You know,tray,I get this dad thing.

259
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,470
I mean my father belongs in the
smiling irish bastard hall of fame.

260
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,070
And the pent. up,unresolved anger i
have toward him,it still overwhelms me.

261
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,520
You've got to learn to forgive.

262
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,250
But how do I forgive
someone that I don't know?

263
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,220
Boy,if I could just talk
to him once. Just once.

264
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,620
Tracy,we're gonna do this together.
You've got to get into therapy.

265
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,970
I don't need therapy.
I'm just mentally ill.

266
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,950
Tracy,what if I told you that the
one thing you cannot do is therapy?

267
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,280
You're not my dad! We're doing therapy!

268
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,940
All right,thank you. Good. bye.

269
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,310
Kenneth,I may have made a mistake.

270
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,120
-I was talking to donnie.
-donnie?

271
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,180
Head page donnie
lawson,the king of sting?

272
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,290
What did you do?

273
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,600
I was just trying to make things right.

274
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:11,920
Nice jacket,parcell. I hope that it and you
will be very unhappy at cnbc for the next year.

275
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,900
Of course,there is one other choice.

276
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,480
A page. off.

277
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,980
A page. off?

278
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,350
It's a savage contest. Mixing
physical stamina with nbc trivia.

279
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,270
What's a page. off?

280
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,220
You wanna page. off?

281
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,280
I don't know what kind of
corporate mind games he's playing.

282
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,910
But if jack thinks i'm
crawling back there.

283
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,870
oh,screw him. But now that you're
free,we can work on something together!

284
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah,we can start our own
network called bitch tv!

285
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,430
Or the second idea that we think of.

286
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,530
Look,when we get back to my place,we
start banging out some ideas.

287
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,670
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life.

288
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,180
What neighborhood is this?

289
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,900
Oh,they call it little
chechnya. So gritty and real.

290
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,010
More murders per capita than detroit.

291
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,010
Try not to write when
you're living here.

292
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,240
Is that guy carrying a gun?

293
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,560
Yeah,but don't worry. He's not a cop.

294
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,690
Hey,tracy,this is susanne
hawker,the nbc therapist.

295
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,590
Who's crazier,me or anne curry?

296
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,120
Hello,tracy. Jack informed me
of the talk you had earlier.

297
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,600
And if you don't mind,I'd like to hop
right in and start with some role play.

298
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,290
Like my wife and I do? Cool.

299
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,170
Donaghy,you play the matador.

300
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:40,010
Uh,no,tracy. What I want you to do is talk to that
empty chair as if your father were sitting there,okay?

301
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,920
Man,this is stupid!

302
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,820
Come on,tracy. We're here to help you.

303
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,000
Uh,tracy,maybe it will help if jack sits
in the chair and pretends to be your father.

304
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,840
I wanna talk to you,son.

305
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,550
You sound nothing like my dad.

306
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,530
Well,where is he from?

307
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,600
All I know is he's
from funky north philly.

308
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,190
He worked in a campbell's soup factory. And he
had a droopy lip due to an unattended root canal.

309
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,180
I think I can do this. Okay,go.

310
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,520
I'm mad at you,dad.

311
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,270
Hey,dummy! I'm mad at you too.

312
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,980
-Uh,that's not exactly what I had in.
-'cause you left me,dad!

313
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,630
I was young and confused and your
moms didn't want me around no more.

314
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,200
Now,pass me them damn collard greens!

315
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,720
Is this true,mom?

316
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,020
He gambled away my welfare check.

317
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,790
Woman,I got a mind to
smack you upside the head.

318
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,890
-Uh,this is not helpful.
-Be me now.

319
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,540
I only act out because I
want your love! Dyn.o.mite!

320
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,190
I think we're just doing good times now.

321
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,490
Now do the white dude that
my moms left my dad for.

322
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,790
Uh,now,see here,tracy. It's
impolite to slurp one's soup.

323
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,510
Whoa,no need to resort
to ugly stereotypes.

324
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,340
You always gonna be my son.

325
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,380
Tracy,just because i stopped loving your
dad,doesn't mean we stopped loving you.

326
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,210
Stop puttin' words in my mouth,woman!

327
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,250
Oye,papi,kayate! People are sleeping!

328
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,320
Mind your own damn
business,mrs.Rodriguez!

329
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,400
All right,this is ridiculous.

330
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,370
Lady,just because i'm
an ignorant black man.

331
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:11,120
And you paid me a nickel to bust up your chifforobe,doesn't give
you the right to call me ridiculous just 'cause I'm proud of my son.

332
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,480
They got me.

333
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,060
The honkeys shot me.

334
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,590
No,dad!

335
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,830
Don't die! I love you,dad!

336
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,680
I don't wanna dog fight no more!

337
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,610
Tracy,that's it! That's it!

338
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,450
Thank you for showing me there
really is love in my family after all.

339
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,120
And I need to stay the
hell away from them.

340
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,500
Donaghy,you're the only
family I need,jackie D.

341
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,620
You got that right,tray.

342
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,570
You know,it's too bad you didn't know howard cosell when you were
growing up. 'Cause I had that one in my pocket the whole time.

343
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,980
There we are.

344
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,240
Oh,crapballs! What was that?

345
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,980
Okay,let's find a pen
and start that screenplay.

346
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,890
This movie is gonna
knock them on their asses.

347
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,880
Right. What's it about?

348
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:10,130
Women in their 50s go on spring break and
get laid by a bunch of grateful 18.year.olds.

349
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,500
Oh,god.

350
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,830
Yeah,exactly.

351
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,090
I predict opening
weekend,a million dollars.

352
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,450
Have you been drinking wine all day?

353
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,740
Oh,it's heart healthy.

354
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,850
-All day?
-Oh,come on,liz. It's the '90s!

355
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,710
Did an f train just go by your window?

356
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,250
I know that look. Don't even
think about jumping for that train.

357
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,010
You know,I think i should
go home before it gets dark.

358
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,450
You can't abandon me,liz. You are me.

359
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,690
No,I'm not you.

360
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,322
Really? You pick up guys
that are smart and funny.

361
00:16:47,378 --> 00:16:51,810
You're never gonna get married,liz.
You're married to your job.

362
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,010
Oh,my god. I lost my job.

363
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,320
You're just like me.

364
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,240
You get up in the
morning and smoke weed.

365
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,500
-no,I don'T.
-You obsess about the jamaican man across the hall.

366
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,420
Oh,my god. I lost my job.

367
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,810
You wouldn't have a job if it wasn't
for me. I broke barriers for you.

368
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,020
I really have to go.

369
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,450
I sat around while my
junk went bad. All for you.

370
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,230
I didn't have any kids. You're my kid!

371
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,520
-You're my kid that never calls!
-yikes.

372
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,230
Help me,liz lemon! You're my only hope!

373
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:32,870
Okay,which nbc series spun off,among
others,cosby,miami vice,cheers,and highway to heaven?

374
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,630
-Supercomputer!
-Oh,you're gonna do great!

375
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,890
Ready!

376
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,820
Page.off,page.off

377
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,750
Come on,kenneth! You can do it!

378
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,560
Hey! What the hell
is going on down here?

379
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,490
The phones are ringing off the hook,there's
no one seating the conan audience!

380
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,330
Get to back to work,you morons!

381
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,770
Pete,wait. You don't understand.

382
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,770
I ruined kenneth's jacket and he needs to get a new one,but
can't have any demerits,so we have to have a page.off.

383
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,140
what,are you kidding me? This
is a billion dollar company!

384
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,760
Demerits?

385
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,340
Donnie,give kenneth a damn jacket!

386
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:27,600
This isn't over between
us,moroney. You're in it now.

387
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,300
It's finally over,ms.Moroney.

388
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,080
Yes. And it's hard to even
remember how it all began.

389
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,220
You burnt my jacket.

390
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,990
All right,I need my job back.

391
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,460
But this is not crawling,this is proud
begging,like those kids that dance on the subway.

392
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,460
Of course you can have
your job back,lemon.

393
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,130
Oh,thank god. It was terrible.

394
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,540
I went to her apartment. I
don't think she has a toilet.

395
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,020
I saw my future,jack.

396
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,180
Never go with a hippie
to a second location.

397
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,570
I can't end up like that. I have
got to make money and save it.

398
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:11,550
And I have to do that thing that rich people
do where they turn money into more money.

399
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,040
Can you teach me how to do that?

400
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,370
With my eyes closed.

401
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,900
Oh,good,because I want to send
rosemary $400 a month for. forever.

402
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,930
You should,that woman is unemployable.

403
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,210
Rosemary says that women become obsolete in this business
when there's no one left that wants to see them naked.

404
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,380
You make enough money,you can
pay people to look at you naked.

405
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,400
To the future,lemon.

406
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:38,440
Oh,and by the way,ge has a
problem with the dog penis sketch.

407
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,750
I'll change it.

408
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,300
Hey,what about cat penises?

409
