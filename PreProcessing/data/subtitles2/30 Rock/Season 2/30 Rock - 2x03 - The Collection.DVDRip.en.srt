1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:06,670
One day, sir,
this whole city will be yours.

2
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,241
Oh, hey, can I talk to you?

3
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,533
You always ruin everything.

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,474
I have to apologize for him.

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,583
He's been a bit tense

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,844
since we found that I'm up
for the GE chairmanship.

7
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,317
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,445
I got a call
from some lawyer today

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,820
who was asking me
what kind of boss you are

10
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:26,983
and how long I've known you

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,925
and what animal
best describes you.

12
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,257
What did you say?

13
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,196
An eagle
with the head of a bear.

14
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,996
Thank you. Your respect
means the world to me, Lemon.

15
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,105
I can't believe
it's starting already.

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,103
What is?

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,707
GE is vetting me.

18
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,241
They're trying to see if I have
any skeletons in my closet.

19
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,140
It's what they do with
all the presidential candidates.

20
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,974
Do you think
they'll find anything?

21
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,638
Oh, yeah.

22
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,645
I've done some things, Lemon.

23
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,084
That's why I hired
a private investigator

24
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,018
to look
into my own background.

25
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,557
He'll spot any red flags
before GE does,

26
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,159
and that way I should be able
to stay ahead of this.

27
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,752
Wait. You hired someone
to investigate yourself.

28
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,796
That's weird.

29
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:06,921
Well, you do the same thing

30
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,728
with your therapist every week,
don't you?

31
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,769
I had an amazing breakthrough
with my therapist this week.

32
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,236
I was talking about...
Ring, ring!

33
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,670
...that dream that I have
all the time...

34
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,366
Hello.

35
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,874
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

36
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

37
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,136
Well, she's right here.
Fake phone.

38
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,646
She'll be right down.

39
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,215
What else is going on?

40
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,775
What's going on in here?
You're on time for work.

41
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,776
The woman in your dressing room
is your wife.

42
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:53,742
Sorry, Angie.

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,871
I let Tracy back in my life
on two conditions.

44
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,312
One... this.

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,611
Bling-bling,
That is ghetto fabulous!

46
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,242
This belonged
to Brooke Astor.

47
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,115
It's very nice.

48
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,689
And the other condition...
I'm with him all the time.

49
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:09,022
All he gets to do is work, eat,
love on me, and sleep.

50
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,424
Isn't that right, baby?

51
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,587
I'm whipped!

52
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,892
Angie got me up
at 7:30 today.

53
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,729
Did you know in the morning
they have food, TV,

54
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,768
almost everything?

55
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,428
It's pretty good.
I did know that.

56
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,470
Yeah.

57
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,735
Liz, I need your help.
I can't do this alone.

58
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,708
Tracy's like a horny child.

59
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,904
He needs
constant adult supervision.

60
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,480
Will you help me out
when I'm not here?

61
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,607
If it keeps him like this,
yes.

62
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,742
Will you be able to do that
without falling in love?

63
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,081
Also yes.

64
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,813
I think
this is gonna be great, Angie.

65
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,254
I think you and me
are gonna make a great team.

66
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,257
Oh, you looking
for a sassy black friend?

67
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,419
Oh, no, I didn't...
Well, you got one now,
girlfriend.

68
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,621
Go on!

69
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,899
Miss Maroney,
here's today's fan mail.

70
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,333
Are there any from prisons?

71
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,460
Are there?

72
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:53,799
Federal!

73
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,671
God!

74
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,900
Putting on this weight

75
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,943
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

76
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,477
People actually like me now.

77
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,309
There she is.
There's my star.

78
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,349
And to think I wanted you
to lose this weight.

79
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,509
It sounds so crazy now.

80
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:07,915
I know.

81
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,352
Oh, and I saw your Enorme
commercial. It's fabulous.

82
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,650
What's Enorme?

83
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,055
It's the number-one fragrance
for plus-sized women.

84
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,762
Grassisima?

85
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,661
Balena?

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,563
Enorme.

87
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,761
Make him chase the chunk.

88
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,464
Available exclusively
at your local drug store.

89
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,074
Do not use if menstruating.

90
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,302
Can't plus-sized women
wear regular perfume?

91
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,810
Jenna, your career
is really taking off now.

92
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,381
And on a personal level, I just
like you more when you're fat.

93
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,347
Oh, thank you.

94
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,849
It's all happening!

95
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,011
Okay,
let's shoot these promos.

96
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,715
Can I get some makeup
for Tracy, please?

97
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,825
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

98
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,892
Hey.

99
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,858
Oh, hell, no!

100
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,157
Actually, he looks great.
Thank you.

101
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,500
You Lenny Wosniak?

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,698
Thanks for meeting me here.

103
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,240
Yeah, I get it.

104
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,274
Discretion.

105
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,243
I wouldn't want to talk
about this in my office anyway.

106
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,438
Yeah.

107
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,947
Also, my gym
is right over there.

108
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,185
So, uh...
how does this work?

109
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,913
It's pretty simple, really.

110
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,456
I'm gonna go through your life
with a fine-tooth comb.

111
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,425
The more information I have,
the easier this is gonna be.

112
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,052
Now, have you ever
been arrested?

113
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,392
I have.

114
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,625
The 1976 Democratic
National Convention.

115
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,963
But it's okay.
I was there beating up hippies.

116
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,333
And what about your family?
Any skeletons there?

117
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,305
My brother Eddie sells
faulty sprinkler systems

118
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,670
to elementary schools.

119
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,778
My cousin Tim
fixes NBA games.

120
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,346
My mother
is an Olympic-level racist.

121
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,882
But as for the rest, they're too
drunk to do much of anything.

122
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,418
Unless getting thrown out
of a Chili's is a crime.

123
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,420
Any weird sex stuff
I should know about?

124
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:51,682
You know what?
Don't tell me.

125
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,689
I like to find that out
on my own.

126
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,589
I'm a watcher.

127
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,663
Okay, I'll get started on my end
of the process.

128
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,595
Is there anything else
you want to tell me now?

129
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:01,825
Nope.

130
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,595
That's pretty much it.

131
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,963
That's what they all say,
Mr. Donaghy.

132
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,234
I'll be in touch.

133
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,242
Mm, one more thing.

134
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,610
If I sign a friend up at my gym,
I get a free hat, so...

135
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,813
Think about it.

136
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:29,986
I'm losing weight.

137
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,097
What?
Look at my belt.

138
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,597
This is the notch
I had to make last week.

139
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,531
This is the notch
I'm using now.

140
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,569
I'm back to
the factory-made notches.

141
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,036
Jenna, calm down.

142
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,165
No, I won't calm down.
This can't be happening.

143
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,833
Everything is based
on the fat.

144
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,969
Enorme,
the offer to play Ms. PAC-MAN

145
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,581
in the live-action
Atari movie!

146
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,307
What?

147
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,476
And worst of all,
Jack won't like me anymore.

148
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,452
We have a secret ritual now
where we slap our palms together

149
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,920
when we walk by each other.

150
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:58,955
A high five.

151
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,652
It was our special thing.

152
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,761
Hey, Liz Lemon.

153
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,057
I've been reading
the newspaper

154
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,633
to come up with some ideas
for some topical sketches.

155
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,100
So, this week,
can we do "Business Section"?

156
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,535
Tracy, I love it
that you're trying to help.

157
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:14,662
Everything is great!

158
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,104
Thanks to Angie.

159
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,301
Word.
Where is my lovely wife?

160
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,105
She had to step out.
She had a hair appointment.

161
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,305
I'm going
to a strip club now.

162
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,609
What? No.
I can't let you do that.

163
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,515
I'm sorry, Liz.
This is who I am.

164
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,780
You can't ask a bird
not to fly.

165
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,447
You can't ask a fish
not to swim,

166
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,559
You can't ask a tiger

167
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,184
not to turn back
into a Chinese dude at midnight.

168
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,791
Angie is gonna kill us.

169
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,662
I feel bad about
doing this to you, Liz Lemon.

170
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,666
I really do.

171
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,828
And the only way
I can feel better about myself

172
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,100
is to get booby-slapped
by a coked-out Russian stripper.

173
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,771
I'm out.

174
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,410
Ugh!

175
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,740
Is there something
we need to discuss?

176
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,010
No, Jack.
Everything's great.

177
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,483
Look...

178
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,587
it's come to my attention

179
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,154
that you no longer
have an eating problem.

180
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,223
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

181
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,553
You're not breathing heavily,
your skin is cleared up.

182
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,684
I even find you
slightly attractive right now.

183
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,093
Don't say that, Jack.

184
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,166
Come on.
"Me want food," right?

185
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,030
Do you want food, Jenna?

186
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,034
Do you?

187
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,036
I don't know anymore.

188
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,198
I have no appetite.

189
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,036
It's okay.
Kenneth.

190
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,737
Kenneth here is gonna be
with you 24-7 to keep you fat.

191
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,039
Keep Jenna fat.
Keep Jenna funny.

192
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,011
Right, Kenneth?

193
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,979
Lt'll be just like back home
on the pig farm.

194
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,812
I'll fatten you up,
grow to love you,

195
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,920
and then my uncles
will slit your throat.

196
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,748
What have you got
for me, Len?

197
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:42,724
Well, Mr. Donaghy,
you're pretty clean.

198
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,025
And your sex life
checks out real nice.

199
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,063
Thank you.

200
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,394
There are a couple things,
though,

201
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,661
that could get in the way
of this promotion.

202
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,395
Like you should probably
give up your membership

203
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,267
to the all-white
Woodvale Country Club.

204
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,136
That is not
an all-white club.

205
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,765
What about Johnny Carlos?
He's ethnic.

206
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,901
He's the king of Spain, Jack.
I don't think that counts.

207
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,241
All right.
I'll resign.

208
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,043
Okay, you also have an
undocumented domestic employee.

209
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,652
Manuelo?
No, I need Manuelo.

210
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,948
I could never pay
an English-speaking
person that little.

211
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,114
They'd starve.

212
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,725
All right,
I'll send him home.

213
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,225
Well, that's it.

214
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,261
Unless you think
I missed something.

215
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,591
No, I think
you've been very thorough.

216
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,666
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

217
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,102
Oh, Jack.

218
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,569
One last thing.

219
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,731
You don't have

220
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,503
a massive collection
of cookie jars, do you?

221
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,111
How did you find out
about that?

222
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,111
Collector of the Year.

223
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,452
Congratulations,
Victor Nightingale.

224
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,151
Thank you.
Yes, I'm Victor Nightingale.

225
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,124
This is bad.

226
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,858
CEOs don't have
thousands of cookie jars.

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,558
Weird little guys
in bow ties do.

228
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,760
You hear
what I'm getting at?
What?

229
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,030
You saying it's a gay thing?

230
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,139
You wish it was a gay thing.

231
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,798
This is worse.
You got to get rid of them.

232
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,341
No.
I'm not doing that.

233
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,536
I've already made enough
sacrifices for this company.

234
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,044
They're not gonna get this.

235
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,043
This is Rudolph Giuliani
in 1987

236
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:16,916
with his collection
of antique wooden dolls.

237
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,546
That's a fake.

238
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,522
Giuliani
doesn't collect dolls.

239
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,957
Yeah, you're right.
He doesn't.

240
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,425
Because he incinerated them

241
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,690
in 1989,
the year he ran for mayor.

242
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,458
He looks so happy.

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,693
Aw, Jack,
the choice is yours.

244
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,703
You can either be the head

245
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,704
of the largest corporation
in America

246
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:40,369
or get buried in a bow tie
with a bunch of cookie jars.

247
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,413
Liz Lemon,
where's Tracy?

248
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,613
He, uh, went to the vet.

249
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,018
His cobra got sick.

250
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,386
Okay.

251
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,322
Hey, everybody.

252
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,894
I'm back from doing
whatever Liz Lemon said.

253
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,021
And what was that, exactly?

254
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,724
My cobra, Ramses.

255
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,461
He got sick.
So I took him to the vet.

256
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,436
Then my thumb got caught
in my butt

257
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,268
so I nodded my head
until it came out.

258
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,468
Come here, you.

259
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,074
You smell like Enorme
and brass polish.

260
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,342
You were at a strip club.

261
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,918
It was all Liz Lemon's fault.
The whole plan was hers.

262
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,281
Aw, come on, man!

263
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,584
Tracy Jordan,
you are in for a world of hurt.

264
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,090
But you're worse.

265
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,625
I trusted you.

266
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,887
You wear glasses.

267
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,691
Your access to Tracy Jordan
is cut off.

268
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,426
You can't cut me off.
This is my show.

269
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,466
Not anymore.

270
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,536
Everything
goes through me now.

271
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,571
Goodbye forever,
Liz Lemon.

272
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,038
Thank you for being
my secretary!

273
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,511
Normally, I would tell Tracy
our sketch ideas.

274
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,312
Okay.

275
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,318
In the opening sketch this week,
Tracy is a bank robber...

276
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,318
No.

277
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,923
I don't want to perpetuate
any black stereotypes.

278
00:10:59,058 --> 00:10:59,922
Next.

279
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,085
Okay, well, in this one,

280
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:08,496
Tracy plays a gentleman
who wears flamboyant clothes

281
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,795
and lives uptown.

282
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,767
He's a pimp.
He's an entrepreneur.

283
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:13,997
What's the character's name?

284
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,835
Slickback Lamar.

285
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,043
He's also playing
Barack Obama.

286
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,271
No.
We support Kucinich.

287
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,574
Listen, Angie,

288
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,309
I'm sorry I lied, but you
got to give me another chance.

289
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,509
Excuse me.

290
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,753
Did you just try to control
my body with your white hand?

291
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,355
Don't make me contact
Reverend Sharpton.

292
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,516
I can't deal with you.

293
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,027
I want new writers for Tracy,
or he doesn't do the show.

294
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,156
Grizz, Dot Com,
start coming up with ideas.

295
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:47,165
We open on a lone soldier
walking through the desert.

296
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,171
The year... 1861.

297
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,502
The place?

298
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,871
Mars.

299
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,537
This stuff will make you
real fat, Miss Maroney.

300
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,616
It made my Dad's heart
just up and give out.

301
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,686
And that's what made
my Mom's friend Ron move in.

302
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,080
Mmm.

303
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,155
Mm-hmm!

304
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,624
Coming in for a landing.

305
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,424
Uh-oh.
There's turbulence.

306
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,897
And now an Indian guy
got up to use the bathroom,

307
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,160
and an air marshal shot him.

308
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,234
Arrrrhh!

309
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,860
No. No, I can't.

310
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,631
Boy, I wish I had
some pig sedative right now.

311
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,773
Goodbye, cookie jars.

312
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,880
Thank you
for taking care of this for me.

313
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,504
No problem, Mr. Donaghy.

314
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,482
This is for the best.

315
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,816
No more secrets.
Nothing standing in my way now.

316
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,218
But just out of curiosity,

317
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,689
what exactly are you going to do
with all of these?

318
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,953
They'll be taken to Jersey City
and incinerated.

319
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,029
No.
No, no, no, no.

320
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,461
I can't have that.
Give that to me.

321
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,725
It's your funeral, Donaghy.

322
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,993
I can't destroy them.

323
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,626
I'll give them to someone.
A fellow ceramiphile.

324
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,205
You're like John Kerry
with his windsurfing.

325
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,331
I warned him, too.

326
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,604
How'd it go with Angie?

327
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,148
Terrible. She hates me.
She's hijacking the show.

328
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,182
I got to talk to Jack.

329
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,081
You want a scary black lady
to be nice to you,

330
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,778
tell her you like her nails.

331
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,549
Always works for me
at the bank.

332
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,424
Miss Lemon,
may I speak with you?

333
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,221
Sure.
Can you walk and talk?

334
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,798
Usually, but now you got me
thinking about it.

335
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,663
Jenna with problem I have.

336
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,770
There it is.

337
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,929
I'm supposed to be helping
Miss Maroney stay fat,

338
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,130
but it's not working.

339
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,366
How do I get her to eat?

340
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,736
Well, a lot of women overeat

341
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,468
because they feel bad
about themselves.

342
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,169
Maybe that's the problem.

343
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,679
Everything's going so well
for Miss Maroney right now.

344
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,408
Yeah, so be mean to her.

345
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,487
Women with low self-esteem take
refuge in either food or sex.

346
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,020
Not me, of course.

347
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,994
Hi. I just wanted to meet you,
Mr. Mason. I'm a really big fan.

348
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,154
Who picked out your outfit?
Stevie Wonder?

349
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,498
Hey! Hey! Hey!

350
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,999
Nice man!

351
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,533
So you got to be mean,
Kenneth.

352
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,368
I guess I could wait for her
to drop something

353
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,068
and then say,
"Smooth move, ex-lax."

354
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,145
That's what
my mom's friend Ron would do.

355
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,405
Oh, brother.

356
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,174
All right,
Jenna really wants this, huh?

357
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,307
Her career depends on it.
Please help.

358
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,578
Okay, do you have something
to write on?

359
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,521
Oh, I got one.

360
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,119
Sir, someone else called about
purchasing your collection.

361
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,857
A Mr. Gary Heingarten?

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,195
No.
Jonathan, he lives in Albany.

363
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,066
The temperature fluctuations
alone would...

364
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,765
These things expand
and contract.

365
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,739
They're alive, Jonathan.

366
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,435
Hey, do you have a minute?

367
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,239
Tracy's wife is...

368
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,847
What's with the cookie jar?

369
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,244
I collect them.

370
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,977
Really? Is that some sort of
unresolved childhood thing?

371
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,143
Nice try.

372
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,255
We never had any cookie jars
in my home

373
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,947
because our mother
never baked us any cookies

374
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,888
'cause she never felt
we deserved any cookies.

375
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,051
So, obviously, it has nothing
to do with my childhood.

376
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,720
But that cookie jar
says "Mom" on it.

377
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,195
Uh, I don't think so.

378
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,425
I've always viewed it
as an upside-down "Wow."

379
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,401
But it doesn't matter now
because I have to, um...

380
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,033
...get rid of them all.

381
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:08,730
Why?

382
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,432
Because the guy
with the weird hobby

383
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,907
never gets
the corner office.

384
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,606
Lemon, what is going on
on your stage right now?

385
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,811
Oh. This is what I came
to talk to you about.

386
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,614
Tracy's wife
is out of control.

387
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,689
Did you tell her
you like her fingernails?

388
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,755
No.

389
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,088
But I thought that we could
give her a consultant credit.

390
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,355
It's meaningless,
but it might calm her down.

391
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,395
Lemon, I'm impressed.

392
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,863
You're beginning to think
like a businessman.
A businesswoman.

393
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,194
I don't think that's a word.

394
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,496
Unfortunately,
what you've gotten yourself into

395
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,867
is not a business situation,
but a family conflict.

396
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:41,904
So it's tricky.

397
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,406
So what do I do
about Angie?

398
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,402
I think you're
gonna have to fight her.

399
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,774
What?
Yeah.

400
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,883
You throw her out, she'll
probably punch you in the face.

401
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,382
Then we eject her
from the building,

402
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,417
and we bar her for life.

403
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,815
I think Angie's right-handed,

404
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,286
so you have to
work her clockwise.

405
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,050
You've already
thought about fighting her?

406
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,352
Every time I meet a
person, I figure how
I'm gonna fight them.

407
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,585
You have a gimpy left knee,
right?

408
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,854
I'm not gonna fight anybody.

409
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,896
I'm gonna give her the title,
and she'll back off.

410
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,794
Lemon, you're gonna get hit
in the face,

411
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,230
and it's gonna hurt
like hell.

412
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,801
You want to lean in
to take away their momentum.

413
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:11,868
Hands up.
Come on.

414
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,437
I don't want to.
Lean in. Come on.

415
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,630
Oh, God.
Stop it!

416
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,270
Hello, Jenna.

417
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,537
Still failing at overeating

418
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,306
just like you fail
at everything in your life?

419
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,676
What?
You quitter.

420
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,909
You gonna quit this
like you quit fashion school?

421
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,450
Give up like you gave up

422
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,076
on your relationship
with David Blaine?

423
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,711
He's the one
who drove the wedge...

424
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,788
with his magic.

425
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,119
Also, you've got
so many daddy issues,

426
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,318
the only thing keeping you
from being a stripper

427
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,759
is your weird mole.

428
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,090
Kenneth.

429
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,698
That's very hurtful.

430
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,698
You lied about
your brother drowning

431
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,303
so people would come
to your one-woman show.

432
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,463
Kenneth, I've never heard you
talk this way.

433
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,268
Your toes
look like dried-up shrimps.

434
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,341
Oh.

435
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,806
Oh, daddy.

436
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,381
Go on.
Keep talking.

437
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,416
What else
don't you like about me?

438
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,951
Can I help you?

439
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,454
Yes.

440
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,458
Angie, I know you and I
got off on the wrong foot here,

441
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,186
but I want you to know

442
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,457
that I appreciate
your contribution to the show,

443
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,195
and so I want to offer you
a consultant credit.

444
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,668
I don't want
that crap title.

445
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,932
You think you're gonna
buy me off so I'll play nice?

446
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,735
It's never gonna happen.

447
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,268
Okay.

448
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,344
I'm ordering you to leave.

449
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,005
Excuse me?

450
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,085
Get your stuff and get out.
Don't make me say it again.

451
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,777
No, Liz Lemon,
don't do it.

452
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,582
Are you steppin' up on me?

453
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,588
So what if I am?
Also, your nails look tacky.

454
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,852
Oh, wait a minute!

455
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,894
Enough, damn it!
Enough!

456
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,589
Do I have to fix
this situation?

457
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,222
I am the immature one.

458
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:49,664
But the both of you,

459
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,032
you're forcing me
to act like an adult.

460
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,399
An adult!

461
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,200
And even worse,

462
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,434
you're making me stop two ladies
from going at it.

463
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,738
But I don't care.

464
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,506
'Cause I'm putting
my foot down.

465
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,240
You're putting your foot down
with me?

466
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,577
Uh-huh.

467
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,344
Baby, you got to go.

468
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:08,418
You're controlling,

469
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,454
you're manipulative,
you're loud...

470
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,387
Tracy, I've never heard you
talk like that before.

471
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,988
Hey, let me
get this shirt off.

472
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,096
Get it off.

473
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:20,859
Okay, so,
just to be clear,

474
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,467
does this mean
Angie is leaving or...

475
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,400
Oh, no!
You guys <i>start</i> with that?!

476
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,335
That... wow!

477
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,634
That is...

478
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,211
Mr. Donaghy?
I've got some bad news.

479
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,976
I wasn't able to get
Miss Maroney to eat.

480
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:39,982
I'm so sorry.

481
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,143
What happened?

482
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,652
Well, It turns out
she's the wrong kind of crazy,

483
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,916
and I guess
we have to get married now.

484
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,719
Apology accepted, Kenneth.

485
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,658
I suppose we're both having
a pretty bad day.

486
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,728
Ha!

487
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,025
Look at that
kooky old cookie jar.

488
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,461
I like the upside-down "Wow"
on it.

489
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,632
You like cookie jars,
Kenneth?

490
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,710
Well, I guess I've never
thought about it that much.

491
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,143
We had a nice one
back home in Georgia.

492
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,215
Had a bear on it.

493
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,684
I remember when my Mom's friend
Ron would come over.

494
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,915
They'd go into the bedroom
to sort out their paperwork,

495
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,823
and I'd just go ahead
and stare at that cookie jar.

496
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,625
It was almost as if I took
every problem that I ever had

497
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,963
and I put it
inside that cookie jar.

498
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,934
And I sealed it up so tight,

499
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,337
that nothing would never,
ever, ever get out.

500
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,171
So, I guess
to answer your question,

501
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,145
I'd give cookie jars
about a "B."

502
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,876
Some people
have so many problems

503
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,078
that there aren't enough
cookie jars in the world

504
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,153
to contain them.

505
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,587
Well,
that just makes me sad.

506
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,057
Kenneth, I have
a cookie-jar collection.

507
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,688
Would you like to have it?

508
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,731
Of course, sir!
I'd love to!

509
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,064
Always hold them squarely
at the base, never by the lid.

510
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,071
And should you ever go
to the convention in Sarasota,

511
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,539
please tell Patty
and Beth and all of them

512
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,509
that Vic Nightingale
says hello.

513
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,078
Okay, sir.

514
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,359
Are you happy now,
you son of a bitch?

515
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,496
You son of a bitch.

516
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,833
Grassisima?

517
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,033
Balena?

518
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,610
Grassota?

519
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,714
Ooh?

520
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,147
Enorme?

521
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,277
Enorme?

522
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,788
Como ti amo?

523
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,554
Porcella?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
