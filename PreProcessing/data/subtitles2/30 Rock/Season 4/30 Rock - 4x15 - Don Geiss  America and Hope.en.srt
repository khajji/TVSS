I'd like to welcome everyone

00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:06,283
to this NBC employee
town hall meeting.

3
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:08,685
And thank you for taking time
out of your busy schedules.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,377
Yeah, I'm supposed to be
drinking a soda right now.

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,803
A special thanks to those
joining us via simulcast,

00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,918
Particularly you gentlemen
in the Tokyo office.

00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:18,299
I know it's late there.

8
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:21,120
I don't know why you're wearing
girls' pajamas,

9
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,632
But I'm sure it's cultural.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,366
I'm here to address concerns
regarding the acquisition

11
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,557
Of our company
by Kabletown.

12
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:30,895
With a K.

13
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,539
This is an exciting time
for NBC.

14
00:00:33,607 --> 00:00:35,881
Not <i>Seinfeld, Friends, E.R.</i>
exciting.

15

More like 3d episodes
of <i>Merlin</i> exciting.

16
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,733
But I believe
this is a great opportunity

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,176
For all of us because Kabletown
is a great company.

18
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:46,019

Yeah, then he looked around,
realized it sucked,

30
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:09,681
And moved to Philadelphia!

31
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:11,819
Oh, did you just whip
a battery at me?

32
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:13,924
Mr. Donaghy, I'm sorry,
can we get back to the meeting?

33
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,498
Of course. My apologies

Before I take
your questions,

39
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:30,060
I'd like to say few words
about Don Geiss.

40
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:32,900
The world has lost a giant.

41
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,968
He built G.E.

42
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,572
into the greatest company
on earth,

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,075
And the earth into one of

In the universe.

45

your respects,

Now the floor is open

And worst of all,
she revealed the fact

101
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,563
That I've never cheated
on my wife.

102

Okay, well,
that's not true.

Actually it is true.

00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:05,377
They'll be bringing in
new page rules.

160
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:08,775
Like age limits
and age verification.

161
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:11,108
Truth be told,
I haven't learned a lot

162
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,241
About Kabletown.

163
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:14,976
It's a whole different
business model.

164
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:17,811
My cousin in Atlanta
is a business model.

165
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,213
She holds up staplers
in catalogues.

166
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,014
But later today, I'm meeting
with an old colleague

167
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,981
Who left G.E. For Kabletown
five years ago.

168
00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:27,749
I'm going to pick his brain
and learn how Kabletown works,s,

169
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:30,148
So I can prove
that I am the man

170
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:32,583
With the ambition,
the talent,

171
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:36,054
And the looking-at-my-watch
skills to run this company.

172
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:40,225
[gasps]
terrific, sir!

173
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,993
So all we need you to do

174
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:43,861
Is to put us under
anesthesia again.

175
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:44,996
Wesley brought his video camera.

176
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:46,697
In England,
we call it a film pod.

177
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:47,931
No.

178
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:50,032
And that way, afterward,
we can watch the tape

179
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,599
And figure out
what our connection was.

180
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,802
Would you ask a cardiologist
to do something like this?

181
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,037
I am a real doctor.

182
00:06:55,105 --> 00:06:56,740
Yeah,
but a cardiologist is...

183
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,342
I know
what a cardiologist is.

184
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,510
My brother is a cardiologist,
and I'm just as good as he is.

185
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:01,745
We drive the same car.

186
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:03,846
So what if his wife
is more attractive?

187
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:06,014
But Dr. Kaplan,
this is for love.

188
00:07:06,082 --> 00:07:08,416
It's like that brilliant film,
uh, <i>Notting Hill.</i>

189
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:11,519
I'm british and charming,
and she's...

190
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:13,921
Got certain angles
that work for her.

191
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:16,723
Really?
You think you found "the one"

192
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,125
In my recovery room.

193
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:21,628
Let me show you
what happens in there.

194
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,231
We are gonna hang out
so much after this.

195
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:27,766
I want to take you
to the big apple circus

196
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:30,668
'cause we're best friends.

197
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:37,606
I don't think
there was any connection.

198
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:40,040
It was just the anesthesia.

199
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:42,608
Well, liz, I wish you
all the best.

200
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:45,444
But future wife deleted.

201
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,878
It's a good idea.

202
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:50,248
And if my heart surgeon
brother is so great,

203
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:52,282
How come so many
of his patients have died,

204
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,984
But I've only killed
one guy, huh?

205
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:04,818
Say it ain't so,
tray.

206
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:07,120
What about the Seattle
Seahawks cheerleader?

207
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,020
That one
kind of thick rockette?

208
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,453
That blind woman

209
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,420
In the business class
bathroom on the acela?

210
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:13,988
Were those all lies too?

211
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,588
But, Frank, I still party.

212
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:17,287
I'm still terrible at my job.

213
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:20,723
I looked up to you.
Now I hate you.

214
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:25,026
Tracy, I know
what you're going through.

215
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:26,394
I got a lot of flack

216
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,429
After I ate the pig
that played babe.

217
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:30,197
I learned you have
to go on the offensive.

218
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,498
Start denying this stuff.

219
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:32,900
I did, j-mo.

220
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:35,335
I held a press conference
this morning.

221
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:38,705
I'm here to announce
that I'm leaving show business

222
00:08:38,773 --> 00:08:41,274
To spend more time
with my stripper.

223
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:44,309
But it's like
a black barbie doll in Arizona.

224
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:45,643
Nobody's buying it.

225
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,311
Well, we lost
another one, tray.

226
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,779
I just got off the phone with
the people

227
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,180
From horny goat weed.

228
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:51,515
They're dropping you
as their spokesman.

229
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,750
But John Edwards and I
were supposed to ride

230
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:55,418
On their cinco de mayo float.

231
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,155
Yet another
black superstar

232
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,457
Taken down
by his personal life.

233
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:06,161
Just like my favorite golfer
OJ Simpson.

234
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:07,228
[laughs]

235
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,496
Remember how you tricked
the owner

236
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:09,797
Of that toaster company
into thinking

237
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:11,732
You were his dead son?

238
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,000
And he sold you the factory
for $1.

239
00:09:14,068 --> 00:09:16,069
You are an animal.

240
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,838
Dave "the animal" hess.

241
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:19,539
I was only as good
as my mentor,

242
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:22,473
The man who taught me
how to bait the enemy,

243
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,975
Jack "the master baiter"
Donaghy.

244
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:28,077
So, dave, tell me
all about Kabletown.

245
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:30,746
What's their business strategy,
revenue streams?

246
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:32,314
Do they have a preferred side
of the head

247
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:33,849
For parting your hair,
because I've been continental

248
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,684
For years,
but I'm willing to go western.

249
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:38,053
Whoa, relax, buddy.
Your job is secure.

250
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:39,754
I just want to understand
the operation

251
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:41,222
So I can contribute
right away.

252
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,791
Well, that's the beauty
of it, Jack.

253
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:45,427
You don't have to.
The cable's already laid--

254
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:47,729
I don't understand.
There's always room for growth,

255
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:49,264
For innovation.
No, there really isn't.

256
00:09:49,332 --> 00:09:50,399
It's brilliant.

257
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,234
And this is the goose

258
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:54,002
That lays the golden eggs--

259
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,738
Channels 500 through 600.

It's all pay-per-view porn.

264
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:09,250
Do you know
how much of our profit

265
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,418
Comes from men
ordering adult movies?

266
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,251
91%.

267
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:14,752
They churn this stuff out,

268
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,352
People at home push a button,

269
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,853
And we make money
off it.

270
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,921
We don't do anything.

271
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,788
Then what do you want
with NBC?

272
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,088
Why do you even want me?

273
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:26,189
Well, buying NBC counts
as a charitable donation

274
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:27,254
For tax purposes.

275
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,954
And as for you,

276
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,720
You're the classic

277

Jack.
I make things.

00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:43,527
I build companies,

Don't fight it, Jack.

Look, I wasn't even supposed

To ride
my footcycle home today.

309

Yeah, fine, my velocipede,
but I did ride it

Because the universe wanted me
to run into you again.

I know why.

00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,218
To jabber.

477
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:48,652
And it doesn't matter
if you have a headache,

478
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,386
Or you're not in the mood,

479
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:52,354
Or you're about to go
to Don Geiss's funeral,

480
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,789
They barge
right into your office

481
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:55,090
And start complaining
about a boyfriend

482
00:18:55,158 --> 00:18:56,291
Or a coworker.

483
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,725
And you're supposed
to sit there and nod

484
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:59,060
And tell them they're right.

485
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:00,961
And the more you give it
to them, the more they want it.

486
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:03,329
I'll tell you, sometimes
my wife will be blathering on

487
00:19:03,397 --> 00:19:05,130
About something,
and I'll think,

488
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:06,731
I'm more
than just a pair of ears.

489
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,233
You know, I'm a person

490
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:10,236
Who thinks about sex
every seven seconds.

491
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:11,504
Exactly.

492
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:13,506
So what if women had
a pay-per-view channel

493
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:16,808
Featuring handsome men
patiently listening to them?

494
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:20,381
What if they had...
Porn for women?

495
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:24,219
Okay, but where does
that content come from?

496
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,154
From us.
We make it.

497
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:28,288
Jack.
We don't make...

498
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:29,988
Hear me out.
Yes, I'm talking about

499
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:32,021
Doubling pay-per-view
profits

500
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,156
While cutting out the middle
man, but I'm also talking

501
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:37,059
About american businessmen doing
what they were born to do--

502
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:38,560
Make things.

503
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:40,228
We've stopped making

504
00:19:40,296 --> 00:19:41,896
And become a country
of consumers.

505
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:45,599
Well, I, for one,
am done consuming.

506
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,000
And I'm ready to make.

507
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,177
Liz?
I don't believe it.

508
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,478
Hello, Wesley.

509
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,279
Don't you see this is
just gonna keep happening?

510
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:05,613
You can't fight the universe.

511
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,048
No, this isn't a coincidence.

512
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:08,516
I wanted to see you,
and I figured

513
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:11,853
You wouldn't miss a tasting
of the white wines of Scotland.

514
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,321
Most restaurants refuse
to serve them.

515
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,456
Oh, yeah, you've only told me
that, like, nine times.

516
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:17,258
So does this mean
you've come to your senses?

517
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,693
Are you ready to settle
and become Mrs. Snipes?

518
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,395
No. I wanted to tell you
to your face

519
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:23,629
That I know
that I can do better than you.

520
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:25,931
And I am never gonna be
Mrs. Snipes.

521
00:20:25,998 --> 00:20:27,899
Hang on, is your name
Wesley Snipes?

522
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,001
That is insane!
No, it's insane

523
00:20:30,068 --> 00:20:32,202
That the actor Wesley Snipes
has that name.

524
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,437
If you saw a picture of him
and a picture of me,

525
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:38,107
And you were asked, "who should
be named Wesley Snipes?"

526
00:20:38,175 --> 00:20:39,975
You'd pick the pale englishman
every time.

527
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,509
Every time, Liz.

528
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:43,178
Frankly, you should be having
this conversation with him.

529
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:46,947
Yeah.
I'm gonna go do that.

530
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:48,715
I give you two months
before you give up

531
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,717
And decide to settle!

532
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:52,118
I'll see you in May!

533
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,653
For sweeps!

534
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,654
That's what we call
spring cleaning in England.

535
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,223
[groans]

536
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:02,289
[flipping channels]

537
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,895
Hello there.
Well, hello.

538
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,764
How was your day?
Do you need to talk?

539
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,700
'cause I'll just listen
patiently and say things like,

540
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:15,003
"uh-huh,"
"how annoying,"

541
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,838
"she's clearly
jealous of you,"

542
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:20,074
And "well, it's his loss."

543
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:23,844
You're a great woman.
You deserve a great man.

544
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:25,646
For just $24.95 an hour.

545
00:21:25,714 --> 00:21:28,282
Yes, please.

546
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,850
It's the yellow button,
sweetie.
