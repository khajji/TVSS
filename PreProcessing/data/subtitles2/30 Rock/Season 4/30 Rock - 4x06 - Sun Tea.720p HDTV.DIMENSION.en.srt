1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,820
... And side. Excellent.Keep
those cores strong.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,850
Three, two, let's take
itoverhead on one...

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,470
This is a classic,prewar
onebedroom, onebath...

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,270
What?

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,580
Oh. The cleaninglady's here.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,180
Please come back later.No polish.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,290
I live here.What're you doing?

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,550
Oh. Haven't you heard?The
building's going condo.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,400
If you're planning on
buying,i'm wendy. We should talk.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,390
Well, I'm not buying,and
they can't just kick me out.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,800
No, they can't,but they
can hike your rent up.

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,150
Way up.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,760
Let me show youthe bedroom.

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,930
-Jack will tell youwhat to do next.
-What?

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,050
Thanks, cindy.All right, now
we'regonna work those glutes.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,150
Hey, do youhave a minute?

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,040
Good god, lemon,have you seen this?

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,250
As I'm sure you'veconcluded from the
headline,don geiss'sestranged son bertram

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,390
is suing hishalfsister kathyfor
control ofthe geiss family trust fund.

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,930
They could've done,"geiss
screams, son pay!"

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,240
you know, like,ice cream sundae.

22
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,710
This makes me sickto my stomach, lemon.

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,280
Don geiss is my hero,my
mentor, a great man.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,040
Holding up one fingerto get someone
to stop talking...He invented that.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,460
- I don't think...
- And now...

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,230
He's being publicly
humiliatedby his own family.

27
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,280
This is y I'm gladI never had
children,and why I never will.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,510
Oh, jack,you don't mean that.

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,640
Geiss also invented the
abruptconversational segue.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,660
Talk aboutyour thing now.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,080
Okay, well, um,my
building is going condo.

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,330
And they're tryingto drive the renters
out?Are you going tobuy your place?

33
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,130
Well, I love my builng,but
if I gonna buy a place

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,830
it should be a big placewhere
I can have a family.

35
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,010
Then spend someof your dealbreakers
money.Buy two apartments.

36
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,520
-What?
-You know whymy place is so big?

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,770
When I was first married to
myexwife we were in the basement.

38
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,780
Over the years I keptbuying
the floors above me

39
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,470
to make room for the
familyI thought we'd have.

40
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,920
Well, now I havesomething
better than a family.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,080
A walkin humidor,a lap pool,

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,060
and a replica of the irish
pubwhere my grandmother was born.

43
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,290
Well, I'm not rich, jack.

44
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,910
You're doing okay.And this
could beyour dream apartment.

45
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,680
Sniff around yourupstairs
neighbor,see if he'sanning to leave.

46
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,520
If he's not, make him an offerhe
can't refuse.Trademark 1974,

47
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,300
-don geiss.
-What, like, bribe him?

48
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,540
I know thissounds ugly,but with
manhattan real estatethere are no rules.

49
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,290
It's like checkinat an italian airport.

Oh, my god! Frank!

54
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,220
Were you gonna peein that jar?

55
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,550
I didn't knowanyone was here.

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,420
That's what youuse the jars for?

57
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,450
You told methat was sun tea.

58
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,420
Some of themare sun tea,

59
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,870
and some of themwere sun tea.

60
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,800
Do you know about this?

61
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,700
We havea gentleman's agreement.

62
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,130
He gets the jars,and
in return he's agreed

63
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,320
to let a yale sweatshirtbe
our desd fart dampener.

64
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,170
What is wrongwith you guys?

65
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,570
What would it be like if
cerieand sue and I were not here?

66
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,140
-We'd have a room dognamed meatus.
-I'd take my pants offand eat chicken wings.

67
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,710
Shut it down.Throw away the jars.

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,600
Fine, but I'mgonna recycle them,

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,280
and then one day as youdrink some apple
juice,you'll wonder,"where has this jar been?"

70
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,460
I will fight my sister toothand
nail to get what I deserve

71
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,380
because i, bertram geiss,am
still daddy's fancy boy.

72
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:44,170
After the deposition,kathy geiss's
lawyeroffered this rebuttal.

73
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,380
My name is teddy ruxpin.Can
you and I be friends?

74
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,550
Mr. Donaghy,you wanted to see me?

75
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,950
Kenneth,I have a task for you.

76
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,700
Is it menial?

77
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,510
As part of nbc's annualgreen week
initiative,has to reduceits carbon footprint.

78
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,860
I'm putting youin charge that effort.

79
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,810
Global warming, sir?

80
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,940
I'm sorry, that's justa
bunch of scientist talk.

81
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,500
Same peoplewho'd have you believe
that my greatgrandfatherwas a monkey.

82
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,760
If he was a monkey, then
whywas he killed by a monkey?

83
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,870
You're preachingto the choir, kenneth.

84
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,420
I mean, I love the earth.I
have these rarekadupul blossoms

85
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,780
flown in every morningfrom
sri lanka on a private jet.

86
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:25,350
That's the definitionof green.And
yet they force usto do more.

87
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,140
More sacrifices.Why? For the children.

88
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,030
What have childrenever done for us?

89
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,670
Well, they makeour shoes and wallets.

90
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,110
I need a 5% reductionof
energy use across the board.

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,340
I'll do itif you insist, sir.

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,720
But I'm gonna be grumpyuntil
the end this sentence.

93
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,760
Hi, I'm liz,and I live right below you.

94
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,750
Oh, my god.I'm brian. Come in.

95
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,550
Wow, this placeis great.

96
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,350
Isn't it?New kitchen,original molding,

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,550
and I have a view because
thatdentist blew up his townhouse.

98
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,390
So... You gonnatry and bribe me like
the rest of theseyuppie bottom feeders?

99
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,980
What? No. Bribe?People do that?

100
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,510
Yeah, well,the guy above me
offered me ten grandto move out.

101
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,380
That's a lot.

102
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,130
It's obscene.This
neighborhoodused to be real.

103
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,480
Now it's all chain
storesand fancy restaurants.

104
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,130
Yeah, we cool peoplegot
to hold our ground.

105
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,970
Fight the man.Michael moore, et
cetera.Is thata working fireplace?

106
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,020
Yeah, but it'skind of
annoying.I can't ut the flue,

107
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,700
so the apartment smells likeburger
king all day and cinnabon all night.

108
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,190
Yeah, I just came up hereto
make sure you're staying.

109
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,070
Ruining things for those creepsg to make
duplexesfor their imaginary children,

110
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,150
and their imaginary
husband,astronaut mike dexter.

111
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,570
So what's your plan?

112
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,350
I don't know. Just
figuresomething out, I guess.

113
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,800
Look,what if we team up?

114
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,110
-What do you mean?
-I can't affordto stay here on my own,

115
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,970
and based on yourshoes and
teeth,i'm guessingyou can't either,

116
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,130
so why don't wemove in together?

117
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,290
I mean, you'd have togive up your
place'cause this isthe twobedroom.

118
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,540
There's two of them?

119
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,360
oh! Is that bad?Oh, god.

120
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,070
So now you're your ownupstairs neighbor.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,510
What's the plan?

122
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,320
Well, I'm gonna pretendto move in
with brian,somehow drive him out,

123
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,360
then buy both placesand
make my dream apartment.

124
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,070
That sounds like something
I'dcome up with if I was smarter.

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,860
I know, I'm terrible.But brian sucks.

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,640
He doesn't have a tv and
hewears political tshirts.

127
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,960
Don't feel guiltyfor a second.This
is manhattanreal estate.

128
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,090
There are no rules.Like
checkinat an italian sex party.

129
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,060
I mean,do you know how long I've
been waitingfor the lady next door

130
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,180
to finally joinher husband in hell?

131
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,350
Hello, Mrs. Gerstein.

132
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,200
Oh, my heart...Is
getting strongerevery day.

133
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,850
Oh, you ancient bitch!

134
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,630
But you've alreadygot
a foot in the door.

135
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,810
Here's whatyou're gonna do.

136
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,160
Do you rememberthat horrible
roommate you had back in chicago?

137
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,960
You mean you?

138
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,440
I know it's my turnto do the
dishes,but I'm in character,

139
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,670
and if you make me do the
dishesI will kill myself!

140
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,900
You drove a lot of guysout
of that third bedroom.

141
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,900
Becauseguys hate drama.And I'm gonna
teach youhow to be a drama queen.

142
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:32,800
And if I fail,i'm gonna take a bunch
of pills,and it's gonna be your fault!

143
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,460
Still got it.

144
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,380
Lemon, I justwant to make sure you're not
making any jokesabout don geiss this week.

145
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,900
Don't worry,ack.Our topicalcold open is
aboutomarosa borrowingbjork's swan dress.

146
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,190

147
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,200
What's up, donaghy?

148
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,260
Tracy jr.,to what do we owe this visit?

149
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,330
It's "take your black kidto work day."

150
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,940
Do you everregret having children?

151
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,550
Every day.

152
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,420
I thought having a family
wasgonna be like the cosby show.

153
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,310
Oh, no,vanessa nto a concert!

154
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,030
Oh, no, rudy and I are makinga
sandwich for 25 minutes!

155
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,810
The cosby show was a lie.Having
a familycan be the worst.

156
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,580
For example,I have this strip club story
from this weekendI need to tell you, jackie d.

157
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,830
It is disgusting.

158
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,620
But I can't becauseI got
this little dbag, here.

159
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,640
I know what that means.

160
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,160
And yet youwon't tell me.

161
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,320
I've been thinkinga lot about
family lately, about my legacy.

162
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,100
I've been watching a friendgo through an
ordealwith his children,and it has only affirmed

163
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,280
that I was not meantto have any
of my ownand that I never will.

164
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,730
It's not that simple.

165
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,490
Now, what if a girltries to trap you like
nicole tried to do meon the band trip?

166
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,990
Bitches can be tricky.

167
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm going to getsome strawberry milk.

168
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,660
Tracy jr.'s right.There's only one way
to reallytake children off the table.

169
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,440
I'm going to geta vasectomy.

170
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,090
.I mean, that's a bigecision!

171
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,110
Having a family is alsothe
best thing a man could...

172
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,410
He's gone.So my story.

173
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,050
So I'm in the strip club with
charles barkleyand one of the hobbits.

174
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,730
Hey, daddy.

175
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,650
Damn it!I n't live like
this!I'm gettinga vasectomy too!

176
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,370
Excuse me, Miss maroney.

177
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,010
Kenneth, I'm doingy
kegelsright now. What is it?

178
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,460
Well, I've beenput in charge of
reducing tgs's carbon footprint.

179
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,710
And everyonehas to chip in.

180
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,600
Kenneth, I oncetook a lowvolume
shower with ed begley jr.

181
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,780
What more can I do?

182
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,350
Well, let's see.

183
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,520
Minka kelly says,"my
show is about football.

184
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,700
"there's a football teamcalled
the chargers.Unplug your chargers."

185
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,450
But kenneth,I need all of these.

186
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,190
This one's for my cell
phone,this one's for my laptop,

187
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,390
this one'sfor my erotic massager,and
this one'sfor something personal.

188
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,470
A vasectomy is a veryserious decision.

189
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,360
I want to make sure
you'veboth tught this through.

190
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,510
I have,I've thought about it,and I've
decided thatI don't want to have children.

191
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,420
Family planning.And
what about you, tracy?

192
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,850
the cosby showlied to me.

193
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,360
I don't think there'sa
box for that on the form.

194
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,240
Uh, what about"cheers lied to me"?

195
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,030
Okay.Now, for the procedureyou can
choose between localor general anesthesia.

196
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,850
I should warn youthat general anesthesia
can cause powerfulhallucinations.

197
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,120
So highly recommend it.I'll
scheduleboth of you for the morning.

198
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,070
Now, this is surgery, so don'teat
anything before you come in,

199
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,880
because I'll havea big
breakfast waiting for you.

200
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,900
Until tomorrow,gentlemen.

201
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,140
We all see the little, black
boyin the corner, right?

202
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,630
Okay.

203
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,080
Hey, liz.

204
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,950
Made you a mailbox key.

205
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,720
So is thatall you have to say
to me?That's how you apologize?

206
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,000
What? What did I do?

207
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,790
What do you care?Whatever,
brian, I am over it!

208
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,730
-Over what?
- It!

209
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,450
Oh, I'm sorry,is it too much drama?

210
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,010
You remind me of my
fatherand my boyfriend!

211
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,030
Ugh! Are you listening to
me?Because if you are not,

212
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,340
I will put on a wedding dressand
jump in front of a subway!

213
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,670
Honey, you don't needto
tell me how much men suck.

214
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,970
Sit downand tell me everythingwhile
I make usraspberry mojitos.

215
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,860
You're gay?

216
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,420
Start from the beginning.What's
this boyfriend's na

217
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,490
astronaut mike dexter.

218
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,450
Hi, tracy.I thought "take your
black kidto work day" was yesterday.

219
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,010
No, it's alwaysa wednesday.

220
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,280
Brian is gay, jenna.The drama
did notmake him want to move out.

221
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,820
Well, of course not.Drama
is likegay man gatorade.

222
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,530
It replenishestheir electrolytes.

223
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,570
Damn it,he's never gonna leave.

224
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,380
Trying to getsomeone to move out?

225
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,010
May I suggest what gotmy
neighbors to move out?

226
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,250
Black person moved in,scared 'em off.

227
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,360
Huh. That's nota bad idea, tracy.

228
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,220
I got a lotof good ideas.Now
if you'll excuse me,

229
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,210
I have to take my sonto my
vasectomybecause the cosby showlied to me

230
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,410
and I cannot tellan
amazing strip club story.

231
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,540
Okay, let's go.

232
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,850
Miss lemon.As I'm sure you
know,it is green week, and nbc...

233
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,010
Oh, brother, are they actuallygonna
do something this year,

234
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,730
or are they just gonna putthat stupid
green peacock in the cornerof the screen?

235
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,160
Actually, we're reducing
tgs's carbon footprint.

236
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,400
And what you can do,miss lemon,is
get rid of youroffice mini fridge.

237
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,720
My mini fridge?What about my fresh
fruit?...flavored toastercheesecakes?

238
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,230
Oh, so I guess you canmake
other peopl stuff up,

239
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,230
but you're too goodto
make a sacrifice yourself.

240
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,630
Fine, I'll give upmy mini fridge because
unlike frankI am a good d decent person.

241
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,610
Is that my cell phone?

242
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,540
Oh, no, sorry.It's in my hand.

243
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,190
Count backwardsfrom ten.

244
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,630
Sure.I know how to do that.

245
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,320
You lied to me, bill
cosby!You lied to me!

246
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,910
Uhoh, here comesmy hallucination.

247
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,300
Denise. Vanessa?Sondra the
boring one.'s your father.

248
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:07,590
I'm having a cosby show hallucination.

249
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,450
Hey, dad.

250
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,680
Theo,what's going on here?

251
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,950
Did rudy make a messwith
the juicer again?

252
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:17,190
Vanessa was supposed tobe watching her
and not upstairsgossiping on the phone.

253
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,490
Who are rudyand vanessa?

254
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,060
Your adorable sisterand your sister.

255
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:24,570
I don't have any sisters, dad.

256
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,620
it's just us guys.

257
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,430
You know how it iswhen
it's just us guys, right?

258
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,400
That's why my lifeis
not like the cosby show.

259
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,560
I only have boys,and
boys are disgusting!

260
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,710
I need a baby girl.

261
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,740
Don't patronize me!

262
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,410
Stop laughing!It's not funny!

263
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,910
I need a baby girl!Don't
snip my vas deferens!

264
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,520
Looking... Things!

265
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,180
Hey, what'reyou doing home?

266
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:59,010
Oh, just gettingmy computer.Sorry,
I forgot you'dbe home now, brian!

267
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,230
Elizabeth,I know you're in there.

268
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,870
Oh, no.It's my crazy black
boyfriend,astronaut mike dexter.

269
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,160
Better not be with a
man!Even if he's gay!

270
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,890
Mike, no, I don't evenknow
why I'm letting you in

271
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,100
when you're in thisunreasonable state.

272
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,660
Don't get angryand jealous,

273
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,550
even though brian is the
onewho convinced me to move on.

274
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,660
I'm gonna be coming byall the time,

275
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,720
gettin' jealous,takin'
thingout of context.

276
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,580
That dude brianwould
be happier moving out!

277
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,210
Okay, everybodyjust calm down.

278
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,220
I feel angry!

279
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,860
Like warren moonmust've
felt back in 1995!

280
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,140
As I have told you many
timesduring our relationship,

281
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,600
no one getsthat reference.

282
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
Oh, lord!

283
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,310
Nypd!Stay on the ground!

284
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,060
A gay hipster cop.You're
aninteresting guy, brian.

285
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,400
Look at this.

286
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,660
The geiss name used to
besynonymous with success, power,

287
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,160
funny incidentswhere
women died at barbecues.

288
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,670
Now it's beingdragged through the mud.

289
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,500
This is whyi'm having a vasectomy.

290
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,740
Yeah, but lookat that picture.

291
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,090
He had some good timeswith his kids too.

292
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,810
That junk is priceless.

293
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,090
Well, I'm glad I'm doing
this.Very, very glad.

294
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,590
What are youworking on now?

295
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,310
I have to write an
essayabout my dad for school.

296
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,550
I wanted the cover to
beone of those things

297
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,360
where each letter in his
namestands for a word about him.

298
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,230
That's calledan "acrostic."

299
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,490
An acrostic. Cool.Thanks
for teaching me that.

300
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,120
Yes, well,you're welcome.

301
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,630
Maybe I could help youwith the
grammar.Why don't youread it to me?

302
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,990
"T" is for terrific,"r" is for rad,

303
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,320
"a" is for awesome,"c"...
'cause he's my dad.

304
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,950
Damn you, tracy jr.

305
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,060
Miss lemon, your mini
fridgeis still in your office.

306
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,640
You made a promiseto masi oka.

307
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,080
"conserve electricity.Don't
be a zero,be a good guy."

308
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,190
Why doesn't thatsay "hero"?

309
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,850
That feels likea real
missed opportunity.

310
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,280
I don't care.If I can't
havemy adult apartment,

311
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,830
I will havemy mini fridge.

312
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,410
Wow, liz.Don't you
careabout the environment?

313
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,560
Shut up. What do you
knowabout the environment?

314
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,980
Only everything.

315
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,150
Ladies and gentlemen,I present to you

316
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,490
the greenest person at
tgs,mr. Frank rossitano.

317
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,420
He neverwastes anything.I've
seen himeat food from the trash.

318
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,950
What's a trash barrel but a
big salad bowlfilled with trash?

319
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,150
He never wastes waterby
doing his laundry.

320
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,040
This shirtstarted out white.

321
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,660
No, do not encourage this.

322
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,070
He pees in jars and leaves themaround
the office.That's a health hazard.

323
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,590
Come.Let me show you something.

324
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,620
Don't talk to melike that.You look
like a turtlewho lost its shell.

325
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,040
Mr. Rossitanohas actually been
emptying his jarsout there.

326
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,390
He's been pouring themout the window?

327
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,150
Oh, that is...

328
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,910
Beautiful.

329
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,240
Miss lemon,tgs can reach its
5% goalin one of two ways.

330
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,430
You can give upyour mini fridge,

331
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,930
or you can let Mr.
Rossitanodo his sun tea system.

332
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,160
Just keepthe door closed.

333
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,000
Absolutely not.

334
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,400
Wake up, tracy!Wake up!

335
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,080
I don't want a vasectomy,dr. Spaceman.

336
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,070
I need to goback in time.

337
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,410
Why did I sellmy delorean to Mr. T?

338
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,220
You'll be fine, tracy.

339
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,620
I didn't let leogo
through with the vasectomy.

340
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,860
If a patient's friendruns
into the operating room

341
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,970
and yells at you,you have to
stop.It's the doctor's code.

342
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,740
Jackie d,I need a baby girl!

343
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,260
Maybe one day our
kidswill play together.

344
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,930
I didn't havemy vastomy either.

345
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,930
Tracy, I wantto have children.I want
those memories,no matter what t cost.

346
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,660
And I have to pass onthis head of hair.

347
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,960
What made youchange your mind?

348
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,090
Tracy jr. Made youan acrostic.

349
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,490
Well, I hope he makes mean across
helmet so I don't get hurtplaying across!

350
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,140
Now, come on,that's
pretty solidfor a guy

351
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,300
who just cameout of an hallucination.

352
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,090
Hey, how'd everything gowith dotcom?

353
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,490
Terrible, actually.

354
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,510
Well, what're yougonna do now?

355
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,360
I give up.

356
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,270
I can't jack, jenna, or tracythis
guy out of the apartment.

357
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,250
I'm out of... Ideas.

358
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,820
I got the apartment!

359
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,480
You did? How?

360
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,550
He moved out,and now it's mine.

361
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,230
You didn't reallyanswer my question.

362
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,350
What?

363
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,800
What did you do?

364
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,710
You didn't!

365
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,670
Manhattan real estate.No rules, right?

366
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,300
You thinki'm disgusting?

367
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,260
I used the sun tea systemto
stop global warming.

368
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,220
You used it to kick a gay
copout of his apartment.

369
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,210
I have no regrets!

370
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,010
No regrets!

371
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,560
Hey, tracy.

372
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,320
Now you can tell meyour
filthy strip club story.

373
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,550
Frank, I'm gonnahave a daughter,and
I would nevertell that story.

374
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,470
It's demeaning to women.

375
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,040
Especially if they've had
theirboobies sneezed on by a tiger.

376
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,100
Good for you, sir.

377
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,710
Did you knowthat fluorescent light bulbs
last ten times longerthan regular ones?

378
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,760
Yup. And they only useone
quarter of the power.

379
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,850
But if we're gonnasolve
the climate crisis,

380
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,280
we've got to change more thanthe
light bulbs and the windows.

381
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,970
We've got to changethe
laws and the policies

382
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,570
through collective
politicalaction on a large scale.

383
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,400
You know, there's an oldafrican
proverb that I made up.

384
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,350
If you want to go quickly,go alone.

385
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,030
If you want to go far,go together.

386
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,220
We need to go far.Quickly.

387
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,860
Mr. Vice president.

388
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,390
The snack tableisn't gonna clean itself.

389
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,060
Look again, kenneth.

390
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,210
Well, that's notsuper helpful.

391
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,120
Kenneth, encourageyour
lawmakers to take action,

392
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,270
and recycle everything.

393
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,860
Including jokes.

394
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,260
I'm sorry, sir, what?

395
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,070
Quiet.

396
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,540
A whale is in trouble.I have to go.

397
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,050
Sir, I'm happy to report that
TGS reduced its carbon footprint

398
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,510
by seven percent.

399
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,940
Kenneth, I also wanna do my part.

400
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,620
You do? I may not have
children anytime soon.

401
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,630
But when I do, I want the earth here.

402
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,580
That's why I replaced my
wasteful imported flowers with

403
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,030
beautiful azaleas from my
very own 30 rock terrace.

404
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,080
Oh my They're still sprinkled with
morning due, Kenneth. Smell them.

405
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,430
Smell my flowers, Kenneth.
