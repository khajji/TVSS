00:05:34,673 --> 00:05:37,241
Well, you're healing
very nicely.

160
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:40,143
You may continue to experience
sensitivity for a few more days.

161
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,079
When can I start eating
hard cheeses again, doctor?

162
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:46,581
I've had this pamphlet
printed up.

163
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:48,816
It was expensive,
but I'm really tired

164
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:51,152
Of discussing this with you.

165
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:52,252
Huh.

166
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,821
Dr. Kaplan,
the last time I was here,

167
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,157
I think I made
a gentleman friend.

168
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,126
But because of the anesthesia,
I can't remember

169
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,226
Where or how.

170
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,527
Well, there was
another patient

171
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,629
In the recovery room with you.

172
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,466
And I remember you were
both laughing quite a bit.

173
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,033
Okay.
So, uh, who is he?

174
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,435
What does he look like?

175
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:14,206
He has some gum recession--
four pockets on 14 and 15,

176
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,509
But, overall, very good teeth,
especially for an englishman.

177
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,644
Ooh, he's english?
I've said too much.

178
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,712
I really can't tell you
anything about him--

179
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,214
You know,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

180
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:27,817
Ah, come on. I mean,
you're not really a doctor.

181
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,185
Well, if that's
how you feel,

182
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:30,587
Then you're not really
a patient.

183
00:06:30,654 --> 00:06:31,821
And people who aren't patients

184
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:34,457
Don't get toys
from the treat bucket.

185
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,558
But there's a batman in there!
Yeah.

186
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:39,294
And if you wind him up,
he swims in the bath.

187
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:40,762
Damn you, kaplan!

188
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:43,063
Who's here?

189
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:45,464
I need someone to be
outraged too.

190
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:48,765
uh... I'm here, miss Maroney.

191
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:52,266
I actually slept here because
my house keys are in my wallet.

192
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,567
It wasn't to bad.

193
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:55,268
Late at night these two little twin girls

194
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:56,269
 told me they wanted
to play with me forever.

195
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,050
Have you seen this?

196
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,552
Is that a macy's
thanksgiving day parade pun?

197
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,820
In March?

198
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:04,555
It's a rave review...

199
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:05,889
For tracy.

200
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,891
It's as if
claps-giving yay ha-rade

201
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,893
Has lost all meaning.

202
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,262
I did it.
I'm a broadway star.

203
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,764
Jenna, could you accept my tony
on my behalf?

204
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:16,332
June is a tough month for me

205
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Because
I begin lifeguarding again.

206
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:19,901
You know, renting a theater
for one night

207
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:21,269
And babbling on stage
for an hour--

208
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,303
Five hours.

209
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,805
Doesn't make you
an actor.

210
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:25,573
I don't know.
People seem to like it.

211
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,741
Well, it certainly
doesn't get you a tony award.

212
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,209
I know the tony rules,

213
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:30,844
Because I've been petitioning
for them to add a category

214
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:33,412
For living theatrically
in normal life.

215
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,080
And I know for a fact
you have to do your show

216
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:37,816
A minimum of eight times
to be eligible.

217
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:38,950
Wait.
The same show?

218
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:41,652
[laughing]
of course the same show.

219
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,188
But I can't do that.
I'm a spontaneous actor.

220
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,423
I never do
the same thing twice.

I can't do
seven more performances.

00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,367
Well, then you better think
of something else

That starts with "t"
for your little necklace.

About my mystery guy.

And?

245
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:52,344
And I now know
that he is english,

246
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:53,879
And he made me laugh.

247

That's wonderful,

Even if he does come
from a country

That's nothing more than the
dried husk america came out of.

250
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,150
So are you gonna call him?

But in exchange, I need you
to do something for me.

Okay.
I told you last night, no.

Why would you even want
to braid my hair?

00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:06,242
Well, maybe we're
just gonna have to agree

475
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,077
To disagree
on the acting process.

476
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,845
You have no process.

477
00:18:09,913 --> 00:18:11,914
Acting is the discipline
of being someone else

478
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:13,082
At all times.

479
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,383
I don't know.

480
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:16,185
When I'm acting,
I just do me,

481
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:17,753
And people seem
to love it.

482
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,188
Well, then I guess
you don't need my help.

483
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,489
Go out there
and be yourself.

484
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:25,920
Go onstage and read the damn
phone book for all I care.

485
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,887
What are you gonna do,
mr. Jordan?

486
00:18:27,954 --> 00:18:30,152
Do you think you can repeat
your performance?

487
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,818
Your performance.

488
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,622
Liz...

489
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,058
Do you work here?
Yeah.

490
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,493
Remember, at coffee,

491
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,061
You said you hadn't seen
the show,

492
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:41,229
But you'd heard bad things.

493
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,464
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?

494
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,466
I'm supposed to meet
kenneth parcell.

495
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:46,467
I found his wallet.

496
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:48,169
What?

497
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:51,705
You must be
my wallet angel.

498
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,439
No.
This is not possible.

499
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,641
But it is.

500
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,175
I knew my wallet
would turn up.

501
00:18:56,243 --> 00:18:57,677
And it did.

502
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:01,680
No, kenneth, this is wesley
from the dentist's office.

503
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:02,980
Oh, my goodness.

504
00:19:03,048 --> 00:19:05,948
This is the guy
from the dentist's office.

505
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:08,350
He found my wallet.

506
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:09,651
[chuckles, grunts]

507
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,354
I'm either very happy
right now,

508
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,255
Or I'm having
a pretty bad donkey spell.

509
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,557
[brays like a donkey]

510
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,762
I'm okay.
It'll pass.

511
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,331
This is crazy.

512
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,434
I guess we have to give it
another shot.

513
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:27,103
I guess we do.

514
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:29,072
Dinner tonight?
Perfect.

515
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,274
Do you like tex-mex?

516
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:33,610
No, I don't.

517
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:36,947
See you there.

518
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:38,582
The fcc will now investigate

519
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:40,884
This large-scale,
multimillion-dollar sale

520
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:41,918
To kabletown.

521
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:44,286
And now
the $5.6 billion question--

522
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:45,454
Who will take the reins

523
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:47,422
Of the cable giant's
new acquisition?

524
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,257
According to my sources,
the clear frontrunner--

525
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:53,060
Current g.E. Executive
jack donaghy.

526
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:55,863
The people I'm talking to
say he's the only guy out there

527
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:58,934
With the programming experience,
business savvy,

528
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:01,803
And piercing blue eyes
of a siberian husky

529
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:03,472
That the job requires.

530
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,506
[phones buzzing and ringing]

531
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:05,907
I'm told donaghy
was instrumental

532
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:07,976
In making this deal happen,
and I spoke to him earlier.

533
00:20:08,044 --> 00:20:11,613
He refused to speculate but
did say, and I'm quoting here,

534
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:14,816
"I'm going to celebrate
by buying my lady friend

535
00:20:14,884 --> 00:20:16,418
"that necklace she pointed out

536
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:19,387
And then cooking her
a western omelet."

537
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:20,555
End quote.

538
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:22,758
And then I'm gonna braid
your hair.

539
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,228
