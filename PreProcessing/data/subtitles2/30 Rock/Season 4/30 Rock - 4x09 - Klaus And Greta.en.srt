1
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:08,105
Hey, Jack.

2
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:09,273
- Did you dye your hair?
- No.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,941
No.

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,153
So how was your New Year's?

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,113
Wonderful. My dear friend,

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,885
the deep-sea explorer Bob Ballard,

7
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:19,553
Brought over a 2,000-year-old
amphora of wine

8
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,022
From a sunken Phoenician trading vessel.

9
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:29,208
The wine turned out to be quite toxic.

10
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:33,982
My guests and I spent the stroke of midnight

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,320
in my garden... vomiting.

12
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:39,321
- Oh, my god, sorry.
- Don't be.

13
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,221
The whole night... the purging, the new year,

14
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:42,923
The vivid hallucinations of Astarte...

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,489
The Phoenician goddess of sex and war...

16
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:47,360
It all wiped the slate clean.

17
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,326
So... Nancy Donovan...

18
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:51,030
What happened before
Christmas was a mistake.

19
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:54,766
She hasn't contacted me since,
so clearly she agrees it's over.

20
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,767
Well, that's healthy. A clean break.

21
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,169
Exactly. A clean break.

22
00:00:58,237 --> 00:00:59,405
So what about you, Lemon?

23
00:00:59,472 --> 00:01:01,774
Is your 2010 off to a good start?

24
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,642
Well, I spent New Year's eve with my family,

25
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,377
Which was actually very special.

26
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:06,577
My cousin Randy,

27
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:08,845
This kid from this rural coal mining town,

28
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:10,246
Came out to us.

29
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:12,181
And I think old Liz Lemon
had a little something

30
00:01:12,249 --> 00:01:13,382
To do with that.

31
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:17,520
Randy's gay, everybody! He's gay.

32
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:19,789
I think everyone knew.

33
00:01:21,593 --> 00:01:22,727
Finally!

34
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:24,295
Over the break, I forgot
what floor I worked on.

35
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:25,562
Six, Tracy.

36
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,998
Six! I knew it was a
character from Blossom,

37
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,868
But I couldn't find the Joey Russo button.

38
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,903
Hold the door!

39
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,671
You guys, I had the most amazing New Year's.

40
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,607
I met James Franco's manager.
It was like a fairy tale.

41
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:41,242
My client, James Franco,
he's actively looking

42
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,677
For a relationship with a human woman

43
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:44,646
To dispel certain unsavory rumors.

44
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:47,115
Are you available for a fake
romance with a movie star?

45
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:49,417
Does chewing on a sponge trick
your brain's hunger center?

46
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,820
Yes! Yes! A million times yes!

47
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,923
So this is some arranged
Hollywood relationship?

48
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,458
With James Franco.

49
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:58,726
Can you believe they went to me

50
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:00,995
Before Ayilla from The Real World:
Cancun?

51
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:02,263
I think it's great.

52
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,831
The exposure will do wonders
for you and TGS.

53
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,833
Lemon, I want you and
Jenna to have a meeting

54
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:08,135
With James Franco and make sure
his manager doesn't screw her.

55
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:09,337
Too late!

56
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:10,571
Wait, which way did you mean that?

57
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,274
I had a pretty amazing New Year's too.

58
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,109
My wife and I are trying for a daughter,

59
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,145
And on New Year's eve I
think I got Angie pregnant.

60
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,413
No, no, no, no.

61
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:22,182
Okay, but I was gonna describe it real good.

62

63
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,868
How was your New Year's, sir?

64
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:48,770
Perfect.

65
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:51,105
Oh, my god!

66
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:52,707
As you know, on New Year's,

67
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,742
I finally met my birth parents.

68
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:59,711
So... thank you for asking about that!

69
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,679
- I called her, Lemon.
- What?

70
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:04,982
I called Nancy on New
Year's eve at 3:42 a.m.

71
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,650
Damn that Phoenician wine!

72
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,218
And you don't remember doing it?

73
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:09,852
The last thing I remember
is going into a closet

74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,987
And switching clothes with Bob Ballard.

75
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:13,155
Look, I don't think you
actually spoke to her.

76
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:14,590
You hit pound after the number.

77
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:16,024
I think you left a message.

78
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,025
Cerie, get on her YouFace page.

79
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:18,893
- Lemon, do you mind?
- No.

80
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:21,362
One second. Okay.

81
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,699
Okay, her YouFace page
says they're on vacation.

82
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,500
They're borrowing a
friend's condo in Florida.

83
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:28,868
Oh, what have I done?

84
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,571
The woman is on vacation
with her husband as we speak,

85
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,906
Probably having beach sex,
which is the third best sex

86
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:35,908
After elevator and White House.

87
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:38,676
Is there any chance that
she hasn't heard it yet?

88
00:03:38,744 --> 00:03:40,745
As a frequent leaver of drunken messages,

89
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:42,914
I can tell you no good can come of this.

90
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:44,915
As a frequent receiver of drunk messages,

91
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:47,151
They are not cute,
even when they're from Liz.

92
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:48,151
Da da da...

93
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,319
Good lord,

94
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:50,887
I've Lemoned the situation with Nancy!

95
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:52,556
I've got to erase that message.

96
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,923
"Lemoned"? That's not a thing

97
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:55,658
People are saying now, is it?

98
00:03:55,726 --> 00:03:57,260
Cerie?

99
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:59,529
Lemoned.

100
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,164
Doing it awesome.

101
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,000
Here's the general idea, Jenna.

102
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:06,203
You and I pretend that we
met while filming a movie

103
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:07,804
Called Space Attack.

104
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,906
My title.

105
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:10,274
This movie will never be released

106
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:12,442
Because my performance will be deemed

107
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,943
"too provocative for America."

108
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,677
Oh, I wish I lived in France.

109
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:18,712
But out of this experience,

110
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,013
We found each other, et cetera, et cetera.

111
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,416
Five dates a week, one fight a month.

112
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:26,851
And because of a product
placement deal with Jamba Juice,

113
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,220
The fight will be in a Jamba Juice.

114
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:30,621
I love Jamba Juice!

115
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,357
And this is the non-disclosure agreement

116
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,492
Regarding anything you two
may learn about each other

117
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,461
During the course of the relationship.

118
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,931
Yeah, what exactly is Mr.
Franco covering up here?

119
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:44,868
i>- Liz, are you familiar with
Japanese moe relationships,

120
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,939
Where socially dysfunctional men develop

121
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:50,674
Deep emotional attachments to body pillows

122
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:52,643
With women painted on them?

123
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,211
I am not, James.

124
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,679
Neither am I, Liz!

125
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:57,814
Which is why it's so weird

126
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,283
The tabloids are running all these stories

127
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,218
Saying I'm in love with a body pillow.

128
00:05:02,286 --> 00:05:03,987
I mean, it's crazy!

129
00:05:06,858 --> 00:05:08,592
Then why is that here?

130
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:13,030
Why?

131
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,633
I mean, why is this table here?

132
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,935
I mean, why is that lamp here?

133
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,835
Kimiko is--

134
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,804
It is here like any other object.

135
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:26,908
Objects are made by men and
used for many purposes.

136
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:30,645
But we never love objects.

137
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:34,282
Where do I sign?

138
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:37,952
Hello?

139
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,289
Liz? It's Randy, Randy Lemon.

140
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:42,591
Oh, hey, Randy. What's up?

141
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,326
Well, my parents and I are
kind of fighting right now.

142
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:47,785
Because you spilled
orange soda on the couch?

143
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,820
No, because of the gay thing.

144
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:53,418
- So now I'm here in New York.
- Wait, you're in New York?

145
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,854
Yeah, I figured I'd come
stay with my cool cousin Liz.

146
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:57,989
Besides, what better place for me to be

147
00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:58,991
Now that I'm a homo?

148
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,786
Is that the one we call ourselves?

149
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:02,821
Nope. Get a cab, okay? Go to my apartment.

150
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:04,690
168 Riverside Drive.

151
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,825
Okay. Uh, actually there's a guy here

152
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:09,328
Who offered to drive me if
I helped him move a couch

153
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:10,529
Into a van.

154
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:11,830
Nope. That's a serial killer.

155
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:13,465
Just get a cab. I'll pay for it.

156
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:14,800
You have Amish here?

157
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,835
Just get in the house, Randy.

158
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:20,839
Kenneth, Jonathan,
I need one of you to help me

159
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:22,408
With a very special assignment.

160
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:25,477
I hope it's me.

161
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:27,379
But I'm honored just to
be standing here with you.

162
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,748
I'm going to drive up to Waltham,
Massachusetts,

163
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,150
Break into a woman's home,

164
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:33,318
And erase a potentially
embarrassing and destructive

165
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:34,853
Answering machine message.

166
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:37,556
The home in questions has a doggy door.

167
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,992
That will be our way in...

168
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,520
Using these hangers.

169
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:44,990
Prove that you are lithe enough
to accompany me to Waltham.

170
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:57,036
It's Kenneth!

171
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:02,207
You sicken me.

172
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:14,898
I did it!

173
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,417
Angie just called. She's pregnant.

174
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:17,785
- That's awesome.
- Congratulations.

175
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:20,421
Yes. And it gets better.
I just had a burrito!

176
00:07:20,488 --> 00:07:22,990
Well, now you just have
to hope that it's a girl.

177
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,692
I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon,

178
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,360
Because I yelled "Susan B. Anthony"

179
00:07:26,428 --> 00:07:28,629
- At the moment of conception.
- Well, that'll do it.

180
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:29,630
We're gonna name her after the place

181
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:31,332
That she was conceived.

182
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,499
It was a pretty wild night.

183
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:35,235
So we gonna name her either Virginia,

184
00:07:35,303 --> 00:07:40,474
Netjet, or bathroom at Teterboro airport.

185
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:44,545
Oh, Liz, I'm in love.

186
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:46,313
You're really not.

187
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:48,215
James and I just had
lunch at The Spotted Pig.

188
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:50,317
The paparazzi were everywhere.

189
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:52,886
The gossip blogs are calling us "James."

190
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:54,888
It's a combination of Jenna and James.

191
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:57,024
Jenna, look, I'm glad
that you're having fun,

192
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:58,659
But is this really all that you want?

193
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:01,862
I mean, you and I are
not getting any younger.

194
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,797
You don't know that thing
I sleep in isn't working.

195
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:05,966
Don't you want more than
some fake boyfriend?

196
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,167
Don't you want to be happy?

197
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:09,036
Liz, I am happy.

198
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:11,305
All this attention,
getting my picture taken,

199
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:14,074
Having ice-cold diarrhea from
drinking too much Jamba Juice...

200
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,176
It's everything I ever wanted.

201
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:33,699
Sorry, sir.

202
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,235
That happens sometimes
when I unhinge my pelvis.

203
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:46,746
Oh, I was afraid of this.

204
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:48,915
It's not an answering machine,
it's a voice mail.

205
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:50,883
Okay, well, we just need to look for clues

206
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,084
To her password.

207
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:53,920
It'll be like the Da Vinci Code.

208
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:55,888
Ehh... albino monk!

209
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,156
That's a mirror, Kenneth.

210
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:59,225
She must have written it down somewhere.

211
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,260
Try on the computer.

212
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:03,462
Okay.

213
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,931
Search...

214
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:07,099
Oops!

215
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,267
I just took my picture with
that little camera thing.

216
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,802
- Kenneth!
- All right.

217
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,506
I just need to erase that picture.

218
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,741
Whoops, I just made it the desktop image.

219
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:16,742
How did I do that?

220
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,012
Wait a minute.

221
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,682
Wait a minute!

222
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:25,084
Ah!

223
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,920
Nancy's husband has been
sleeping on the couch.

224
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,655
"emailing image to address book"?

225
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:32,825
What is wrong with me?

226
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:35,695
- Hey, Liz.
- Oh, thank god.

227
00:09:35,762 --> 00:09:37,296
Randall Lemon, where were you?

228
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:38,397
I'm sorry, I met these two guys

229
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:39,599
And they just dropped me off.

230
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,534
Well, I'm glad they brought you home, but...

231
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:42,802
That's where I'm meeting them later...

232
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:44,337
A bar called "Home Butt."
- No, you're not.

233
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:46,128
You came to New York to
see your cool cousin,

234
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:47,897
Not run around with strange gentlemen.

235
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,865
You don't have to be so protective of me.

236
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:51,901
This is New York City, Randy.

237
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,302
Liz, you know how hard it was growing up gay

238
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,037
In Methenburg, Pennsylvania?

239
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,040
The local TV station edited
Will & Grace down so much

240
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,675
that it was just called Karen.

241
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:01,210
Being in New York, this is the first time

242
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:02,678
I've ever felt like myself.

243
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:06,182
And I want to go out and enjoy it, have fun.

244
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,483
Oh, we're gonna have fun.

245
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,919
We're gonna stay here and make nachos

246
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:13,255
And see who can fall asleep the earliest.

247
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,757
Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!

248
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:17,193
This is nice.

249
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,729
Your hand feels like a pillow
that's been in the microwave.

250
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,598
Thanks.

251
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:27,269
Okay, well... I'll see you tomorrow.

252
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,505
Wait.

253
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:37,546
Oh, it's okay. You can stop.

254
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:38,747
- I was wrong.
- What?

255
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,749
I thought it was a paparazzo,

256
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:43,953
But it's just some loser
taking a picture of his kid.

257
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,355
Oh...Right. Of course.

258
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:48,757
That was fake.

259
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:51,660
Did you know "paparazzo"
is singular to "paparazzi"?

260
00:10:51,728 --> 00:10:54,430
Kimiko taught me that.

261
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,232
I'll see you at dawn so you can get caught

262
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,266
coming out of my apartment.

263
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:58,434
I'll loan you a shirt.

264
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,002
Try to look like you just got drilled.

265
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,437
You know the deal.

266
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:24,832
Sir, this computer is not
helping with our search.

267
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,502
If you type "Nancy's secrets"
into the internet,

268
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,704
Do you have any idea what comes up?

269
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,373
A store that sells wig extensions.

270
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,975
I've seen all this before, Kenneth.

271
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:36,010
The separate beds, the empty closets,

272
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,545
The brave public face.

273
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,581
This is just another Irish Catholic couple

274
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,717
Who won't admit to the world
that their marriage is over.

275
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,786
Sir, you don't know that.

276
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,954
They're on vacation together right now.

277
00:11:47,022 --> 00:11:49,791
Are they?

278
00:11:49,858 --> 00:11:53,995
Nancy Donovan, still so organized.

279
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,264
In German class, Mr. Kruger always chose her

280
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,032
To sort the students.

281
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,169
He was eventually arrested
by Israeli commandos.

282
00:12:01,236 --> 00:12:02,703
Hmm.

283
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:04,138
Look.

284
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:07,608
On the 30th she took flight 1470 to RSW.

285
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,977
He left the next day for CVG.

286
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,679
They have to be different cities.

287
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,248
Uh, Fort Myers and Cincinnati.

288
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,917
Did you not learn your
nation's airport codes

289
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:17,051
in high school?

290
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:19,520
She's at the beach house alone!

291
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:21,422
That's the most divorced
sentence I've ever heard.

292
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,514
Mr. Donaghy, this snooping has to stop.

293
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:25,549
We came here to erase... oh!

294
00:12:25,617 --> 00:12:28,185
I just took a picture of both of us.

295
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:33,324
Good morning. Is that glitter?

296
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:35,760
Oh, my god, did you go out last night

297
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,661
After I won the sleeping contest?

298
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,663
I forgot to wash my face, didn't I?

299
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,198
I meant to do it at the club,

300
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:42,533
But when I got into the bathroom,

301
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:43,901
Everything started up again.

302
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:45,369
Okay, that's it, I am taking you

303
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:47,371
To the Port Authority.

304
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:49,206
To get on a bus home, not to meet people!

305
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,709
God!

306
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:54,245
Look, you've had your fun.
You've seen New York.

307
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:57,181
You've made some really neat friends.

308
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:01,419
Maybe that's enough for a first step. Okay?

309
00:13:01,486 --> 00:13:03,954
Yeah. Okay, you're right.

310
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:05,956
But I'm not going home

311
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:11,195
Until I give my cool cousin a makeover!

312
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:12,897
i>- Is it gonna be fierce?

313
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,532
It would be if it was 2006.

314
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,269
Well, I do have this one cardigan

315
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,237
That I've been kind of afraid to wear.

316
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:21,472
Well, let's see it, girl.

317
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:26,410
I'm not going back to Methenburg!

318
00:13:26,478 --> 00:13:29,013
Randy Lemon, you open this door right now!

319
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:32,016
Okay, I do appreciate the irony

320
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,218
That I'm the one stuck in the closet now.

321
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:36,587
- Is that irony?
- Not really.

322
00:13:38,457 --> 00:13:39,782
The sun is up and we are
still in these people's home.

323
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,183
God can see us now.

324
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:47,285
We have to find that voice mail code.

325
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:50,288
It's on the dry-erase board
above the phone.

326
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,423
What?

327
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:53,358
I saw it there a few hours ago.

328
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:56,428
But I wasn't done looking around.

329
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:59,331
I'm ready to hear the message now.

330
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,066
Sir, I don't mean to swear,

331
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:04,136
But I am irritated right now.

332
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:09,107
5-5-2-8-7.

333
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:11,243
Thursday, December 30...

334
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,811
Thursday.

335
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,113
Friday, January 1st.

336
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:16,215
3:42 a.m.

337
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:17,784
Meine liebe, Gretta,

338
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,719
It's Klaus.

339
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:22,221
Remember Mr. Kruger's German class?

340
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:24,424
I took it to be with you.

341
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:27,427
Sat behind you so I could talk to you

342
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,662
And try to see the top of your underwear.

343
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,733
You were Gretta and I was Klaus--

344
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:35,034
Jack, are you coming in?

345
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:37,403
I'm on the phone! Get back in the hot tub.

346
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:40,673
Ballard, don't let them
put their tops back on.

347
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:43,009
I'm going to say good night

348
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:45,311
With help from the poet Rilke.

349
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,413
Because only German can capture

350
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,817
What seeing you again has made me feel.

351
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:52,785
Aus unendlichen sehnsuchten

352
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:57,457
Steigen endliche taten wie
schwache fontanen.

353
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:58,758
Auf wiedersehen, Gretta.

354
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:03,952
To erase, press seven. To save, press nine.

355
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,422
For more options, press four.

356
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,807
Sir, what are you doing? Erase it.

357
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,942
I don't know.

358
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,644
I thought I wanted a clean break,

359
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,512
But if that message is how I really feel,

360
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,080
Maybe she was supposed to hear it.

361
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,715
Her marriage is falling apart.

362
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:17,950
We meet again after all these years.

363
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,685
Message deleted.

364
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,854
Next message.

365
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,889
Mr. Donaghy, whatever's happening here,

366
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:27,026
It is not your place to interfere.

367
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,061
If Mrs. Dougherty wanted you in her life,

368
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,896
She would have called, given you some sign.

369
00:15:30,964 --> 00:15:34,466
But she hasn't. Let it go, sir.

370
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,734
You're right, Kenneth.

371
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,538
But you are leaving through the doggy door.

372
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,473
Yes, sir.

373
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:51,289
Hey, Liz, we're playing the
Today Show drinking game.

374
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:54,892
You do a shot every time
they give a dumb travel tip.

375
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,628
I like to take the shampoo

376
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:59,864
And put it in the little
travel-size bottles.

377
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,532
Then I take the original bottle

378
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,834
And put it back in the shower...

379
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,636
For later.
All: Yeah.

380
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,305
Great.

381
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:09,641
Liz, relationship emergency.

382
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,143
Why are you wearing a
man's shirt and no pants?

383
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:13,912
Last night, James kissed me.

384
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,170
And for a second, I forgot it was fake.

385
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:18,105
And it was incredible.

386
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:20,974
Now having lunch with James and
the actress who plays my mom

387
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:22,643
Somehow seems hollow.

388
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,478
What's wrong with me?

389
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:25,646
Jenna, what you're feeling is good.

390
00:16:25,713 --> 00:16:27,481
This thing with James is fun and exciting,

391
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:28,482
But it isn't real.

392
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,616
Deep down I think you want to be

393
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,418
With someone you really love,

394
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:33,454
And who can love you back.

395
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:35,322
More friends on the plaza this morning.

396
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,758
- Hi, guys. You celebrating?
- We're in love!

397
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:39,626
Trent's quitting the navy,
and we're going to get married

398
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:40,828
In Massachusetts.

399
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:42,763
Wow. Congratulations.

400
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,031
Oh, boy.

401
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,966
If you want to save money on the trip,

402
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:48,635
Consider taking a sandwich.

403
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:49,937
Give 'em a hand.
All: Yeah.

404
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,675
Hey, baby, you new here?

405
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:56,677
- Yeah, this is my first show.
- Uh-huh.

406
00:16:56,744 --> 00:16:59,146
And before you worked here,
were you an ass scientist?

407
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:00,214
Because your ass...

408
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:01,815
Blah, blah, blah. You get the point.

409
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:04,151
- So what's your name?
- Virginia.

410
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:06,019
Virginia?

411
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:07,621
But that's gonna be my daughter's name.

412
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,024
- Are you also someone's daughter?
- Uh, yeah.

413
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:12,993
Is every woman someone's daughter?

414
00:17:13,061 --> 00:17:15,229
- Of course.
- Uh-oh!

415
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:26,907
No... way.

416
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,578
I was wrong, sir. There is a sign.

417
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:33,313
She's been thinking about you for years!

418
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,038
Why can't you be more like Kenneth? Go on.

419
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,109
Her code... 5-5-2-8-7.

420
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:40,343
Do you know what it means?

421
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:41,378
Well, it's not a date.

422
00:17:41,445 --> 00:17:42,679
The first numbers are too high.

423
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:43,980
It's not the numbers, sir.

424
00:17:44,048 --> 00:17:46,583
It's the letters. They spell "Klaus."

425
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,552
Your name in German class.

426
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,990
The class you were in with Nancy...
In high school.

427
00:17:54,058 --> 00:17:56,326
- Back in Massachu... 
- I get it, Kenneth!

428
00:17:56,394 --> 00:17:57,527
I'm just trying to figure out my next move.

429
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:58,595
I have to play it cool.

430
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,929
You should buy a leather jacket!

431
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,198
Get Cerie in here. Not you.

432
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:06,236
Pack your stuff.

433
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:09,606
You know, I don't think this
is about you protecting me.

434
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,175
I think you have a problem with
people enjoying themselves.

435
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,843
Why did you even leave White Haven, Liz?

436
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:15,445
When was the last time
you watched the sun rise?

437
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,180
Sometimes at work...

438
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:19,115
- Or kissed a boy you just met?
- Gross.

439
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,284
Or went dancing? I'm not going home

440
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:23,353
Until I make you appreciate living here.

441
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:26,289
Tonight we are gonna do
that makeover for real.

442
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:28,057
And then I'm taking you out.

443
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,960
Yeah, okay. Fine.

444
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,262
I mean, who am I to tell Jenna

445
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:34,230
That she doesn't know how to be happy

446
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:36,466
- When I can't even figure out,,, 
- Stop. So bored.

447
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,568
Did I do that right?

448
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:43,206
Yeah. That was super bitchy.

449
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:44,741
You can't just break up with me.

450
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:46,676
I'll sue you for breach of contract!

451
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:49,579
Oh, you're being such a
non-pillow right now!

452
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,314
But don't you understand?

453
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,906
I just want something
real in my life for once.

454
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,241
I want what you have with Kimiko.

455
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,912
Oh, Kimiko-tan...

456
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,680
What am I doing, Jenna?

457
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:04,416
Pretending to be something I'm not.

458
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,585
Making myself miserable
when I've got happiness

459
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:08,787
Waiting for me at home.

460
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,456
Unless Kimiko's jealous of the ottoman.

461
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:12,858
There's nothing going on there.
That's a business relationship.

462
00:19:12,926 --> 00:19:16,095
Don't Lemon your life, James.

463
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,362
Be happy.

464
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,299
I'm the actor James Franco, damn it!

465
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,534
And I'm in love with and common-law married

466
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,838
to a Japanese body pillow!

467
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,608
And I hope you had a good New Year's.

468
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,276
Let me know the next time you
and Mark are in New York,

469
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,078
And we'll all grab dinner.

470
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:35,681
Auf wiedersehen.

471
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,291
Liz.

472
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,626
- James.
- Wow.

473
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:49,027
You look great.

474
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:50,329
Is Jenna here?

475
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,397
No, Jenna and I broke up, actually.

476
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,133
We both decided it was time to be happy.

477
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,802
Me too. I'm saying yes to life!

478
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,305
Okay.

479
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:10,516
Let's do this.

480
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:13,674
Hey, you got home late.

481
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:17,478
Yeah, I, um...

482
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:19,513
Randy, this is James Franco

483
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:22,750
And our friend Kimiko-Tan.

484
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:25,553
Hey, Randy.

485
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,021
I'm gonna go to the bus station.

486
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:30,057
I think that's for the best.

487
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:34,589
I blame you three for my unhealthy attitude

488
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:35,590
towards women!

489
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:37,392
You have created an atmosphere

490
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,260
of hostility and intolerance

491
00:20:39,328 --> 00:20:41,307
that everyone talks about all the time.

492
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,307
Griz, when is the last time you told
your fiance you loved her

493
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:48,751
since the phone call I interrupted
to make this announcement?

494
00:20:49,018 --> 00:20:52,420
Kenneth, your haircut is
disrespectful to lesbians!

495
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:56,090
Dotcom, do you ever read
books by women?

496
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:58,059
But George Eliot was a woman.

497
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,685
Enough! I've made a decision.

498
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:02,854
And starting next week, I'm adding a woman

499
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:04,188
To the entourage.

500
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,458
Really?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
