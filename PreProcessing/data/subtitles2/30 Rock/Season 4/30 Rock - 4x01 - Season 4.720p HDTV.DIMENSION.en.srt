1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,230
Hello everyone

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,930
I'm so happy to see all of you
and to welcome you to season four

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,490
which is of course the name of the restaurant
the number one asian fusion restaurant in new york

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,880
We'll be eating the number one selling food In
the rest of america.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,170
- What it is?
- All right! Cheesy blasters.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,580
?You take a hot dog Stuff it with
some jack cheese Fold it in a pizza ?

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,600
?You got cheesy blasters ?

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,360
And then all the kids
say, "thanks, meat cat."

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,200
And then meat cat flies away
on his, um, skateboard.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,930
I can't eat this. I'm a foodie.

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,410
These cheesy blasters are
here to teach us a lesson.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,690
The economy is struggling and your
parent company is struggling with it why?

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,100
Because we've lost tou with the
heartland, consumers, with the real america.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,810
Ay, that's a vonsense term
all of america is america.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,360
Like it or not, you are all part of the elite.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,340
When was the last time any of
you worked for the minimum wage?

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,990
Well, before i made it as a stand-up,
i was a bucketrummer in the subway.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
- That's not a real job.
- Oh, yeah?

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,620
Then how come i got sued
for sexual harassment at it?

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,180
Acy, you may come from humble beginnings,
but yove been rich for a long time.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,170
I think it's affecting your act.

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,500
You know how on St. Barth's people
be eating they lobster like this?

23
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,290
Don't look at me in the eyes!

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,590
Have i lost touch with my roots?

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,830
I better talk to rabbi
shmuley about this.

26
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,540
Jack, if it would help the show,
i would be willing to "go country."

27
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,440
- Really?
- "go country"?What does that mean?

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,570
It's a totally legitimate career move, Liz

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,290
the best way for a lady to get heat in
this in is to either record a country album

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,980
or have a lesbian relationship.

31
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,940
We'll start with going
country. To "tgs."

32
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,480
We'll trick those racecar-loving
wide loads into watching your lefty,

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,360
Homoerotic propaganda hour yet.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,670
You just don't like anybody, do you?

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,010
Well...

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:00,740

39
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,630
Lemon, how soon can you
start the talent search?

40
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,720
What talent search?

41
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,920
"tgs" needs to find someone who
can appeal to a broader audience.

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,320
Those two do not test
well outside the cities.

43
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh, he's burning money again.

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,810
- What about josh?
- Right, josh. I forgot about that guy.

45
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,150
You think that's a good sign?

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,110
Oh, jack, please don't make
me look for a new cast member.

47
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,520
You make these pronouncements
on a whim and then i have to--

48
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,250
Lemon, this is a financial necessity.

49
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,520
Every division of the company is
reaching out to the middle of the country.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,420
Our new mammogram machine is
called the "git 'er done 2000."

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,400
Another actor? Why? They have
so many feelings and opinions.

52
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,150
All right, fine. I'll make reservations
for us at some stand-up clubs.

53
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,550
But don't tell anyone.

54
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,840
Are you kidding me? Remember when jenna thought
that blonde intern wanted to be an actress?

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,610
I'm studying acting and singing and
someday i'm gonna be just like you.

56
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,550
I never did find her earlobe.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,660
- No one can know about this.
- Know about what?

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,120
- Pete's stealing money.
- Liz's uterus fell out.

59
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,660
I think i already knew that.

60
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,870
Thank you, kenneth.

61
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,640
Sir, i have a problem with my time card.

62
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,650
So naturally you came to me because
this company is just the two of us.

63
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,140
I received a memo saying that pages are no
longer allowed to work more than 16 hours a day.

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,280
Yes, kenneth. Thanks to comrade obama's
recession, we've had to cut overtime for pages.

65
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,230
Oh, it's not the money, sir.

66
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,250
It's just that i always
work more than 16 hours.

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,590
So i would be signing my name to a lie.

68
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,900
The parcell name is synonymous
with honesty as the hill people say,

69
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,620
"parcell, gon' say
del go up del saw say."

70
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,250
We've all had to make
sacrifices, kenneth.

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,870
I had to downsize the payroll department
to one guy and an envelope-stuffing machine.

72
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,140
Today's my birthday.

73
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,380
You can hand in an accurate time
card as soon as we can pay for it.

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,570
But trust me, we literally
have no extra money.

75
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,390
So do your part. Sign your time card.

76
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,980
"dah don say da bay ton daw."

77
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,640
Kenneth. Boop.

78
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,560
- Thank you, sir.
- Elizabeth, i have your paycheck.

79
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,650
Thank you, peter.

80
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,040
All right, we're on for
8:00 at the stand-up cellar,

81
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,090
Then we're going to nyu
to see that improv troupe.

82
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,600
Okay, i guess we leave separately and
then meet there? I hate being sneaky.

83
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,400
Luckily everybody here is dumb
and you and i are good at lying.

84
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,550
What are you two
lovebirds whispering about?

85
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,920
- Nothing.
- Uterus nothing.

86
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,350
Geez. I was just joking.

87
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,190
I blame you and dotcom.

88
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,970
You two have built a protective shell around
me like a hermit crab or a mermaid booby.

89
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,820
And now i've lost touch
with the common man.

90
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,020
Who's that?

91
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,970
This is rolly the custodian.

92
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,430
You said you wanted an ordinary
person to reconnect with.

93
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,290
Oh, hey, guy. Come on in.

94
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,040
- So, rolly, where you from?
- Brooklyn.

95
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,410
Right on, my brother.

96
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,470
My dear friend moby opened
up a tea house in park slope.

97
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,280
Does he know you?

98
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,470
- Hey, rolly, you ever lose your remote control?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,340
And then your wife start getting
all mad because the roof won't close

100
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,140
And the bed that's in the shape
of your face is getting rained on?

101
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,420
I like you, rolly.

102
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,230
Can i feel the rough skin on your hands?

103
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,830
Sorry about that.

104
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,160
What do you mean that was weird?

105
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,310
You've sheltered me too much.

106
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,930
I'm going out on the street and i
don't want nobody to follow me. Nobody!

107
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,040
Um, which one is the
elevator i'm not afraid of?

108
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,820
Right!

109
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,820
I think the machine gave
me someone else's paycheck.

110
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,940
"john francis donaghy."

111
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,540
Hey, he's got a girl's middle name too.

112
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,060
But he said sacrifice...
And no overtime.

113
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,860
So many zeros.

114
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,900
I thought you were leaving
ten minutes ago of me.

115
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,890
Oh, well, we're going two
separate places, so it's not weird.

116
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,200
No, nothing's ever weird now.

117
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,690
Oh, hey, liz. You want to share a cab?

118
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,980
I can't. I'm picking up my
nutritionist and his elderly son, so.

119
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,090
Pete, are you driving uptown?

120
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,840
Love you too! Bye!

121
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,790
Good morning, mr. Donaghy.

122
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,690
I would like to speak to you
on behalf of all the nbc pages.

123
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,160
I'll give you a new york
minute. That's seven seconds.

124
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,590
Well, sir, we pages and i feel that me
and they are not being treated fairly

125
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,460
as regards paychecking. I'm nervous.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,120
We demand that you give
us back our overtime.

127
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,430
We went over this yesterday,
kenneth. There's no money.

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,110
Sir, i accidentally saw your paycheck.

129
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,040
Well, i hope it was inspirational.

130
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,380
All those zeros. It's
downright un-american.

131
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,580
That's where you're wrong,
kenneth. It's extremely american.

132
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,540
My talents are more valuable than
yours, so i'm paid accordingly.

133
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,100
Therefore, i'm entitled to my bonus.

134
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,780
That's a bonus check? You
said there was no extra money.

135
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,940
"bonus" means "extra."

136
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,760
I know that from game shows.

137
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,530
You lied to me.

138
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,670
I didn't lie, kenneth.
I massaged the truth.

139
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,940
What do you need to move past this?

140
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,800
Well, sir, you made a liar out of
me by making me sign that time card.

141
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,600
I would like you to sign your name to a piece
of paper that says, "i'm a big ol' liar."

142
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,470
I'm not doing that.

143
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,290
Well, then we pages have no
choice but to go on strike!

144
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,270
I like you, kenneth, but you do
not want to mess with me right now.

145
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,170
I am in the middle of a raging period...

146
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,650
Of economic turmoil.

147
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:55,980
Too late, sir! Page strike!

148
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,350
I will wait.

149
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,950
Ken! How do i get out of this building?

150
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,710
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

151
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,540
- When do we want it?
- Whenever would Be convenient for you.

152
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,950
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,080
- When do we want it?
- Whenever would Be convenient for you.

154
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,410
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

155
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,590
- When do we want it?
- Whenever would Be convenient for you.

156
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,130
- What do we want?
- To get you sandwiches.

157
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,360
Lemon, how's our talent search going?

158
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,360
The worst.

159
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,250
I'm lying to everybody about something
i don't even want to be doing.

160
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,510
Pete and i keep accidentally touching
knees under those little comedy club tables.

161
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,540
What is a new cast member--
shut up! Shut up! Here it comes.

162
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,300
Good morning, y'all.

163
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,850
Well, who's this southern peach?

164
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,730
Do you know the song are
you ready for some football?

165
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,630
Do i? That's what my phone plays
whenever ray lewis calls me.

166
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,130
Well, you are going to record a rollicking
new southern rock theme for nbc sports.

167
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,940
Yee haw!

168
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,510
What sports does nbc have these days?

169
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,960
Off-season tennis. Liz, i'm
going to need jenna all day today.

170
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,610
No. Wednesday is a very
important rehearsal day.

171
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,480
- Where's kenneth?
- Picketing the building.

172
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,590
Whatever religious undergarment
kenneth wears is in a twist

173
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,430
'cause i took my bonus this year.

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,290
They lost their overtime
and you took a bonus?

175
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,790
Is someone going to answer these phones?

176
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,650
Studio 6h.

177
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,910
- Hello?
- Hello?

178
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,880
Why don't you give them some
overtime out of your giant bonus?

179
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,940
Aren't you trying to be
johnny america right now?

180
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,000
I am johnny america and
this strike ends now.

181
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,400
Hello? Is anyone there?

182
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,310
I'm in sort of a tunnel and i
see a man with a blue uniform.

183
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,410
I think he's a friend.

184
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,090
Oh, never mind. There's a door. I'm out.

185
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,350
Oh, it's sunny!

186
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,640
Hello, fellow human being.

187
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,780
Would you like to ask
me what time it is?

188
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,900
Are you a large child or a small adult?

189
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,750
You look regular. Can i get your name?

190
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,720
Is it pedro? Is it
craigford? Is it swimming?

191
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,110
Are you a pre-op
trans-centaur?

192
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,780
Excuse me, do you have
change for a $10,000 bill?

193
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,280
I would like some chicken nuggets, a
beer, and some of my wife's rice to stay.

194
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,990
Excuse me, sir. Do you want to
hold hands with a black millionaire?

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,590
Does anyone want to be my friend?

196
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,810
I'm normal!

197
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,300
Len, this page strike is an
embarrassment to the company.

198
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,930
I get it.It's like i tell my assistant,

199
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,380
"your weight is a reflection on me."

200
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,130
I can't have that apple-cheeked goon
outside screaming about my bonus.

201
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,590
What are my options?

202
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,760
Let me ask you a question, mr. Donaghy.

203
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,690
How do you kill a snake?

204
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,370
- Cut off the head.
- Of course! Thank you.

205
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,550
Now i won't be afraid
to go into my garage.

206
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,160
All right, here's how
we play this page thing.

207
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,620
I go undercover, infiltrate the union,
take this parcell guy down from the inside.

208
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,690
Very well. And you have
undercover experience?

209
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,940
They used to call me "the chameleon."

210
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,620
Because of my slender
frame and my big wet eyes.

211
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,070
Has anybody seen my wallet?

212
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,800
It's an l.l. Bean child's
wallet from the 1970s.

213
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,280
There's no money in it, but i was one
hole-punch away from a free tasty d-lite.

214
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,170
Damn it to hell! I hate my life!

215
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,790
Liz, maybe you left your wallet
in a friend's car last night.

216
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,110
Maybe.

217
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,380
And maybe i will run into that friend again
tonight and then i will get it back from her.

218
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:47,040
Yes, she will give it back to you when
he goes home and gets it from her wife.

219
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,630
What's up with you two? You've
been acting weird all week.

220
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,000
- Weird?
- You left together last night.

221
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,700
And then later, i saw you
in front of a comedy club.

222
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,020
- Oh, boy.
- Uterus, oh.

223
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,080
Are you guys doing it?

224
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,880
Yes. Yes. We are doing it.

225
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,510
That's disgusting.

226
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
So there you go. Case closed.

227
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,410
Pete and i are intercoursing each other.

228
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,050
Hi, honey.

229
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,910
Liz, i found your wallet in what
our children call, "big wed cawr."

230
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,250
- No, paula. No.
- Let me get through this.

231
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,690
If this is what pete needs...

232
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,620
I would be willing to welcome
you into our lovemaking.

233
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,530
No.
It's--no.

234
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,190
Pete, i know that i haven't been
very sexual since my mother died.

235
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,400
No! Stop! Paula, stop!
Okay, now look.We--

236
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,150
pete and i have been sneaking around because
jack is making us look for a new cast member.

237
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,230
- No!
- I hate that!

238
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,740
Lutz want to smash!

239
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,880
Yeah, but you can't
tell any of the actors.

240
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,400
Do you not see me?

241
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, dang it. I keep
forgetting about you.

242
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,390
You know what? I've
had it with this place.

243
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,690
I don't need this show because i could
get a job tomorrow in the air force.

244
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,170
I quit!

245
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,370
Oh, somebody help him
out, for god's sake.

246
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,570
You got to use your lower back.

247
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,920
That's incorrect. Lift with your legs.

248
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,580
Attention! Attention,
everyone! Strike update!

249
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,980
I am happy to report that
local 415 has joined our cause!

250
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,620
I think we should just give up.

251
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,510
"yeah, brandon's right."

252
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,040
They are a blanket union that includes mall
santas, horse whisperers, and bucket drummers.

253
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,500
Hey, dudes, i'm organizing a viral
protest on tweeter and youtubes.

254
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,260
Anyone wants to get in on that, just
write down your social security numbers.

255
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,110
I'm sorry, brandon, what show
are you assigned to again?

256
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,780
Donahue.

257
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,850
Hey, tray. How's the connecting
to the common man going?

258
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,800
It's going super great, dotcom.

259
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,830
Meet my new friends, nobody and his
wife susan walters-hyphen-nobody.

260
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,420
I'm so far from my roots, i
don't think i'll ever get back.

261
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,840
What's that sound?

262
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,330
Bucket drummers!

263
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,410
Once i'm vested, i'm out of here.

264
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,920
Who are we?

265
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,500
- Pages.
- Mall santas.

266
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,830
And what do we want?

267
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,540
- Overtime.
- Cleaner beards.

268
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,600
- Who are we?
- These! These are my people.

269
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,320
Bucket drummers, if
you're striking, so am i.

270
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,020
2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 14, 16, 18--

271
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,690
?It's tennis night in america ?

272
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,650
?Grab some buds and some brews
? ?It's gonna be a fight ?

273
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,630
Okay, i have to tell her that josh quit without
her getting wind of the "new cast member" part.

274
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,170
Well, do it now while
she's drunk on attention.

275
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,160
Or in an hour when she's just drunk.

276
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,630
Cut! Good. Let's take five.

277
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,350
You look pretty.

278
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,810
Did you hear what
happened? I am so upset.

279
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,410
Oh, no. Okay, let me explain.

280
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,030
I came in here to shoot these tennis
promos and they had blue gels on the lights.

281
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,240
You know that makes my
teeth look see-through.

282
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,360
You weren't here to do your job, liz.

283
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,190
- Okay, well, josh quit.
- Who?

284
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,030
Jack's counting on country
jenna to save the show,

285
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,310
But i just want to understand
what it is that's distracting you

286
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,940
from the one thing
you've been told to do.

287
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,980
Really? You want to know
what i've been doing?

288
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, liz. Enlighten me.

289
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,620
Jack is hiring a new cast member.

290
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,170
If it is a blonde woman,
i will kill myself!

291
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,530
Jenna maroney is great!

292
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,790
- No new cast member!
- New what?

293
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,880
If it's a blonde
woman, i'ma kill myself!

294
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,850
I don't know what to
tell you, mr. Donaghy.

295
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,670
Sympathy strikers,
celebrities, clever signs.

296
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,240
This strike is getting out of control.

297
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,020
Then step up the pressure,
len. Take parcell down.

298
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,000
I can't. The man is incorruptible.

299
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,510
He was impervious to the charms
of the nympho coed charlene larue.

300
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,060
Guide me. Tell me what to do... Nixon.

301
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,050
May i come in, kenneth?

302
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,890
Of course, sir.

303
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,960
Would you like something to eat?

304
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,860
I have some leftover
turtle meat from dinner.

305
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,080
Or as you would call
it, "bonus" turtle meat.

306
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,850
I'll just make myself a drink, if
you don't mind. Where's the bar?

307
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,140
Well, there's a bar in the shower that the
previous tenant installed to keep from slipping.

308
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,900
He still died in there though.

309
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,340
We're not so different... You and i.

310
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,370
Those glasses are for display only.

311
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,400
We both grew up poor.

312
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,530
We both put work above all else.

313
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,010
And yet when people look at you,
they see who they want to be.

314
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,290
When they look at me,
they see who they are.

315
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,470
Sir, you sound like the mall santas
when they come back from lunch.

316
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,660
You win, kenneth.

317
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,490
You have the moral high
ground. I can't change that.

318
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,250
But i can destroy you.

319
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,810
If the pages are not back at work tomorrow
morning, i am shutting down the page program...

320
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,110
- Forever.
- You wouldn't.

321
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,960
Okay, josh refuses to un-quit.
Jenna and tracy are on strike.

322
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,580
We have no actors. Now we
could rerun episode 214.

323
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,330
No, no, no. That's the one where
tracy tore up that picture of the pope.

324
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,470
In his defense, it was pope innocent the fourth
because he increased taxation in the papal states.

325
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,680
Well, where are your solutions, liz lemon?
You know, this whole thing is your fault.

326
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,030
It's not my fault.Blame jack
or kenneth or tracy or meat cat,

327
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,440
'cause i've had the cheesy
blasters for three days.

328
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,780
We have no show, liz. You better
hope that strike ends soon.

329
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,260
Why, so they can all go back
to making my life a living hell?

330
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,360
I hope they stay on strike forever!

331
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,430
Is this really our first week back?

332
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,780
Whenever would be convenient for you.

333
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,280
- Who are we?
- Pages.

334
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,590
And what do we want?

335
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,740
What are you still doing here,
kenneth? I made myself clear.

336
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,380
Well, sir, now that
i know you're a liar,

337
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,480
I was wondering if you were lying
about canceling the page program.

338
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,820
And then i thought if
there were no pages,

339
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,260
You'd have to pay somebody real money to
do our jobs and give them health insurance.

340
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,960
And if you don't even have
money to pay our overtime,

341
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,510
Then you certainly
can't afford all that.

342
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,380
What do you want?

343
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,780
You know what i want, sir.

344
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,810
"i am a big ol' liar."

345
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,070
The strike is over!

346
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,760
What did we get?

347
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,300
A piece of paper that i
can't really tell you about!

348
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:06,430
Wait. Was this strike just over a
personal thing between you and mr. Donaghy?

349
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,590
Massage it, kenneth.

350
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,450
No, it wasn't!

351
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,250

?it's tennis night in america ?

354
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,670
?grab some buds and brews
it's gonna be a fight ?

355
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,560
?so put down your meth
slip on your whites ?

356
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,660
?'cause here in real
america it's tennis night?

357
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,150
Turn it up it's the specialty of American way

358
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,470
And Barnett cup, semi final

359
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,370
*Got my lottery and my truck
not an ocean inside*

360
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,030
*So kiss my ass New York
cuz it's tennis night*

361
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,660
I hate that i kinda like that

362
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:03,160
Step into the light, Lemon
There's nothing wrong with being fun and popular
and just giving people what they want

363
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,760
Ladies and gentelmen, Jay Leno
