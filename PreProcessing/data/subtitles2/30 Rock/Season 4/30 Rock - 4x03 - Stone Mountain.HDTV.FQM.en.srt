1
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,040
Now,remind me,did you just
do the philadelphia cotillion,

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,200
or did you also debut internationally?

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,360
I'm happy to say that
I don't even get that.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,540
- How was your trip?
- Terrible.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,700
I had to give up my window
seat to some sevenyearold

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,660
who had to sit next
to her precious mommy.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,900
What about the actual
purpose of your tr?

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,870
How is the search for
the new cast member going?

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,390
Okay. I saw a few good alternative
comics in San Francisco.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,880
San Francisco?

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,230
I asked you to find an actor
from middle America,a real person.

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,410
You're not going to find him in the
people's gaypublic of drugifornia.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,720
Jeez,relax. I'm also setting
up auditions in toronto.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,530
Canada? Why not just go to iraq?

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,110
The television audience doesn't
want your elitist east coast,

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,730
alternative,intellectual,leftwing...

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,770
Jack,just say Jewish.
This is taking forever.

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,860
Stop trying to amuse yourself
and start thinking about

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,260
what makes actual human beings laugh.

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,600
Who wants...

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,170
my puddings!

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,260
Now that's what I'm talking about.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,610
What a dumb...

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,370
oh,no,he's really hurt.

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,050
Hey,tracy,did you hear?

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,250
Fred dawkins,the
incredibly overweight guy

27
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,040
that pacman was based
on died last night.

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,330
I will eat a bowl of cherries

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,780
and some ghost meat in his honor.

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,390
Orange and black decorations?

31
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,030
Is this halloween or
princeton parents' weekend?

32
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,740
I don't know whether to be
scared or proud of my cousin.

33
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,880
- It's halloween,sir.
- Proud it is.

34
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,520
But this "almost all saints' day"

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,160
isn't gonna be much of a celebration.

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,200
I just heard that
worldfamous clog dancer

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,120
jugbert cody has gone to a better place.

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,580
He's in cabo?

39
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,720
No,sir. He passed away.

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,140
But at least he died
doing what he loved...

41
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,780
blogging on the huffington post.

42
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,350
Two down,one to go.

43
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,360
What do you mean?

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,600
The rule of threes...

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,680
celebrities always
die in groups of three.

46
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,030
You better be careful,tray.

47
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah,right. That's not a real thing.

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,870
This is gonna be the scariest
princeton parents' weekend ever!

hey,I read your rewrite.

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,470
Start over,you hack!

54
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,950
Miss maroney,are you okay?

55
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,300
Oh,I'm fine.

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,210
Just reminding the writers who's boss.

57
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,410
With this new actor coming in,

58
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,720
I want to make sure I get taken care of.

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,030
I'm not gonna be pushed
aside and forgotten,

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,890
like that time at my sister's funeral.

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,460
Ma'am,I don't think bullying people

62
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,330
is the way to get them to help you.

63
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,710
This is show business.

64
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,260
Being nice gets you nowhere.

65
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,910
No. Being nice can get you everywhere.

66
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,140
Florence henderson used to bake
cookies for the brady bunch writers.

67
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,520
And,in return,they wrote
her the role of a lifetime,

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,840
as her own grandma hutchins.

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,960
I don't really remember the brady
bunch,'cause I was too young.

70
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,110
But being nice to the writers...

71
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,370
interesting idea.

72
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,790
Think about it.

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,760
Excuse me,Mr. Donaghy.

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,450
I wasn't sure if you were participating

75
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,280
in this year's pumpkincarving contest,

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,430
or,if like last year,I
should go jump up my own ass.

77
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,170
Same as last year.

78
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,790
Uh,hang on.

79
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,110
Kenneth,you're from georgia,aren't you?

80
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,360
Stone mountain,sir.

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,670
Although when the parcells
first came to America,

82
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,270
they lived in a town
called sexcriminalboat.

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,810
Do you think that's cherokee?

84
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,160
Uh,no,I mean,you're a middle
American,a Joe average.

85
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,120
You're the only one around here
who knows what ordinary people want.

86
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,100
So tell me... what makes you laugh?

87
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,150
The usual,I suppose.

88
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,750
Two hobos sharing a bean...

89
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,740
lady airline pilots.

90
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,140
I remember,growing up in stone mountain,

91
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,730
my whole family would go
down to the chuckle hut.

92
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,100
That's the local comedy club?

93
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,540
Oh,no,sir. It's a chuckle hut.

94
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,530
You see,the chuckle
is the part of the pig

95
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,830
between the tail and the anus.

96
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,040
But at night,the chuckle hut
becomes the laugh factory,

97
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,610
and that's a comedy club.

98
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,050
Lemon,cancel your trip to toronto.

99
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,720
We're going to stone mountain,georgia.

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,780
******

101
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,250
hey,Frank,what is this?

102
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,970
It's an Evite to our halloween party.

103
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,720
I don't want to do that again.

104
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,500
Remember last year?

105
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,910
Hey,I work across the street,

106
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,190
and I saw you guys are
having a halloween party.

107
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,550
Yeah,we are.

108
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,260
Could you close your blinds?

109
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,720
You're really bumming all of us out.

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,740
It's humiliating.

111
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,230
Guys,we can't give up on halloween.

112
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,700
It's a magical night where women
dress slutty and drink too much,

113
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,850
where we can hide our
bodies in bulky costumes.

114
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,930
We've got to keep trying.

115
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,930
But we suck.

116
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,830
Yes,but anything can
happen on halloween.

117
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,670
Up is down. Black is white.

118
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,920
Good is evil. And evil... becomes good.

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,390
Hey,writers. I baked you cookies.

120
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,900
Jack! You have to help me.

121
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,450
I'm gonna die any minute.

122
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,520
- What are you talking about?
- Celebrities.

123
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,240
They always die in groups of three.

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,220
Two already died,and I
might be the next to go.

125
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,370
That's ridiculous.

126
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,830
I got to go somewhere where
nothing will happen to me.

127
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,090
Can you get me on Charlie rose?

128
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,390
Tracy,you have nothing to worry about.

129
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,710
The rule of threes is a
myth that doesn't exist,

130
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,040
like going bald with dignity.

131
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,890
That said,I would prefer
if you take the next one.

132
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,780
So this all started
when their plane crashed?

133
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,900
That's lost.

134
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,430
Oh,right.

135
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,910
You know,I met j. J. Abrams once.

136
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,180
And I don't know what this means,

137
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,000
but he said the Island
is just Hurley's dream.

138
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,100
Why is jenna hanging out with us?

139
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,840
'Cause she's freaking out
about the new cast member.

140
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,530
So she's trying to suck up.

141
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,710
I don't like having her around.

142
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,770
Don't worry. We'll get rid
of her,one prank at a time.

143
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,230
There my buddies are.

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,250
Oh,wow,they painted the ceiling in here.

145
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,930
We're going to find the perfect
person for the show down here,

146
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,770
someone who represents the real America.

147
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,580
Jack,for the 80th time,

148
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,820
no part of America is more
American than any other part.

149
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,400
You are wrong.

150
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,590
Small towns are where
you see the kindness

151
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,420
and goodness and courage
of everyday americans...

152
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,010
the folks who are teaching
our kids,running our prisons,

153
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,880
growing our cigarettes...

154
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,060
people who are still living
by core American values.

155
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,360
There are plenty of core
American values in new York.

156
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,900
But there are not restaurants
called fatty fat sandwich ranch.

157
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,740
Turn here. Turn here!

158
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,880
Lemon,if this is going
to play out like lunch,

159
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,350
I suggest you crack your window now

160
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,040
and save yourself the
embarrassment in 20 minutes.

161
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,810
Now,they have hush puppies here,

162
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:17,390
which you might know better
as a knish or a beignet.

163
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,950
I know what you're trying to do,Jack.

164
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,200
You want to paint me
as this new York snob.

165
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
Can I share with you my world view?

166
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,590
I'd rather hear you
sing rocket man again.

167
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,950
All of humankind has
one thing in common...

168
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,020
the sandwich.

169
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,500
I believe that all anyone
really wants in this life

170
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,240
is to sit in peace and eat a sandwich.

171
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,750
What a surprise... your
world view is foodbased.

172
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,270
And who am I to say that
my delicious Italian sub

173
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,180
is better than its stone
mountain equivalent?

174
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,810
Which is why I will have the
carp po'boy with extra chuckle.

175
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,840
Keep refreshing.

176
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,500
Maybe Andy dick has died
in the last 20 seconds.

177
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,410
Okay,I'll keep looking.

178
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,050
No,I have to take
matters into my own hands.

179
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,670
- Hello?
- Boo!

180
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,340
Who is this?

181
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,080
Hey,Betty,it's t. J.

182
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,500
Tracy!

183
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,020
I haven't seen you since that
rappinggrandma movie we did.

184
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,560
You were so funny as
the rapping grandma.

185
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,010
So how are you feeling?

186
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,640
Any arm pain?

187
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,910
Shortness of breath?

188
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,340
Plans to investigate
corruption in russia?

189
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,150
Wait a minute.

190
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,100
Are you calling because the
pacman guy and jugbert cody died?

191
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,940
- Is this a "rule of threes" call?
- Um,no.

192
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,130
Nice try,jordan,but I am
going to be at your funeral.

193
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,060
I will bury you.

194
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,710
oh,this carp sandwich is not
agreeing with my world view.

195
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,920
Hello,there,folks.

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,940
How y'all doing on this fine october...

197
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,970
we have reservations under
donaghy and lemon,and we need keys.

198
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,530
Are y'all from new York?

199
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,860
Yes. How can you tell?

200
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,720
- New York people,always in a real big...
- hurry,yeah.

201
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,250
No,it's not because we're from new York.

202
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,960
We're all the same sandwiches.

203
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,950
You all have a beagle with you?

204
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,000
Just give us our rooms.

205
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,190
Oh,my God.

206
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,390
Tell me about the peach festival.

207
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,920
Oh,peach festival...

208
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,710
they got peach preserves,of course,

209
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,690
peach pie,peach wine,peach jerky...

210
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,670
peach butter...

211
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,740
unbelievable.

212
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,500
I have to apologize.

213
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,060
You know what they should
do with people like her?

214
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,470
They should round them all
up and put them on an Island.

215
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,030
Oh,wait,they already have.

216
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,080
It's called Manhattan.

217
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,920
Down here we call it sexcriminalboat.

218
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,950
Maybe spend some photoshop there.

219
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,430
Hey,Frank.

220
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,220
Do you know
sacha,Michael,and gay Michael?

221
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,120
Can I ask you a question?

222
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,490
Why?

223
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,760
Oh,God,it's bad enough
having jenna hang out here.

224
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,850
Now she's bringing her friends?

225
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,810
How can a dude in a midriff
top dominate me like that?

226
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,900
I like those guys.

227
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,450
I might hang out with them on halloween.

228
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,610
What? Why?

229
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,390
Have you ever been to a gay halloween?

230
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,950
It's amazing.

231
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,910
Last year my girlfriends and
I went to mario cantone's party

232
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,950
in a renovated Barn in chelsea.

233
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,490
So that's where all the
girls are on halloween...

234
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,340
at awesome gaydude parties.

235
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,700
Oh,my God,we go so crazy.

236
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,220
We kiss each other,get
into vans,black out.

237
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,030
I mean,I'm engaged,but not on halloween.

238
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,170
Stop! Stop filling jenna's
wigs with raw shrimp.

239
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,700
- Why?
- We need to pretend to be jenna's friends

240
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,560
for the next 24 hours.

241
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,330
She's our ticket to a gay halloween.

242
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,520
How come when jenna suggests
it,everybody's on board?

243
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,400
No,lutz. Jenna attracts gay guys.

244
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,940
Gay guys throw awesome
halloween parties.

245
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,360
Hot girls go to awesome
halloween parties.

246
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,980
Ergo,if we're jenna's friends...

247
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,440
we spend halloween...

248
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,460
- with hot girls.
- With gay guys...

249
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,940
hot girls.

250
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,610
God,are you doing this to me

251
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,240
'cause I took that blind guy's hot dog?

252
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,840
Who was at the door?

253
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,110
You probably know him as
"hick at the reception desk,"

254
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,070
but his name is travis hoagle,

255
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,480
and,uh,he brought you
something for your stomach.

256
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,640
What is this? "peppy bismilk"?

257
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,930
Why is everything a
little different here?

258
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,380
- I hate it!
- You hate it? You hate travis hoagle...

259
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,770
choir member,desert storm
veteran,father of three?

260
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,310
I made all that up,but you get my point.

261
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,120
Do you even care that
I am not feeling well?

262
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,950
Of course I do.

263
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,850
There,there.

264
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,560
Thank you. That's nice.

265
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,930
Well,I'd love to stay
and do this all night,

266
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,080
but one of us has to
go to the laugh factory.

267
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,870
No,I don't want you going there alone.

268
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,900
Yes,you do.

269
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,280
The people here... they're the
audience we're trying to reach.

270
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,350
I get them. I know what they want.

271
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm gonna find somebody great tonight.

272
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,450
Hey,Rick,what's the difference
between your girlfriend and your truck?

273
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,250
I don't know,pumpkin.
What is the difference?

274
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,030
Your truck don't yell at
you every time you get gas.

275
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,710
Wonderful. Bravo

276
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,670
hey... actor friend.

277
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,210
So what are we all doing
together for halloween?

278
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,330
Oh,well,sacha and the
michaels usually have a party.

279
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,760
Oh,'cause lutz and toof
and I always have a party.

280
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,670
Hang on.

281
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,210
What if we combined parties,

282
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,340
threw one big party here in the studio?

283
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,630
- Is that crazy?
- No. Let's do that.

284
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,300
Yes.

285
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,800
That gesture.

286
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,020
I like people who do that.

287
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,310
A party with them?

288
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,210
Oh,don't look at me
like I'm a football game.

289
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,120
I need those guys.

290
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
I've been using them to make sure

291
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,980
I'm taken care of when
the new actor gets here.

292
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,350
Girl,I don't even have
the energy to tell you

293
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,140
what's happening here,so read my face.

294
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,320
Oh,my God!

295
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,510
They're using me to get
invited to gay halloween

296
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,440
so they can meet hot girls.

297
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,810
In metro news,Mary Hillman is
going to gaffney for the weekend

298
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,230
and hopes that Martha or
stephanie will water her plants.

299
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,420
And now an update on...

300
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,190
very small town.

301
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,480
Morning,lemon. I
brought you a ginger ale.

302
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,780
"Schwupps ginny pale"?

303
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,250
This place is the worst.

304
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,910
Don't worry. We're leaving.

305
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,560
Our work here is done.

306
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,570
In entertainment news, local
funnymanand subshop owner Rick Wayne

307
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,610
has been hired by a catholic

308
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,730
to appear on tgs with a black fella.

309
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,370
- What?
- Hear me out.

310
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,120
We're hiring Rick Wayne and pumpkin.

311
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,570
It's a ventriloquist act.

312
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,630
Oh,I'm too sick to handle this.

313
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,950
See,you think you're not this
prejudiced,arrogant new yorker,

314
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,750
but you are,because in your mind,

315
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,040
a southern ventriloquist
act can't be funny.

316
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,860
But you know who does think it's funny?

317
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,730
These people... these
wonderful,folksy,simple...

318
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,790
stop calling them simple.

319
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,750
You know what? You're the prejudice one.

320
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,780
Sure,some of these people are simple,

321
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,250
but some of them are
smart,like matlock...

322
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,230
or wholesome,like elly mae clampett.

323
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,080
And some of them are skeevy dirt
bags like the dukes of hazzard,

324
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,880
driving around like maniacs.

325
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,700
Children use those roads.

326
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,010
My point is americans
are the same everywhere

327
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,220
in that we are all different.

328
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,240
You're wrong,lemon.

329
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,820
These people are better,purer.

330
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,070
Do you know what I did this morning?

331
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,090
I assisted in the birth of a foal.

332
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,580
They named it Jack.

333
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,230
And it was delicious.

334
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,130
I know what I'm doing here,lemon.

335
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,050
We're hiring Rick and pumpkin.

336
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,990
We're not hiring
anyone until I see them.

337
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,020
Good God,lemon,your breath.

338
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,820
When did you find time to eat a
diaper that you found on the beach?

339
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,750
Hi,I'm trying to get
to studio 6b from here.

340
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,270
I'm still finding my way around.

341
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,550
You look clean.

342
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,130
You a celebrity?

343
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,430
I have my own show on NBC.

344
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,000
No. Celebrity.

345
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,990
I was in a movie with
queen latifah once.

346
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,220
Perfect.

347
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,920
I'll show you the shortcut.

348
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,900
Okay,you're sure this is the right way?

349
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,910
Yes,queen latifah's friend.

350
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,850
I'm sure.

351
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,000
Mr. Jordan!

352
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,500
Are you trying to kill Mr.
Fallon with that hammer?

353
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,180
What the hell?

354
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,450
Is this a "rule of threes" thing?

355
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,060
Not cool,guy.

356
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,240
I'm sorry,Ken.

357
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,750
But I want to live.

358
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,000
Mr. Jordan,you're going to be fine.

359
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,910
There is no rule of threes.

360
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,520
- Iook out!
- Okay,okay,truce. Truce,okay?

361
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,630
But if some celebrity doesn't die soon,

362
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,830
I'm gonna kill my first guest tonight.

363
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,990
It's a dog who plays soccer.

364
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,320
Really? That's your first guest?

365
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,020
Yeah.

366
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,760
Pete,I'm not gonna let this happen.

367
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,160
But what can you do?

368
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,270
Well,Jack says I'm just
an obnoxious new yorker,

369
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,220
so that's what Rick Wayne
is gonna get tonight.

370
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,830
And it's gonna get ugly.

371
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,980
What are you...

372
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,550
oh,my God,you're gonna heckle him,

373
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,340
like that time I invited
you to see my cover band.

374
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,360
Yeah,and today the world is better off

375
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,530
without the Pete hornberger
Alan Parsons project project.

376
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,630
I may be dehydrated.

377
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,450
I may still be working a little chuckle

378
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,120
out of my system,but don't worry.

379
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
When I'm done,the last
thing Rick Wayne and pumpkin

380
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,140
are gonna want to do
is come to new York.

381
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,870
You guys,I am so excited.

382
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,890
I already put on my costume.

383
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,410
Get it? I'm an Italian senator.

384
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,420
Don't you love it?
It's gonna be awesome.

385
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,110
And with one word,I
can make it all go away.

386
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,310
Wait,wwhat are you talking about?

387
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,480
Oh,cut the crap.

388
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,810
You boys are just pretending to
like me to get in on gay halloween.

389
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,120
Okay. What do you want?

390
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,020
I want two good sketches a week,

391
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,210
a promise to hate the new cast member,

392
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,380
and no more making fun of me

393
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,520
when I misuse dated cultural references.

394
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,570
Okay? Are we cowabunga on this?

395
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,900
- Fine,we're... we're cowabunga.
- Good.

396
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,590
But if I wake up in any of your
apartments tomorrow morning,

397
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,580
you will buy me breakfast.

398
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,700
All right,the last pig
is in the chuckling chute.

399
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,040
And we're now the laugh factory.

400
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,600
We got a great show for y'all tonight,

401
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,780
and we're gonna get right to it

402
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,030
with stone mountain's own
Rick Wayne and pumpkin.

403
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,250
All right,you asked for it.

404
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,000
- Good evening,everyone.
- How y'all doing?

405
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,360
Hey,this your first time doing this?

406
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,470
I'm sorry,I didn't know it was filthy,

407
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,210
thinlipped hooker night
here at the laugh factory.

408
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,590
Okay. I underestimated you.

409
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,240
Knock,knock. Who's there,pumpkin?

410
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,550
A ferretfaced skank.

411
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,340
Yep,I see her too.

412
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,110
Get a job,hayseed.

413
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,260
Are you still talking?

414
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,080
You are one mouthy bitch.

415
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,630
I don't go down to where you work
and stop them from milking you.

416
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,210
I'm sorry,but that's enough,sir.

417
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,330
You're out of line.

418
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,560
I'll tell you what's out of line.

419
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,140
Your old lady's knockers.

420
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,240
Good lord,woman. I
wouldn't you with elmo's.

421
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,600
Rick,pumpkin,what are you doing?

422
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,110
A gentleman,whether he's human
or somehow more than human,

423
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,150
does not speak to a lady like that.

424
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,040
You two are wholesome and decent.

425
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,890
Oh,I get it. You think 'cause we talk
like this,we're all simple and quaint.

426
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,390
Well,I'm an amateur astronomer,and
Rick's black wife speaks French.

427
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,210
Her name's jamilla.

428
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,130
See,I told you. There's
no "real America.

429
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,790
" You shut that dog
rectum you call a mouth?

430
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,240
Yes,sir.

431
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,810
Why are you people laughing at this?

432
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,540
You're supposed to be
better,nicer,but you're terrible.

433
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,660
You're all terrible,just
like the people in new York.

434
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,980
All God's children are terrible.

435
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,920
Terrible,huh? I got a
question for you there,pal.

436
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,820
Do you ever find smaller
heads orbiting your head?

437
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,420
Is that a comment about
the size of my head?

438
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,080
I'm a tall man,and it's
proportional to my frame.

439
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,460
Your frame? What are they
building there... a super walmart?

440
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,610
You come down here and say that.

441
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,940
I can't. I got a man's arm stuck up me.

442
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,740
But you know what that's like.

443
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,860
I can't believe I bought a
fatty fat sandwich franchise!

444
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,870
Oh,God,he's murdering me. His
head is so much bigger up close!

445
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,890
The deal's off,Wayne.

446
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,100
Lemon,to the kia sorrento!
