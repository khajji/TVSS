1
00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:01,683
<i>Previously on 30 Rock...</i>

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:03,524
- So you're...
- In three weddings

3
00:00:03,591 --> 00:00:04,857
On the same day, yeah.

4
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:06,960
Fate is telling us
we're each other's

5
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:08,432
Settling soul mates.

6
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:09,867
I've been seeing someone else,

7
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:11,465
And I think I'm in love
with both of you.

8
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,833
Jack wants me to stall?

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,539
So I'm gonna marry...

10
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:20,142
Japheth.

11
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,915
And we're gonna live in...

12
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,984
Nineveh.

13
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:27,986
And I'm gonna be a...

14
00:00:28,054 --> 00:00:29,320
Prostitute.

15
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:31,189
Yes, I continued
to see other people.

16
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:33,895
One person, who apparently
you're also in love with.

17
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:36,297
<i>It's possible. Haven't you
ever read Archie comics?</i>

18
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:38,733
Jack, I got divorced.

19
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,870
I didn't know
if you would ever leave mark,

20
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:43,807
So I let myself
fall into something else.

21
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,442
You look amazing in that dress.

22
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,679
You look like a gay mortician
in that suit.

23
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,986
You know, Kenneth,
I have a thankless job.

24
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:54,721
For example,
I'm here on a Saturday

25
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:56,190
To show around
some Kabletown folks.

26
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:57,892
Chk-chk! Boom!

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,393
It's not real.

28
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:02,830
Point is, I usually only get
to deliver bad news.

29
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,031
But not today.

30
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,102
Kenneth, you are the new...

31
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,541
Junior in-charge boy
of the entire NBC page program.

32
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:14,542
Oh, my goodness!

33
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,577
This is my dream come true.

34
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:20,180
And to hear it from my best
friend in the whole world,

35
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,148
Comma, bald category.

36
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,949
Well, you start in two weeks.

37
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,351
And they'll give you some moving
money to help you get to L.A.

38
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,419
California?

39
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,154
I can't move out there

40
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:31,721
And be away from all of you.

41
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:33,857
No, thank you, sir.
I'll pass.

42
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:36,526
You can't pass.
Jack put you up for this.

43
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:38,028
If you don't want the job,
you have to talk to him.

44
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:39,964
Fine.
I will talk to him.

45
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,966
And Mr. Donaghy
will understand

46
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,702
'cause he's my best friend
in the whole world,

00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:57,749
I want to be with you.

52
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,151
I want to take naps with you.

53

I want to watch you

Who had to wear his sister's
hand-me-down corduroys.

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,141
But what are you gonna do
about it?

64
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,509
I can't share you
with another woman

65
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:23,410

00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,550
I'm a mom.
Give me a break.

00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,686

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,628
Paul?
What are you doing?

82
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,229
I thought you were going to get

83
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:19,263
Your hair done
for your friend's wedding.

84
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,332
I was, but I forgot
my bag of hair.

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,967
Is this who you're into now?

86
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:25,268
Cher?

87
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,937
You're being another woman
behind my back?

88
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:29,272
It's not what it looks like.

89
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,906
Oh, spare me your lame excuses.

90
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,508
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,

91
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,576
But when a girl dates
a straight man

92
00:03:34,644 --> 00:03:37,779
Who impersonates her on stage
for mostly gay audiences,

93
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:39,515
She has certain expectations.

94
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,917
Fidelity, Paul.

95
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:42,618
It's not just the name
of a bank that sued me.

96
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,753
But I love you both equally.

97
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,521
I don't know what to tell you.

98
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:47,723
But you have to choose.

99
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,926
It's her or me.

100
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:52,528
Jenna, babe, wait.

101
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:53,529
I'm sorry.

102
00:03:53,596 --> 00:03:57,432
That came out wrong.

103
00:04:03,638 --> 00:04:04,705
Mr. Donaghy!

104
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:06,206
- Oh, God, Kenneth!
- I need to talk to you

105
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:07,841
About an urgent
page-related matter.

106
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:08,842
God, he came out of nowhere.

107
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,244
We can talk on Monday.

108
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,479
Ms. Donovan and I have an hour
between weddings to, uh--

109
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:14,114
- Tickle each other
like teletubbies.

110
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:15,649
That's how I used to explain it
to my kids

111
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:17,451
When they walked in on us.

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,054
But I don't want
my promotion, sir.

113
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:22,656
I want to stay here in New York
with all my friends.

114
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:24,459
I'm not going
to let you say no, Kenneth.

115
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:25,727
This is a promotion for you.

116
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:26,895
And, yes, it's difficult,

117
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:28,730
But today
is about pulling triggers.

118
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:29,965
It's about making bold choices.

119
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,133
It's about--
- Two spider-mans fighting,

120
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:33,301
And sometimes
they make weird noises,

121
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,337
But they're not hurting
each other.

122
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:36,405
How often
did they walk in on you?

123
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:37,506
A lot.

124
00:04:37,574 --> 00:04:39,408
If you'll excuse me.

125
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,381
D'oh, bother!
Treble bother!

126
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:47,516
What is it?

127
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:48,750
My fancy dress slippers.

128
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:50,118
I left them in my office.

129
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:52,020
So go get them and meet me
at Cerie's wedding.

130
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,756
No.
When I was fired,

131
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:54,957
I vowed on the snipes name

132
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,859
I would never set foot
in there again.

133
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,062
Also Kevin in security
has a picture of me.

134
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:01,932
So, what, you want me
to go get your tuxedo shoes?

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,568
See?
Our minds are already one

136
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:05,770
As our bodies soon shall be.

137
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,106
There's the address.

138
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:10,041
Of course.
You work in insurance.

139
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,311
Specializing
in the transportation industry.

140
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,714
Fulfills my boyhood passion
for train accidents.

141
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,149
Fine.
I'll go get your shoes.

142
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,917
Farewell, my luscious plum.

143
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,355
- Oh, son of a--

144
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,023
- Why is your face like that?

145
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:31,962
California?
No way, Ken.

146
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,830
Look, you got
to tank this promotion.

147
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:35,832
Do a sloppy job,
and they'll leave you alone.

148
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,903
That's how I got out of doing
foreplay with Angie.

149
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,370
And my taxes.

150
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:43,372
That's not in my nature.

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,542
If you've learned anything
from me,

152
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,177
It's how to do a bad job.

153
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:49,745
Go. Honor me.

154
00:05:49,813 --> 00:05:51,013
Save yourself.

155
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:52,648
But first get me a sandwich.

156
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:56,285
Get it yourself, Chubbs.
I'm on a coffee break.

157
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:00,656

00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,077
- Jack Donaghy.
- Paul l'Astname.

164
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,178
I'm Jenna's boyfriend.

165
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,580
Oh, I've heard a lot
about you, Paul.

166
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,014
Well, it's all true.

167
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:25,116
I'm a native of Houston,
and I love to cook healthy.

168
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,085
And the female
impersonator stuff.

169
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,886
Oh, sure.
Of course.

170
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:32,824
It's actually been causing
some problems at home lately.

171
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:35,626
Do you think it's possible
to love two women at once?

172
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,395
I know it's possible.

173
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:40,798
But at some point,
you have to choose, Paul.

174
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:42,433
You can't delude yourself
with thoughts like,

175
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,371
"what if I could somehow combine
them into one perfect woman,

176
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,740
Like a s'more you could take
a shower with?"

177
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,809
But how do you know if you've
made the right decision?

178
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,578
You don't.

179
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,313
You'll always be wondering

180
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,515
What your life
would have been like

181
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,950
If you'd opened
that other door.

182
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,618
Like at a haunted house
sex party.

183
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:00,786
Exactly.

184
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,355
Thank you, Jack.

185
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:09,662
Come on, Jessup.
Get it together. No tears.

186
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:12,565
Everything all right in there?

187
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:17,304
I'm fine.
Thank you.

188
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:20,073
Here.
You need this more than I do.

189
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,942
I never put my mouth on it.

190
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,179
- Thanks.
- You look so familiar to me.

191
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:28,115
Oh, I'm a financial reporter
for CNBC.

192
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:30,518
<i>The hot box
with Avery Jessup.</i>

193
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:33,321
No. You ever do a commercial
for overshoppe.com?

194
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,689
Oh, God, I did.

195
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:37,525
Oh, that was before I got rid
of my Maryland accent.

196
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:40,961
Does the "o" have it?
"o," we do.

197
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,330
Do you "o"?
"o," no?

198
00:07:43,398 --> 00:07:45,365
Let go.
"o."

199
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,967
Ugh.
That accent's idiotic.

200
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,470
Anyway, nice to meet you,
Avery Jessup.

201
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,604
I'm Nancy.
Hi.

202
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,874
I'm not normally
this--ahem--overwhelmed.

203
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,043
I-I came here
to talk to my boyfriend

204
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,378
Or whatever he is.

205
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,047
I mean,
this whole situation--

206
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:02,750
Clamp down, Jessup!
Be a winner.

207
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:05,853
Oh, my God.

208
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:07,922
I can't drink this.

209
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,929
You wanna talk about it?

210
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:19,067
Oh, tuxedo slippers.
Give me a break.

211
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,468
Excuse me.

212
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:21,903
I'm supposed to meet you here?

213
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,337
Huh?

214
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:25,338
Are you Wesley?
I'm Carol.

215
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:26,706
I'm sorry.
What's happening now?

216
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,874
I'm supposed to meet a Wesley

217
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:28,975
About my insurance claim.

218
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:30,376
Wesley doesn't work here
anymore.

219
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,378
Are you serious?

220
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,679
I mean, I made the appointment,

221
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,580
Like, a month ago.
I rearranged my whole Saturday.

222
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,148
Are you a doorman?

223
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,818
Yeah, I'm a doorman...
To the sky.

224
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:39,852
I'm a pilot.

225
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,688
Oh, okay.

226
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,090
Well, look, it's a pretty
standard workman's comp claim.

227
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:45,692
I'm sure you could handle it.

228
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,194
I was flying at 7:00 A.M.
From Tampa to Louisville,

229
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,529
And we had
a two-hour weather delay,

230
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,431
So naturally
all the passengers got drunk.

231
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:52,932
Generally speaking,
if there's a delay

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,534
Of more than 20 minutes, I might
as well be driving a party bus.

233
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,736
It's just idiocy.

234
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:59,138
I don't know what's going on
in this country.

235
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,840
- I know. People wear flip-flops
to church.

236
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,376
And the NBA tattoo situation
is out of control.

237
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,212
Thank you. Anyway, we're about
a half hour into the flight,

238
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,913
I hear this commotion
behind me in the cabin,

239
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:11,381
So I exit the cockpit,
I go down the aisle,

240
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:12,716
And to my left, I see--

241
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,084
A terrorist?

242
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:15,786
No. I wish.
It's a drunk lady.

243
00:09:15,853 --> 00:09:17,955
She's pulled her pants off,
and she's ranting.

244
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,657
She's complaining about
the in-flight entertainment.

245
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,860
So things got
a little heated...

246
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,363
And I had to implement sky law.

247
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,898
- What's...
- Sky law.

248
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,134
It's when I put on
the "fasten seatbelt" sign,

249
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,335
And no one's allowed to move

250
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,471
Till we've had ten minutes
of silence.

251
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:32,706
I made the whole thing up.

252
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:33,974
But, you know,
people are stupid,

253
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,442
So they don't question it.

254
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,144
That is awesome.

255
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:40,214
So what is the workman's comp
part of this?

256
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:41,682
Eventually, I flipped
the drunk lady off,

257
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,217
She bit my finger.

258
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:44,719
I know.
It was totally unprofessional.

259
00:09:44,787 --> 00:09:47,355
<i>But she was bagging pretty hard
on my TGS.</i>

260
00:09:47,423 --> 00:09:48,990
<i>- What?
- TGS.</i>

261
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:51,160
It's this late-night show
on NBC.

262
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:53,562
We run it in-flight
when we're northwest-bound.

263
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,164
Basically, the greatest thing
ever on television.

264
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:58,901
I don't stand for anybody
besmirching it on my aircraft.

265
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,137
Do you believe in fate?

266
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:05,574
Wait a minute.
Are you kidding me?

267
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:06,676
<i>You write
for TGS with Tracy Jordan?</i>

268
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,344
I'm the head writer.

269
00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:09,979
I'm not
an insurance claims adjustor.

270
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:13,549
I'm just here
because my cousin...

271
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,653
Well, I mean,
it's my favorite show ever.

272
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:20,323
There's
the one fart doctor sketch

273
00:10:20,391 --> 00:10:22,291
Where this fart doctor's trying
to figure out who farted

274
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,959
In the spelling bee,
and he's like...

275
00:10:24,027 --> 00:10:25,594
"he who spelt it,
dealt it."

276
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,629
I wrote that.
I write all of the fart doctors.

277
00:10:27,697 --> 00:10:29,464
I can't believe this.

278
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,401
Would you like to go to
a rich girl's wedding with me?

279
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:35,269
I don't know.
Does that sound like more fun

280
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:37,238
Than me eating alone
at the Laguardia chili's?

281
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,741
I won't leave you, sir.

282
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:42,543
No matter what it takes.

283
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:47,046
Good afternoon,
and welcome...Not.

284
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,848
We begin our stupid tour

285
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,550
Of this once-great network

286
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,819
Outside studio 6h.

287
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,888
Uh-oh. Ring-ring.

288
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:57,558
Hmm.
What's up?

289
00:10:57,626 --> 00:11:02,096
Nothing. Just giving a dumb tour
to a bunch of uggos.

290
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,398
Let's meet up later

291
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,467
And smoke some drug cigarettes.

292
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:10,073
You're a pilot, huh?

293
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,275
I should pick your brain.

294
00:11:12,343 --> 00:11:14,678
I'm developing a daytime talk
show with Sully Sullenberger.

295
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:15,713
Yeah, I met that guy.

296
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:17,215
He's not that great.

297
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:18,650
You know what a great pilot
would have done?

298
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:20,285
Not hit the birds.

299
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,354
That's what I do every day--
not hit birds.

300
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,555
Where's my ticket
to the Grammys?

301
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,957
Hey, what took you so long
in the bathroom?

302
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:28,393
The usual ladies' room
nonsense.

303
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:29,394
Girl with boyfriend troubles.

304
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:30,629
Someone forgot tampons.

305
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:32,464
Everybody's bad
at science and math.

306
00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:34,233
You know the drill.

307
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,901
The ceremony
will be starting soon.

308
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:37,369
I'll get our table number.

309
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:39,638
You get as many drinks
as you can carry.

310
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,139
I'll see you
at the reception, Liz.

311
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:43,275
Jack.
Carol.

312
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:47,746
Get ready for some of this.

313
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:49,247
Later.

314
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:50,482
He's here with you?

315
00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:51,516
Indeed he is.

316
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,285
I see that Nancy is still here.

317
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:55,220
You're welcome.

318
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:57,589
- Smug 40-year-old bridesmaid.
What a treat for everyone.

319
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:59,958
Yes, Lemon,
I am with Nancy now.

320
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,026
What made up your mind?

321
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:02,727
Well, I decided
that any decision

322
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:04,396
Was better
than no decision at all.

323
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:05,530
Huh.
I don't know, Jack.

324
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:07,466
I used to feel that way too,
but now I know.

325
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,068
You can't force your fate.

326
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:11,069
You just have
to let it wash over you,

327
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,806
Like a spray tan that won't take
because your skin is too oily.

328
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,041
That's absurd, Lemon.

329
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,409
The world is made
by those who control

330
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:17,643
Their own destiny.

331
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:19,378
It isn't made by those
who don't do.

332
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:21,113
It's made by those who do do,

333
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,882
Which is what made me
the man I am.

334
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,251
I do do.

335
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:25,352
Yeah.

336
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,020
Grow up, Lemon.

337
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:29,423
The point is I made my choice,
and I'm not looking back.

338
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,691
Period.
Period.

339
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,267
Avery Jessup?

340
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:40,435
Son of a--

341
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:42,605
What did you do
on your tour today?

342
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,306
Those were
the Kabletown executives.

343
00:12:44,374 --> 00:12:45,541
Our new bosses.

344
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,876
Sir, I was just trying
to do a bad job

345
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:50,279
So I wouldn't have
to go to Los Angeles.

346
00:12:50,347 --> 00:12:52,415
Everyone there smiles creepily
all the time.

347
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,183
And that's sort of my thing.

348
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,351
Kenneth, you're not going

349
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:57,486
To Los Angeles.
Oh.

350
00:12:57,554 --> 00:12:59,722
Because they're making me
fire you.

351
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:02,057
You're fired.

352
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:23,409
Ready?

353
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:25,244
Here.
This is yours.

354
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,146
Oh, Nancy, I'm sorry.

355
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,381
This is
an embarrassing oversight.

356
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:30,683
Jack, this morning at church,

357
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,484
You told me all the reasons
that you loved me,

358
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:33,719
Some more graphic

359
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:35,087
Than were appropriate
for the setting.

360
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,689
Now I want you to tell me

361
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:39,191
What's so special
about this other woman.

362
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,794
Well, I like
how she's less hot than you.

363
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,995
I'm serious.

364
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,130
What can I say?

365
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,233
She's smart.
She's pretty.

366
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,469
She can tell you the Dow 40
in order of market cap.

367
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,838
She knows how
to field dress a deer.

368
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:51,939
Why do you--
- Go on.

369
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,675
Okay.

370
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:58,212
Her laugh is like music.

371
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,446
Really mean music.

372
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:00,981
And she always wears high heels

373
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,351
Because, according to her,
flat shoes are for quitters.

374
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,653
For God's sake, what can I say?

375
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,188
You'd like her.
So you weren't lying

376
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:09,589
When you said
you were in love with two women?

377
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:11,758
- No. I wasn't lying.
- Good.

378
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:13,526
Then I feel a lot better
about leaving.

379
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:15,762
- What?
- Avery's here, Jack.

380
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:20,633
And she's pregnant.

381
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,802
Oh, my God.

382
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,437
This is crazy.

383
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:25,872
Ah, it's fate.

384
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:27,406
You were supposed to be a dad.

385
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:30,110
And by the way, when I blew
your mind last night,

386
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:35,215
I was giving it about 50%.

387
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:36,950
Unhand my fiancee!

388
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:39,319
No, no, he's just a groomsman.

389
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:41,622
And a Somali pirate.
Careful.

390
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,023
You tried to end our engagement

391
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,359
With a textual transmission.

392
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:48,462
Your behavior as a fiancee

393
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,565
Has been as weak
as American tea.

394
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:52,665
There. I've said it.

395
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:55,501
Our first argument, everyone.

396
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:57,402
You're engaged?

397
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,804
What if the bachelorette party
theme was sluts?

398
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,906
No, the engagement is off.

399
00:15:01,974 --> 00:15:05,309
You keep talking about how fate
is trying to push us together.

400
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:07,846
You know what, it is.
But not to meet you.

401
00:15:07,913 --> 00:15:09,480
To meet the right man.

402
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:11,148
His name is Carol.

403
00:15:11,216 --> 00:15:13,084
Like Carroll O'Connor
from Nick at nite.

404
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,618
Exactly, Cerie.
Thank you.

405
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:17,588
Carol is the one
that I was fated to meet.

406
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:19,757
And, yeah, I've only known him
for a few hours,

407
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:20,992
And maybe this sounds crazy,

408
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,760
But I already feel
like I could spend

409
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,295
The rest of my life with him.

410
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:27,332
He's the one
that I've been waiting for.

411
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,135
And someday, when Carol sees
my disgusting foot secret,

412
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:32,937
He's gonna be okay with it.

413
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,171
I can tell.

414
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:36,140
You were wrong, Wesley.

415
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,275
We don't have to settle.

416
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:38,743
The moms were wrong.

417
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:41,079
Stupid buzz Aldrin was wrong.

418
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:43,748
So thank you
and good-bye.

419
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:47,352
Praise to the universe.
Love is real!

420
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,522
Fine.

421
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,458
It's your loss.

422
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:55,061
There's only one Wesley snipes
in this world.

423
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,896
You know there isn't.

424
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,537
How much of that did you hear?

425
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:05,105
Well, you were engaged.

426
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,206
Apparently
you hate buzz Aldrin.

427
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:07,874
Foot problem.

428
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,342
And you and I are going
to spend

429
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,543
The rest of our lives together.

430
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:12,211
I see.

431
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,813
I'm sure you could
get a cab on Houston.

432
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:17,282
Yeah, I'm gonna depart.

433
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,050
On time.

434
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:21,319
I'm a pilot.

435
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:28,392
Jack.

436
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,927

I'm trying to tell you
I want to get married.

446
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:58,019
Oh, for God's sakes, Jack.

447
00:16:58,087 --> 00:17:00,255
What do you think, you're just
gonna sweep me off my feet?

448
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:03,190
This pregnancy is two years
ahead of schedule.

449
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:04,759
I'm suing dodecacil.

450
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,728
I'm suing you.
I'm suing this baby.

451
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:08,263
You can't control everything,
Avery.

452
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,464
Sometimes it's just fate.

453
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:11,900
Ugh. Is their gay juice
in the champagne?

454
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:13,835
See.
I want you to teach our child

455
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:15,537
How to say awesome stuff
like that.

456
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:18,141
- I would be a kick-ass mom.

457
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,877
But if this is just you
trying to do the right thing--

458
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:22,612
- No. I want this.

459
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,782
I've always wanted this.

460
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:26,116
But maybe it's too hard.

461
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:28,218
The career, motherhood,

462
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,586
Keeping it tight

463
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:30,954
To stay camera-ready
for breaking news.

464
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:32,990
I mean, sure,
Soledad O'Brien does it, but--

465
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:34,891
- I wipe the floor
with that bitch.

466
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:40,263
Let's do this.

467
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,132
Love is patient.

468
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,734
Love is weird
and sometimes gross.

469
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:47,804
Love is elusive,
and you have found it.

470
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:49,139
So treasure it.

471
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:50,674
To Grizz and Feyonce.

472
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:55,680
On behalf of Grizz and Feyonce,

473
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:56,981
I'd like to thank Jack Donaghy

474
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:59,684
For letting us have
this reception here

475
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:02,220
After the other location
couldn't support the weight

476
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:04,822
Of Grizz's extended family.

477
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,197
Naturally, I blew it.

478
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,298
Now I'm alone in a dashiki.

479
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,734
I wonder what
that Somali pirate's deal is.

480
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:18,802
I could live on a boat.

481
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,871
I don't even know
where Paul went.

482
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:22,272
I guess he made his choice.

483
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:23,740
You know what?
Forget men.

484
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:24,774
We've got each other.

485
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,809
Yeah. Let's go lez.

486
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,011
No, I meant, like,
a book club or something. Jeez.

487
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,714
Right. Sisterhood.

488
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,549
That's something
we can count on.

489
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:34,017
I'll never--
is that Paul?

490
00:18:36,454 --> 00:18:38,221
- You have a lot
of taped-up balls

491
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,490
To come here dressed like that.

492
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:41,624
Oh, my God.

493
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:43,259
If this is gonna work, Jenna,

494
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,727
It can't just be all about you.

495
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:46,762
- But...
- No buts.

496
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,031
I'm the man here,
and you're gonna respect me.

497
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:53,069
Yes, shma'am.

498
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:59,042
Lemon, you know that's
a young boy's puberty dashiki.

499
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,311
Wrong, Jack. It's
a warlord's concubine dashiki.

500
00:19:01,378 --> 00:19:03,146
Avery, you're here.

501
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:04,914
I'm not surprised.
Why should I be?

502
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:06,349
And I'm pregnant.

503
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,053
Also not shocking me.
Reacting appropriately.

504
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:11,921
Lemon, I think your pilot
friend is looking for you.

505
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:17,126
So?

506
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,727
I thought he was gone forever.

507
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:20,763
I guess
I should go talk to him.

508
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,433
Carol, what are you doing here?

509
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:25,935
How did you get past security?

510
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:27,403
You walk briskly
in a pilot's uniform,

511
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,737
You can go
pretty much anywhere.

512
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:29,972
I've been upstairs
in the white house

513
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,106
While the obamas were sleeping.

514
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:33,108
I thought you had a flight.

515
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:35,309
Yeah, I do.
Those dirt bags can wait

516
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:36,444
On the runway
a couple more hours.

517
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:39,079
I hate people too.

518
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:41,281
Look, I'm 39 years old,
I'm single,

519
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,217
And lately I've been thinking
there's a reason for that.

520
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:45,318
I keep expecting people
to be perfect,

521
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:47,521
But nobody's perfect.
Yes. Exactly.

522
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:48,722
So if the worst thing about you

523
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,059
Is that you give
crazy speeches to fiances

524
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:53,394
And maybe you have
some kind of foot thing...

525
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:55,063
That was a joke.
I have medicine for it.

526
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,497
Why don't we give this a shot?

527
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:59,267
As long as you're not Jewish.
I'm totally kidding.

528
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:00,935
Yes.
Let's do this.

529
00:20:01,003 --> 00:20:04,605
And honestly, Carol,
I am a very normal person.

530
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:05,739
Not a good time, guys.

531
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,008
Liz, Cher and me,

532
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:10,043
Paul, and I want to thank you
for being a part

533
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,211
Of our lives.

534
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,681
And for encouraging us
to be like this.

535
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:15,015
I can't believe I'm meeting

536
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,151
1 1/2 Jenna Maroneys right now.

537
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:18,386
Hi. Hi, there.
Hi.

538
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:20,221
- Carol.
- Carol. That's a girl's name.

539
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:21,322
It's a family name.

540
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:23,924
Hey, everybody.

541
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:26,460
I got fired today.

542
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:30,364
You won't have Kenneth Ellen Parcell
to kick around anymore,

543
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:33,534
So I want to tell you people

544
00:20:33,602 --> 00:20:35,770
What I really think of you.

545
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,938
- Hey, this ain't the--
- No. No.

546
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:43,076
For four long years, I have
listened to you all complain

547
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:48,082
About your East coast
media elite problems,

548
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:50,017
Your apartment renovations,

549
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:54,122
<i>And your overpriced
star wars memorabilia.</i>

550
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,591
That doorman is hammered.

551
00:20:55,658 --> 00:20:56,992
I have watched you

552
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,229
Throw away better food

553
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:04,167
Than my family eats
at Christmas.

554
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:08,471
And I have loved it.

555
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:11,742
You people,
you are my best friends,

556
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,345
And I hope you get everything

557
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:17,114
You want in life.

558
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:21,185
Kenneth!

559
00:21:21,253 --> 00:21:23,653
So kiss my face!

560
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,288
That was actually really sweet.

561
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:28,058
I'll see you all in heaven!

562
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,329
Have a wonderful summer!

563
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:43,330
