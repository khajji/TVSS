1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,000
- SO WE'RE AGREED.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,160
ASSUMING NOTHING GOES WRONG
IN THE NEXT EIGHT HOURS,

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
<i>JAYDEN MICHAEL TYLER WILL BE
THE NEXT TGS CAST MEMBER.</i>

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,080
- EIGHT CITIES,
40 COMICS,

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,640
ONE SLAP FIGHT WITH
A TSA AGENT.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,120
I'M DONE.
JAYDEN'S THE ONE.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,320
[sighs]

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,160
NOW WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE
JACK THINK

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,040
THAT HIRING JAYDEN
WAS HIS DECISION.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,360
WHO ARE THE DECOYS WE WILL
BE USING FOR THE AUDITION?

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,400
- UH, MIDDLE-AGED FEMALE COMIC
WITH A BOLO TIE,

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,120
ONE-MAN BAND WHO ONLY PLAYS
HALLOWEEN MUSIC,

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,160
AND AUSTRALIA'S
JACKIE MASON.

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,520
JACK WILL HATE ALL OF THEM
AND PICK JAYDEN.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
- UGH, I HATE DOING THIS
TO PEOPLE.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,840
THEY ALL THINK THIS IS
THEIR BIG BREAK,

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,040
BUT WE'RE JUST USING THEM.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,520
- CALL IT THE HORNBERGER
SYSTEM.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,160
- YOU'VE NEVER BEEN ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS, PETE.

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,960
AUDITIONING IS HARD.
SO MUCH REJECTION.

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,520
ELIZABETH LEMON,

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,520
I AM REPRESENTED BY
SUZANNE'S B-PLUS TALENT.

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,440
MY CARPETS NEED A DEEP CLEAN.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
- NEXT!

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,080
- AND THEN YOU CALL YOUR MOM
AND TELL HER, "IT WENT GREAT,"

26
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,120
AND YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD
FEELING ABOUT THIS YEAR.

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,400
- I KNOW IT'S NO FUN,

28
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,920
BUT YOU ARE MAKING
THIS GUY'S DREAMS COME TRUE.

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,760
AT YOUR AGE,
IT'S PROBABLY THE LAST TIME

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,840
YOU'LL EVER MAKE A MAN HAPPY.

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,400
- [laughs]
THAT'S TRUE, LIZ IS OLD.

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,600
UH, WHERE ARE WE
ON THIS AUDITION?

33
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,840
- UH, WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN
TO FOUR PEOPLE

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,000
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,440
- I'M ALREADY NOT LIKING
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE.

36
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,440
IT REMINDS ME
OF BEING ON THE BUS.

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,320
- COME ON, GUYS,
THESE ARE PEOPLE UP HERE

38
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,720
WITH FEELINGS AND MOTHERS
WHO WORRY ABOUT THEM.

39
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,880
- LEMON, STOP RIGHT THERE.

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,080
YOU ARE ON TOP OF
THE PYRAMID.

41
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,240
<i>TGS IS A SMALL PYRAMID,
WHICH NEVERTHELESS</i>

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,600
WILL ONE DAY BE YOUR TOMB.

43
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,440
YOU CAN'T LET EMOTIONS
DISTRACT YOU

44
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,160
FROM MAKING DECISIONS
ABOUT THE SLAVES

45
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,640
WHO BUILT THE PYRAMID,
WHICH, AGAIN,

46
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,920
WILL ONE DAY BE YOUR TOMB.

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,640
- GEEZ.
SORRY I'M NOT A ROBOT.

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
- WE ALL ARE.
BUT WE'RE GETTING THERE.

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
IN TEN YEARS, THIS'LL ALL BE
THE SIZE OF A MICROCHIP.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,520
BUT UNTIL THEN,
YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,440
THINK LIKE A ROBOT.
BE LOGICAL AND DISPASSIONATE.

52
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,000
- ARE YOU OKAY?

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,120
- SEE, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT--HUMAN EMPATHY.

54
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,760
IT'S AS USELESS AS
THE WINTER OLYMPICS.

55
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,440
THIS FEBRUARY ON NBC.

56
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,440
[exciting jazz music]

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,560
- TRACY.

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,200
I JUST HEARD THEY'RE
CLOSING DOWN THE SET TODAY.

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,400
DO YOU THINK
IT'S FOR AUDITIONS?

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,160
- JENNIFER M,
WHY ARE YOU SO WORKED UP?

61
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,120
- BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE
A DISASTER.

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
LIKE KATRINA.
DO YOU REMEMBER KATRINA?

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,280
THAT CRAZY GIRL
FROM HAIR AND MAKE-UP?

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,080
- NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE.

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
THEY'RE GONNA HIRE
SOME SKINNY WHITE GUY.

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
HOW IS THAT A THREAT?

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,560
YOU'LL DO YOUR LADY
CHARACTERS,

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,120
AND I WILL GET ONSTAGE
AND PEOPLE WILL LAUGH

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,200
EVEN WHEN I FORGET MY,
UM, MY--LINE.

70

- LINES.
- LINES.

71

- EVERYBODY'S A THREAT,
TRACY.

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA
WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR.

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
- IT'S TRUE.

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,920
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN
IN THE AUDITION PROCESS.

75
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,160
- OH, YEAH,
I FORGOT, DOTCOM.

76
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,920
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT ACTING
BECAUSE YOU PLAYED A BIRD

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,760
IN SOME STUPID SCHOOL PLAY.

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,720
[laughs mockingly]

79
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960

- ARE THEY CLOSING THE STAGE
THIS AFTERNOON FOR AUDITIONS?

85

WHAT'S ON THAT PIECE OF PAPER?

86
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,000
- UH, MISS LEMON DID SAY,
"KEEP THIS AWAY FROM JENNA."

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,160
BUT SHE MAY HAVE MEANT
THE JENNA

88
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,760
THAT WORKS DOWNSTAIRS
AT THAT LUGGAGE STORE...

89
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:27,280
SO I'M GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU.

- THANK YOU, KENNETH.
- OH, MY, SIR.

91

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT A BAD CASE
OF THE CHEWDADDIES.

OZARK KISSES?
THE WOODSMAN'S COMPANION?

BEDBUGS. THEY'RE A BIG PROBLEM
IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.

94
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,000
- I DON'T HAVE BEDBUGS,
KENNETH, I WENT TO PRINCETON.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
- SIR, ANYONE CAN GET THEM.

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,400
BACK IN STONE MOUNTAIN,
EVEN THE MAYOR HAD BEDBUGS.

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
AND SHE WAS A HORSE.

- UH--UH, NO, BRECKMAN,

101
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
- IT'S NOT NOTHING, SIR.

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,640
MR. DONAGHY'S GOT
BLUE RIDGE QUILT TICKLERS.

OH, SORRY. BEDBUGS.

- BEDBUGS?

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,560
CAN'T THOSE LIVE IN
YOUR CLOTHES?

106
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,120
- THAT'S TRUE, MR. DONAGHY.

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,320
THE MAYOR HAD TO BURN
ALL HER PANTSUITS.

108
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,480
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
BRECKMAN.

109
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,800
I'LL SEE YOU AT THE, UH,

BUT NO, I'M SORRY,
YOU CAN'T.

121

MY REQUESTS WITH RESPECT.

- LIZ,
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

GRIZZ OR DOTCOM.

TO GET IT.

WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT TRICK?

131
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,960
YOU DON'T THINK
I'VE BEEN BROUGHT IN

132
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
ON A MILLION AUDITIONS
JUST TO MAKE KIM CATTRALL

133
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,360
SEEM GROUNDED AND HUMAN?

134

- YES, FINE, WE'RE STACKING
THE DECK FOR JAYDEN.

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
LET ME GUESS WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS WITH HIM.

136
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,240
HE'S A TALENTED ACTOR
AND YOU'RE THREATENED BY THAT.

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,800
- NO, I KNOW HIM, LIZ.

138
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,760
WE DID A PLAY TOGETHER
20 YEARS AGO,

139
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,240
AND WE WERE BEST FRIENDS.

140
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,200
UNTIL HE BETRAYED ME.

141
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,040
- HEY, JENNA, CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR NOMINATION.

142
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,200
FOR WORST SUPPORTING BRA!

[laughter]

144
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
- WHAT PLAY IS THAT?

145
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,760
- I WILL NOT ALLOW THIS
TO HAPPEN.

146
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
- UGH.

147
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,120
THIS PROCESS IS PAINFUL ENOUGH
WITHOUT ADDING YOUR CRAZY TO IT.

148
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,240
- TOO LATE.

149
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,960
I'M GETTING THAT HOT FEELING
IN MY HEAD.

150
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,720
- [sighs]

151
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,120
- HEY, MOM, IT'S WALTER.

152
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
I'M JUST CALLING TO TELL YOU
THEY CANCELLED THE AUDITION,

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,760
SO MAYBE PRAY
ON SOMETHING ELSE.

154
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,760
- YOU CAN AUDITION.
- I'LL NEED A PIANO.

00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,778
- WHAT IS THIS?

157
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,338
- IT'S CISCO EQUIPMENT, SIR.

158
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,338
IT'S ALMOST BETTER THAN
BEING THERE.

159
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:03,218
- IS THIS BECAUSE OF
MY BEDBUGS?

160
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:05,018
I WILL NOT BE OSTRACIZED
LIKE THIS.

161
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:07,258
- JACK, BEDBUGS HAVE BECOME
AN EPIDEMIC IN NEW YORK.

162
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:11,058
I JUST THINK THAT EVERYONE
WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE

163
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:12,258
IF YOU STAYED
IN YOUR OFFICE.

164
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:14,658
YOU LIKE
THE CISCO EQUIPMENT?

165
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:16,298
- OF COURSE, IT CONTINUES
TO BE THE GOLD STANDARD

166
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:18,418
BY WHICH ALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY
IS JUDGED.

167
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:21,058
CISCO, THE HUMAN NETWORK.

168
00:06:21,058 --> 00:06:22,258
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

169
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,818
WHEN YOU LIVE NORTH
OF 62ND STREET.

170
00:06:23,818 --> 00:06:25,018
- YOU THINK I DIDN'T
HEAR THAT?

171
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,338
I CAN HEAR YOUR HAIR GROWING
ON THIS THING.

172
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:28,498
YOU ARE DISCRIMINATING
AGAINST ME.

173
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:31,098
I AM A HUMAN BEING.

174
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:32,378
DID YOU JUST MUTE ME?

175
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,698
DID YOU JUST USE CISCO'S
CUTTING EDGE

176
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,258
SUREMUTE TECHNOLOGY
TO MUTE ME?

177
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:38,138
- BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE
A UNITED FRONT.

178
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:40,338
BART SAID THAT IF WE GO IN THERE
WITH THE NUMBERS ALL SET--

179
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:42,338
- I'M GONNA COME TO YOUR HOUSE
AND CRAWL INTO YOUR BED

180
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,258
AND I'M GONNA BITE YOU
ON THE ASS, DO YOU HEAR ME?

181
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:45,938
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
DOTCOM'S AUDITIONING?

182
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,098
HOW DUMB ARE YOU?
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE?

183
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:49,218
- PETE, STOP IT.

184
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:50,658
YOU KNOW MY FONTANELLE
NEVER CLOSED.

185
00:06:50,658 --> 00:06:54,258
I TRIED TO BE STRONG,
BUT I JUST COULDN'T TELL HIM NO.

186
00:06:54,258 --> 00:06:55,778
AND NOW I DON'T HAVE TO,
SEE,

187
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:57,418
BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING IT
JACK'S DECISION.

188
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,818
- OH, WE WERE,

189
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,738
BUT NOW YOU'VE COMPROMISED
THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM.

190
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,418
IT'S FOUR PEOPLE FOR A REASON.

191
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:03,618
THE FIRST GUY JACK'S
SETTLING IN,

192
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:06,178
THE SECOND HE HATES,
THE THIRD IS JAYDEN,

193
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:08,378
THE FOURTH PROVES
HOW GOOD JAYDEN IS.

194
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:10,378
THE MORE PEOPLE YOU ADD,
THE LESS EFFECTIVE IT IS.

195
00:07:10,378 --> 00:07:12,098
LIKE A NEIGHBORHOOD DAD
GARAGE BAND.

196
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,738
- COME ON, IT'S JUST DOTCOM.

197
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:16,898
- IT WON'T BE, BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

198
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:18,338
- I'M DRIVING A BUS?

199
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,218
- NO, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE OPENING THE FLOODGATES.

200
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:22,538
- WITH A HORIZONTAL WHEEL?

201
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,218
- FLOODGATE WHEELS
ARE HORIZONTAL!

202
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:25,618
IT WAS ALL UNDER CONTROL.

203
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:29,298
NOW EVERYONE'S GONNA WANT IN
AND WE CAN'T STOP THEM.

204
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,618
- HEY, WHAT THE FRAK, NERDS?

205
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,298
PETE TOLD ME YOU WERE ONLY
LOOKING AT OUTSIDE PEOPLE.

206
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:35,338
NOW DOTCOM'S AUDITIONING?

207
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:37,258
- FRANK, I KNOW
YOU'RE A STAND-UP, BUT--

208
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:38,778
- NO "BUT."
I WANT IN.

209
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:41,618
AND I'M NOT CHANGING MY ACT
TO FIT YOUR STUPID SHOW.

210
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:44,218
- MM-HMM.

211
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:46,538
- LIZ, THERE YOU ARE.

212
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:48,378
- I HEARD ABOUT THIS WHOLE
DOTCOM THING.

213
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:50,738
I'M NOT SAYING
I WANT TO AUDITION,

214
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:54,538
BUT NICKY MOTORULO

OH, HE'S EVIL "COMMA" TRACY.

- PETE AND LIZ ARE RIGGING IT
TO MAKE SURE HE GETS THE JOB.

226
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,218
DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
THEY'RE AUDITIONING?

227
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:21,018
A ONE-MAN BAND.

228
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:23,138
SOME OLD AUSTRALIAN,

AT THE WESLEYAN ARTSPACE.

232
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,378
THAT GUY IS GOOD.
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH HIM.

233
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,618
- OKAY.

234
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:35,178
THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
NEITHER ONE OF THEM GETS THE JOB

235
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:36,978
BY FINDING BETTER ACTORS
OURSELVES.

236
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:50,818

THIS BEDBUG SITUATION FIXED,

THEY DON'T WANT YOU USING
YOUR COMPANY CAR.

WHAT IS KATHY GEISS DOING HERE?

311
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:22,298
I'VE JUST GOT THE ONE PAIR,
AND I SLEEP IN THEM.

312
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:24,538
- I FELL TO THE BOTTOM OF
THE PYRAMID TODAY.

313
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:26,538
CAST OUT OF SOCIETY
LIKE A LEPER.

314
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,058
NO ONE WILL LOOK AT ME,
LET ALONE TOUCH ME.

315
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,658
BUT YOU WILL, WON'T YOU?

316
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:31,458
MAKE ME FEEL HUMAN AGAIN.

317
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:35,898
EMBRACE ME, KENNETH.

318
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:37,978
- I'VE GOT A THING.

319
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:49,778
<i>- ET TU, KENNETH?</i>

320
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,378
- IT'S JUST A MATH EQUATION,
THAT'S ALL.

321
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,978
JUST, OKAY--YOU PUT TWO WOMEN
IN A ROW LIKE--

322
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,378
WHO THE HELL ARE THEY?

323
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:57,298
- THESE ARE SOME ACTORS
WE FOUND

324
00:12:57,298 --> 00:12:59,378
DRIVING ALL OVER
THIS AMAZING VIBRANT CITY.

325
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,058
- AND THIS IS
A REIMBURSEMENT FORM FOR MY GAS.

326
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:04,351
I DROVE A MILLION MILES.

327
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,084
- LOOK.

328
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:12,644
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DRAGGED
THIS IDIOT IN

329
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:13,644
ON YOUR PARANOIA--

330
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:15,044
- PARANOIA? WHERE?

331
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,164
- UGH!

332
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:18,244
YOU ARE NOT TAKING AWAY
THE ONE GOOD THING

333
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,644
THAT I GET OUT OF
THIS MISERABLE PROCESS.

334
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:22,844
- IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
HIRING JAYDEN, YOU'RE INSANE.

335
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,524
JUST CALL ANYONE
HE'S EVER WORKED WITH.

336
00:13:24,524 --> 00:13:25,644
- I DID.

337
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:27,484
I CALLED EVERY ONE
OF HIS REFERENCES,

338
00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:28,684
AND THEY ARE IMPRESSIVE.

339
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,924
A COMMERCIAL WITH
MARTIN SCORSESE,

340
00:13:30,924 --> 00:13:33,484
AN OFF-BROADWAY PLAY
WITH CHRISTOPHER WALKEN.

341
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:36,004
HE'S EVEN STUDYING
THE MEISNER TECHNIQUE

342
00:13:36,004 --> 00:13:37,604
WITH SIR GILBERT GOTTFRIED.

343
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:40,364
AND THEY ALL SAID
THE SAME THING.

344
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:42,204
Scorsese: ALL RIGHT, LET ME
TELL YOU ONE THING ABOUT JAYDEN.

345
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:45,684
I LOVE JAYDEN.

346
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:48,444
Walken: I LOVE JAYDEN.

347
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:50,444
Gottfried: I LOVE JAYDEN!

348
00:13:50,444 --> 00:13:52,604
- WAS DESCRIBING
YOUR SANDWICH NECESSARY

349
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:54,484
TO OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT HAPPENED?

350
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:57,444
- NONE OF YOUR ACTORS
ARE AUDITIONING.

351
00:13:57,444 --> 00:13:58,884
THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM
WILL PREVAIL.

352
00:13:58,884 --> 00:14:00,244
- THINK AGAIN, LIZ.

353
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,644
THE HORNBERGER SYSTEM
WILL DE-VAIL.

354
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:03,444
IS THAT THE OPPOSITE
OF PREVAIL?

355
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:06,764
- [sighs]

356
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:09,124
- I HOPED IT WOULDN'T
COME TO THIS.

357
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:11,524
BUT NOW I HAVE TO RUIN JAYDEN
PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

358
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:12,884
- TELL ME MORE.

359
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,084
- I'M GONNA WALK UP TO HIM

360
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,364
AND SAY THE FOUR
MOST VICIOUS WORDS

361
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,084
YOU CAN SAY TO A PERSON
YOU'VE ALREADY MET.

362
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:18,924
"NICE TO MEET YOU."

363
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,684
- AND THAT FREAKS PEOPLE OUT,
HUH?

364
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:26,364
THIS IS A LEARNING
AND FRIENDSHIP ADVENTURE.

365
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,964
- LEMON, ARE YOU READY
TO GET STARTED?

366
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:29,324
- YES, I JUST NEED ONE MINUTE

367
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:31,004
TO SEND SOME OF
THESE PEOPLE HOME.

368
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,364
- REALLY?

369
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:33,804
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO KICK
ALL OF THEM TO THE CURB

370
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,284
LIKE SO MUCH HUMAN GARBAGE?

371
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:38,124
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO COLD
AND DISPASSIONATE?

372
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,164
- WHAT?
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO.

373
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:41,644
- AND YOU JUST BLINDLY DO
WHATEVER I SAY?

374
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:42,844
WHAT ARE YOU, A ROBOT?

375
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:45,644
- YOU ALSO TOLD ME
TO BE A ROBOT.

376
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:46,644
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

377
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:48,644
- I HAVE BEDBUGS.

378
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:50,684
AND THESE BEDBUGS HAVE CHEWED
THE BLINDERS OFF MY EYES.

379
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:53,044
THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE, LEMON.
WITH FEELINGS.

380
00:14:53,044 --> 00:14:54,484
- GRR!

381
00:14:54,484 --> 00:14:56,524
- AND THEY ALL GET A CHANCE.
THEY ALL GET TO AUDITION.

382
00:14:56,524 --> 00:15:01,044
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO AUDITION,
JUST GIVE YOUR NAME TO PETE.

383
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:03,404
- ANTHONY DECICCO.

384
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:07,644
I'LL NEED AN OBAMA WIG.

385
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:10,564
FRANK ROSSITANO.
QUEENS, NEW YORK.

386
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:14,084
I GUESS DREAMS
CAN COME TRUE.

387
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:16,404
SO LAST WEEKEND,
I WAS AT THE MALL,

388
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:18,484
BUT THEN I WENT
TO THE BEACH [bleep]

389
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,724
WITH MY NIECE'S FRIEND

390
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:22,924
AND THEN I [bleep] AT
THE POOL PARTY.

391
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:25,524
- MM-HMM.

392
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,724
MM.

393
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:30,204
- FOR MY FIRST CHARACTER,
I'D LIKE TO DO AN OLD JANITOR

394
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:36,084
WHO'S FINALLY HAD ENOUGH
AND STABS EVERYBODY!

395
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,964
- HELLO, I'M JENNA MARONEY.

396
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:39,324
- OH, HI, I'M JAYDEN,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

397
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:42,044
- HOW DARE YOU PRETEND
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME!

398
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:43,604
I'M THE ONE WHO DOESN'T
REMEMBER YOU!

399
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:47,924
<i>- JOSH GERARD.
FORMER TGS CAST MEMBER.</i>

400
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:50,644
THEN SOME MOVIE WORK.
THAT DIDN'T PAN OUT.

401
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:53,244
THEN MY AGENT DROPPED ME.
THEN A WEB SHORT.

402
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,404
WHERE THEY MADE ME
DO GUY-GUY STUFF.

403
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:59,364
OH, GOD, FORGIVE ME!

404
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:01,004
I CALL THIS CHARACTER
SMELLY BELLY.

405
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:04,524
- GOOD EVENING, WE ARE
LAUGH OF THE MOHICANS.

406
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,324
OUR FIRST BIT IS
THE HAMBURGLAR--

407
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:07,724
- NO!

408
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:09,844
- TOOFER AND LUTZ DIDN'T TELL ME
THEY WERE GONNA GO TOGETHER.

409
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,724
THIS THROWS OFF
THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

410
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:15,044
I GOTTA FIND ONE MORE.

411
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:20,444
- HEY, DOTCOM.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

412
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:21,684
- WHY WOULD HE
SAY THAT TO ME?

413
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:23,484
- HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED
WHAT HAPPENS

414
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,644
IN THE REFRIGERATOR
AFTER THE LIGHT GOES OFF?

415
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:26,804
DOES THE MILK SAY,

416
00:16:26,804 --> 00:16:28,004
"LET'S GO DOWN TO
THE CRISPER DRAWER

417
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:29,204
AND MAKE TROUBLE"?

418
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:34,524
I DON'T KNOW.
FUHGEDDABOUTIT.

419
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:37,604
- YOU WANNA BE ON A TV SHOW?

420
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:39,604
COME ON.

421
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,724
COME ON, COME ON.

422
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:44,644
- GROWING UP IN BED-STUY,
THERE WAS A CERTAIN MUSIC

423
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:46,644
TO THE WAY PEOPLE TALKED.

424
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:48,204
"HEY, PAPI

425
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,604
WHATCHOO DOIN'?"

426
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:52,644
I'M SORRY,
CAN I START OVER?

427
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,924
SOMEONE REALLY MESSED WITH
MY HEAD RIGHT BEFORE I CAME ON.

428
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:58,164
- I DREAMED THAT LOVE 

429
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:02,684
WOULD NEVER DIE 

430
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,004
I DREAMED THAT GOD 

431
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:07,124
WOULD BE FORGIVING 

432
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:14,364
- [mechanical sounds]

433
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:17,644
- OKAY. HERE WE GO.
YOU CAN DO IT.

434
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:18,844
- HI, I'M JAYDEN MICHAEL TYLER.

435
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:20,604
MY FIRST PIECE WILL BE
A DINNER PARTY

436
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:22,604
AT MARTIN SCORSESE'S HOUSE
WITH CHRISTOPHER WALKEN

437
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,564
AND GILBERT GOTTFRIED.
- WHAT?

438
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:27,284
- [as Christopher Walken]
THANK YOU FOR INVITING US,

439
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:29,324
MARTIN.

440
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,524
- [as Gilbert Gottfried]
I BROUGHT WINE!

441
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:34,004
- [wheezing laughter]
- SON OF A BITCH.

442
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:37,484
I WAS TALKING TO YOU
ON THE PHONE, WASN'T I?

443
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:38,684
- WHAT?

444
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,804
- [poorly impersonating Walken]
GIVE...IT UP.

445
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:43,644
I FIGURED OUT...
YOUR GAME.

446
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:45,924
- CONGRATULATIONS.

447
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:48,484
YOUR SHOW IS SO STUPID,
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE TOO.

448
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,644
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I WENT THROUGH
ALL OF THIS FOR YOU.

449
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:51,764
I FOUGHT FOR YOU, JAYDEN,

450
00:17:51,764 --> 00:17:53,644
AND NOW I'M GONNA HAVE
TO START ALL OVER.

451
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:54,644
- NO, YOU DON'T.

452
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:57,004
YOU'RE GIVING ME THE JOB
NO MATTER WHAT.

453
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:59,884
BECAUSE YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER MY CAMERA.

454
00:17:59,884 --> 00:18:01,164
- SO?

455
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,604
- SO?

456
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,484
YOU SAID YOU'D ONLY HIRE ME

457
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,604
IF I LET YOU TAKE PICTURES
OF MY GENITALS.

458
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:08,524
- OH, NO!

459
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:09,964
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM?

460
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,644
JENNA WAS RIGHT.
YOU'RE TOTALLY CRAZY.

461
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:16,604
- WOULD A CRAZY PERSON
LAUGH LIKE THIS?

462
00:18:16,604 --> 00:18:21,004
[maniacal laughter]

463
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:26,644
- [mechanical sounds]

464
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:28,964
- YOU CAN USE THE REGULAR
ELEVATORS AROUND THE CORNER.

465
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:30,844
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S HUMAN HERE.

466
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,244
- [despondent intonation]

467
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,004
- WELL SAID.

468
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,244
- JENNA, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S CRAZY.

469
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,444
WE CAN'T HIRE HIM.

470
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,524
- WHO, BRIAN WILLIAMS?
- NO, JAYDEN.

471
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,564
I'M SORRY I DOUBTED YOU.

472
00:18:41,564 --> 00:18:42,764
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'VE
NEVER BEEN RIGHT BEFORE.

473
00:18:42,764 --> 00:18:44,684
ABOUT ANYTHING.

474
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,924
- I KNOW.

475
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,644
- I GOTTA FIND JACK.

476
00:18:48,644 --> 00:18:50,524
TELL HIM WE DIDN'T FIND ANYONE
AND WE HAVE TO START OVER.

477
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:57,044
- MY TWO CENTS?
I LIKED THE JANITOR.

478
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:59,884
- I'D NEVER BEEN TO
AN AUDITION BEFORE.

479
00:18:59,884 --> 00:19:01,124
IT WAS UPSETTING.

480
00:19:01,124 --> 00:19:03,764
A GROTESQUE CARNIVAL
OF HUMAN MISERY.

481
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,444
- TO BE FAIR,
I DID NOT THINK KATHY GEISS

482
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,564
WAS GONNA FINISH HER SONG
BY TAKING OFF HER UNDERPANTS.

483
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,564
- HOWEVER, THE PROCESS
WAS A PLEASANT REMINDER

484
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:12,284
THAT SOME OF US ARE,
IN FACT, BETTER THAN OTHERS.

485
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,564
THERE WAS ONE CLEAR STANDOUT
IN MY OPINION.

486
00:19:14,564 --> 00:19:15,764
- NO, I KNOW.

487
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,124
HE WAS MY FAVORITE TOO,
BUT WE CAN'T.

488
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:19,644
HE'S CRAZY.
WE HAVE TO START OVER.

489
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:21,124
- ALL ACTORS
ARE CRAZY, LEMON,

490
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:23,164
AND THE MORE TALENTED THEY ARE,
THE CRAZIER THEY ARE.

491
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:24,484
I MEAN,
LOOK AT JENNA AND TRACY.

492
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:26,564
THEY HANDED IN
A CHECK REQUEST FORM

493
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:30,684
FOR $600,000 WORTH OF GAS.

494
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:32,644
YOUR JOB IS TO MANAGE THE CRAZY
AND BRING OUT THE TALENT.

495
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:35,564
- CRAZY IS ONE THING,
HE'S A PSYCHOPATH.

496
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:36,644
- YOU'RE WRONG.
HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

497
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,084
AND THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

498
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,484
WE'RE HIRING THE ROBOT.

499
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:44,404
- THE ROBOT...
IS THE GUY THAT YOU LIKE.

500
00:19:44,404 --> 00:19:48,484
AND YOU THINK HE'S THE BEST...
BECAUSE?

501
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:50,004
- BECAUSE HE WAS
THE ONLY ONE OF THEM,

502
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:52,524
THE ONLY PERSON IN NEW YORK
THAT WOULD SHAKE THE HAND

503
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,084
OF A MAN WITH BEDBUGS.

504
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:56,684
LEMON, WE'RE NOT JUST HIRING
AN ACTOR.

505
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:59,484
WE'RE HIRING A COWORKER,
A HUMAN BEING,

506
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:00,644
AND I SAY WE HIRE THE ONE

507
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:03,204
WHO LIVES BY THE CODE
OF THE ROBOT.

508
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:07,524
CARE. LOVE. LIVE.

509
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,244
- OKAY.

510
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:12,004
SO INSTEAD OF STARTING
FROM SCRATCH,

511
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,004
WE ARE HIRING THE ROBOT.

512
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:21,484
ON THE SHOW.
TO ACT.

513
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:24,644
BOY, I HOPE
HE SPEAKS ENGLISH.

514
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:27,206
YIKES.

515
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,399
- THIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE,
LORD 

516
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,159
all: I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE 

517
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,639
WHOA, THIS LITTLE LIGHT
OF MINE, LORD 

518
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:38,119
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE 

519
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,599
THIS LITTLE LIGHT
OF MINE, LORD 

520
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,519
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE 

521
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,119
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY 

522
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,279
LET IT SHINE 

523
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,919
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY 

524
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:52,279
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE 

525
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,839
OH, EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY 

526
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,199
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE 

527
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,679
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY 

528
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,719
I'M GONNA LET IT SHINE 

529
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,319
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY 

530
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:09,839
LET IT SHINE

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
