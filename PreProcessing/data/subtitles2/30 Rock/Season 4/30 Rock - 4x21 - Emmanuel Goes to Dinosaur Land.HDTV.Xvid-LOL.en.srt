1
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:05,326
Jack.
Got a minute?

2
00:00:05,394 --> 00:00:06,665
Avery, of course.

3
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:07,766
Are you okay?

4
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, yeah, it's nothing.

5
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:11,064
<i>I was a guest on mad money
last night.</i>

6
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:13,065
What's happening?
Is one of you Jim Cramer?

7
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:14,364
Okay, stop it, stop it!

8
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,731
I didn't realize
we were still airing that.

9
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,804
Cramer's been dead
for six months.

10
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:20,905
Look, I know
I'm supposed to go with you

11
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:22,306
To Cerie's wedding
this weekend,

12
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:23,606
But I can't make it.

13
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:25,445
Okay, I know you and I
are in a period

14
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:27,412
Of detente right now
because of my other--

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,581
- Piece of tail?

16
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,583
I was going to say
romantic entanglements,

17
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,484
But you do not want
to miss this wedding.

18
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:34,119
It's going to be
New York royalty.

19
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:35,421
The Astors, the Rockefellers.

20
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:36,423
The Sbarros.

21
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:37,592
Yes, I know, Jack.

22
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,759
You think I don't want to know

23
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:40,327
What pizzarina Sbarro
is gonna be wearing?

24
00:00:40,395 --> 00:00:41,362
Then come.

25
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,698
We both know
that is a bad idea.

26
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,300
Which is why I scheduled
a conflict for this weekend

27
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:45,334
I can't get out of.

28
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:46,436
What is it?

29
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:47,438
Well, if you must know,

30
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,108
I'm on dodecacil.

31
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:51,076
The pill where you only
get your period once a year.

32
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:54,079
Ugh! We're so close to beating
that thing completely.

33
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:55,615
Ah, well, my time has come.

34
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:57,451
I'm going to a spa.

35
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:58,519
Well, it's not really a spa.

36
00:00:58,586 --> 00:00:59,821
It's more
of a fenced-in area

37
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:00,855
In the Adirondacks.

38
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:02,958
Fine.
I'll go alone.

39
00:01:03,026 --> 00:01:05,328
And while I'm gone,

40
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:08,530
Do some thinking about us.

41
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:10,099
I promise you,
this weekend will be filled

42
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,335
With staring out windows while
holding a glass of scotch.

43
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:16,839
That means a lot to me.

44
00:01:16,907 --> 00:01:20,776
- Have a, uh, good time
at your fenced-in area.

45
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:22,444
And I'll see you in two weeks.

46
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:24,313
What's that supposed to mean,
you dumb douche?

47
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,747
[calmly] ooh, it's starting.

48
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:28,282
I should go.

49
00:01:31,285 --> 00:01:33,719
- Aloha means hello
and good-bye.

50
00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:34,720
So aloha.

51
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:36,455
- What?
- What?

52
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:38,391
Hi, handsome.

53
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,326
I didn't know
you were coming to New York.

54
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:42,362
I'm here to see my man.

55
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,398
You're not busy this weekend,
are ya?

56
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:45,432
Well, I am, actually.

57
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
I have some thinking to do.

58
00:01:46,568 --> 00:01:47,802
Well, you can do your thinkin'.

59
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,470
We'll just do it together
on that tour boat

60
00:01:49,538 --> 00:01:51,907
That's painted like a shark.

61
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:54,176
Hey, Liz, I need to know
the name of the date

62
00:01:54,243 --> 00:01:55,410
You're bringing to my wedding.

63
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,711
I'm coming alone, Cerie.

64
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,646
But I would still
like two meals.

65
00:01:58,713 --> 00:01:59,813
So is it okay if I sit you

66
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,415
Next to
my dad's mistress' cousin?

67
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:02,682
Whatever makes it
easier for you.

68
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,250
Awesome.

69
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:06,119
God, three weddings in one day.

70
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,154
I am gonna be in spanx
for 12 hours.

71
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,222
My elastic line is gonna
get infected again.

72
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,691
Are you really not bringing
someone to Cerie's wedding?

73
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,360
[scoffs] I don't care
about having a date.

74
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:15,894
What about Floyd's wedding?

75
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:17,529
If I have to sit
through that alone,

76
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,198
I will rent a car,
set it on fire,

77
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,700
And drive it off a waterfall.

78
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:22,168
I could set you up
with my trainer.

79
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:24,070
He's gay, but not
when he's drunk.

80
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,605
No, I don't need help, Jenna.

81
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:27,239
I know where I'm gonna
find my date,

82
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,241
Because I have already met him.

83
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:30,442
What are you talking about?

84
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,876
Jack's mom said to me

85
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,411
That there's only a few
different types of men

86
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,579
In the world.

87
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,915
And, at my age,
I have met all of them.

88
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,184
So I'm gonna go back through
my gentleman Rolodex--

89
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:40,919
- Sexual time travel.

90
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,320
Just like my cinemax soft core,

91
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:44,189
<i>Emmanuelle goes
to dinosaur land.</i>

92
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:45,892
I've dated plenty of good guys.

93
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,927
My standards have just
been too high.

94
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:49,162
Yeah, they have.

95
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,564
Meet me in the handicapped stall
in ten seconds.

96
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:56,670
[exciting jazz music]

97
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,630
Liz Lemon.

98
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:20,964
I was just thinking
about you the other day.

99
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,066
- Really?
- Yeah.

100
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,101
I saw this gorgeous woman
putting glasses

101
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:25,268
On her daughter's
Mrs. Potato head.

102
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,337
The "why" is not important.

103
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:28,438
Can we talk?

104
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,707
Sure.

105
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,876
I was just doing some baking.

106
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:34,277
Uh, can I get you
something to drink?

107
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,679
What goes good
with second chances?

108
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:38,315
Ugh, water.
I'd like water.

109
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:39,449
So...

110
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:40,717
Are you seeing anyone?

111
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:41,785
Oh...

112
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,387
<i>This conversation.</i>

113
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,988
Uh, no, I'm still single.

114
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,691
No one serious
since you, actually.

115
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,226
Well, that's good to hear.

116
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:50,494
You know, when we broke up,

117
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,796
It was because I felt like
I was smarter than you.

118
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:55,665
But that's so judgmental
and--and now I just--

119
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,601
[gasps] oh, my God.

120
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:59,202
What?

121
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,805
Oh, my hooks, heh.

122
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:04,641
I'm just so comfortable
with them that--that--

123
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,808
Ohh.

124
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:07,577
Whoops.

125
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,813
Oh! Oh!

126
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:10,881
Oh, not again.

127
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,120
That was my last
ungashed painting.

128
00:04:15,187 --> 00:04:16,488
How did this happen?

129
00:04:16,555 --> 00:04:19,191
Uh, freak accident.

130
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,794
You know I work
with doctors without borders.

131
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,197
Well, I was helicoptering
into Zimbabwe

132
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:28,099
When I thought I saw
somebody that I knew.

133
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,902
So I waved from the helicopter,

134
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,170
Which, it turns out,
is a big no-no,

135
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,106
And the rotor took my right hand
clean off.

136
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,942
And it turns out the person
I was waving to

137
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:38,477
<i>Was not my old football coach.</i>

138
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,879
Of course not.
You were in Zimbabwe.

139
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,615
Well, it looked just like
a black version of him.

140
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,150
What about the other hand?

141
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,219
Oh, well, to celebrate
my return from Africa,

142
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,321
My cousin and I bought
a bunch of fireworks.

143
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:50,955
You know what?
This was a bad idea.

144
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:51,956
I should just go.

145
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,425
What, you're too good for me

146
00:04:53,492 --> 00:04:55,026
Now that I have
pirate hook hands?

147
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,229
It is absolutely
not because you are disabled.

148
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,731
I've been dumped by four
different guys in wheelchairs.

149
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,899
Look, I'll have you know, Liz,

150
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,134
That I am in line
for a hand transplant.

151
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:06,037
There's this strangler
who's about to be executed,

152
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,473
And, uh, I got
my hooks crossed.

153
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,641
[chuckles]

154
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,210
Oh, heh.

155
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,311
Oh, my God, drew,

156
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,412
It's not about the hooks.

157
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
It's how you got that way.

158
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,583
You're just too dumb.

159
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,685
Wait, Liz.

160
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,420
Don't go.

161
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,722
Ow, it's hot!

162
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,756
Yeah, of course it's hot.

163
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,890
