Oh, well.

You are the one that's
in trouble now, buddy,

317
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:25,366
Because creativity to me
is just like...

318
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:28,870
It's like a bird, like a friendly bird

319
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,438
that embraces all...

320

Wait, why are you wearing
your lucky tie?

I'm having dinner tonight with Nancy.
Alone.

She changed her status to "weirdsies."

What are your expectations here?
She's married.

Uh, I don't know, Lemon.
Nancy's leaving tomorrow.

Can't I just enjoy this while it lasts?

Did you hire this guy
to hide in my dressing room

335

and punch me in the throat?

- No.
- He's bigger than you said.

May I still collect my kiss?

Vattene!

00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,184
Why would you do that, Jenna?
I thought we were buddies.

I'm terrible at Christmas
because I never had a nice one.

358
00:14:58,193 --> 00:15:00,579
Sometimes my mom would take us
to see Santa Claus,

359
00:15:00,614 --> 00:15:03,196
But that's just because she suspected
one of them was my deadbeat dad.

360
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:06,599
So I'd have to get on every santa's lap
in the Bakersfield area and scream,

361
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,701
"you oughta be ashamed
of yourself, Travis!"

362

Oh, no, that's...
that sounds horrible.

363
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:13,105
And then I'd sing carols
in the middle of Sears

364
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:15,641
just to create a distraction
while my mom shoplifted.

365
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,711
And those few minutes
when I was singing carols,

366
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:21,147
that was the one part
of Christmas I liked.

367
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:25,051
And now you've taken that
away from me.

368

Secret Santa has been cancelled

But something's changed in us.

376
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,145
It's... it's a Christmas miracle.

377
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,814
That certainly proves God exists.

378
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:59,219
If God existed, then he would punish you
for what you did to me.

379
00:15:59,254 --> 00:16:01,722
And yet here you are unpunished.

Of course.

No, they tore it down
