1
00:00:02,262 --> 00:00:03,329
Lemon.

2
00:00:03,397 --> 00:00:04,830
I just got my bridesmaid's dress

3
00:00:04,898 --> 00:00:06,132
For cerie's wedding.

4
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:09,001
It is a vietnamese size two.

5
00:00:09,069 --> 00:00:10,870
Dressing up isn't
any easier for men.

6
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:12,605
Do you know what it's like
when a younger man shows up

7
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:14,073
Wearing the same cufflinks?

8
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:15,408
You might as well be invisible.

9
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:17,276
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
let this dress win.

10
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:19,712
I have a plan.
This morning, I joined--

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,913
- A suicide cult!
- A gym.

12
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:22,048
What do you want, jack?

13
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:23,816
I just received a
call from don geiss'

14
00:00:23,884 --> 00:00:25,017
Estate lawyer.

15
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:27,620
Apparently, I've been
named in his will.

16
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:30,289
I know this is a
difficult time for you,

17
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:31,590
But word of advice:

18
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,059
If the will says that you
have to spend the night

19
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:34,460
In a haunted house,
you better hope

20
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:36,462
That everybody else there
is black guys and sluts.

21
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,397
I just want something
to remember the man by.

22
00:00:38,465 --> 00:00:40,566
- Okay.
- His pen or his tie clip.

23
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:42,802
Maybe that boyhood
sled he held so dear.

24
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:44,770
I believed he called it...

25
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,472
Sleddy.

26
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,807
Something which I, in turn,

27
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:50,910
Can then pass on to my...
Protege.

28
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,511
any chance it's one of those

29
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,347
Bendy hospital beds?

30
00:00:54,414 --> 00:00:56,449
Maybe. He did have three.

31
00:00:57,651 --> 00:01:00,386
he was such an amazing man.

32
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:16,500
Sync by n17t01

33
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,976
Before we rehearse,

34
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:26,746
I have an announcement to make.

35
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:30,249
Our boy grizz is getting
married on may 22nd.

36
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:34,487
<i>Jeez, another wedding.</i>

37
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:36,055
Life is like tv.

38
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:38,024
Testing tells us that people
like weddings, births,

39
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:40,292
And episodes where
a character dies.

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,327
That's dumb.

41
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:43,496
My heart!

42
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,598
So I thought grizz might
want to take this time

43
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:47,867
To announce who's
gonna be his best man.

44
00:01:47,934 --> 00:01:50,469
Um...I haven't decided yet.

45
00:01:50,537 --> 00:01:52,738
"um, I haven't decided yet."

46
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:54,206
You sound like my mother

47
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:56,075
Talking to the planned
parenthood lady.

48
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:59,812
Seriously, which one of
your rich and famous friends

49
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,515
With hepatitis b are
you going to pick?

50
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,517
Let's not do this in
front of everybody.

51
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:06,419
Let's not do this in
front of everybody?

52
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:08,587
You sound like my mother
being pulled onstage

53
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:10,656
At a 2 live crew concert.

54
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:12,858
Damn.

55
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,427
My mother had problems.

56
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:17,129
Oh, brother,
we have to tell jenna

57
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:18,798
We can't do her
kardashian sketch

58
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:21,634
Because jack is "bros"
with lamar odom.

59
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:23,135
you are such a coward!

60
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:25,771
you think I care what you think?

61
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,106
Hey, jenna!

62
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:30,543
So look, we can't do
the kardashian sketch.

63
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,912
Okay, I understand.

64
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,613
Pete, there you are you.

65
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,382
I heard one of your
kids broke his arm.

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,284
Oh, uh, yeah.

67
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,885
The shed I built
collapsed on him.

68
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,020
Well, is he gonna be okay?

69
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:42,088
What's going on?

70
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:43,391
Why are you being
so happy and nice?

71
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,493
Are you soaking your
tampo in vodka again?

72
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:54,461
Because the glue is abrasive.

73
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:57,497
But I'm really happy.

74
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,334
Is there any chance

75
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,501
This might make
our lives easier?

76
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,370
No way. I have seen
this 100 times.

77
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,838
She gets psyched about some guy,

78
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:06,206
He reveals himself to be crazy,

79
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:07,274
Then there's a terrible breakup,

80
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,375
And we suffer.

81
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,577
Remember when she
dated that sniper?

82
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:13,080
And so it's over.

83
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:14,648
Jenna, there's a laser
sight on your forehead.

84
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,216
Oh, please. He's not gonna fire.

85
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,085
For god's sakes,
he's scared of his own mother!

86
00:03:18,152 --> 00:03:19,353
Aren't cha, alan?

87
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Aah!

88
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,022
Whoever this new guy is,

89
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,357
We need to figure out his deal

90
00:03:23,424 --> 00:03:25,525
Before she gets burned
and takes it out on us.

91
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:26,593
Tell me about it.

92
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,862
Remember this breakup,
when she bit me?

93
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,497
Pete, that was, like,
two years ago.

94
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:32,599
It just won't heal.

95
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,569
That concludes mr.
Geiss' financial disbursements.

96
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:37,771
I believe all have
been accounted for.

97
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:39,673
His daughter. His lovely wife.

98
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,675
His even lovelier mistress.

99
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,477
The secret canadian family.

100
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:46,313
And his even more
secret attic family.

101
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:49,049
L that remains are a
few personal items.

102
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,384
"to my daughter cathy,

103
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,252
"I bequeath my pocket watch.

104
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,089
"it comes with very specific
instructions for care,

105
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,357
"the most important of which

106
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,760
Is to not let the
piece get wet."

107
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,134
"to my protege and friend,
john francis donaghy,

108
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:08,502
"I leave a gift

109
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,038
"from the gardens of my
estate in connecticut.

110
00:04:11,105 --> 00:04:13,940
My beloved pet peacock, argus."

111
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:22,549
Hello, old friend.

112
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,924
Ugh! Vietnamese size two.

113
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:29,827
Beth, I hope it
wasn't awkward for you

114
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,428
When tracy brought
up my wedding.

115
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:32,429
Why would it be awkward?

116
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,632
Because of our sexual past.

117
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,335
Leave it open. I'd feel safer.

118
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,237
How could I help you, grizz?

119
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,605
Well, tracy keeps pushing...

120
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:42,640
To be your best man.

121
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:43,807
Yeah, I noticed that.

122
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,109
But I wanna pick dotcom and...

123
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:48,145
And you're afraid that
tracy will freak out.

124
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:51,181
So you want me to help you
convince him to step aside.

125
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,483
You know my every thought, beth.

126
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,285
We really were the sam
and diane of this place.

127
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,857
no.

128
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,260
Liz, pete,

129
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:04,428
I want you to meet someone.

130
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:06,263
This is my boyfriend paul.

131
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:08,032
- Pete hornberger.
- Hey.

132
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,167
But you can call me dallas.

133
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:11,669
this could be the start
of something for me.

134
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:13,404
It's really nice to meet you,

135
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:15,005
And I'm a big fan of the show.

136
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:16,807
Yeah, so, paul,
what's your deal?

137
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,710
How did you guys meet?

138
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,811
Through a mutual fund.

139
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,012
Friend, jenna.

140
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,181
Oh, of course.
Through a friend fund.

141
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,282
Noted.

142
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,718
And what do you do
for a living, paul?

143
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,154
Oh, I work for a bank.

144
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,855
-...Rupt circus.

145
00:05:31,923 --> 00:05:34,625
He works for a bankrupt circus.

146
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,599
Okay, he's hiding something.

147
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,535
I'm guessing...

148
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,370
Already-married cat strangler.

149
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:48,472
Hmm.

150
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,074
Hey, could I just get a signa--

151
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,042
Agh! Living dinosaur!

152
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,243
Lemon.

153
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,545
This is argus.

154
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:56,146
He was a gift from don geiss.

155
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:58,015
Don's last gift, to be exact.

156
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,349
Why did don geiss
have a peacock?

157
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,684
Is that an nbc thing?

158
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:04,188
No, don owned argus long
before he bought nbc.

159
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:07,157
Peacocks can live
up to 40 years,

160
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,827
Longer if they're not part
of mike tyson's home zoo.

161
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:11,061
Ohh, what a weird gift.

162
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,329
Not at all.

163
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:14,498
When don was first
taking me under his wing,

164
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:16,600
He and I would sit
on the veranda

165
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,701
Of his home in connecticut,

166
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:19,837
Talking about business,
politics,

167
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:22,072
How to avoid getting paper
cuts while making love

168
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,607
On a pile of money.

169
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,443
And our friend argus would strut
proudly through the garden.

170
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,513
We three peacocks felt
like we owned the world.

171
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:30,748
Well, that's a--

172
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:32,783
how did he get up here so quick?

173
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,651
You know, I never told
anybody this before, lemon,

174
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,387
But don and I had
nicknames for each other.

175
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:39,490
Like we might someday, j-town?

176
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:42,392
We called each other
sempai and kohai.

177
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,694
Master and pupil.

178
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:45,829
Terms we learned
on a trip to japan

179
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:48,065
<i>Because they played the movie
rising sun on the airplane.</i>

180
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:50,501
Don was my sempai.

181
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:53,270
Now this bird is...
All that remains.

182
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:55,606
Jack, I'm really
sorry for your--

183
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,309
Oh, his feather
went in my mouth.

184
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,478
Ew, it's so oily.

185
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,613
Lemon, he's marked you.

186
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,748
He thinks you're his wife.

187
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:08,252
Go! Get out.

188
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,720
yah!

189
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:14,057
Hey, tracy.

190
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,492
Grizz and I were just talking.

191
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,427
Of course.
You guys are very close.

192
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:18,462
Continue.

193
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,931
And we had an amazing idea.

194
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,966
We thought that maybe,
at the wedding,

195
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:25,836
You could be the lead
singer of the band.

196
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,472
Really? I'd be awesome at that.

197
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,706
You would.

198
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:31,575
Now, of course you
couldn't sing and--

199
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:33,243
But who's gonna tell you two?

200
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:34,778
The wedding band is u2?

201
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:36,747
No! You two idiots!

202
00:07:36,815 --> 00:07:38,649
I see what you're trying to do.

203
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:40,284
You're trying to manipulate me

204
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:42,186
Into not being the best man.

205
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,787
And, damn it, grizz,

206
00:07:43,855 --> 00:07:46,156
I've known you since
you was six feet tall!

207
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,592
I'm gonna be your best man!

208
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,460
I am the leader
of this entourage!

209
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:53,764
and because of you,
I'm having a tantrum!

210
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:57,367
Now pick up that table
and smash it for me!

211
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:02,139
That's right!

212
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,274
I know that.

213
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:05,843
Hey, jenna...

214
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,844
What are you doing?

215
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,613
I'm just feeling the weight

216
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:12,216
Of jenna's jewelry
on my finger pads.

217
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:19,389
pete!

218
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,958
Pete!

219
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:22,960
Ugh. Dallas. - What's up?

220
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:24,595
Paul is getting weirder.

221
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,167
We've got to step it up.

222
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,336
You know what we should do,
we should follow him.

223
00:08:32,403 --> 00:08:33,503
I don't care how long it takes.

224
00:08:33,571 --> 00:08:34,538
What's going on?

225
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:35,706
Your kids have a play tonight?

226
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:36,940
<i>Oklahoma.</i>

227
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:38,308
They couldn't find
cowboy hats big enough

228
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:39,343
For my kid's head,

229
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,577
So they're just wearing turbans.

230
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,512
It's on. When paul leaves,
we follow him,

231
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,680
Cia style.

232
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:45,749
And afterwards, I go to the gym.

233
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:50,821
Words are the first step
on the road to deeds!

234
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,793
You wanted to see me, sir?

235
00:08:56,861 --> 00:08:59,429
Oh, my, what a
gorgeous swamp eagle.

236
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,964
This is argus.

237
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:04,601
He is very special to me.

238
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,436
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

239
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,871
He's become listless.

240
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:09,439
And he won't eat any
of the peacock food

241
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,541
I got at the crazy rich
person's pet store.

242
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:13,043
Frankly, I don't
know what to do.

243
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:17,014
He's recently taken a mate.

244
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,482
Lemon.

245
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:20,217
Good luck, argus.

246
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:25,155
Well, sir, there's nothing
wrong with this bird.

247
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:27,524
He's just very old.

248
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,393
Argus probably doesn't
have very long to live.

249
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,795
All of your page
duties stop right now.

250
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,164
The welfare of this bird
is your only concern.

251
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:36,366
He lives...Or you die.

252
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:39,636
I was about to suggest
the same thing.

253
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:45,642
Hey, dummy,

254
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,444
What are you doing to grizz?

255
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:48,578
Whoa, you watch your mouth,

256
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,615
Before I show you
the back of my hand.

257
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:56,887
Look, you gotta grow up
about this best man thing.

258
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:59,056
Liz lemon, I don't even
want to be best man.

259
00:09:59,123 --> 00:10:00,324
Why would I?

260
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,359
Show up one time,
not lose a ring,

261
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,561
Keep my shirt on
through a dinner? Psh.

262
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,730
Then why are you
throwing a fit about it?

263
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:09,566
Because I'm trying to
protect dotcom, dummy.

264
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,735
He's in love with
grizz's fiancee...

265
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:12,769
Feyonce!

266
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:14,237
Oh, your stutter is back.

267
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:17,607
No, grizz's fiancee's
name is feyonce.

268
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,042
Like beyonce with an "f."

269
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,410
- Ah, come on.
- Listen...

270
00:10:20,478 --> 00:10:22,012
We cannot make dotcom

271
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,947
Get up there and give a
speech at that wedding.

272
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,382
It'd kill him!

273
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,184
Wow, I can't believe
that you are using

274
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,053
Your infantile
selfishness for good.

275
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,588
I'm impressed, tracy.

276
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:33,256
You think that's impressive,

277
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,158
Watch me stand on one foot.

278
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:39,296
Hang on. I did it earlier.

279
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:40,564
You're right, tracy.

280
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,666
You've got to convince
grizz to choose you.

281
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:43,934
No, you do.

282
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:45,969
Why do I have to do everything?

283
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,971
Oh! I am never gonna
fit in that dress.

284
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,842
Bored!

285
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:53,343
What? Ohh.

286
00:11:02,186 --> 00:11:03,587
That's a bar.

287
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,655
We're gonna have to
drink a lot to fit in.

288
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:11,528
I don't understand
where he went.

289
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:13,196
Can I get five more beers here?

290
00:11:13,264 --> 00:11:14,364
Name's dallas.

291
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:16,700
I don't get it. Did we lose him?

292
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:19,002
What if he's in a secret
back room doing pot?

293
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,271
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

294
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:24,241
For miss jinah baloney!

295
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,909
what did he say?

296
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,244
Is that jenna?

297
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,581
No, it's paul.

298
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,384
* my muffin top is all that *

299
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,219
* whole grain, low fat *

300
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:38,088
* I know you want
a piece of that *

301
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,890
* but I just want to dance *

302
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:42,159
I'm jenna. Naturally.

303
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:46,063
Jenna's boyfriend is a
jenna maroney impersonator.

304
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,330
* *

305
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:48,432
Work it, miss thang.

306
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,766
Oh, god.

307
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,869
I'm gonna need five more
cranberry juices over here!

308
00:11:58,546 --> 00:12:01,315
Jack, I just found
out that jenna

309
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:05,152
Is dating a guy who does
a drag show...As her.

310
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,054
Lemon, what is with
this food layout?

311
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:09,023
Kenneth says he needs
some sumac bark

312
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,057
And shrub yellow root

313
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,725
To make a poultice for argus.

314
00:12:11,793 --> 00:12:13,494
How is your thing
weirder than mine?

315
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:15,295
I...

316
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:16,964
I am not letting that bird die.

317
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,232
And why does he have to?

318
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,267
For god's sakes,
if we can put an ear

319
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:21,602
On a mouse's back,

320
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:23,303
We can certainly make
a peacock immortal.

321
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,672
Oh, jack, I know this
is important to you,

322
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,975
But it is just a bird.

323
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:30,644
I mean, do you think maybe
you're so worked up about argus

324
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:33,280
Because you never let
yourself grieve for don?

325
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:34,982
I did grieve for don.

326
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,417
As soon as jack welch told me,

327
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,685
I went through all
five stages of grief.

328
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:40,521
Don is dead.

329
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:41,655
What?

330
00:12:41,723 --> 00:12:43,791
You didn't do anything.

331
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:45,692
- Let me retell it-
- in slow motion.

332
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,061
Don is dead.

333
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:58,138
* *

334
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,046
See?

335
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:07,681
Sir, I just wanted
to let you know,

336
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:08,882
Argus is sleeping.

337
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,151
And you left him alone?

338
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:12,419
What if he rolls
over on his back

339
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,388
And his cloaca
fills with mucous?

340
00:13:15,757 --> 00:13:17,858
Oh, brother. This is
not about some peacock.

341
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:19,293
We're gonna have to
help him, kenneth.

342
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,928
I have an idea, but you're
gonna have to take the lead,

343
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:22,329
Because I am stretched
pretty thin.

344
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:24,765
Well, not new york thin, but--

345
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,234
Don't worry,
I'm on it, ms. Lemon.

346
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:29,269
Sorry--mrs. Argus.

347
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,171
Okay.

348
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,874
Beth, I need you to
do something for me.

349
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:34,908
Yeah, actually,
I need to talk to you

350
00:13:34,976 --> 00:13:35,909
About the wedding.

351
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,411
I'm too upset to talk.

352
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,779
Look at me.

353
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:43,817
What's this?

354
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:46,587
Grizz has asked me to
read this to both of you.

355
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:48,355
"dear friends,

356
00:13:48,423 --> 00:13:51,191
"I don't want any more
fighting or bad feelings.

357
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:53,861
"tracy, I love you,
but I've known dotcom

358
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:56,497
"ever since we went to
above the beanstalk,

359
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:58,866
"a free summer camp for giants.

360
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:01,201
"I want him to be my best man.

361
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:02,736
"and if you care about me,

362
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,071
"you'll respect my decision.

363
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,672
I will always be your"--

364
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,475
Oh, no, I'm white.
I can't read that word.

365
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,844
<i>"friend from the neighborhood.</i>

366
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,613
Grizz."

367
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:15,816
I'm so honored.

368
00:14:15,884 --> 00:14:17,184
Now no one is getting hurt.

369
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:18,752
No one at all.

370
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,953
Thanks, guys.

371
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,855
I'm so happy.

372
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,865
Hey! Jenna!

373
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,901
So nice to meet paul!

374
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,202
Interesting guy.

375
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,937
How much do you know about him?

376
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,739
Well, I lost a toe ring in him,

377
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:40,073
So I'd say a lot.

378
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:42,843
No, I mean, like,
what he does...

379
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:44,077
At night,
and what he wears there

380
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:45,512
And who he's being.

381
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,549
So...You know about paul's act.

382
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:50,184
Wait, you know about paul's act?

383
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,785
How do you think we met?

384
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,087
Paul won a jenna maroney
impersonator contest,

385
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,223
At which I came in fourth.

386
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,058
And now you're dating him?

387
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,593
That's it, right there.

388
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:00,627
That face.

389
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,129
That is exactly why

390
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:03,830
I didn't tell you about
paul in the first place.

391
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:06,400
Your judgmental badger face.

392
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,101
Jenna, even for you,

393
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,404
This is weird. Be a friend, liz.

394
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:11,972
Until then, I don't
want to talk to you.

395
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,778
Looks like one of
us is in trouble.

396
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:25,953
- How is he?
- He's awake. But...

397
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,087
But what?

398
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,222
Well, sir,

399
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:30,324
I've spent a lot of
time with peafowl.

400
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,426
They make all sorts
of different noises.

401
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:38,198
ooh, that's a car alarm.

402
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,466
Kenneth, what's your point?

403
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:42,436
It's just I've never
in all my life

404
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:43,870
Heard a peacock say

405
00:15:43,938 --> 00:15:46,206
Sempai and kohai.

406
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:47,774
What did you say?

407
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:49,576
Sempai and kohai.

408
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,645
At least, that's
what it sounded like.

409
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,649
Kenneth, I've been under
a lot of strain lately.

410
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:58,252
But do you believe a human soul

411
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:00,854
Could be transferred
into an animal vessel?

412
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:02,623
Sir, I think that there's
a lot about this world

413
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,224
That we don't understand.

414
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:05,659
Like the afterlife.

415
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:08,562
Or how bread turns into toast.

416
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,233
Liz,

417
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:15,969
I am in love with grizz's
fiancee, feyonce.

418
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,337
Oh, my god!

419
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:18,905
I definitely didn't know that.

420
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,974
Would you talk to
grizz and convince him

421
00:16:21,042 --> 00:16:22,542
Tracy should be his best man?

422
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,745
Okay, yeah. I'll try to help.

423
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:26,513
But can I please go
to the gym first?

424
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:28,382
No.

425
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:32,352
Hello.

426
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,353
badger.

427
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:34,421
It's another badger.

428
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,189
The third badger
has taken the bait.

429
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,525
Why is everyone
code named badger?

430
00:16:38,593 --> 00:16:40,427
I thought you said you
wanted to do it this way.

431
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:42,763
No, I said I didn't care.

432
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:51,438
Jenna, can we please
talk about this

433
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:53,440
Before it becomes a big--

434
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:55,142
Aah! - Hello, liz.

435
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:57,377
Jenna told me I didn't need
to hide from you anymore.

436
00:16:57,445 --> 00:16:59,179
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

437
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,947
What's your game, friend?

438
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:02,115
What are you getting out of this

439
00:17:02,183 --> 00:17:03,717
<i>What am I getting out of this?</i>

440
00:17:03,785 --> 00:17:04,885
Yeah.

441
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:06,620
I am the luckiest
"shman" in the world.

442
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,189
I get to be with
the most talented,

443
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:11,091
Beautiful, sexy woman ever.

444
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:13,393
So you aren't just
using her for your act?

445
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:14,761
My act?

446
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,464
I'd never tuck my penis
again if she asked me.

447
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:18,932
All I want to do

448
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,436
Is spend my days listening
to her talk and sing

449
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:24,805
And scream at her cleaning
lady on the phone.

450
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:26,473
To be honest, liz,

451
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,809
I just don't understand
what she gets out of it.

452
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:31,345
I think I do, paul.

453
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,513
She finally gets
to love herself.

454
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:34,548
It's perfect.

455
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:37,150
What are you two talking about?

456
00:17:37,218 --> 00:17:38,151
You, jenna.

457
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:40,987
Ooh.

458
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,623
This situation is
empirically weird.

459
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:46,326
But...I'm glad you're happy.

460
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,595
I heard what you said about me.

461
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:50,163
You're so sweet.

462
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,099
God, you're incredible.

463
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:56,670
Okay, guys, let's just...

464
00:17:56,738 --> 00:18:00,307
Ew, jenna, why are you
grabbing his boobs?

465
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:10,150
I don't know, argus.

466
00:18:10,218 --> 00:18:11,985
Maybe it's the scotch talking,

467
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:14,388
But I think...

468
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:17,591
There might be a man's
soul inside you.

469
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:26,299
This is crazy, but, don,

470
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:29,102
If you're in there...

471
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,637
Give me a sign.

472
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:38,311
You want a drink.

473
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,338
Don...

474
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:06,673
Sempai...

475
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,175
There's just a few things

476
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:09,843
I want you to know.

477
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:12,712
You're the father
that I never had.

478
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:14,881
Just let me finish.

479
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,583
I want to live the
rest of my life

480
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:19,786
In a way that'll make you proud.

481
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:22,456
I just wish you could be
here to watch me do it.

482
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:33,800
Good-bye, sir.

483
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:39,940
All right, grizz.

484
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:41,741
I'm gonna speak
frankly to you now.

485
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,610
And I can do that
because of our...

486
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:45,011
Sexual past.

487
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,947
Damn, beth, let it go.

488
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:51,084
Don't even have a best man.

489
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,919
Your wedding day

490
00:19:52,987 --> 00:19:54,921
Is about you and your bride.

491
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:57,190
So who cares what anyone thinks?

492
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:58,725
Love isn't judgmental.

493
00:19:58,793 --> 00:20:00,560
Love is patient.

494
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:02,195
Love is...Weird.

495
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:05,232
And sometimes gross.

496
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,133
Love is elusive.

497
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,401
And you found it.

498
00:20:08,469 --> 00:20:09,736
So treasure it.

499
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:12,439
And maybe don't leave
it alone with dotcom.

500
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,674
That was beautiful.

501
00:20:14,742 --> 00:20:15,876
Look at me...

502
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:18,879
Crying like a baby.
