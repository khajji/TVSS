And yeah, I know you're standing there!

169
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:46,470
Hey, fellas, we're
getting Tracy his own room,

170
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,839
So I assume you two will pair up?

171
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,909
Why would you just assume
we would room together?

172
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,277
Why would he assume we wouldn't?

173
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:52,743
I don't know.
Maybe because one of us

174
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,445
still hasn't read
the other's screenplay.

175
00:05:54,513 --> 00:05:55,580
I read it.

176
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,648
I just didn't like it.

177
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:03,421
Hey, Cerie, I thought
you and I could be roommates.

178
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,190
Go out, meet guys,
share clothes like twinsies.

179
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,459
What size are you?

180
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:09,129
Usually designers
just make clothes for me,

181
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:11,731
But when I do buy stuff,
I'm a child's medium.

182
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,900
Well, I only wear designer labels.

183
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,701
These are Jamie Foxx for assfarm.

184
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,803
But I can't room with you.

185
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:18,306
Sue and I already talked about it.

186
00:06:18,374 --> 00:06:21,208
Why? You know sue says stuff
about you behind your back.

187
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,743
She always says stuff to me about you.

188
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:23,742
Wait, what?

189
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,144
I was making my thing up.

190
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:27,046
You bitch!

tell her, you vondruke?

192
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:31,549
Liz Lemon,
I can't go to Boston.

193
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:33,218
Oh, Tracy, come on.

194
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:34,388
You don't understand.

195
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,421
I get in trouble on the road.

196
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:37,555
Thank you, thank you.

197
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:39,123
It's great to be here, Cleveland.

198
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,257
You suck.

199
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,359
I suck?

200
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,194
The rock and roll hall of fame sucks!

201
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:45,428
- Oh, yeah?
- Hello.

202
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:47,429
The road is a minefield, L.L.

203
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:49,698
All those angry drunks
and new temptations?

204
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,133
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

205
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,466
This Boston thing
is Jack's idea.

These gentlemen are
the writers for <i>Bruins Beat,</i>

Whose offices we'll be sharing.

They are all named Sean.

Liz, Mr. Donaghy would like

What? What?

You've got to be kidding me.

What, are you not using
an office-replication service

228
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,439
while we're here in Boston?

229

Is it identical?

Not quite.

See if you can spot which ones.

233
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:56,448
So how's the show looking for Friday?

234
00:07:56,516 --> 00:07:58,683
Like it may not happen, actually.

235
00:07:58,752 --> 00:08:00,652
Oh, that'll really disappoint
your key demographic

236
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,853
of drunken 11-year-olds.

Look, I know for you
this is all just a way

but it is my job.

Let me give you some advice

00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:08,627
on uniting a dividing people...

241
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,330
Find a common enemy.

242
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:11,432
A common enemy?

243
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,531
For example,

244
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,199
What keeps people polite on airplanes?

245
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:16,467
A shared hatred of the CBS sitcoms

246
00:08:16,535 --> 00:08:17,635
They're forced to watch.

247
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:19,036
No,
I understand the concept,

248
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:20,405
Because with these dummies,

249
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:22,840
The common enemy is always me.
And I'm sick of it.

250
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:24,342
I'm not gonna be the bad guy this time.

251
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,211
Then find someone else.
I recommend Lutz.

252
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,113
Why do I always
want to choke that guy?

253
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,814
You just do.
But that is not...

254
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:30,816
Am I interrupting?

255
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,621
Of course not.

256
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,354
- Oh.
- Oh.

257
00:08:40,193 --> 00:08:42,395
You're not a part of this, Liz.

258
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,331
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming up here?

259
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,767
I wanted it to be a surprise.

260
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,103
And I hope that you
and of course Mark

261
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,404
will come to the show on Friday.

262
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:51,573

263
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,041
I'm in the same building
as <i>Bruins Beat.</i>

264
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,407
- Come on. Give me a tour.
- Of course.

265
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,476
Ooh, actually I'm gonna tag along.

266
00:08:57,543 --> 00:09:00,411
I still haven't had a formal
tour of the facility.

267
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:03,781
So I'm gonna...
Stay here.

268
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:05,217
Why the long face?

269
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:07,252
Your boss there
making your life miserable?

270
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,753
It's complicated, Sean.

271
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:09,921
Yeah, I know what it's like.

274
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,063
It's wicked hard.

275
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,367
Is this where they do the news?

276
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,037
It's small, isn't it?

277
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,104
I find that news anchors and breasts

278
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:27,373
are always smaller than they look on TV.

279
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,607
You can try it.

280
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:32,277
Feel like Chet Curtis
and Natalie Jacobson.

281
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,480
Tonight's top story,

282

A Worcester man accused

283
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:37,616
of trading his foster son for gasoline.

284

Ten tips on how to make

00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:48,561
Oh, God.

290
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:52,598
I swore I wasn't
gonna cry in front of you.

291
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,866
Mark left.

292
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,368
Yesterday.
He took a job in New Orleans.

293
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,370
What?
What about his roofing company?

294
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:00,440
Apparently Brad Pitt and Sharon Stone

295
00:10:00,506 --> 00:10:02,574
did a crap job rebuilding
those Katrina homes,

296
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,743
and Mark thinks he can make
a fortune down there.

297
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,244
But I know the real reason he left.

298
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:09,115
He wants to force me to be
the one to ask for the divorce.

299
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:11,282
So you guys are having problems?
I'm sorry.

300
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:13,018
Oh, Jack, it's a mess.

301
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,986
Suddenly he has his own bank account.

302
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:17,190
We've had our house
on the market for a year,

303
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,992
and neither one of us
know what to do about the dog,

304
00:10:20,061 --> 00:10:21,261
'cause we both hate it.

305
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:22,894
Have you talked openly about divorce?

306
00:10:22,962 --> 00:10:24,831
Yeah, we talked to Dr. Phil,

307
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:27,533
and then we made a collage
in our dream journals.

308
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:28,533
No.

309
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:29,768
You know how it is up here.

310
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:30,770
People don't talk.

311
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:32,136
They just run off to New Orleans

312
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:35,107
And jump on that B.S. Saints bandwagon.

313
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,941
Go pats.

314
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:40,110
Oh, Donovan, I hate seeing you like this.

315
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,745
Well, I... I got to get going.

316
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:43,480
I... I got an open house tomorrow,

317
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,050
and Mark was supposed
to shovel the walk

318
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,184
and salt the carport.

319
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:47,720
I can barely understand you,

but let me help while I'm here.

321
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:50,790
Do you know how to rewire a doorbell?

322
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:53,861
I do if you can resuscitate
an electrocuted person.

323
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:57,329
Can you wire the doorbell to the dog?

324
00:10:57,397 --> 00:10:58,731
Okay, that's lunch.

325
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,834
Dude, why do you keep
fixing my spelling?

326
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:02,036
We're back in at 3:00.

327
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:04,840
No, 3:30.

328
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:06,575
Enjoy the town, everyone.

329
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:07,775
You're welcome.

330
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:09,344
Now who would like to join me

00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,113
on a morale-boosting tour

332
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,915
of Boston's historic freedom trail?

333
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,684
Ooh, I would...

334
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,653
N't.

335
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,955
Now what am I supposed to do?

336
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:20,689
I got free time in a strange city.

337
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:22,724
Why don't you come on
the freedom trail with me?

338
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,694
It's an educational walking tour.

339
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:25,826
Purr-fect!

340
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,494
Like a cat birthday.

341
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,563
How could I possibly get
in trouble on a walking tour?

342
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,397
Smash-cut to...

343
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:34,801
And I, John Hancock,

344
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,969
With one stroke of my pen,

345
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:39,536
set all Americans free.

346
00:11:39,604 --> 00:11:41,842
You lying, white devil!

347
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:43,575
The only people you set free

348
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:46,145
were rich, white dudes like yourself!

349
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:49,248
I think my good friend
and supervisor Paul Revere

350
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,415
can address that.

351
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:51,916
I'm out, Kenny.

352
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:54,051
Hey, you know what?
We're gonna go.

353
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,353
Man, no.

354
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:57,690
Most dudes that signed
that declaration of independence

355
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:58,690
owned slaves!

356
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:01,058
What about you, John Hancock?

357
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,459
Well, technically,

358
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:05,194
I just inherited my slaves.

359
00:12:05,262 --> 00:12:06,195
I knew it.

360
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:07,363
For a dude that has

361
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,566
the most hilarious last name
I ever heard,

362
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:10,734
you blow.

363
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:13,036
We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.

364
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,906
Plymouth Rock landed on Mars!

365
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:17,273
All right.

366
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:18,674
Give it a try.

367
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:21,610
'kay.

368
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,880
[electricity crackles]

369
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:27,182
Ugh.

370
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,418
I have many other valuable skills.

371
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:30,818
It'll be the new owner's problem.

372
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:33,055
Just like the water heater.
And the ghost.

373
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:35,224
Well, it is a buyer's market right now.

374
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,091
I think it'll turn around
in the next year or so.

375
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,628
Oh,
I can't wait that long.

376
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,663
I got to sell this place
if I want to get divorced.

377
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:41,831
What do you mean?

378
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,166
Well, there's no money, Jack.

379
00:12:43,234 --> 00:12:44,700
If I can get some cash
out of this place,

380
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,369
Then I can start a new life.

381
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,139
Buy a condo in Marina Bay.

382
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:51,540
Open a store for redheaded girls
to buy cosmetics...

383
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,643
From someone who understands.

384
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:57,247
So you need to sell this house
to get divorced?

385
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:58,681
Basically.

386
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,488
You looking for a country estate
in Waltham?

387
00:13:03,553 --> 00:13:04,553
[doorbell rings]

388
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,822
There it is. See?

389
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,990
Why did you even get
to pick lunch again?

390
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:10,192
Because it's my birthday.

391
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:11,226
And thanks for remembering.

392
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:13,294
I'm 45.
It's kind of a big deal.

393
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,396
Who orders food from a gas station?

394
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,398
The Shell by me has good hot dogs.

395
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:19,632
[all protest]

396
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,634
Guys, guys, come on.

397
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,836
We're all in this together.

398
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:23,069
Shut up, Liz.

399
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:24,404
This is your fault.

400
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,406
It's not my fault.

401
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,639
I tried to do something nice.

402
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:27,640
It was Jack...

403
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:29,442
Sure, find a scapegoat.

404
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:32,647
Just like John Hancock did
with the good King George.

405
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,548
Jack made us come to Boston.

406
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:36,951
This isn't about Boston.

407
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:39,553
Boston was just the match
that lit the powder keg.

408
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,423
Like the tragic events
at Lexington and Concord.

409
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,557
- That's right.
- Yes.

410
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,126
We are sick of the long hours,

411
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:46,627
The crappy food,

412
00:13:46,696 --> 00:13:47,896
sharing offices with

413
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:50,565
the one black guy
in New York who sucks.

414
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,032
Getting stuck with new cast members

415
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,199
who don't even hit on us once.

416
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:54,835
Stop trying to send
dirty text messages

417
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,035
to my land line, Jenna.

418
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:57,038
And the winter.

419
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:58,406
Oh, lord.

420
00:13:58,474 --> 00:13:59,772
The winter.

421
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:01,777
Really?
You're blaming me for winter?

422
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,676
Well, we've got to blame someone.

423
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:05,210
Who's it gonna be if it's not you?

424
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,679
You want someone to blame?

425
00:14:06,747 --> 00:14:10,716
I'll give you someone to blame.

426
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,050
Dale Snitterman.

427
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,453
Okay, I'm out.

428
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,020
Who the hell is Dale Snitterman?

429
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,822
Dale Snitterman is the guy at NBC

430
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,557
who makes all the decisions
that make us unhappy.

431
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,191
Snitterman is the one

432
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:25,361
Who cancelled taco night
in the commissary.

433
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:28,264
Snitterman is the one
who okayed that cast photo

434
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:29,398
where your hair looks green.

435
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,334
He's the one who keeps rejecting

436
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,736
your "summer shorts for the pages" idea.

437
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,172
Sounds like one of King George's

438
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:36,706
hated tax collectors.

439
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:39,775
Exactly.
Thank you, Tracy.

440
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:41,110
You guys think I'm the bad guy?

441
00:14:41,177 --> 00:14:42,577
Fine. I don't care.

442
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,514
But I fight for you every day.

443
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,650
And if Dale Snitterman had his way,

444
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:49,320
the show wouldn't even be on.

445
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:50,652
That vondruke!

446
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,889
And all we can do to get back at him

447
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:56,824
is put on the best damn show that we can,

448
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:58,993
and not give him the satisfaction

449
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,994
of everybody turning on each other.

450
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:02,062
Or me.

451
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,063
Yeah.

452
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:04,197
Yeah.

453
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,733
Yeah! Yeah!

454
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:08,402
I love you guys.

455
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:09,231
-

456
00:15:13,523 --> 00:15:16,860
You wanted to see
the world's greatest manager?

457
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:19,329
Is Kiyoshi Kawashima of Honda here?

458
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,731
No, it's me.
I'm a genius.

459
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,167
I made up a fake NBC executive

460
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:26,838
and blamed everything
that has ever gone wrong on him.

461
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,273
The imaginary enemy.

462
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,174
Classic move, Lemon.

463
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:32,843
The Salem witch trials,
the red scare, global warming.

464
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,547
Now that you've cleaned up
your little mess,

465
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:36,081
I'll need to borrow some of your people

466
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:38,549
to go to an open house in Waltham for me.

467
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:39,652
Charlie what now?

468
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,252
Nancy spilled everything.

469
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Her husband left.

470
00:15:42,387 --> 00:15:44,521
And they're getting divorced

471
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:46,155
If she can find someone
to buy their house.

472
00:15:46,222 --> 00:15:48,158
And that someone is you.

473
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:50,059
I'm just going to be
the money man.

474
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:52,061
The transaction will be
conducted by one of your staff,

475
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,231
Who will be operating
under the alter ego

476
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:56,600
Silas Marymount-Peppercorn,

477
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,367
Uh, a name I came up with.

478
00:15:58,436 --> 00:15:59,669
Oh,
you should have come to me

479
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:00,670
for your fake name.

480
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:03,871
My executive?
Dale Snitterman.

481
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,206
Amazing, Lemon.

482
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:06,875
Where do you come up with this stuff?

483
00:16:06,943 --> 00:16:08,009
Well, you know,

484
00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:09,410
The creative process is always a mystery.

485
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:10,944
I just wish I could get inside

486
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,013
that marvelous brain of yours.

487
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,247
Oh, wait.

488
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:17,317
I can.

489
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:21,453
Okay, in this instance,

490
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:24,291
The creative process
was that I saw that name,

491
00:16:24,357 --> 00:16:25,692
forgot that I saw it,

492
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,162
and said it later.

493
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:34,402
Then, in 1754,
I graduated from university

494
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:35,603
here in Boston.

495
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:38,573
Well, not in Boston, but nearby.

496
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,040
No, not tufts.

497
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,309
Don't listen to him!

498
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,812
We fell for his lies 300 years ago.

499
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,745
Don't let this slave-owning
time traveler

500
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:47,079
fool us again!

501
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:50,615
Excuse me, John Hancock was a patriot.

502
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:52,117
Then patriots are overrated.

503
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:53,252
Hey!

504
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,922
What'd you say about the patriots?

505
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:56,589
I said they suck!

506
00:16:56,656 --> 00:16:57,623
[laughs]

507
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,460
Uh-oh.
Here come the punches.

508
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:02,228
This was all Snitterman's fault.

509

[doorbell rings,

510
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:07,768
Are you here for the open house?

511
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:09,103
Hello.

512
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:11,472
We are here from a different
town for the open house,

513
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,807
because we are interested

514
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,910
in purchasing a house in this area.

515
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:16,877
I'm Nancy, the owner.

516
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:22,284
I am Silas Marymount-Peppercorn,

517
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,584
And this is my first wife...

518
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:25,952
Moronica.

519
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:28,755
It's nice to meet you.
I'm British.

520
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:32,024
My wife and I have disparate
levels of attractiveness,

521
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,959
because I am a successful inventor.

522
00:17:34,027 --> 00:17:35,962
Well, I got to be honest.
I was wondering.

523
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:37,130
Well, all right.

524
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:38,798
It's a...
it's a three bedroom,

525
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,501
and a partially-finished basement.

526
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:41,867
Partially finished?

527
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,372
I'll take it!

528
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:47,706
Dudes, you are not gonna believe this.

529
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,643
Snitterman is here.

530
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,011
What?

531
00:17:51,078 --> 00:17:52,345
I was wandering around upstairs,

532
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:54,248
Checking out the local
cleaning lady talent,

533
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,317
And I found that
son of a bitch's office.

534
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:57,350
He's in Boston?

535
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:58,785
We should go up there and mess him up

536
00:17:58,854 --> 00:18:00,588
for all the crap he's put us through.

537
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:05,057
Right, Liz?

538
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,127
Let's get him!

539
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:08,927
Yeah!

540
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:10,230
Kill!

541
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,465
Okay, don't...

542
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:14,870
Oh, boy.
Okay. Oh, boy.

543
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:16,370
You little bitch.

544
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:17,537
- What?
- Look at you.

545
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:19,239
You're just a suit.
You're nobody!

546
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,573
I don't even know why
I was scared of this guy.

547
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,208
Look, there must be some mistake.

548
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,876
Don't try to explain
yourself, Snitterman.

549
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:26,311
You don't talk.

550
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:27,413
You don't talk at all.

551
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,413
Aah!

552
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:31,017
Hey! Hey! Hey!

553
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,752
Okay, I think he's really scared.

554
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,922
We've done enough here.

555
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,921
Never.

556
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,756
Lutz!
Truffle-shuffle him!

557
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,994
Truffle shuffle!
Truffle shuffle!

558
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:44,596
- Truffle shuffle!
- Hey, what are you...?

559
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:47,065
Yeah, take that, Snitterman.

560
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,668
That's what you get for
making us work late tonight.

561
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:51,034
Yeah!

562
00:18:51,102 --> 00:18:53,470
We're working late tonight
because of you!

563
00:18:55,606 --> 00:18:56,739
So how was the open house?

564
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:59,577
Well, somebody actually came, for once.

565
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:01,412
Nice young couple.

566
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,947
Weird last name, though.

567
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:06,584
I'm sure your name is weird to them.

568
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:09,085
Any reason to open this?
Did they make an offer?

569
00:19:09,153 --> 00:19:10,688
No, they didn't.

570
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:12,156
Really? Are you sure?

571
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:14,024
Yeah.
That house is never gonna sell.

572
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,291
I'm gonna take it off the market

573
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,859
And see what happens in a year or so.

574
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:18,027
Well, what about your plans?

575
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:20,628
The condo?
The store for pale teens?

576
00:19:20,696 --> 00:19:22,931
I can't run a store,
make change for people.

577
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,399
Have another open house.

578
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:25,767
I bet someone offers cash this time.

579
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,434
Not with that broken doorbell.

580
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:28,437
We'll have it fixed.

581
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:29,838
I had an offer, okay?

582
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:31,207
For ten grand over the asking price.

583
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:32,607
So what's the problem?

584
00:19:32,674 --> 00:19:35,776
The problem is that I've
been married for 23 years.

585
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:37,979
The dumb house
is just an excuse to stay put.

586
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:40,648
You know, I'm not ready
for a new life, Jack.

587
00:19:40,717 --> 00:19:42,450
Not ready?
Nancy, we're 50.

588
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:44,486
Yeah, and that's too old
to rush into anything.

589
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:46,488
You know, you're not
from here anymore.

590
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:48,090
You know, down in New York
people are like,

591
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:49,524
"let's get divorced.

592
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:50,927
"you marry the butler,

593
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:52,427
And I'll be a gay octomom."

594
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:53,762
It's different here.

595
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:54,996
People judge you.

596
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,730
Who cares what people
around here think?

597
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,499
Your neighbors named
their daughter Belichick!

598
00:19:58,567 --> 00:20:00,033
I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

599
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:01,535
Of course you don't want
to talk about it,

600
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,637
- You repressed, Irish maniac.
- Don't want to talk about it.

601
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:04,906
You must know that I have
feelings for you.

602
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:06,341
No. Not talking.

603
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,408
I don't want to pressure you,
but if you were divorced...

604
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:10,644
No, let's go to Kelly's.
Let's get some roast beef.

605
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,813
Nancy, let me talk.

606
00:20:15,417 --> 00:20:18,552
I'll give you two words.

607
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:19,753
Ten.

608
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,755
Four.

609
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,821
Final offer.

610
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,124
I'll wait.

611
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,291
Not forever.

612
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll try.

613
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:29,561
Wicked hard.

614
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:33,329
-

615
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,000
Tracy, there you are.

616
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:40,437
I want you to meet
my fellow revolutionary

617
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,438
And dear friend,
Crispus Attucks,

618
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,741
So you can see John Hancock
has black friends.

619
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,077
Uh-huh.
And where did you two meet?

620
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:52,049
Why, we met at
the sons of liberty gathering.

621
00:20:52,116 --> 00:20:53,115
Uh, when was that, Crispus?

622
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:55,284
1775?

623
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:56,285
Really?

624
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,286
So five years after

625
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:00,922
Crispus Attucks was killed
in the Boston massacre?

626
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:02,757
Run, Crispus.

627
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:05,593
He... he's on to us!
