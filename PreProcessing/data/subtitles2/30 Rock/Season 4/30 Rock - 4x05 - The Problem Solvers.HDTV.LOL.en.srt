********

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,580
********

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,420
I also bought this.  
A chinese knockoff of your book.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,420
What?

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:19,050
"dealbreaker: the book for you man
no good,by lesbianyellowsourfruit.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,550
" so,uh,what do you need from me?

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,230
Ah,well,our new cast
member starts today.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,120
Oh,of course,the robot.  I liked him.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,810
We don't know anything about him.

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,750
I don't think his real name is partybot.

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,750
I don't know what he looks like.
 I don't know what he talks like.

13
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,660
I certainly don't know if he can act.

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,290
Lemon,what did you once
say to me about acting?

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,260
Just hit your marks,stay in your light,

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,290
and do the same thing
every take for continuity.

17
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,620
See?  Anyone can do it.

18
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,200
Miss lemon,security called. 
Our new actor just checked in.

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,150
He'll be on six in a couple minutes.

20
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,480
Let's go introduce ourselves.

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,270
This is so exciting.

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,820
Maybe we should practice the
welcome song i distributed.

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,730
?makin' a new friend
??sure ain't easy ??

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,980
and that's how two become one ?

25
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,870
lemon,do you have any
plans for dinner tonight?

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,010
I do,i bought an activia
microwavable panini.

27
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,780
Good god,have dinner with me.

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,190
- Just the two of
us?  - Yes.  - Okay.

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,900
Hey,jackie d.

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,100
I hope the new dude isn't
impossible to work with,

31
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,740
like some people i know.

32
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,680
- I hope he's educated. 
- I hope he hates toofer.

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,880
I hope he likes janitor hugs.

34
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,290
Somebody's coming.

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,920
Oh,no.  Is that the new guy?

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,720
What?  No,it's me,lutz.

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,240
I've worked here for three years.

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,120
I gave you that car i won.

39
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,580
Come on.

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,080
Hi.  I think i'm supposed to be on tv.

41
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,680
Jack donaghy.  Good to see you again.

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,520
Oh,hey.  I'm jack...  Baker.

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,440
So guess there's two jacks here now.

44
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,630
I don't think there are.

45
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,260
Welcome aboard...  Danny.

46
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,560
Hi,danny.  I'm liz.

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,070
Did he just change my name?

48
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,820
Let's go look at your
dressing room...  Danny.

49
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,260
He looks like all the
guys in my magazines.

50
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,810
This is unbelievable.

51
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,770
Last week,i was just a street
performer making 50 bucks a day

52
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,950
and getting memory loss from all the
silver paint fumes,and now i'm...  Um...

53
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,570
- You're on tgs. 
- I'm on tgs?

54
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,860
This is unbelievable! I
haven't done any real acting

55
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,300
since i was in that high school
football movie back in ottawa.

56
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
You're canadian?

57
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,310
All right,hosers,i want all 12 of us
fighting for every meter on all three downs!

58
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,110
We're gonna make this a boxing day
the prime minister will never forget!

59
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,850
Okay,well,you don't
have zero experience.

60
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,310
I just don't want to screw up.

61
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,420
Like,what do you wish you'd
known on your first day here?

62
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,250
Oh,well,don't eat prop food.

63
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,020
They spray something on
it that messes you up.

64
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,140
Hello,mr.  Baker.

65
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,810
I'm kenneth,one of the nbc pages.

66
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,450
I'm going out to get miss
maroney and mr.  Jordan's lunch.

67
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,500
And what would you like?

68
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,210
Oh,thanks.  I'll probably
just go grab something later.

69
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,290
Can i get you anything while i'm out?

70
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,150

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,890
??okay,here's one.

75
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,760
You can have the powers of
superman for an entire year,

76
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,710
but you can only have one sexual
partner for the rest of your life.

77
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,670
Two questions: must i live
by superman's moral code,

78
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,570
and will the sex woman get older?

79
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,770
- Yes and yes. 
- Forget it.  No deal.

80
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,760
I don't want your
sleeve to catch on fire.

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,470
Why would my sleeve catch on fire?

82
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,800
You know me well,sir.

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,270
I often know what you're
going to do before you do it.

84
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,490
- What am i going to do next? 
- What am i going to do next?

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,010
Speaking of which,i made some calls.

86
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,270
And there's interest in a dealbreakers
talk show with you hosting.

87
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:10,030
Spit take.  Are you serious?

88
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,950
Absolutely.  You're
becoming a commodity.

89
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,720
I say we book the
studio,shoot the pilot,

90
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,210
and take it from there
what do you think?

91
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,200
Wow,okay.  Let's do it.

92
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
- i knew you would say yes,lemon. 
- i knew you would say yes,lemon.

93
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,890
Hey,pete,i have question.

94
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,180
Is camera left my left or my right?

95
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,690
Here's some advice,danny.

96
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,140
Learn as little as you can.

97
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,680
'Cause when you know
things,people ask you to do things.

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,230
And then everyone starts coming
to you with their problems.

99
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,790
That's why when someone comes to me
with something i don't want to deal with,

100
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,570
i say,"oh,no,my kid's
sick," and take off.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,690
You have any kids?  No.

102
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
I mean,i pretty much
raised my little sister,

103
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,390
'cause my mom ...that
must have been hard.

104
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,520
no,my kid is sick.

105
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,110
A dealbreakers talk
show?  That's amazing,liz.

106
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,820
Liz lemon,you are blowing up like
a balloon with a grenade in it.

107
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,700
Who else are you meeting with?

108
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,380
What do you mean?

109
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,010
You know,like producers and agents.

110
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,370
No onei'm doing it with jack.
 For sheinhardtuniversal.

111
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,110
Liz,you can't just go with the
first person who comes along.

112
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,960
I know,because i've been burned.

113
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,190
Do you remember when i
was first starting out,

114
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,090
and i signed a tenyear deal with
that karaoke machine company?

115
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,770
??when i first got big,i made
bad business decisions too.

116
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,060
Which is how i got stuck having
to plug wade bogg's carpet world

117
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,380
five times whenever i appear on screen.

118
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,520
You have to plug what?

119
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,050
Wade bogg's carpet world.

120
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,030
Wade bogg's carpet world.
 Wade bogg's carpet world.

121
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,130
Liz,jack would never
take a first offer,right?

122
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,220
He's taking advantage
of your relationship.

123
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,110
He knows you're special,like a
black stripper with blue eyes.

124
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,220
You have to test the marketplace.

125
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,470
But i already told jack
that i would do it with him.

126
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,630
Did you sign anything?

127
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,200
Then he'll understand.  It's business.

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,810
I'm gonna set you up
with someone at my agency

129
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,590
and make sure that you do this right.

130
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,620
And one last piece of advice,liz lemon,

131
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,430
from someone that's been on this
side of the business for a long time.

132
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,170
Wade bogg's carpet world.

133
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,970
That was actually good advice.

134
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,480
From now on,i shall call
us the problem solvers.

135
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,940
Yo,ken.  Do you have a
problem that needs solving?

136
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,580
Actually,i do.

137
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,560
Mr.  Baker wants to do
everything for himself.

138
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,600
I feel about as useless
as a mom's college degree.

139
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,310
Sounds like a job for
the problem solvers.

140
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,240
We'll talk to danny for you.

141
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,630
Lemon,i was just going to call you.

142
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,410
The guy who came up with
this thing for arsenio hall

143
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,050
wants to create a signature
arm gesture for our talk show.

144
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,830
I was thinking something like this.

145
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,070
About the talk show...

146
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,390
While i am very thankful for your offer,

147
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,900
i think i maybe should take a couple other
meetings before committing to anything.

148
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,450
Like you said,i'm a commodity now.

149
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,410
My book is number 14 on the
nonfiction bestseller chart,

150
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,400
right behind the founding fathers' diet.

151
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,480
So...  I'm signing with an
agent and exploring my options.

152
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,190
I see.

153
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,750
Well,if that's how you feel about it.

154
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,840
Good luck in the marketplace.

155
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,890
Obviously,this is nothing personal.

156
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,590
I just want to be thorough.

157
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,140
That's okay,right?

158
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,090
All right,then.  Great meeting.

159
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,050
Raise your hand if you're
cool with what's happening.

160
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,410
Not too late to raise your hand.

161
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,410
Cerie,if you need me,i'll be
at a meeting with my new agent.

162
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,970
Oh,he called to confirm your lunch,

163
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,280
but i told him you'd
already eaten a weird panini.

164
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,590
That was no.

165
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,250
Just,heh,call him and
tell him i'm on my way.

166
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,840
- Do i look okay? 
- That's exactly how you look.

167
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,690
There she is! The
dealbreaker! Simon barrons.

168
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,570
- You're an agent? 
- Uh,junior agent.

169
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,790
Um,uh,full disclosure: until
now,i've mainly represented dogs,

170
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,090
but seeing as how we're both embarking
on a new phase in our career performing,

171
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,730
representing humans and monkeys i
want you to know that i'm hungry.

172
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,220
And i would do anything for you.

173
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,540
My clients are more important
to me than my own mommy.

174
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,980
Okay,good.  I need someone
that i can count on.

175
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,980
I'm...  Kind of alone out
here in the marketplace.

176
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,090
I get it,i get it. 
That's what i'm here for.

177
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,980
Um,okay,let's get your face
out there,take some meetings.

178
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,470
There's jack donahee at nbc.

179
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,520
Donaghy.  Already met.  Who else?

180
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,190
Do you know who scottie shofar is?

181
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,550
Oh,yeah,he's the guy that produces   THAT
DUMB SPORTS SHOW THAT ALWAYS BEATS US.

182
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,140
Yeah,you're talking
about sports shouting.

183
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,280
- Okay,let's meet with him. 
- Absolutely.

184
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,840
Now,i don't know him,

185
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,380
but a former client of mine once
buried a bone in his backyard.

186
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,550
We go looking for that bone,

187
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,750
it's like,"oh,mr.Shofar,what's up?

188
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,550
My client has got an
idea for a talk show.

189
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,450
" oh,no,i got the hiccups.

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,380
Danny,around here,we're
known as the problem solvers.

191
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,520
Always have been,always will be.

192
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,610
And we think you could
use a little guidance.

193
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,650
Yes,please.

194
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,030
I don't even know where the
bathrooms are around here.

195
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,790
It's not about the room,danny.

196
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,900
It's about the man.

197
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,890
Any room you see
around here with a door,

198
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,650
you make it your bathroom.

199
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,840
You're an actor now.  You're special.

200
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,960
And taking advantage of
kenneth is part of it.

201
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,370
It's what he's here for.

202
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,550
Look,i'm just trying to keep my head
down and suppress my canadian accent.

203
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,980
I'm not "aboot" to...
 Aboot...  Abwah...  Out.

204
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,270
Ah,all i'm saying is
that i don't want to

205
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,140
rub anyone the wrong way,even kenneth.

206
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,690
Oh,don't worry.  Kenneth
loves being our slave.

207
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,380
He may say that,but
trust me,it's not true.

208
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,820
I was an assistant once

209
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,340
,and when you're in that position
you grow resentful and bitter.

210
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,710
So what if kenneth's
bitter?  He's an underhuman.

211
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,070
Look,a couple days ago,i was
working as a robot for spare change.

212
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,550
And now look at me.

213
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,740
Kenneth's a page,but who knows?

214
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,630
Someday,he could be running the network.

215
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,840
What?  That's ridiculous.

216
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,370
- Crazier things have happened. 
- Kenneth in charge?

217
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,500
Liz,here are today's press clippings.

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,560
Women's health magazine
gave us a dminus.

219
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,290
Son of a bitch!

220
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,040
Sheinhardtuniversal announces
production of a dealbreakers talk show?

221
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,440
What the what,jack?

222
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,150
Let me explain something to you,lemon.

223
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,890
Dealbreakers is a sketch that first
appeared on this networkwe own it.

224
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,440
And we're doing it whether
or not you're involved.

225
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,560
Really?  So you think
you can just replace me?

226
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,000
Of course not.  We can do better.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,760
I've already spoken to padma lakshmi.

228
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,930
Then who's gonna host top chef?

229
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,800
You are ruining my life!

230
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,070
Well,we could just do the show with you.

231
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,340
But that door is closing.

232
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,600
Close it.

233
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,340
You think you can bully me like this?

234
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Well,you don't know me.

235
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,820
Two can play at this game,jack.

236
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,390
Gaah!

237
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,390
Ken,you don't want to be a page forever.

238
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,420
Who said i've been alive forever?

239
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,410
What?  No,i mean...
 What's your dream job?

240
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,730
Where do you see yourself in ten years?

241
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,970
Well,you know how much
i love television,sir.

242
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,960
So i guess my dream would be
to one day run the network.

243
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,880
Just kidding.  There won't be a network.

244
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,580
But whatever people are watching,i
want to be in charge of it.

245
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,050
So...  Someday,you could be my boss?

246
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,470
Well,guess so.

247
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,870
Now,are you ready to get started?

248
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,640
No! I'll brush my own teeth.

249
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,700
I don't want you to have
any resentments towards me.

250
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,970
From now on,i don't want
you to do anything for me.

251
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,860
Hey,jack.

252
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,870
Two days to the show,and i
still don't really know anything.

253
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,070
I'll tell you everything
you need to know,danny.

254
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,620
Never do business with a friend.

255
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,150
Never be friends with a woman.

256
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,350
And lose the leather bracelet.

257
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,010
Pete,i have a problem.
 I need your help.

258
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,360
Oh,my kid got hit by a car!

259
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,920
Hey,jackie d,what's wrong?

260
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,870
You're not your usual,giggly self.

261
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,440
If you've got a problem,you've
found the right people.

262
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,700
Okay,i have a problem.

263
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,660
It needs to be communicated to lemon
that if she wants to play business,

264
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,100
i'm more than happy to play with her.

265
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,280
But as she saw earlier today,business
jack does not play gentle.

266
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,010
Are you as turned on as i am right now?

267
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,900
Lemon has a decision to make. 
She can either be crushed by me.

268
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,240
Or she can suck in her stomach

269
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,750
and crawl back through the tiny crack
i've left for her in the proverbial door.

270
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,900
You think you can pass that along?

271
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,170
Wait,hang on...  Our tshirts are wrong.

272
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,490
Do you want to switch where we're
standing,or switch our tshirts?

273
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,620
Just to be safe,let's do both.

274
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,970
Really?  He said crawl back?

275
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,240
You're not really capturing
the sexual energy of it,

276
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,540
but that was the message.

277
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,130
So problem solved?

278
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,810
I haven't even begun to problem.

279
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,570
We are suing jack donaghy and nbc
for the rights to dealbreakers.

280
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,540
Would either of you care for a drink?

281
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,650
- No. 
- Do you have drinkable yogurt?

282
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,230
Simon,we're both men of the world.

283
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,560
Yeah,i've seen some bras.

284
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,610
I bet you have.

285
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,700
Here's the thing. 
No one's suing anyone.

286
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,910
Don't let him push you around.

287
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,540
I'm not.  God,leave me alone.

288
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,240
Nbc employs 80% of
your agency's clients,

289
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,930
between are you stronger than a dog

290
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,100
and i'm a celebrity dog: get
me out arf here.  You need us.

291
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,570
I've already talked to your lawyers,and
they're not interested in pursuing this.

292
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,880
God,jack,why are you being
such a wang about this?

293
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
I'll take that as a complement.

294
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,830
An wang,the founder of wang computers,

295
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,200
is one of the greatest
businessmen of the 20th century.

296
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,870
And you're the one being
a lowercase wang,lemon,

297
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,230
because after working with
me every day for four years,

298
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,010
you didn't trust me
to produce your show.

299
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,410
Instead,you made it about business.

300
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,310
And i didn't get a bathroom door that looks
like part of a wall by being bad at business.

301
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,340
That's a bathroom?

302
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,230
You tried to take advantage of
our friendship to make money.

303
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,150
I don't need you to make money.

304
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,740
In fact,i'm meeting with
your replacement tonight.

305
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,730
Yeah?  Well,i'm replacing you too.

306
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,780
Because i got all kinds
of meetings lined up.

307
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,740
- Big meetings. 
- Really?  With who?

308
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,340
Damn it,simon!

309
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,050
You were right about jack.

310
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,170
He's in love with me?

311
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,090
What?  No.  He burned
me on dealbreakers.

312
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,520
And now i need to find someone
to help me burn him back.

313
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,290
Well,i could introduce you
to my boy,scottie shofar.

314
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:54,990
You know him?

315
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,830
Hell,yeah! I'm a frequent
guest on sports shouting.

316
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,100
Nah,introducing you to scottie probably
wouldn't solve your problems with jack.

317
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,190
Jack who?  Set it up.

318
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,100
Scottie shofar.  I know that name.

319
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,470
- What does he look like? 
- I don't know.

320
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,540
All white people look
the same to me,pete.

321
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,120
Oh,my god.

322
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,680
Scottie shofar was my assistant
on trivial pursuit: the movie.

323
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,210
I was horrible to him.

324
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,100
And now he's actually successful?

325
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,900
What if i got called in to audition
for him and he recognized me,

326
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,660
even with all the changes to my face?

327
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,110
That have happened naturally.

328
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,740
That's what danny was saying.

329
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,510
We have to be cool to everybody.

330
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,340
Because the future is
like a japanese game show

331
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,750
you have no idea what's going on.

332
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,830
Miss maroney,your
mexican diet pills came.

333
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,040
Should i start taking them
to test their side effects?

334
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,600
No,kenneth.  I'll do it myself.

335
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,350
You don't have to do anything
for me anymore.  Ever.

336
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,850
What is happening around here?

337
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,330
What has changed?

338
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,260
We're aboot to get married.

339
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,940
Oh,no,that's not right.  Abhah.  Obot.

340
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,790
Mr.  Baker.  We need to talk.

341
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,040
Now's not a great time,kenneth.
 I don't need anything.

342
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,910
Sir,this time,i need something from you.

343
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,000
You've poisoned mr.  Jordan's
and miss maroney's minds.

344
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,230
You've got to tell them to
go back to the way it was.

345
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,310
To let me help everyone
again.  Including you.

346
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,550
- Kenneth,i don't. 
- yes,you do.

347
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,600
Because you're scared.  And frustrated.

348
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,130
Of course i am,because
i'm going on tv tomorrow

349
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,750
and i don't know what i'm doing.

350
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,810
- Embrace your anger. 
- What?

351
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,700
Yyou know,of all the
weirdos i've met around here,

352
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,380
you're the worst! With
your creepy,don knotts face,

353
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,530
that ridiculous hitler youth haircut.

354
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,460
Excellent.  What about my chin?

355
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,540
What about your chin,kenneth?

356
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,340
I've seen bigger chins
on a premature baby!

357
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,230
MR.Baker,you've just
made me feel terrible.

358
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,040
And said the word "about" correctly.

359
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,830
Congratulations.  You're an actor.

360
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,220
- About. 
- About.

361
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,610
Oh,my god.  Thank you,kenneth.

362
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,380
That was aboot the coolest
thing i've ever seen.

363
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,800
How long have you been there?

364
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,160
- Nine hours. 
- A few minutes.

365
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,320
Well,you need to know something too.

366
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,140
No matter what happens in the future,

367
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,400
i will always take care of you.

368
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,870
Kenneth's the best.

369
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,930
He knows what i want before i do.

370
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,540
- Who's hungry? 
- I wanted waffles.

371
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,600
So you can have all the powers
of superman for an entire year,but

372
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,660
superman? I've done hot yoga
with tom welling and dean cain,

373
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,130
and i don't think
they're right for this.

374
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,750
No,i wasn't,um sorry,i gotta take this.

375
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,680
What's up?  Nothin',just meeting
with this dealbreakers lady.

376
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,180
I don't know. 
Regular,six.  Drunk,seven.

377
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,900
Padma,i'm so happy you've taken
an interest in dealbreakers.

378
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,730
I love doing top chef,

379
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,370
but this would give me a chance
to showcase my other talents.

380
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,410
I mean,men always
tell me i'm very funny.

381
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,210
Have you heard this one?  Knockknock.

382
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,040
We don't even care about the
profits from your actual show.

383
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,190
That's nothing to us. 
That's our snapple money.

384
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,440
See,we're all about
monetizing you as a brand.

385
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,970
I'm blowing up.  It's rahm emanuel.

386
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,750
He wants me to go to deer
valley.  I am crushing it!

387
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,480
Yeah,because i'm really
looking for a partner in this.

388
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,880
Someone i can trust.

389
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,340
So...  I would be a full
partner in this with you?

390
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,780
That's what i'm looking for,yes.

391
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,080
I like it.  You know,i'm
very entrepreneurial.

392
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,790
I invented this new bag that you put
around a sandwich to keep it fresh.

393
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,220
But it's clear,so you still get
the full visual of the sandwich.

394
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,550
So it's a sandwich bag?

395
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,170
No,jack,it's a new
thing that i invented.

396
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,660
The point is,we do business together,

397
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,780
and you are my number one priority.

398
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,060
Nothing is more
important to me than you.

399
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,840
I gotta take this.  It's brooke hogan.

400
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,790
What's up,you tall drink
of bitch! You're amazing.

401
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,510
No,seriously.  Amazing.

402
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,070
Yeah,you heard me.  Yeah,that's right.

403
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,810
Yeah.  No,seriously.

404
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,410
So what would my time commitment
be if i host this thing?

405
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,090
Honestly,two days a week.

406
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,930
Wow,that's great.

407
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,710
Top chef has all this
traveling and allday shoots.

408
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,780
If i could do this instead,i wouldn't
be so grouchy and exhausted all the time.

409
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,310
My clothes wouldn't have
food stains all over them.

410
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:31,770
I could actually find a balance
between my work and being a mommy.

411
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,560
This would change my life,jack.

412
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,710
It would.  It would change your life.

413
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,100
- So let's do this. 
- No.

414
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,120
- What? 
- I don't want to change your life.

415
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,350
I want to change
lemon's life.  I'm sorry.

416
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,950
Uhh,this business is so hard!

417
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,140
Not really.I'm kidding.

418
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,650
Go.  Go.

419
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,880
- Lemon. 
- Jack.

420
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,240
I was wrong.  It's you.
 It's always been you.

421
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,510
I want to do business with you,lemon.

422
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,660
I'd like that.

423
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,380

424
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,070
do you have a problem?

425
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,500
then call the problem solvers.

426
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,470
Taxes got you down? 
Wasps in your crawlspace?

427
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,320
Term paper blues?  Migrating implants?

428
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,140
call the problem solvers.

429
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,900
'Cause after all,what's a
problem but an opportunity

430
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,750
disguisedas a stripper
having a seizure on your boat?

431
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,840
Mouse in your house?

432
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,730
Or need a cheap flight to tucson?

433
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,960
Both: ?we are the problem...??solvers ?

434
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,620
that was a good rehearsal.
 Now let's record it.

435
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,340
And we're rolling.
