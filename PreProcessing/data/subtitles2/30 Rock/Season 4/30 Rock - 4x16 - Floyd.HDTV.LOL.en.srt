Who is this guy?

00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:04,894
Uh, I met him on kdate,

00:00:04,962 --> 00:00:07,650
Which is the personals section
of the kraft foods website.

00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:08,781
And what was he like?

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,810
He owns a cockatiel
named Arliss.

00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:11,976
Oh, God.

7
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:13,475
But I'm not letting it
get me down.

8
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:15,508
I'm just gonna keep putting
positive energy out there,

00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:17,509
And something good
will come back to me.

A Mr. Debarber called.

Oh, my God.

00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,826
That's amazing.
What you said worked.

For what?

Danny was nominated

In the same category

great exposure for ya.

a profile of me

of that guy's positive energy.

We got to start messing
with him.

Yeah. Like, what if
we trick him into kissing me?

Kenneth, I'm having a Tracy
and Jenna problem.

00:01:56,077 --> 00:01:57,077
Gosh, Mr. Hornberger,

48
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:58,478
You say that so often,

49
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:00,646
You should come up
with a shortcut word for it,

50
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:03,615
Like, "ivatrennapra."

51
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:05,316
Well, Danny's interview
with the <i>New York Times</i>

52
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:07,251
Comes out today,
so "ivatrennapra."

53
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,585
A what?

54
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:09,853
If Tracy and Jenna hear
about it,

55
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,920
They'll get jealous
and act out,

56
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:12,021
And as much as I want to,

57
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:13,922
I can't slap
the brat out of them.

58
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,591
So Tracy and Jenna will spend
the day in the makeup room,

59
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:19,627
Having full plaster impressions
made of their faces.

60
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:23,164
So that should shut them up
for, uh, let's say, 12 hours.

61
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:25,299
Oh, my,
that's a long time.

62
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,700
Maybe I should keep
them company.

63
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,769
Yes.
Tell them your stories.

64
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:32,971
They'll hate that.

what's wrong with my voice?

Yeah. I mean, I'd love

00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,714
Okay, well,
I'll call you tomorrow.

for the <i>New York Times,</i>

95
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,057
And they printed all
of this stuff that I didn't say.

all my news

From Dick Cheney's website--

her way to the middle

Or that Jenna kidnapped
a Swedish au pair

To use as a hair farm,

102
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:51,067
And I never called Tracy clean
and articulate.

00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:52,569
Why would I?
He's not.

is in the newspaper, Jack.

Everyone's gonna see it.
No, they're not.

106
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,710
It's a hoax.
What?

107
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:59,713
The <i>New York Times</i>
doesn't have a staff writer

108
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,381
Named Seymour Nips.

109
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,149
You've been pranked
by the nerds.

110
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:08,088

of Frank, the black one,

The writers--
why would they do that to me?

114
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:15,394
Because they look at you, and
you're everything they're not.

You're handsome.

are we gonna do?

But one time
we snuck up to Dartmouth,

123
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,608
Put their mascot
in a box,

124
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:32,844
And sent it
to Mexico City.

125

We didn't know
until the next day

That it was
an actual indian.

what it means,

But I am allowing myself
to be excited.

141
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:06,134
I mean, on the phone,
it was like

Liz and who?
Come on. Floyd.

144
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:15,241
My ex-boyfriend, the only
good boyfriend I've ever had--

145
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:17,643
Recovering alcoholic, he used
to work in this building.

146
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,812
Oh, you mean that guy?

147
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
And, of course, this is
our other finalist couple

148
00:05:21,748 --> 00:05:24,518
For the <i>today</i> wedding contest,
Floyd and Kaitlin.

00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:27,488
[cheers and applause]

150
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:29,256
Whahk?

151
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:35,276
An old Gus is the biggest catfish
in the pond.

152
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:36,576
Legend has it, the only bait

153
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:37,964
That'll catch old gus

154
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:39,994
is a piece of old Gus himself.

155
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:41,324
So everytime they catch him,

156
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,434
they cut off a litlle piece of him

157
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,564
so they can catch him

158
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:47,094
Now how did the very first person
