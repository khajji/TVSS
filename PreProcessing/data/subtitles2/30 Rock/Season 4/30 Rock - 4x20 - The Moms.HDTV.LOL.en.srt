Good news, tray.

We found a great mom
for you.

Her name is novella Nelson.

Novella Nelson?

Oh, wait, is she
aquaman's girlfriend?

169
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,656
No. She's a great actress
who lives in Brooklyn.

She looks like you.

That could be anyone!

is younger than you.

Who cares?
She's awesome, and so am I.

186

I want Serena Williams
to be my mother.

I don't want
to talk about Nancy Donovan.

Oh, hi.
Are you going up?

I can't. They both

I couldn't just
pick up and move.

never regretted it.

Yeah,
but I always called him ed,

00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:43,264
because our town had,
like, five buzzes.

293
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:45,366
You could have
married buzz aldrin?

294
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,835
You should regret that, mom.

295
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:49,337
You should have followed him.

paying for that other implant.

a very simple decision to make--

309
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,032
quit, don't get paid,

310
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,767
and drive around
with one headlight out,

311
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:21,269
or, swallow your pride,

312

and get the money you need
tomorrow.

They said they were gonna
put a wig on me or something

314

so that nobody
would recognize me

as the pajamarall lady.

316

Like anyone
would recognize you anyway.

00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:48,429
but I am what you got,

324
00:11:48,497 --> 00:11:50,465
so, Tracy,
you better watch yourself,

325
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:52,867
or you may wind up
with no mother at all.

326
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:56,637
Fine. I'd rather be
up on that stage all alone

327
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:57,905
than to be with someone

328
00:11:57,973 --> 00:12:01,242
whose resume has
"black judge" on it nine times.

329
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,177
And you think
I wanted a fake son

330
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:06,214
who recorded
an anti-condom psa?

331
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,616
I saved a lot of kids
from lame sex!

332
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,485
Little ingrate.

333
00:12:14,289 --> 00:12:15,723
All right,
start with taxes,

334
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,925
then insurance, and change
this to "latin America."

335
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:21,062
I can't say Nicaragua.

336
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,397
Gah!

337
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:23,531
You must be Avery.

338
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,766
Yes?

339
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,034
I am so sorry,
miss Jessup.

340
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:29,137
Mrs. Donaghy keeps tricking me
and running away,

341
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:30,471
but not anymore.

342
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:33,107
Carl, they need you
out in the hall.

343
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,709
Yes, ma'am!

344
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:36,978
Mrs. Donaghy.

345
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:38,379
You must be Jack's mother.

346
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:39,480
Indeed, I am.

347
00:12:39,548 --> 00:12:42,417
And Jack has told me
so much about you.

348
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:45,253
You're going to have
to work your backside,

349
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,921
because chest-wise

350
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:49,824
you have the measurements
of an altar boy.

351
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:51,626
I wish Jack had told me
you were in town.

352
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:54,395
Well, men have their
little secrets, don't they?

353
00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:55,830
Especially Jack.

354
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:56,831
Secrets?

355
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,266
What I'm trying to say is,

356
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,934
if you're serious
about Jackie,

357
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:01,669
let him know now.

358
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:04,806
A man like Jack
has other irons in the fire.

359
00:13:04,873 --> 00:13:05,973
I beg your pardon?

360
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,576
Oh!
Look at the time.

361
00:13:08,644 --> 00:13:12,914
I've got to get back
to calling Kenneth "carl"

362
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:15,450
to see if he ever corrects me.

363
00:13:15,517 --> 00:13:17,118
Carl!

364
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:18,519
Yes, ma'am?

365
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:21,055
[Laughs]

366
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:23,991
Lemon,
have you seen Colleen?<,

367
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:25,660
Kenneth was supposed
to be watching her,

368
00:13:25,727 --> 00:13:27,128
but I just saw him
with his eyes closed

369
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:28,196
counting to infinity.

370
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:30,164
You want to talk about moms,
Jack?

371
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:31,332
Listen to this.

372
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,102
My mother could have
married buzz aldrin.

373
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,170
Oh, really?
I know buzz.

374
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:37,572
We met at a photo shoot

375
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,341
for <i>vanity fair's</i> annual
awesome gentleman issue.

376
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,876
My mom blew it, Jack.

377
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:44,378
She had true love,
and she threw it away

378
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,547
just because
it was inconvenient.

379
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,349
Well, lemon, if your mom
had ended up with buzz,

380
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:49,550
you would have
never been born.

381
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:52,386
Or I would have
been born Peter aldrin.

382
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:54,856
And I+d wait for a woman
with the right stuff.

383
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:56,257
Now, remember,
in this scenario,

384
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:57,992
I'm a man and my father
is an astronaut.

385
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,360
Well, lemon,
if you'd like to see

386
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:00,695
what your mom's life
would have been,

387
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:01,829
I can arrange for you
to meet buzz.

388
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,364
Are you serious?
He's in town.

389
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:05,566
I saw him last night at
Rupert Murdoch's twister party.

390
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:09,504
I mean, uh, regular party.

391
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:12,974
Tracy, this mother's day thing
is a disaster.

392
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,041
I hear you.

393
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,376
Because you're
talking in the ear

394
00:14:15,444 --> 00:14:16,644
that I didn't
lose a button in.

395
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:19,847
I thought verna and I
had made this breakthrough,

396
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:20,915
but now we're just back

397
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,183
to fighting
about money and clothes.

398
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:23,718
Thank God Terry's dead,

399
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:25,419
or we'd be fighting
over him again too.

400
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:28,556
Boy, I thought I had it bad
with my fake mom.

401
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:29,657
Are you kidding?

402
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:30,791
At least your fake mom

403
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:32,360
has to act like
she cares about you.

404
00:14:32,427 --> 00:14:33,794
Yeah, it's true.

405
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:35,062
And she is a good actress.

406
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,398
I bought those pajamaralls.

407
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,699
And you got to choose her.

408
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:42,203
No, Jenna, no one gets
to choose their mom...

409
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,638
Even when they're fake.

410
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:45,039
For good or bad,

411
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:46,240
we're stuck with them.

412
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:47,708
And you know what?

413
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,177
They don't get to choose
who we are, either.

414
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:52,580
And God knows
we're not perfect.

415
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:54,115
It's true.

416
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:58,653
Sometimes I sing
too beautifully.

417
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,954
What a nice surpri--

418
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,389
is there another woman?

419
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,624
What? How did you--?
Colleen.

420
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:04,926
Don't blame your mother,
Jack.

421
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:06,260
This is about us.

422
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:09,063
Oh, my God. Look, Avery,
you know how I feel.

423
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,232
So I'm gonna skip the part
where I deny anything.

424
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,534
Then you skip the part
where you yell at me.

425
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:16,971
And then we both move on
to the, uh, make-up sex.

426
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:17,972
Wow.

427
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,373
That is a swing.

428
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:22,710
Look, I assumed you and I
were exclusive,

429
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,412
but we never talked about it,

430
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:27,448
so maybe this is
partly my fault.

431
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,250
And I forgive you.
Come here.

432
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:30,985
I'm sorry.

433
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,888
But these tactics have worked
on stupider women.

434
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,489
If we're going
to move forward,

435
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:38,926
you better figure out
what it is you want.

436
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:41,095
Soon.

437
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,400
Excuse me, Dr. aldrin.

438
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,102
I'm sorry. There wasn't a door,
so I just...

439
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,270
I don't believe in barriers,

440
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:51,405
because I always break them.

441
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:52,440
You must be Liz.

442
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:53,574
Yes, sir.

443
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,344
I actually came about my mother,
Margaret lemon.

444
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:58,613
Well, you would have known her
as Margaret Freeman.

445
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,315
Maggie Freeman?
Of course I remember her.

446
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:02,550
Well,
I'm sorry to bother you,

447
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,152
but I can't help but wonder
what my mom lost

448
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,954
by giving up on you,

449
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:08,723
her perfect man.

450
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,791
Perfect? Sure,
I'm a famous astronaut,

451
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:15,429
decorated fighter pilot,
doctorate from mit,

452
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:17,598
but even I sometimes...

453
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,001
I see you.
I see what you're doing.

454
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:23,838
Return to the night.
You've no business here.

455
00:16:23,905 --> 00:16:25,506
Are you yelling at the moon?

456
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:27,541
I'm sorry.
She and I just...

457
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:29,977
I get mad sometimes.

458
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,245
Sure.

459
00:16:31,313 --> 00:16:33,247
Look, you want to know
what your mother missed?

460
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:36,050
Years of drinking,
depression, cheating.

461
00:16:36,118 --> 00:16:39,286
I flipped over a saab
in the San Fernando valley.

462
00:16:39,354 --> 00:16:42,223
I once woke up
in the air and space museum

463
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,660
with a revolver in the waistband
of my Jean shorts.

464
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:47,528
Oh, my God.
But you're--

465
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:48,729
a human being.

466
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:50,297
But I'm at peace now.

467
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,667
Sober almost 32 years.

468
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:57,038
But I would have put
Maggie Freeman through hell.

469
00:16:57,105 --> 00:16:58,539
[Sighs]

470
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:00,174
The moms were right.

471
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:04,078
There's no such thing
as astronaut Mike Dexter.

472
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:05,312
What am I doing?

473
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,648
I'm sorry
if I've disappointed you.

474
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:10,751
Would you like to yell
at the moon with buzz aldrin?

475
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,854
Yes, please.

476
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:15,122
I own you!

477
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,590
You dumb moon!

478
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:18,292
I walked on your face!

479
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,660
Don't you know it's day?

480
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:22,063
Idiot!

481
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,532
Well,
I'm ready for the show.

482
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,102
Mom,
you're wearing my outfit.

483
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,304
Well,
a mother makes sacrifices.

484
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:33,374
Like those 16 hours
I spent in labor,

485
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,409
even though it was
Margarita Monday

486
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:38,012
at dockside Joe's.

487
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,214
Daughters
make sacrifices too.

488
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:43,217
Why are you wearing that?
Who's paying you?

489
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,752
No one.

490
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,222
I'm wearing it for the same
reason you're wearing mine.

491
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,324
Because I love you.

492
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:53,127
I love you too, baby girl.
Oh.

493
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,862
Why does your chest
feel weird?

494
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,531
Uh, because I love you
so much.

I'm glad you married dad.

So am I, dear.

506
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:40,441
Now, would you please
find yourself someone

507
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:41,776
and start a family

508

What is wrong with you?

514
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:01,629
I am 51 years old.

515
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:02,863
Do you not think
I can take care

516
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:04,231
of my own personal life?

517
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,766
Think?
I know you can't.

518
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,535
You do a lot of things well--

519
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:10,838
make money,
choose wine, wear ties.

520
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:13,574
But you and women?
Disaster.

521
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:15,442
Divorce.
Broken engagements.

522
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,144
I assume herpes.

523
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:18,546
And I wonder
why I'm like that.

524
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:19,947
Maybe it's because
you can't let go

525
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:21,549
of your precious Jackie,

526
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:23,217
so you undermine me
at every turn.

527
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:24,985
I'm not
gonna be around forever.

528
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:26,487
Don't pull that out,
Colleen.

529
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,589
And if I don't do something,

530
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,391
you will never
make a decision.

531
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,762
You'll just froufrou around
with Nancy and Avery

532
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,530
until they're both gone.

533
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:38,065
And then where will I be?

534
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,502
I'll be circling the globe
in my coffin rocket.

535
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,604
Something I saw on tv.

536
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:44,738
It's very expensive.

537
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:47,775
I'm done disapproving,
Jackie.

538
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:50,110
I'm just trying to help.

539
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:53,147
I need to know that someone

540
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,616
is looking out
for my little boy.

541
00:19:55,684 --> 00:19:57,685
All right, Colleen.

542
00:19:57,752 --> 00:20:01,155
Then I'm asking you,
for the first time in my life,

543
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:03,691
tell me what to do.

544
00:20:03,758 --> 00:20:05,726
And I'm going to tell you,

545
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:09,597
for the first time in my life,

546
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:12,066
I can't!

[Door opens]

548
00:20:14,202 --> 00:20:15,870
I--I did not lose her, sir.

549
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:18,405
Carl would never let you down.

550
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:19,974
Carl,
that does not sound right.

551
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,476
Kevin--no.

552
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:25,446
Who am I?

553
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:27,147
Is it Keith?

554
00:20:27,215 --> 00:20:28,549
No, that's not--
yes, I'm Keith.

555
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:35,422
That's our show.
