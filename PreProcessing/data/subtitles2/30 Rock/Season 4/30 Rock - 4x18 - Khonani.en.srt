00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:06,418
Hey!

2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,048
Did you know
that everybody here

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,319
Went out last night without us?

4
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:12,927
Oh, nerds!

5
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:17,563
Nerds?

6
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,935
Nerds.

7
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:23,531
Yeah, Thursday night thunder.

8
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,226
That's been going on for years.

9
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:27,294
You know about it? How come
I've never been invited?

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,829
Don't you think
th's a little bit rude?

11
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,195
Well, I yelled "baba booey"

12
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:31,825
At Walter Cronkite's funeral,

13
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:34,983
So I actually have no idea
of what's rude or not.

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,085
- Yeah, well, let me... 

15
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:37,553
- But I couldn't thunder
last night,

16
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,021
Because I had to take
Angie to the ER.

17
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:41,223
She had some complications
with her pregnancy,

18
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,558
So that kind of trumps
your little problem.

19
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,494
Ah, yeah, you're right.
How is she?

20
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,162
Well, she's fine,
and the baby's fine,

21
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,530
But they put her on bed rest

22
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:50,931
Till her blood pressure
goes down.

23
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,932
Well, listen, tray,
if there's anything I can do,

24
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:54,065
Please let me know.

25
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,366
There's one thing.

26
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:57,034
Could you take care of Angie
like a husband

27
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,035
Until this whole ass-ache
blows over?

28
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,336
Absolutely not.

29
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:01,337
What about you, k?

30
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:02,905
I'm on it, sir!

Oh, my.

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,626
I haven't seen your brow
that furrowed

35
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:32,228
Since you saw that picture
of Helen mirren in a bikini.

36
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:33,965
How is it possible?
Is she a wizard?

37
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:35,466
A question
for another time, Lemon.

38
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:36,934
I was with Avery last night,

39
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,237
And I almost had
a Nancy-related incident.

40
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:40,639
Oh, Jack.

41
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,407
Oh, Nan...

42
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:43,506
Na.

43
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,504
What?

44
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:45,871
I was saying,
"oh, Nana."

45
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,307
Have I not told you
about my grandmother fetish?

46
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,076
Avery actually tried
to get on board.

47
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:52,377
Later that night,

48
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,811
She put some mothballs
behind her ears

49
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,812
And fed me peppermints.

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,648
She is in it to win it.

51
00:01:56,715 --> 00:01:58,116
This can't go on.

52
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,620
I'm making a decision
about Nancy and Avery today.

53
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,187
I'm going in the bunker.

54
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,655
No distractions.

55
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,072
I had Jonathan remove the bar

56
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,338
And my collection
of 18th century french erotica.

57
00:02:08,406 --> 00:02:10,306
I've had to make
some tough calls over the years,

58
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,008
Switching sheinhardt's

[NBC chime plays] it's fresh.

63
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:23,219
But this Nancy-Avery thing

64
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:26,389
Is the toughest decision
I've ever had to make.

65
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:28,291
Well, I'm glad
you're taking it seriously.

66

Although, sometimes when
you try so hard to find love,

67

You can't see that it's been
standing in front of you

68
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:35,464
The whole time.
Oh, good God.

[sighs]

72
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,705
Last night, I saw
my entire staff out at a bar.

73
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:44,041
They go out every week
and I'm never invited.

74
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,708
Do they not even like me?

75
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,277
Oh, don't worry.
It's healthy.

76
00:02:47,344 --> 00:02:49,012
Bosses need to keep
their distance

77
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,380
From their subordinates.

78
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:52,515
Mr. Donaghy, I have to
run out to Mr. Jordan's house.

79
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,117
I'll call you when I get there
so you know I'm safe.

80
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,451
No! I don't care
if you're safe!

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,653
I love you!

82
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,787
After four years,

83
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,589
I thought I was close
with these people.

84
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,024
I thought we were a family.

85
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:02,192
Don't say family.

86
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:03,760
Then I see them
out at a bar without me,

87
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,361

But this is your staff.
You can't let it bother you.

90
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,067
You could always come up here
and have a drink with me,

92
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:13,570
Oh, great,
that sounds really fun.

93
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:15,572
I'll just pour myself a drink.

94
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:22,378
Oh, I dropped my glass!

95
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:23,846
Is that supposed
to be a broom?

96
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,048
Anchor the handle.

97
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:26,082
Yeah.

98
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,217
There it is.

101
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:36,726
Mr. Jordan,

102
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:39,429
The situation here
has deteriorated.

103
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:40,663
Great update, Ken.

104
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:42,365
Thanks for checking in.
Talk to you later.

105
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,399
Actually, sir,

106
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:45,735
I think you should come home.

She wants you to come help her.

00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:53,106
What? But why?

111
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,409
You're much better
at that serving stuff than I am.

112
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:56,777
Well, your wife thinks

113
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,979
Taking care of her
should be your job

114
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:00,814
And I have to agree, sir.

115
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:02,516
You made a promise
to care for her

116
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:03,508
In sickness and in health.

117

Don't you remember
your wedding vows?

118

To be honest, I couldn't
really understand anything

Come home, Mr. Jordan.

Mrs. Jordan needs you.

Fine, I'll be there soon.

You can help yourself
to anything in the fridge,

And once I'm there,

What did you do?

to you and Jenna in...

clips their toenails?

Not cool, guys.

You are? Still?

143
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,159
Well, it was off for a while,

144
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:56,828
Because my fiance
was on his dad's yacht

145
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,196
And got captured by pirates,

146
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:01,032
But now,
thanks to the a-team, he's back.

147
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,233
Sure.

148
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:03,501
He has
a different energy now.

149
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,036
He's quieter.

150
00:05:05,103 --> 00:05:06,838
But we're getting married.

151
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:07,872
And are we still
in the wedding?

152
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,340
Of course.

Are gonna
throw me a work party,

It has to be this week.

160
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,019
- Oh, no! Really?
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

161
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,437
It's just that the schedule's
really filling up

Now that aris
is finally getting over

His Stockholm syndrome.

00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,748
Oh, that reminds me.

165
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:28,882
You guys may have to walk
down the aisle

166
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,451
With some pirates.

167
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,486
It's just, I don't think
I can plan a party this week.

168
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:33,554
I'm doing a juice fast,

169
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,055
And it's making me
really grouchy.

170
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:37,057
Aah!

171
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,358
You know what?
This is perfect.

172
00:05:38,426 --> 00:05:40,627
I'll have that party...
Tonight,

173
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,096
And it'll be fun,

174
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:44,031
And you'll all see
that I'm fun.

175
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,532
So screw both of you!

176
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,301
And screw everybody out here!

177
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:49,470
Liz Lemon is having a party!

178
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:50,737
[rapping] * and they're
ain't no party *

179
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,072
* like a Liz Lemon party *

180
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,475
* 'cause a Liz Lemon party
is mandatory *

181
00:05:59,062 --> 00:06:00,195
All right, Donaghy,

182
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:02,898
Follow your heart.

183
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,133
"hard equations
and rational thinking."

184
00:06:14,444 --> 00:06:16,311
Damn you, heart.

185
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,621
[panting]

186
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,622
I'm sorry, sir.

187
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,458
There's
a minor janitor problem.

188
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:30,892
I apologize for letting
a kashmiri

189
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,294
Into your office.

190
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:34,362
I just need five minutes
of your time, Mr. Donaghy.

191
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,567
[speaking hindi]

192
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:44,773
Now would be a good time,
actually,

193
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,374
To handle
the janitor situation.

194
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,809
- But, sir, what about... 

195
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,244
- I always say bosses
should stay

196
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:50,946
Deeply involved
with their subordinates.

197
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,547
Does this mean you're coming
to my cabaret?

198
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:55,984
Jonathan, close the door.

199
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,886
Please.

200
00:06:57,954 --> 00:07:00,655
So what can I do for you?

201
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:01,312
It has been a week,

202
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,181
And I've heard
nothing from you, sir.

203
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:04,449
Have you forgotten
our agreement

204
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,017
About me taking over 11:30?

205
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:08,319
I'm sorry. What?

206
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,021
Five years ago,
I threatened to quit

207
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:12,123
Unless you got me
out of the late night shift.

208
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,492
Wow, other than
some notable recent exceptions,

209
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,528
Nbc never guarantees
employment terms

210
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:18,129
Five years in advance.

211
00:07:18,197 --> 00:07:19,798
I have a contract.

212
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:23,368
That is my signature.

213
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:26,938
You signed it
on April 22, 2005.

214
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:29,040
Okay, in my defense,
every April 22nd,

215
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:31,409
I honor Richard Nixon's death
by getting drunk

216
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:33,278
And making
some unpopular decisions.

217
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,879
Well, I want
the earlier shift.

218
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,481
It's better pay
and more prestigious.

219
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,316
Ever since I am a little boy,

220
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,719
I am dreaming
of hosing the tonight shift.

221
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:42,153
Okay. Uh, calm down,

222
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:44,022
Uh, Khonani.

223
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,790
I understand
that I made you a promise,

224
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:48,126
And we're going to keep it,
because this is NBC...

225
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:50,028
<i>[NBC chime plays]
the biggest loser network.</i>

226
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,629
So you'll fix this?
Today?

227
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:54,365
Well, this is
a janitor emergency,

228
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,500
And I really have no choice

229
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:57,168
But to make it
my number one priority.

230
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:58,803
Good. Thank you.

231
00:07:58,871 --> 00:08:00,371
Can I have those pictures

232
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,974
For a special book
the janitors keep?

233
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,709
Absolutely not.

234
00:08:08,647 --> 00:08:09,748
[dog snarling]
Aah!

235
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,182
Good monster!

236
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,751
Good scary monster!

237
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:15,820
Hey, Ken, isn't that
a fun place to stand?

238
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:19,046
Oh, I forgot to warn you
about my dog, Tracy senior.

239
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:21,015
I trained him
to hate white people,

240
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,049
Because, not to profile,

241
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,484
But most ghosts are white.

242
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,686
This is my boy here.

243
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:27,321
And look what Angie did to him.

244
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,356
She set up an invisible fence.

245
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:31,725
He gets shocked if he tries
to leave the property,

246
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:34,028
Just because he'd run away
and cause car accidents

247
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,263
And impregnate
neighbors' horses.

248
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:38,099
He's trapped here just like me!

249
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,034
Sir, you're not trapped.

250
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,070
Mrs. Jordan just wants you
to be here for her.

251
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:44,205
I'm trying, Ken,

252
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:45,606
And I want to be responsible,

253
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:47,842
But I've been me
for a long time.

254
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:49,577
Well, Mrs. Jordan
isn't asking for a lot.

255
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:50,978
Right now,
she just has a craving

256
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:52,446
For a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

257
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,715
No, we're not supposed
to do any sex stuff

258
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,283
While she's on bed rest.

259
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:59,353
Oh! Like a real one!

260
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:00,421
I'm on it!

261
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:03,791
Maybe this'll get Angie

262
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:05,292
To stop calling me
irresponsible.

263
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,861
Just stay focused

264
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,463
And take this sandwich
to my wife.

265
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:10,531
Nope!

266
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,433
I'm in a strip club!
My bad!

267
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,304
Hey, Jenna, if I'm expecting
about 20 people tonight,

268
00:09:17,372 --> 00:09:18,672
How much ice should I get?

269
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,808
Oh, you don't want
to mess with that stuff, Liz.

270
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:23,144
Ice has caused a lot of ods
in the porn community.

271
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:25,880
Oh, you mean frozen water?
I don't know.

272
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:27,882
Well, I just don't
want to forget anything.

273
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:30,184
Don't worry.
No one's expecting a lot.

274
00:09:30,252 --> 00:09:31,719
No, tonight
is gonna be different.

275
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,787
There's gonna be booze
and a karaoke machine

276
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,022
And that Black Eyed Peas song

277
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,223
They wrote for bar mitzvahs.

278
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,914
[on speaker] Jenna Maroney
to the floor.

279
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,103
Sure, it will.

280
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:41,104
Hello?

281
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,338
Lemon, you know Subhas,

282
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,240
The current
first-shift janitor?

283
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:45,475
Uh, kind of.

284
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,043
According
to the janitor community,

285
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:48,111
You call him frequently

286
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:49,579
Regarding
home toilet situations.

287
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:50,814
No, it's not that.
We're dating.

288
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,881
Lemon, please.

289
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,950
Look, I just need
his phone number.

290
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,819
What does this have to do
with Avery and Nancy?

291
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,886
That is taking a backseat

292
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:58,788
To this janitor situation
right now.

293
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,657
I need Subhas to step down.

294
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:02,058
But Subhas does a great job.

295
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:03,193
Look, five years ago,

296
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,128
I promised Khonani
the earlier shift.

297
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,563
Why would you ever
promise that?

298
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,097
Honestly, these immigrants
have a tough life,

299
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:09,165
No health care,

300
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,834
And I kind of just thought
he'd die

301
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,168
Before it became a thing.

302
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,970
Are you sure that
you're not just using this

303
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,139
As an excuse to avoid
your real problem?

304
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:18,441
Lemon, this is
a janitor emergency.

305
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:19,542
I need that phone number.

306
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,577
Okay, let me find it.

307
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,245
Subhas...Scrolling.

308
00:10:22,313 --> 00:10:24,047
- I know you know it by heart.
- 917...

309
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:27,851
All right, Khonani,

310
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,752
If I've learned anything
from recent experience

311
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,387
It's that we have to handle
this next step

312
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:32,956
With Subhas very delicately.

313
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:33,957
Oh, don't worry.

314
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,491
Subhas will want to leave,

315
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,926
Spend time on his hobbies.

316
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:39,863
He collects classic car... 
[coughing]

317
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,097
Cardboard.

318
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:42,999
Classic cardboard.

319
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,367
[dog growling]

320
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,969
Ken!

321
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,371
Why did you let me
go to a strip club?

322
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,273
I tried to stop you, sir,

323
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,574
But you threw your dog at me!

324
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:54,110
This is bad,
because I can't change!

325

I'm like a chameleon,

[cell phone vibrates]

327
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:01,353
This better be a meeting,
'cause I'm important!

328
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:02,554
Tracy, it's Liz.

329
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,256
I want you to know
that at my party tonight,

330
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:05,657
You're off the leash.

331
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:07,059
I want to see the behavior

332
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:09,361
That got you kicked out
of the inaugural ball.

333
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:10,462
I can't, l.L.

First of all,
the secret service

335
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,433
Never gave me back
my t-shirt cannon,

336
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:15,601
And second of all,

337
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,403
I gotta stay home
and take care of Angie!

338
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,537
What? No!

339
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:20,272
Come on, you have to come.
I need you.

340
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,640
This party
has to be off the hook.

341
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,342
People don't say
that anymore.

342
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,411
They say
"surf party, usa."

343
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,912
Tracy, this is important.

344
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,781
I have to prove
to my co-workers

345
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,250
That I am not some angry,
un-fun woman,

346
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,118
Who doesn't deserve
to be included.

[speaking german]

348
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,958
Look, Liz Lemon,
I know your feelings are hurt,

349
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:41,493
But parties are like frisbees.

350
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:43,328
If you throw them
the wrong way,

351
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:45,063
They'll veer off
in a bad direction,

352
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:47,633
And then your kid
will fall into a quarry.

353
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,767
What?

354
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,469
Don't throw
a party for vengeance.

355
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,037
It will turn on you,

356
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:55,774
Like your wife after your kid
has fallen into a quarry.

357
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:58,076
You know what? Fine.
I don't need you.

358
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:01,747
I am gonna crush
this party Liz-Lemon style.

I don't know what to do.

360
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:04,516
A party's in trouble,

361
00:12:04,584 --> 00:12:05,818
And I'm the only one
that can save it,

362
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:08,620
But your wife and
unborn daughter need you here.

363

- I'm torn, k-pax.

364
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:11,457
I know I should be here,

365
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,625
But my body's gonna
take me to Liz Lemon's.

366
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:14,660
What do I do?

[dog whining]

368
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:22,190
Put the electric
dog collar on me.

369
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,392
It would be my honor.

370
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,503
Subhas, thank you
for coming in

371
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,406
And for showing me
your, uh, special book.

372
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,408
More men in it
than I would have expected.

373
00:12:33,475 --> 00:12:34,542
Book is book.

374
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,810
Indeed.

375
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:38,713
Uh, Subhas, you've
been with us a long time,

376
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,048
And you've
done great work here,

377
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,549
But we need some new blood.

378
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:43,718
I've decided that it's time
for you to step aside,

379
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,887
And Khonani will take over
at 11:30.

No! I'm in a union!

No, no, hold on.

There's always another option.

No, thank you.

388

What if the night shift
just got a whole lot earlier?

389
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,037
Gentlemen, there is a way

390
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:04,405
For everybody to get
what they want

391
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:06,074
And for me to look
like a genius and a hero.

You're bullcrapping us.

No, I am not.

But what's going to keep you
from just taking the collar off?

in the lock.

out of the liquor cabinet.

And, of course,
I'll be here to help.

else you have to do...

There's no trash, Jack.

Ever since you moved Subhas

are you talking about?</i>

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,356
Maybe someone should
say a few words.

487
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:42,624
[amplified] Absolutely.

488
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:44,526
* Jimmy crack corn
and I don't care *

489
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:46,495
* Jimmy crack corn
and I don't care *

490
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:49,164
- What are you doing?
- Juice fast delirium, Liz.

491
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:51,500
Um, I'm glad
you could all make it

492
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,001
To cerie's party.

493
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:54,369
I don't have a lot to say,

494
00:16:54,437 --> 00:16:55,871
Just that the bar is open

495
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:58,173
And the karaoke machine
is ready to go.

496
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:00,876
Karaoke, awesome.
Yeah.

497
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:04,479
You think I don't know
what that is?

498
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:06,648
I know about
Thursday night thunder

499
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:08,517
And I know
that I'm not invited!

500
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:09,851
- Uh-oh.

501
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,153
I deserve to be loved!

502
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,155
Oh, no, she's going wide.

503
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:16,258
I am a proud, single woman!

504
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,659
How did it become about this?

505
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:18,760
Go out the window!
Save yourselves!

506
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,829
I may not have a real family,

507
00:17:20,897 --> 00:17:22,998
But I thought at least
I had one at work,

508
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,223
Which is not what I wanted
for myself, by the way.

509
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,924
You think when I was a kid,

510
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:28,926
I dreamed of someday
paying $1,200

511
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:30,261
For a karaoke machine

512
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,163
To impress
a bunch of pasty losers?

513
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,531
And a professional singer,

514
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,700
Who's beautiful,
but doesn't know it.

515
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,735
So now let's
all go around the room

516
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:40,038
And apologize to me!

517
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:42,573
- Oh, my God,
this is the worst... 

518
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:44,342
- [whimpering]
I had nowhere else to go!

519
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,044
- [barking]
- dog!

520
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:47,378
Dog attack!

521
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:50,548
[screaming]

522
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,720
[exhales]

523
00:17:58,223 --> 00:17:59,590
Hmm.

524
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,659
Maybe this doesn't work
on people.

525
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:04,228
Aah! Aah!

526
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:05,396
Oh, my neck!

527
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:07,432
My swan-like neck!
Aah!

528
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,133
Oh!

529
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:12,537
Must...Fight...Through it.

530
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:15,573
Also must...Weed...Lawn!

531
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:18,609
[gasping]

532
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:19,844
I made it.

533
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,013
I'm on the other side.

534
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,021
I'm free.

535
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,857
I can go anywhere I want...

536
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,726
Like Liz's party

537
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:35,993
Or one of those places

538
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:38,463
Where you skydive
over a huge fan.

539
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:45,675
[truck door closes]

540
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:48,445
Hmm...Maybe it doesn't
work on people any... 

541
00:18:48,513 --> 00:18:50,313
Aah! It still does!

542
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:51,715
Aah!

543
00:18:51,783 --> 00:18:53,917
[screaming and dog barking]

544
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:56,286
Why is that thing
following you?

545
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:57,487
Hunting me!

546
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:58,755
Electric collar!

547
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:00,557
[dog barking, door thuds]

548
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,092
There's no fire escape
in this room!

549
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,794
Why are we even here?

550
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:05,395
You make us show up,
you start yelling,

551
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:06,630
And then we get attacked
by a dog!

552
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:07,998
And Cerie didn't even come.

553
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:10,167
That's just
a cardboard cutout of her.

554
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:11,535
But I rescued her.

555
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:12,903
[door thuds and screaming]

556
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,472
Quiet! Quiet!
Everybody shut up!

557
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,808
We need to figure out
what we're gonna do.

558
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,179
[dog growling]

559
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,382
Oh, really?
Now I'm a part of the group?

560
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,217
Now you like me
because you're in trouble

561
00:19:27,285 --> 00:19:28,919
And you need someone
to bail you out?

562
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,987
Yes, that's exactly
why we like you.

563
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:33,390
We love you.
You solve our problems.

564
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,591
That's what you're good at.

565
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,259
So what if you're
not fun at parties?

566
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:37,861
Yeah. You know
who's fun at parties?

567
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,597
Paris Hilton, Andy Dick, Tracy,

568
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:41,998
And they're all
gonna burn in hell.

569
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:43,233
Oh, God!

570
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,068
If you deliver me from this,

571
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,704
I promise every Sunday
for the rest of my life,

572
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:49,773
I'll go to... 

573
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,475
Huh?

574
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,243
I'm through it.

575
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:54,878
Pizza Hut.

576
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:56,813
I'll go to pizza hut.
Ha!

577
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,748
Look, if this is a family,

578
00:19:58,816 --> 00:20:00,217
That makes you the mom,

579
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,152
And you don't want to go out
drinking with your mom.

580
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:04,460
You want mommy
to make the monsters go away.

581
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:05,628
[door thuds and screaming]

582
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,130
- Oh, please
- come on!

583
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,232
[dog barking]

584
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,769
Everything's
gonna be all right.

585
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:16,739
Oh. Okay, Tracy senior,

586
00:20:16,807 --> 00:20:18,408
Let's see what you've got.

587
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:19,909
[gasps]

588
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,277
[dog barking]

589
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,578
Aah!

590
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,314
Oh! Aah!

591
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:27,083
Run! Run, my losers!

592
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:29,585
[panting]

593
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:31,788
Aah!

594
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,056
Great party, Liz.

595
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:34,624
Everybody take some cupcakes!

596
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,825
[dog barking] Aah!

597
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:40,866
Hi, Subhas.

598
00:20:40,934 --> 00:20:43,268
I have an extra headshot
I was gonna throw out,

599
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:45,403
Unless you want it
for something.

600
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,073
No!
You're not book!

601
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,809
Why?
What am I doing wrong?

602
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,378
Wanting to be book
is not book.

603
00:20:53,446 --> 00:20:55,513
Mm...

604
00:20:55,581 --> 00:20:57,515
So you solved
your janitor thing.

605
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,185
Now back to Nancy and Avery?

606
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,686
<i>Top gun high-five
for courage?</i>

607
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,955
Only because you look
like you need it so badly.

608
00:21:04,023 --> 00:21:05,256
I'm fine with that.
