1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,890
We need to talk.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,490
Right now!

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,890
We know Tracy is not in Africa.
He's hiding somewhere in New York.

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,890
- What?
- Don't play stupid, Walter.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,890
We have ways of
making people talk.

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,135
By giving them
fresh apple slices.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,004
Listen to me very carefully.

8
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:21,122
This show is my life.

9
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:23,008
I need Tracy back.

10
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,793
Where is he?

11
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:26,127
You think
we don't want him back?

12
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,480
Do you know how much
our Cobra payments are?

13
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,265
And he's the only one
that knows the combination

14
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:31,933
to the candy safe.

15
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:34,936
The worst part
is being able to see the candy.

16
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:36,688
All right.

17
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:38,690
But if I find out
you're holding out on me,

18
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:39,974
I will no longer allow you

19
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:41,660
to use my office
for your history club.

20
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:44,812
That's ironic, because
next week's topic is fascism.

21
00:00:54,123 --> 00:01:01,630
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="##FF8C00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

22
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,004
What about grizz and dot com?

23
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:11,172
They don't know anything.

24
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:12,941
Neither does anyone
Tracy's close to...

25
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:16,027
his wife, Charles Barkley,
Edward James Almost,

26
00:01:16,112 --> 00:01:18,029
who is an Edward James Olmos
lookalike

27
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:20,615
- that Tracy is friends with.
- Kenneth talks to Tracy

28
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:21,900
on Skype, doesn't he?
Just call him.

29
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:23,235
It doesn't work that way.

30
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,687
Tracy only contacts Kenneth
on special occasions

31
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:26,905
like Bastille Day.

32
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,323
I'm going to go ahead
and assume

33
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:29,691
that Bastille is a stripper.

34
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:31,526
As well you should.

35
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:32,911
Now there's a chance
he may call tomorrow

36
00:01:32,995 --> 00:01:34,379
because it's
his lizard's birthday.

37
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:38,166
Has it really been a year
since we were all at the Waldorf

38
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:40,535
eating that cake made out
of lizard meal?

39
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:41,720
Yup. Jeremy's almost 11.

40
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:44,422
For now, our only lead
is the pizza box

41
00:01:44,507 --> 00:01:45,807
that we saw Tracy eating from.

42
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:48,393
We traced the phone number
to a pizzeria in Queens.

43
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:50,262
Listen to me.
I sound like Cagney and Lacey,

44
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:51,763
but without the slutty clothes.

45
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:52,981
You have to find him, Lemon.

46
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:54,432
Your show works with Tracy.

47
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:57,018
And this morning, I figured out
how to fix NBC.

48
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:59,571
We will only do shows
that work.

49
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:00,772
That's nonsense.

50
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:01,740
Do you know
what the business model is

51
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:03,224
in the entertainment industry?

52
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,727
Make ten shows and hope
that one of them works.

53
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:07,996
We produce more failed pilots

54
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:09,864
than the French air force.

55
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:14,035
$15 million so far
developing a show

56
00:02:14,086 --> 00:02:16,070
called <i>Who Nose?</i>
about an investigative reporter

57
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:19,124
who can't smell and has to get
the story using only his eyes,

58
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,458
ears, and other senses.

59
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,460
You underestimated me,
congressman,

60
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:23,712
because I can't smell.

61
00:02:23,763 --> 00:02:26,131
But you made one mistake.

62
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:28,433
You let me see the documents.

63
00:02:28,517 --> 00:02:32,220
So from now on, no more
throwing good money after bad.

64
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:36,424
Only what works. $10 million
developing <i>Dad 2.0?</i>

65
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:38,727
Not on my watch.

66
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:40,228
Your father may be gone,

67
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,613
but before he died,

68
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:43,698
he programmed me
to take his place.

69
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,150
No. Shut it down.

70
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:46,818
This is terrible.

71
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:48,102
So what's going on?

72
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:49,487
Is Tracy coming back
or what?

73
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:50,955
Well, I don't know.

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,157
Well, what do you know?

75
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:53,458
What do you even do?

76
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:54,793
I'm the producer
of the show.

77
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,995
Right, that's what
your wife told me

78
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,446
in the shower this morning.

79
00:02:59,832 --> 00:03:01,883
All right, well,
we're all having fun,

80
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,918
and it's important that we all
be able to laugh together.

81
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,053
Yeah, we're not laughing
with you.

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,755
We're laughing at you,
you bald bitch.

83
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:10,091
Yes, Reggie, I am bald.

84
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:12,143
I lost my hair
at a very early age

85
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:14,262
when I hit that Gypsy's kid
with my car,

86
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:15,963
but I am still your boss.

87
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:18,516
Hey, bald bitch.

88
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:22,520
Hey, that's you.

89
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:24,472
- No, I get it.
- He's being you.

90
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:25,857
Yeah, I get it.
I get it.

91
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:28,993
Listen up, fives.
A ten is speaking.

92
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,612
As you may have heard,

93
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:32,747
the Jennababy dolls
I've been selling on QVC

94
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:33,865
have been recalled.

95
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:35,483
Apparently
they were just being used

96
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:37,652
to smuggle cocaine
into the country from Mexico.

97
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:40,455
And that's caused some problems.

98
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:42,457
Let's just go
to soccer practice now.

99
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,708
I mean right now.

100
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,927
Yes. It's 4:00 in the morning.
Let's do it.

101
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,629
We own this town.

102
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,348
Jennababies were my backup
if <i>TGS</i> gets cancelled,

103
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,302
but don't worry because I have
a backup to my backup.

104
00:03:54,353 --> 00:03:55,520
We don't ever worry
about you.

105
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:56,671
We don't think about you.

106
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:58,440
That's right, Frank.

107
00:03:58,507 --> 00:03:59,524
I booked a movie.

108
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:02,527
It's called
<i>Take my Hand.</i>

109
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:06,147
It's kind of an artsy character
study about a young woman

110
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:08,182
who has a lot of holes
drilled into her head

111
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:11,152
by a deranged veterinarian
named Slaughterface.

112
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:13,905
Oh, so you're doing
a torture porn thing like <i>Saw.</i>

113
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:17,492
Exactly. In fact,
the producers of this movie

114
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:19,661
rented <i>Saw</i>
and watched it.

115
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:22,163
So let me know
if Tracy comes back.

116
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:24,549
Until then, I will be
in Stamford, Connecticut.

117
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:26,668
We're shooting there
for tax reasons.

118
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:28,386
On an unrelated matter,

119
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:31,756
does anyone know where I can get
intimate bleaching done

120
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:32,757
in Stamford, Connecticut?

121
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,392
Anyone?

122
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,229
I'm leaving to do a movie,
Pete.

123
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,098
What? No!
You can't do that.

124
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:42,400
That's what your wife told me
in the shower this morning.

125
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:44,853
Ha.

126
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,739
Can we order lunch
from Ikea?

127
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:49,223
What?
No.

128
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:51,192
I'm the producer.
I'm picking lunch today.

129
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,361
Okay.
We'll have a contest of strength

130
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:55,697
to decide who gets
to pick lunch.

131
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,588
Who's next?

132
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:06,641
Welcome to Federici's.

133
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,209
What can I get
for you guys?

134
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,345
Well, as hard as it is
to believe,

135
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:12,981
given our apparent ages,
this is my son.

136
00:05:13,048 --> 00:05:15,767
- Seems about right.
- Okay, good.

137
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:19,270
My son is currently studying
at a local pizza academy.

138
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:20,889
Really? Which one?

139
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,608
New York Pizza Academy.

140
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:24,926
Well, then I hate you,

141
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:27,445
'cause I'm a Pizza Academy
of New York man.

142
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:29,981
Wonderful.

143
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:33,234
So what fraternity
are you pledging?

144
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:34,953
I'm not.

145
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:37,906
There are no fraternities
at New York Pizza Academy.

146
00:05:37,957 --> 00:05:40,325
That's right. You correctly
answered my trick question.

147
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,277
Now I'm bound
by pizza academy tradition

148
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:44,629
to grant you any request.

149
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,831
Wow, this could not have gone
any better.

150
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,049
We need to see
all your delivery receipts

151
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,501
from the last two months.

152
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:53,287
Oh, you got that delivery
receipt exam coming up, huh?

153
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,923
What a bear.

154
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:56,290
Here you go.

155
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:58,259
Take your time.

156
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,963
I'll be in the back trying to
think of other ways to help you.

157
00:06:02,014 --> 00:06:07,301
Well, this is obviously
a dead end.

158
00:06:10,356 --> 00:06:12,357
Yeah!

159
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,142
Eat your weakness.

160
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,149
Congratulations.

161
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,651
According
to the transitive property,

162
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,653
you just defeated Muammar
Qaddafi in arm wrestling.

163
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:27,989
Yes!

164
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,657
This would have bothered me
in my 20s.

165
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,626
Pete, how are you so good
at that?

166
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,661
I don't know.
I never work out.

167
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,263
Paula!

168
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,347
Here comes the big girl.

169
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:37,715
She's got a clarinet.

170
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:41,352
Pete, lunch is your pick.

171
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:42,720
Takeout from Hooters.

172
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:44,672
What?
That makes no sense.

173
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,524
We'll know they touched it.

174
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:03,575
No one's coming to save you.

175
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,661
Oh, God.
Who are you?

176
00:07:06,712 --> 00:07:08,329
Cut!

177
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,049
I just got a text
from the studio.

178
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,584
We're shutting down production.

179
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,636
- What?
- But I turned down <i>Carousel</i>

180
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,671
- at the Goodspeed for this.
- I'm sorry, Dana,

181
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:18,640
but our budget depends
on getting a tax break

182
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:21,042
from Connecticut, and they say
we're not portraying the State

183
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:22,143
in a positive light.

184
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,062
How are we not doing that,
Shawn?

185
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:26,714
I'm a little baffled
over here.

186
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:28,850
Yeah, no, it's just that
we're spending taxpayer money

187
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,985
saying there's a veterinarian
running around Connecticut

188
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:31,986
trying to make
a house out of breasts

189
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:33,271
for the Governor to live in.

190
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:36,240
But there's a positive message
at the end of it.

191
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,359
If you're a woman
in Connecticut,

192
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,728
Slaughterface will kill you.

193
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,532
This must be it.

194
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,833
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:47,085
There have been several
deliveries to this address

196
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:49,337
of Mr. Jordan's
signature order...

197
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:51,923
large cheese pizza
with one slice taken out

198
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,741
so I can pretend
I'm eating pac-man

199
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,259
like my hero
Blinky the ghost.

200
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:11,559
I hear someone coming.

201
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:18,265
Well, well, well.

202
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:20,151
You found me.

203
00:08:20,235 --> 00:08:23,071
After I ordered Thai food
and gave you this address.

204
00:08:23,122 --> 00:08:24,989
Yeah?

205
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:29,077
I'm sorry. I thought
my friend was living here.

206
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,111
And my best friend.

207
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,713
Oh, is this awkward?

208
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,332
Because I'm your best friend,
but you're not my best friend?

209
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:35,616
No.
No one living here.

210
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:37,001
At least not since we moved in
two weeks ago.

211
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:40,922
Wait a minute. Was that stuff
here when you moved in?

212
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,842
A copy of <i>Black Yachts</i> magazine

213
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:48,146
and a Rubik's cube that
has been smashed out of anger.

214
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,014
Mr. Jordan was here.

215
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:51,265
So what, Kenneth?

216
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:52,934
These guys have been here
for two weeks.

217
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,102
Tracy could be anywhere.

218
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:55,603
We're never gonna find him,

219
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:57,021
<i>TGS</i> is gonna get cancelled,
and then what?

220
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:58,156
Can I work here?

221
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,607
I'll do anything.

222
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:01,526
I'll get in my bra,
and you could throw nails at me.

223
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,527
I'll dance for you.

224
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:03,661
Miss Lemon.

225
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:05,329
Don't panic.

226
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,532
We have other options.

227
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:10,451
But for instance...
Mr. Jordan!

228
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:12,870
Where are you?
Come back!

229
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:17,759
For the love of God,
come back or we'll die!

230
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,759
Jack, can we talk?

231
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:21,009
One ten to another.

232
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,665
I'm an 11, but continue.

233
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:25,284
Me, my ass double,
and a drill that once appeared

234
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:26,819
on <i>Home Improvement</i>
are currently starring

235
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,621
in a feature film
called <i>Take my Hand.</i>

236
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:30,823
Really? Years ago,
Universal had a project

237
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:31,824
by that name.

238
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,042
It was a romantic comedy

239
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,378
with Reese Witherspoon
and Patrick Dempsey.

240
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:38,163
Reese Witherspoon's
just a likeable version of me.

241
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:41,017
Then she dropped out, and it
was rewritten as a buddy comedy

242
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,885
with Dempsey and Josh Hartnett.

243
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:44,970
But everyone fell asleep
during the table read,

244
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:46,522
so we moved it over
to Telemundo

245
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:48,858
where they tried to turn it
into a variety show

246
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:52,478
hosted by a supermodel and
a soccer ball with a mustache.

247
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:55,865
I met that soccer ball once
at a no-hands-allowed sex party.

248
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:57,283
Then after another round
of rewrites,

249
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,784
it was picked up
by our low-budget thriller,

250
00:09:58,852 --> 00:10:00,519
high-budget porno division,
Splatterflix,

251
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,824
and now it's a horror movie
starring "any blonde actress."

252
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,909
Thank you.

253
00:10:06,993 --> 00:10:09,328
Wait, that's our project?

254
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:12,698
This is exactly what
I was talking to Lemon about.

255
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:15,084
Three years,
millions on rewrites,

256
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:20,005
$20,000 in first-class flights
for the drill.

257
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:21,891
And we still have nothing
to show for it.

258
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:23,175
And we never will.

259
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:24,393
We just got shut down

260
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:25,978
because Connecticut's
being a douche bag.

261
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,313
They won't give us
a tax break

262
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,881
unless the movie
promotes tourism.

263
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,399
Then we make the movie
pro-Connecticut.

264
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:34,570
We are not losing any more money
on <i>Take my Hand.</i>

265
00:10:34,654 --> 00:10:37,440
Okay, we just need to hire
some of those ugly people

266
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:40,693
who have the paper
and change the shapes on it.

267
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:42,611
Writers?
No.

268
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,280
We'll do the work ourselves.

269
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,617
Meet me in my dressing room.

270
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:50,736
I'll get a computer
from one of the ugly people.

271
00:10:50,787 --> 00:10:53,706
And I'll bring the world's
greatest encyclopedia...

272
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:56,742
my mind.

273
00:10:59,346 --> 00:11:01,079
Hey, is that a to-do list?

274
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:02,765
'Cause if your wife's on there,
I've already taken care of her.

275
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,636
I challenge you
to the wrestling of arms.

276
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:09,472
- What?
- Arm wrestling.

277
00:11:09,556 --> 00:11:11,256
On the stage.
Midnight.

278
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:13,392
In front of everyone.
How about tomorrow?

279
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:15,111
Seems like it would be
more convenient for people.

280
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:18,781
I'll meet you
anytime, anywhere.

281
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:21,700
I just have to work
around a PTA meeting at 5:00

282
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:25,154
that I can't miss, 'cause,
this week, I'm snack dad.

283
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:36,549
Lemon, you look terrible.

284
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:38,334
And I once watched you eat
oysters while you had a cold.

285
00:11:38,418 --> 00:11:40,085
We had him, Jack,
and we lost him.

286
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:42,221
So Kenneth and I had to spend
the rest of the afternoon

287
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:43,806
trying to think
like Tracy.

288
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,425
I ended up eating a swordfish
dinner at a strip club,

289
00:11:46,476 --> 00:11:48,894
and Kenneth grabbed a cop's gun
and shot a blimp.

290
00:11:48,962 --> 00:11:51,013
Well, tomorrow's another day,
so go home,

291
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:52,731
have a glass of wine,
and watch a show

292
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,849
about wedding cake disasters.

293
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,267
I can't go home, Jack.

294
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:57,269
<i>TGS</i> goes away
if I don't find Tracy.

295
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,156
I'm gonna wait up and hope
that he calls his lizard.

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,473
Did you make sure
that Tracy wasn't pretending

297
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,492
to be his own wax figure
at Madame Tussauds?

298
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:04,944
Yes.
There was some confusion,

299
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,980
and I ended up punching
the real Levar Burton.

300
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,249
I'm gonna go get Jeremy.
I hope he's not still in heat.

301
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:13,619
He has gotten
my top off before.

302
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:18,541
Here you go.

303
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,925
Did you know
that Connecticut is home

304
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:23,161
to the oldest public library
in the United States?

305
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,681
Huh. Could you use that
to motivate Slaughterface

306
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,666
sewing the sheriff's mouth
to his own anus?

307
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,221
Of course. Elegant.

308
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:34,190
Should vaginatorium
be capitalized?

309
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:40,479
Oh!

310
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,180
I cannot wait to humiliate

311
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:44,200
that guy in front of all
of his meathead buddies.

312
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:45,951
You're like a new man, Pete.

313
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,069
Yeah, I am.

314
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,320
Last night,
I had sex with Paula,

315
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:49,822
and neither of us
was wearing a walkman.

316
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:51,023
Oh, yeah.

317
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,025
Why are you
picking him up now?

318
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,693
I'm supposed to have him
till the weekend.

319
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:56,361
Shane wanted to come home,

320
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,630
'cause his dad's a loser.

321
00:12:57,697 --> 00:12:59,698
Did your show
get cancelled yet?

322
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:01,500
We don't know, Stephanie.
We're waiting for Tracy

323
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:03,368
to Skype with Liz
and Jeremy the lizard.

324
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,056
You're a joke. David is taking
us all to Outback Steakhouse,

325
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,207
and we're getting appetizers,

326
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,543
'cause David can afford them.

327
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:14,563
Well, of course he can.
Mr. big shot pet photographer.

328
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:16,181
I hope he can sleep at night.

329
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,716
Never thought
I'd feel sorry for a guy

330
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:20,552
with a tattoo of a leprechaun
vomiting on a book.

331
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,912
No one's coming to save you.

332
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:48,747
- Oh.
- Because we're deep

333
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:53,052
inside one of Connecticut's
30 beautiful state forests.

334
00:13:53,603 --> 00:13:54,436
30!

335
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,855
Oh, please,
don't kill me.

336
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,642
I still haven't tried
the famous seafood pizza

337
00:13:59,726 --> 00:14:00,943
at Sally's in New Haven.

338
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:02,778
And cut.

339
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:05,430
Great. All right.
Let's move on to the scene

340
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:07,566
where Slaughterface centipedes
Jenna to the docent

341
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,034
of the Danbury Railway Museum.

342
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:11,203
Hold on.
I just spoke to Walmart.

343
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,789
They sponsor
wholesome TV programming,

344
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:15,074
and I've convinced them

345
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,325
to get into the movie business.

346
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:18,410
They will partially fund
this project

347
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,629
if we make it family-friendly.

348
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:22,965
I can never find stuff
to watch with my kids.

349
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:24,282
Thank you, Walmart.

350
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:26,085
This production
will be profitable.

351
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:29,805
Jenna, to your dressing room
to write.

352
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,642
It begins with the words.

353
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:37,313
Reggie.

354
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:38,597
I need to show you something.

355
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:40,316
Whoa.

356
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,350
Is that your deltoid?

357
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:43,986
I'm gonna beat you, Reggie.

358
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,187
But I don't want to.

359
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:46,772
I saw you in the lobby
with Stephanie

360
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:50,142
and Shane talking
about David and appetizers.

361
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,027
Look, I know what it's like
for your kids

362
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:53,245
to think you're a loser.

363
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:55,531
Which is why I'm gonna throw
the match.

364
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:57,983
Wow.
You would do that for me?

365
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,373
Know what your wife told me
in the shower this morning?

366
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:05,708
You're a good guy.

367
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:13,849
Oh, miss Lemon,

368
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,667
wake up.
It's him.

369
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,669
Okay, this is it,
Parcell.

370
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:18,804
We got to keep Tracy
on the line,

371
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:19,838
so draw him out.

372
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,473
Don't spook him.
Act normal.

373
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,561
Hello.
I'm a baby.

374
00:15:25,645 --> 00:15:27,112
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

375
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,647
- You got in my head.
- Hang on.

376
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:30,983
Something's not right.

377
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:32,868
Why is Jeremy acting so weird?

378
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:34,203
I don't like this.

379
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:36,405
- Hey, Tracy, don't hang up.
- Uh-oh.

380
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,991
Jeremy, call me
when you're alone.

381
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,162
I'm sorry, miss Lemon.

382
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,881
Don't be.
I know where he is.

383
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,374
Merry Christmas!

384
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,376
I practice abstinence.

385
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:54,078
Connecticut!

386
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:55,212
And cut.

387
00:15:57,516 --> 00:15:59,383
We're not done yet.
Ladies and gentlemen,

388
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,635
this is Phil Rosenthal,

389
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:02,937
the creator
of the acclaimed show

390
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:03,938
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

391
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,056
Last great sitcom.

392
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:07,141
Still does a 3.4 share
in Syndication.

393
00:16:07,225 --> 00:16:08,726
I did okay.

394
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:10,311
I have a refrigerator
that's just for sodas.

395
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:13,030
Anyway, Phil is interested
in getting into acting.

396
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,815
- I got the bug.
- And has offered

397
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,901
to pay us $5 million

398
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,102
to be in the movie.

399
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,453
I'll rewrite the part myself.

400
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:21,271
You know what, why don't we
just get one as written,

401
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:22,323
and then we'll play with it.

402
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:24,625
You are a guest here, Phil.

403
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,443
Hello, Phil.

404
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:27,995
I never heard back
about my audition

405
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,113
for <i>Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

406
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:30,464
I'd wondered
if you made a decision.

407
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,466
Yeah, 15 years ago.

408
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:33,834
We went with Doris Roberts.

409
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,221
But thank you for tying
your headshot around a brick

410
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,806
and throwing it
through my window.

411
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,512
Go ahead, bald bitch.
Go ahead.

412
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:46,897
Thanks for doing this.

413
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,632
I convinced my ex

414
00:16:48,684 --> 00:16:51,135
to drop off my kid so
he could see me being a winner.

415
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:53,354
You rock.

416
00:16:53,438 --> 00:16:55,189
No one's gonna know
that you did this

417
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:57,141
or that you're actually stronger
than me.

418
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:58,359
It doesn't matter.

419
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:01,812
All that matters
is I'm doing the right thing.

420
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:04,148
That's real strength.

421
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:26,854
Ha.
I beat you.

422
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:28,723
We're getting lunch
from Ikea.

423
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:32,843
- Ikea!
- Ikea! Ikea!

424
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,312
Ikea! Ikea!

425
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:42,853
That's fine.
Don't offer your guest anything.

426
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,239
Wax statue.

427
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:47,541
Darn it.
I thought we had him.

428
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:48,826
Are you kidding me?

429
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:49,877
You have been hiding

430
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,545
in my apartment
for the last two weeks?

431
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,630
What are you mad about?

432
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,498
I'm waiving the $60,000
you owe me

433
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:55,833
in appearance fees.

434
00:17:55,884 --> 00:17:58,169
Did you really think
I wouldn't recognize

435
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,005
my college futon with its
trademark absence of sex stains?

436
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,224
This is the stupidest idea
you've ever had.

437
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:04,708
Really?
Think about it.

438
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,543
<i>TGS</i> is your whole life.

439
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,378
So where's the last place
you would be

440
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,347
if you were out
trying to save your show?

441
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:13,050
Home. Life lesson
from an unlikely source.

442
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:14,935
The only thing I do here
is sleep.

443
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,188
I know.
I seen you do it.

444
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,656
You're having a dream.

445
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,658
Is this your only mustard?

446
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,526
Huh? What?
Yeah.

447
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:24,612
You're the one who wrote

448
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,914
"every kind of mustard"
on my shopping list.

449
00:18:26,998 --> 00:18:29,366
And yet you still don't have
the one I'm thinking of.

450
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,419
It's red.
It says ketchup on it.

451
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:34,121
Oh, I hear it.
That's on me.

452
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,540
Look, Tracy.

453
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:37,875
I don't know
why you're going crazy,

454
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:38,876
but I want to help.

455
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:40,261
Just come back to <i>TGS.</i>

456
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:41,929
You don't think I want to,
L.L.?

457
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:43,798
Then why are you hiding?

458
00:18:43,882 --> 00:18:46,467
Oh, no, did you
also spill ice cream

459
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:48,269
on your mom's boyfriend's
record player?

460
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:51,889
As a time saver, I will refer
to the two of you as Klemon.

461
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,424
I wanted that next level,
Klemon.

462
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,227
Now, remember,
to save time,

463
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:57,444
you two are Klemon.

464
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:59,563
- It's a combination of...
- Just keep going.

465
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,431
I had everything I dreamed of.

466
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:05,236
Awards, respect,
Justin Long's autograph.

467
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:07,771
But I also got expectations.

468
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:09,790
People thought
I could change the world.

469
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,876
And it's too much pressure.

470
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:15,212
Like the time I got stuck in
Temple Grandin's hugging machine

471
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,446
at the Golden Globes party.

472
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:19,166
You pretended
to be in Africa

473
00:19:19,251 --> 00:19:21,118
so that no one
would be disappointed in you.

474
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,137
I'm sorry I did this to you,
half of Klemon.

475
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,672
I had no choice.

476
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:27,124
Sean Penn wanted me to go
to Haiti with him.

477
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:28,342
And I'm not strong enough

478
00:19:28,426 --> 00:19:30,294
for the pain
and the human misery

479
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:31,729
of a three-hour plane ride

480
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,814
with Sean Penn.

481
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:35,132
I'm tired of hiding.

482
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:37,818
I just want my old life back.

483
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,854
Then you need to get people
to stop respecting you

484
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:41,689
and start remembering
what an idiot you are.

485
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:43,657
You're off the leash,
Tracy.

486
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:46,861
It's not a leash.
It's a very long skin tag.

487
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,362
You want your old life back?

488
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:50,664
You're Tracy Jordan.

489
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:53,650
Hulk Hogan called you
a dirt bag.

490
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:56,370
The NAACP once hired someone
to kill you.

491
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:59,540
You wore a penis hat
to princess Diana's funeral.

492
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:02,009
Because I had worn it
to their wedding.

493
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:03,994
It was special
to the three of us.

494
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:07,331
You were the worst,
and you can be again.

495
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:08,883
You just have to go out there

496
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,385
and remind people
who you really are.

497
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:15,172
Go trash a hotel room,
expose yourself to Elmo,

498
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:16,724
visit OJ in jail again,

499
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:19,343
attack the Lincoln Memorial
with a hammer.

500
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:22,846
I have to burn
all my goodwill.

501
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,531
Then they won't expect anything
from me.

502
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,317
And you can go back
to your old life

503
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,035
and <i>TGS.</i>

504
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:31,038
Tracy Jordan
is off the leash!

505
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:39,880
Godspeed, Mr. Jordan.

510
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:51,854
I can't believe
that amazing rap is available

511
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:53,272
now on iTunes.

512
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Are you kidding?

513
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
No one's gonna pay to see that.

514
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,200
It doesn't matter, It's already
profitable. It works, Lemon.

515
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,000
<i>To vote for Phil Rosenthal
text "Phil" to 62288,</i>

516
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,300
Vote? For what? Isn't this
supposed to be a movie?

517
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,000
Again, it doesn´t matter. People will
just to anything to get 99 cents of text.

518
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, I'm not letting Rosenthal win
I am voting for the muppet.
