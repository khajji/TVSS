1
00:00:02,013 --> 00:00:04,131
- How's it going in there?
- Great.

2
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:06,739
Trying on jeans is my favorite thing.

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,047
Maybe later I can get a paps mirror
from an old male doctor.

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,812
Oh, come on, Liz.
This store is cool.

5
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:14,496
It's huge with all the young people.

6
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:16,470
I mean... all the us.

7
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:18,748
This place is trying way too hard.

8
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:20,735
Why are there straightjackets
everywhere?

9
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:22,203
Because before this was
a clothing store,

10
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,571
it was a mental hospital.

11
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,906
It's winky and fun, Liz.

12
00:00:24,974 --> 00:00:28,860
Okay, I tried them on.
Can we go now?

13
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:30,478
Liz Lemon, you look hot.

14
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,146
Really?

15
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:34,949
I swear to Kaballah monster.

16
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:37,085
Those jeans are perfect.
Look at your butt.

17
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:39,821
<i>Oh, my God.
Is that me?</i>

18
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:40,989
Liz, it's the dream.

19
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,757
Boy on the bottom,
girl on the top.

20
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,411
<i>O.M. God,
those jeans are zing!</i>

21
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:50,231
This online slang dictionary
says it's short for "amazing."

22
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,634
Or it's a club drug made
from a tooth whitener.

23
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:53,902
Either way you win.

24
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:56,588
I'll wear these jeans out, and
I'll take ten more pairs!

25
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:59,574
'Tastic. Shall I put the pants
you had on in with the jeans?

26
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,609
No. Burn them.

27
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:03,344
<i>Burn them!</i>

28
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:16,081

<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

29
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,531
I'm sorry I was late
this morning, sir.

30
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,568
- I was attacked in my apartment...
- Quiet.

31
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:27,752
Congressional candidate
Regina Bookman...

32
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:29,103
Are they really talking
about that woman?

33
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,573
...Making political hay
out of the wheat field

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,841
that is the NBC-Kabletown
merger...

35
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:36,811
Who wrote this?
Jared, honestly?

36
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,613
Bookman told reporters, quote,

37
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,966
"The merger of NBC and Kabletown
is bad for the consumer.

38
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:43,935
"I don't trust
their executive leadership,

39
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,803
<i>"and Kabletown still has
an auxiliary button</i>

40
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,555
"on their remote.

41
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:48,840
"What is that for?

42
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,325
It just makes the screen
go blue."

43
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,293
Why is she still talking
about the merger?

44
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:54,629
She said I had three months
to make NBC more diverse.

45
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,630
It's not your fault
nobody watched

46
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,699
<i>America's next top black guy.</i>

47
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:59,601
Bookman, amping up
the rhetoric in a tight race.

48
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:01,235
Polls have her in a dead heat

49
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:03,204
with out-of-nowhere challenger
Steven Austin.

50
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:07,041
Wait a second.
There's a chance she could lose?

51
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:09,177
Bookman is obviously holding
a gun to my head.

52
00:02:09,244 --> 00:02:11,963
And no matter what I do,
she obviously wants me to fail.

53
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:14,449
But if she loses...
This isn't a conversation!

54
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,917
But if she loses,

55
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:18,219
I won't have to worry
about her scuttling the merger.

56
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:20,421
Jonathan,
get her opponent in here.

57
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:24,125
Whoever he is, he just made
a very powerful friend.

58
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:26,427
I thought you said you didn't
need any more friends.

59
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:34,519
'Zing leg-tubes, Liz.

60
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:35,937
Vunderhinder!

61
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,355
They're from Brooklyn Without Limits.

62
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,341
It's this very cool store
with locations in Gay Town,

63
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:43,811
White Harlem, and the Van
Beardswick section of Brooklyn.

64
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,812
And they don't just look great.
See the tag?

65
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,281
"Handmade in U.S.A."

66
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,484
Because BWL is all about
fair trade

67
00:02:50,536 --> 00:02:53,488
and local artisans
and staying green.

68
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,156
These jeans totally make up

69
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:58,292
for all the times I took a long,
hot shower because I was bored.

70
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,028
I'm so excited for you, Liz.

71
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:01,963
Now we both have amazing butts.

72
00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,266
Make that all three of us.
Jenna, a word.

73
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,635
Specifically,
the word "talking."

74
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:10,338
Oh, and look at this.

75
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,307
J-train, as you may know,
I was in a film

76
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,776
<i>called Hard to Watch.</i>

77
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:17,178
<i>And the pundits think
I have a chance</i>

78
00:03:17,246 --> 00:03:20,064
<i>at an Oscar, and I just learned
about air quotes.</i>

79
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:22,016
Yes. I talked about
your movie

80
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,318
with my therapist
last week for 20 hours.

81
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:25,653
I know this is difficult
for you.

82
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:26,954
I'm fine.

83
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:29,323
Talking with Dr. Linda
helped me realize

84
00:03:29,391 --> 00:03:31,459
I have just as much
going on in my life.

85
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:33,861
My exercise video
is dropping soon.

86
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:35,863
<i>It's called
Jenna Gets Hard.</i>

87
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,053
Well, if you're okay talking
about it, I need your help.

88
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:44,338
These reporters want to
come do a story on me.

89
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,840
They're from something called

90
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:48,676
the Hollywood
foreign press association.

91
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:50,445
HOFPA?

92
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,947
- Yeah.
- That's the Golden Globes.

93
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:56,084
The second-most-important awards
in Hollywood...

94
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:58,853
After the People's Choice
Awards...

95
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,389
Where the fans are in charge.

96
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,457
So what do you think
I should do?

97
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:06,060
You could have a special screening for them...
host a luncheon.

98
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:11,199
And when the time is right...
Be bad at snapping. Got it.

99
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:15,136
No, Tracy.
You could try to bribe them.

100
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:19,474
I mean, a Golden Globe is
a stepping stone to an Oscar.

101
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,709
How bad do you want it?

102
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,979
I'm not an expert at morality,
but isn't that wrong?

103
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:29,350
You're asking me?

104
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:32,887
So this is the man who's
gonna bring down Regina Bookman.

105
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:36,157
Rhode Island's own
Steven Austin!

106
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,476
Actually, I go by Steve Austin.

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,311
That way people see
my name on ballots,

108
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:42,814
they think I'm the wrestler,
and they vote for me.

109
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:44,332
I've been reading up
on you, Steve.

110
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,934
Honestly, I want to like you.

111
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:50,271
But I see that you're not affiliated
with the republican party.

112
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:51,989
The party system
is broken, Jack.

113
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,074
I don't believe in parties.

114
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:56,644
I don't join 'em, and I never get
invited to 'em...Hint, hint.

115
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:57,745
You're an individual.

116
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,665
A Maverick.

117
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:01,949
People like you are succeeding

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,085
because Americans are fed up
with the status quo.

119
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:05,636
Exactly.

120
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,854
They're tired of the direction
this country's headed in.

121
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:08,790
They want to return
to our past glory.

122
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,424
They want an American
renaissance!

123
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:11,459
I like what I'm hearing, Steve.

124
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:14,395
Then you're gonna love
the sound of this.

125
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:15,963
Goo goo gaa gaa, Jack.

126
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,298
What's that?

127
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,733
That's the theme
of my campaign.

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,601
Renaissance means rebirth.

129
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,738
I want to usher in
the rebirth of this country.

130
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:26,174
That's why the theme
of all my campaign commercials

131
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,042
is "I'm a baby."

132
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,178
This country has lost its way.

133
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:33,214
We need to start over and return
to what made our nation great.

134
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,816
My name is Steve Austin,

135
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:36,717
and I'm a lifelong resident
of Rhode Island,

136
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,753
and the manager of a local
paintball facility.

137
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,588
I will clean out Washington,

138
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:42,990
like it's the bathroom
of a paintball facility.

139
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:44,542
Vote Steve Austin.

140
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,094
And if you're blind,
I am the wrestler.

141
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:48,629
Right.

142
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:50,598
I like a lot
of what you're saying, Steve,

143
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,717
but before I throw
my support behind you,

144
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,101
I do have a litmus test.

145
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:56,470
Okay. Can I take that
in two weeks?

146
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,839
No, it's just questions.

147
00:05:57,906 --> 00:06:00,074
What do you think the role
of the government should be?

148
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,443
Limited. I believe
in small government.

149
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:04,512
- Excellent answer.
- Or no government at all.

150
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,681
If it works in Antarctica,
why can't it work here?

151
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:09,984
But if we have to have government,
make it as small as possible.

152
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:13,687
Dwarves, tiny buildings...
Pizza bagels for lunch.

153
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,790
Maybe we should stop
at small government.

154
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,992
Let's cut to the chase.

155
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,595
I need you to assure me you
would never allow the government

156
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:23,364
to interfere with the sale
of one company to another.

157
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,566
Of course not. The government
shouldn't interfere in anything!

158
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,802
What happens inside
a man's own rain poncho

159
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,870
at a minor league baseball
game is his own business.

160
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,640
Well, Steve, we should stop
talking before I change my mind.

161
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,475
But I do want to host
a fundraiser for you,

162
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:35,843
so give me a couple of days
to put that together.

163
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:39,113
I need to know that you
believe in my message, Jack.

164
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:42,283
Take the rattle.

165
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,254
Say "goo goo gaa gaa," Jack.

166
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:49,190
Goo goo gaa gaa.

167
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:55,437
What's going on here?

168
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:58,306
I'm helping Tracy plan for
a Golden Globes event tomorrow.

169
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:00,142
Kenneth is our
human Sushi platter,

170
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:02,944
and I'm doing a dry run
so everything will be perfect...

171
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,379
For my friend Tracy.

172
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,149
Lying perfectly still
reminds me of hiding

173
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:09,301
under our porch during
a hill people rampage.

174
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:12,120
On the day, Kenneth's mouth
will be filled with wasabi

175
00:07:12,188 --> 00:07:14,556
so he don't do so much...

176
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:17,125
I should get a chafing dish
and fill it with my underwear

177
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:19,161
in case some Saudi guys
show up.

178
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:24,533
Let me get this straight.

179
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,334
You, the person who is
still jealous

180
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,286
of the attention
baby Jessica got,

181
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:32,174
are helping Tracy
win an award for acting?

182
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,842
Oh, I'm helping him, all right.

183
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:37,045
I even gave him the idea
to try to bribe them.

184
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,214
And he's gonna do that?
That's awful.

185
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:40,715
I trust award shows.

186
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,984
They tell me how much to care
about different dead people.

187
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,302
It's not gonna work.

188
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:46,621
If they could be bribed,
I would have won a golden globe

189
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:49,691
<i>for my lifetime original movie
sister, can you spare a breast?</i>

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,027
So you've tried this before?

191
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:56,932
And they were so offended,
they banned me for life.

192
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:59,167
And the same thing
will happen to Tracy.

193
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:00,836
So you're sabotaging him.

194
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:02,537
Just like I did to my niece
when she tried to sing

195
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:03,839
at our family's
Christmas party.

196
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:06,475
You know what, you and Tracy
deserve each other.

197
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,376
I don't know which of you
to be more disappointed in.

198
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:09,678
Me, silly.

199
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:11,129
I'm more aware
of what I'm doing.

200
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,919
I'm sorry, miss.

201
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:21,389
Do you know where
Liz Lemon... Good God!

202
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:24,759
Lemon, those jeans make you look
like a Mexican sports reporter.

203
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:27,028
Thank you, Jack. Hi.

204
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:30,098
Do I know you from
outside the bagel store?

205
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,333
You probably know me
from the future,

206
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,401
where I am the president
of the United States.

207
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,771
Steve Austin, Rhode Island's
independent candidate for congress.

208
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,974
Oh, yeah, somebody forwarded
me one of your campaign ads.

209
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:42,410
The rebirth of America
starts now.

210
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,579
Waaaaah!

211
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:46,748
My name is Steve Austin,
and if you're senile,

212
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:49,401
yes, I am
the six-million dollar man!

213
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:51,386
Paid for by the broken vending
machine at the paintball place.

214
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:53,421
I'm actually working
with Steve's campaign,

215
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,624
and I would like you to produce
a biographical video

216
00:08:55,691 --> 00:08:56,791
for a fundraiser I'm hosting.

217
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:57,926
Oh, my God!

218
00:08:57,994 --> 00:08:59,494
I got a zappos box
coming today,

219
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:00,629
and there's nobody there
to pick it up

220
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:02,197
because my wife left me
for my twin brother.

221
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:03,431
Can I use your phone?

222
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,166
Yeah, okay.
You don't have a cell phone?

223
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:06,568
Yeah, I got a cell phone.

224
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:10,605
I walk around all day with a CIA
tracking device in my pocket.

225
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,809
Okay, that guys is bananas.

226
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:17,845
Obviously he should not be in
congress... What are you doing?

227
00:09:17,897 --> 00:09:20,749
He's running against
Regina Bookman... I need him.

228
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:23,652
Aha. So you're putting
one more nut job...

229
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,787
Yeah, I said it... "one more."
I'm political

230
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:28,456
in Washington
so you can advance your career?

231
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:29,558
What is going on today?

232
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,359
Has everyone lost
their moral compass?

233
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:32,994
You're being awfully
high and mighty

234
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:35,463
for someone who once claimed
her husband drowned

235
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,632
so she could get out
of a gym contract.

236
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,068
The whole Kabletown deal
is resting on this,

237
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:41,536
and Austin is pro-business.

238
00:09:41,604 --> 00:09:43,538
Big business is what's
screwing up this country.

239
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:45,607
Please, Lemon, you work
for General Electric!

240
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:47,309
Technically, I am a freelancer,

241
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:49,644
which is pretty much
a modern-day cowboy.

242
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:53,565
And I live like a cowboy by buying
quality, locally made jeans.

243
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,269
Also by eating beans out of
a can due to impatience.

244
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:58,687
You're on your own here,
partner.

245
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:02,357
But hey, it's not all bad, 'cause
you get to watch me walk away.

246
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:09,831
No, no, that's not right.

247
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:12,334
Why can't the delivery guy
just leave it out back?

248
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:16,471
Yeah, I know it's not a
house, but I sleep there.

249
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:18,173
I'd like to thank
you all for coming.

250
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,742
We've heard complaints about
the Sushi platter moving...

251
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,143
We're working on it.

252
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,645
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:27,515
Tracy would be happy to take
any softball questions you have,

254
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:31,152
like the following...
What films inspire you?

255
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,054
Well, definitely
the foreign films.

256
00:10:33,122 --> 00:10:36,224
Like the political ones where you
think there'll be no boobies,

257
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:38,310
then bam! Boobies.

258
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:41,429
Tracy, what is an actor?

259
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:45,066
I think the better question is,
<i>what isn't an actor?</i>

260
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:49,037
A lamp. A couch.
That mirror.

261
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:50,405
Or a hidden pistol.

262
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:55,327
An actor...

263
00:10:55,411 --> 00:11:00,248
And now, amidst a day of
wonders, one wonder more.

264
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:03,618
<i>A special voters-only screening
of Hard to Watch,</i>

265
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:07,955
<i>based on the book Stone Cold
Bummer, by manipulate.</i>

266
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:14,562
They call New York
the Big Apple.

267
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,065
Never seemed that way to me.

268
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,900
I used to have dreams.

269
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:21,102
I was an all-city
running back,

270
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,274
and I was gonna run out of here
to college, the suburbs.

271
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:31,813
Now the only thing I use a
football for is as a toilet.

272
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:34,482
Funny thing to happen
to a guy named "lucky."

273
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:40,655
♪ ♪

274
00:11:40,723 --> 00:11:43,224
I am a constitutional
originalist,

275
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,494
and I believe that our
founding fathers had it right.

276
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:48,863
We need to get back
to their America.

277
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,598
No paved roads.

278
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,767
Rum used as an anesthetic.

279
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:53,835
Legalized slavery.

280
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:56,004
All right.
Some good pieces.

281
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:57,505
Jack, you want to see
my hand gestures?

282
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,507
I have you listen to me!

283
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,860
Forceful conclusion.

284
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,812
There's work to be done.

285
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,914
Hand me that shovel so I can
dig a grave for her.

286
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,348
Okay, let's cut.

287
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,119
Sir, look at this
Bookman photo op.

288
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:14,022
"Representative Bookman greets
young voters at Warwick mall."

289
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,791
She's courting the youth vote.
That means she's desperate.

290
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,193
My generation never votes.

291
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,295
It interferes with talking
about ourselves all the time.

292
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,464
She's running scared.
God, this could work.

293
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:24,833
Now all I have to do is
whip Austin into shape.

294
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:26,634
Hey, Jack,
just to have options,

295
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,470
should we do
a couple takes with Binky?

296
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:29,971
- Let's take five.
- Wow.

297
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:31,923
You're really going ahead
with this.

298
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,441
Lemon, I'm not about
to take criticism

299
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:34,776
from someone wearing
that tee shirt.

300
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:37,145
Hey, don't talk down
Brooklyn Without Limits.

301
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:39,147
Stores like this are
saving the world.

302
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:41,416
Really? You're gonna lecture
me about big business again?

303
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:43,551
Do you know who owns
Brooklyn without limits?

304
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:44,602
Brooklyn Zack.

305
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:45,954
He throws pool parties
in dumpsters.

306
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:47,889
Halliburton.
In the mid-'90s,

307
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:49,157
they found themselves
with a surplus

308
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:50,959
of canvas waterboarding hoods,

309
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:53,094
so they had sweatshops make them
into messenger bags

310
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:55,563
to sell to outer-borough
idiots.

311
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:57,198
You don't know
what you're talking about.

312
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,667
Handmade in USA.

313
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:02,003
Your magic jeans are from BWL?

314
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,739
Oh, Lemon,
it's not handmade in USA.

315
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:07,175
<i>It's pronounced
hond-made in oosa.</i>

316
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:10,145
The hond people are
a vietnamese slave tribe,

317
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:12,147
and USA is their island prison.

318
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:14,382
<i>They made your jeans.</i>

319
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,451
You know how they get
the stitching so small?

320
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,052
Orphans.

321
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,687
No!
Brooklyn Zack is real.

322
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,639
He just got back from Peru,
where he met a family

323
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:23,558
that's been making hats
for 2,000 years.

324
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,059
We all make our compromises.

325
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,395
At least I'm doing it
for our company, for jobs.

326
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:30,765
You're doing it for your ass!

327
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:33,902
I don't believe you.

328
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,770
The liberal media would have
told me about this.

329
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:37,122
There's no such thing.

330
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,107
<i>The New York times is owned
by  NYT incorporated,</i>

331
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,909
which is owned by
Altheon Ballistic Dynamics,

332
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,510
which is owned by
the Murdoch family,

333
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:45,747
who are owned...
By Halliburton.

334
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,704
It goes all the way to the top.

335
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,456
How can you work here?

336
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,141
Do you know
who owns this place?

337
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,910
Halliburton, bitch.
So what?

338
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,144
But look at you!

339
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,547
You're meticulously groomed,
and...

340
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:10,482
and you turned a tie
into a belt.

341
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,100
Oh, so gay men
can't be conservative?

342
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,351
<i>You're so 'norant.
That's short for ignorant.</i>

343
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,887
That's short for "ignorant."

344
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,955
And who are you to judge?

345
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,640
You're still wearing
those jeans.

346
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:24,162
Ah...Che Guevara...
If only you knew what this place stood for.

347
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,431
His great grandfather was
Domingo Halliburton.

348
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,074
Wow!

349
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,276
I haven't seen so many suits
since my trial.

350
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:43,448
I have an idea. I know these
people, so let me do the talking.

351
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,251
Oh, uh, Steve?

352
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,719
Of course you know Ed Perlman.

353
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:51,840
Perlman, isn't that last name Jew...

354
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,091
New strategy.

355
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,426
I'll raise the money,
and you stay in here

356
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,428
and cultivate an aura
of mystery.

357
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,263
Ooh, good idea.
Maybe I'll add to it

358
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,966
by making some mysterious
sounds.

359
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,604
- Oooooohhh... Yeeee-eeee...
- I love it.

360
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,875
Oowwww...
I'll go to jail in Deshawn's place

361
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,443
'cause he's my brother.

362
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:12,777
Don't say nothin'.

363
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,780
Sometimes you gotta do
the right thing...

364
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,650
Even when the wrong thing is
a whole lot easier.

365
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,754
Now let's just have one last
happy dinner together...

366
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,489
As a family!

367
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,227
Your mother exploded.

368
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,775
I got them
right where I want them.

369
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,411
Time to do a little
Golden Globe shopping.

370
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:54,252
No, Tracy... That movie gave
me drunk-in-the-bathtub face.

371
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,987
We need to talk.

372
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:59,691
Thank you for coming.

373
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:02,093
Well, you were right
about Brooklyn Without Limits.

374
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,931
Crunchy on the outside,
right-wing nut job on the inside.

375
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,766
Like Anne Coulter's underwear.

376
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,167
But I see you're still
wearing the jeans.

377
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,703
I know!
They look so good.

378
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:14,506
And I'm skyping later with Carol,
and we like to dance together.

379
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,208
And I want to do
this "back it up" move

380
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,143
that I haven't been able
to pull off since high school.

381
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,079
It's like...
♪ back it up, back it up ♪

382
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,314
♪ and drop it like it's hot ♪

383
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,481
♪ drop it like it's hot ♪

384
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,267
♪ I will haunt your dreams ♪

385
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,120
So fine, I'm selling out.
But so are you.

386
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,489
No. I believe
in Steve Austin

387
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,159
and his plan to put a casino
on the moon.

388
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,027
Then I believe in Halliburton.

389
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,331
Good. So neither of us
should feel guilty.

390
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,932
We don't.

391
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,040
Sabotage? But I'm the one
who does that to me.

392
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,176
I know, Tracy.
It was wrong.

393
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,179
But I couldn't go through with
it because I saw your movie.

394
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,682
And I can't believe I'm saying
this, but you're great.

395
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,451
Wait, great like good,

396
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,786
or grate like the thing
I dropped my asthma inhaler down

397
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,722
the other day?

398
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,056
The first one, Tray.

399
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,093
You are going to win.

400
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,595
And when you do,
I'll be furious.

401
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,231
Like waking up
next to Rob Schneider furious.

402
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,100
But I don't care.

403
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,235
It's like you said
in the movie...

404
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,571
Sometimes you gotta do
the right thing,

405
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:22,107
even when the wrong thing
would be a whole lot easier.

406
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,541
No, don't say that.

407
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,910
In real life,
you have to make compromises.

408
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,829
No, Liz Lemon,
it's like the thing I said

409
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,681
in another movie I made.

410
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,250
Compromises are for
lesser souls.

411
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,953
Die, werewolf zombie!

412
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,456
So you two have decided
to do the right thing?

413
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,625
Ugh! Fine!

414
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,177
I'll go home and change!

415
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,463
Take a last look, guys.

416
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,138
- I would hit that.
- Too small.

417
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:58,643
I believe we are all being held
in slavery by big government.

418
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,615
Lesbian Mario brothers.

419
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,649
I couldn't do it, Jack.

420
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,251
I just couldn't support BWL.

421
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,253
And I'd already thrown out
all my other jeans.

422
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,555
That is the most unflattering
item of clothing

423
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,490
I have ever seen you wear.

424
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:16,161
And I'm including 2008's
turtleneck with smiley-face vest.

425
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,712
But I feel good.
And not just because

426
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,432
in my shorteralls
I found a bag of tastetations,

427
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,900
a discontinued chocolate
hard candy,

428
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,937
but because sometimes
you gotta do the right thing,

429
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,708
even when the wrong thing
would be a whole lot easier.

430
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,710
Die, werewolf zombie.

431
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:40,085
Good God, Lemon!

432
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:44,856
I will never allow
casinos on the moon!

433
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,574
Thank you!

434
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:00,271
- Steve?
- Friend or foe?

435
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,974
You're the reason
everyone came here tonight.

436
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,342
They need to hear you speak.

437
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,845
In person.

438
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,580
From the heart.

439
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,056
Damn you, shorteralls!

440
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:21,693
Americans are a simple
but powerful people,

441
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,995
which is why I have written
a new national anthem.

442
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,697
♪ Ooga booga big ♪

443
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:26,965
♪ ooga booga strong ♪

444
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,835
♪ I am going to sing
my ooga booga song ♪

445
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,337
♪ ooga booga big ♪

446
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,572
♪ ooga booga strong ♪

447
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,576
Wow! That's worse than
the speech my grandpa made

448
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,512
when my cousin married
a Japanese girl.

449
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,914
As if that weren't enough,
Austin was mocked

450
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,150
in Jay Leno's monologue
tonight.

451
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,052
The kingmaker has spoken.
It's over.

452
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,888
Bookman will be reelected.

453
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,356
But you did the right thing.

454
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,924
And at the end of the day,

455
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,893
isn't that more important
than some merger?

456
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,895
Letting morality get
in the way of making money...

457
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,864
I might as well go
and be a teacher.

458
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,032
I know what will cheer you up.

459
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,700
Would you like some cake?

460
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,502
Yeah.

461
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,603
Cake boy!

462
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,448
This has been
the best day of my life.

463
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:21,848
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

464
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:24,560
I believe ketchup bottles
should be 500% larger.

465
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:27,863
<i>We are all responsible
for heroes becoming terrible.</i>

466
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:31,801
But what kind of jail are these
alien prisoners being held in?

467
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:33,536
We should bring back slavery!

468
00:20:33,604 --> 00:20:36,872
And they're backed
