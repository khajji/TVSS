00:06:35,502 --> 00:06:40,605
Now, unless I see
some serious change at NBC

158
00:06:40,673 --> 00:06:45,375
and soon, I can guarantee you
this deal will not happen.

159
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:47,478
[People murmuring]

160
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:49,245
Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb.

161
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:50,879
Peas and carrots.
Rhubarb. Rhubarb.

162
00:06:50,947 --> 00:06:51,947
Peas and carrots.
Rhubarb.

163
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:58,018
Dotcom, you run Tracy's
production company, right?

164
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,686
Yes. Dotcom productions.

165
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:02,722
That's Tracy Jordan
spelled backwards.

166
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,258
- Well, I need programming for
the African-American community,

167
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:07,894
and nobody knows that
demographic better than you.

168
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,563
Don't worry about it,
Jackie D, I'm on it.

169
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:11,931
Call Grizz.

170
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,200
I need someone around
who's not just a yes man.

171
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,236
Whatever you say, Tray.
Oh.

172
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,238
Come on, Walter.

173
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,975
What is going on?

174
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:25,344
Representative Regina Bookman
is using the Kabletown hearings

175
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,911
as a soap box
from which to complain

176
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,479
about a lack of diversity
on TV.

177
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,480
Well, she has a point.

178
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,015
<i>I was reading the new Malcolm
Gladwell new yorker piece</i>

179
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,717
on my kindle.
Did you really read that?

180
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,151
No, I did not.

181
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:38,420
I really resent
the congresswoman's accusations.

182
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:40,555
I've long been an advocate
for diversity.

183
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,890
It's made this nation great.

184
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:43,858
The Chinese built the railroads,

185
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:46,393
the Irish built
and then filled the jails...

186
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:48,261
A guy named Juan
built my armoire.

187
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,930
Diversity means new ideas
and new markets.

188
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:54,232
It is our best hope
for true innovation.

189
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,200
Did you tell all that
to congresswoman Bookman?

190
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,901
No, I was too busy
trying to remember

191
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:59,269
<i>the name of the black kid
on community.</i>

192
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:00,403
D'nall glover.

193
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,538
It wouldn't have mattered
anyway.

194
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,239
The whole thing
was just political theater.

195
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:05,774
You should have seen
her grandstanding.

196
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:08,242
The future and America.

197
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,113
Now I may have lost my train of
thought several minutes ago,

198
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:15,049
but if I continue
to talk like this,

199
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,184
no one will notice,
and when I stop,

200
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:20,953
you will applaud my energy.
Thank you.

201
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:22,088
Thank you.

202
00:08:22,155 --> 00:08:26,391
[Applause] Thank you.

203
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,460
I can't let Bookman
jeopardize this deal.

204
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,560
<i>Tell me about diversity
at TGS.</i>

205
00:08:31,628 --> 00:08:34,096
Well, Lutz claims to be inuit.

206
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:35,197
At least
that was his explanation

207
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,931
when I found his poem
about snow.

208
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,633
What about Toofer?
Is he any good?

209
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,067
I don't know if he's mentioned
this to you 100 times,

210
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:41,368
but he went to Harvard.

211
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:44,138
So we know he's smart and
superb at masturbation.

212
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:46,073
Ha.

213
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:48,075
Is there any way
we can give him a promotion

214
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:49,476
of some kind?
Sure.

215
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:51,077
Make him co-head writer.

216
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,245
I always figured he'd take over
for me when I die at my desk.

217
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,580
Really?
You're okay with that?

218
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:58,149
Oh, yeah. Let someone else share
the total lack of respect,

219
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,084
deal with the meetings,
the complaining,

220
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:01,986
the stupid Johnny Appleseed
sketch.

221
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:03,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

222
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:06,056
You are not doing a sketch
on the Appleseed family.

223
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,991
Monty Appleseed and I share
a liquor locker at the opera.

224
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:10,625
[Screams]

225
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:13,094
[Hoarsely] I forgot my doctor
said no more frustrated noises,

226
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:16,897
because it makes my vocal cords go...
[muttering]

227
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,999
Now it's gonna be
like this all day.

228
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:23,235
There you are.

229
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:25,003
I've got hair extensions
for you

230
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,471
and a body shaper
with a reinforced penile sleeve.

231
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:28,939
Miss maroney, please.

232
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,807
My feet are killing me.

233
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,976
I am trying to help you,
Kenneth.

234
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,843
Believe me, I wish you weren't

235
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:37,111
such a Houston foreclosure
of a human being,

236
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,679
but I need to tear you down

237
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:40,981
and turn you into someone that
can actually win this thing.

238
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,553
They hired keyboard guy?

239
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,525
He's not even recycling
properly.

240
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,427
Miss maroney, wait.

241
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,031
So what do we want
to see on TV?

242
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,766
I personally love cop shows.

243
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:06,470
<i>I can't wait for law & order
to start back up.</i>

244
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,772
Why?
It was a tentpole!

245
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,974
A tentpole!

246
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,409
Well, here's something
I've been working on.

247
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,710
<i>It's called let's stay together.</i>

248
00:10:14,778 --> 00:10:16,478
After the Al Green song.

249
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:20,015
It focuses on an African-American
family in Detroit in the '70s.

250
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,418
Motown, the auto industry,
Vietnam, Watergate.

251
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:25,486
<i>Let's stay together
is not just about a family</i>

252
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:28,289
trying to stay together,
but also a nation.

253
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:29,457
What if there was
a talking dog?

254
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:32,460
I'd like to see that
incorporated into your rewrite.

255
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,929

Smile.

265
00:10:58,478 --> 00:11:00,878
Okay, let's dig in, cohorts.

266
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,488
It means the badger in Spanish.

267
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:18,390
I'm not sure who did it.

268
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:23,160
Toofer's got
a head writer sign on his door.

269
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,895
It's great.
Good for him.

270
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,363
<i>Oh, God.
Tejon face.</i>

271
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,398
Is this about the TV interview?

272
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:29,100
What TV interview?

273
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,569
It's nothing.
It's just a local cable show.

274
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:34,805
- Well, if my co-head writer is
being interviewed, then so am I.

275
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,607
<i>Aqui viene el tejon!</i>

276
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,412
- The only thing that worked in
the read-through was the dog.

277
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,713
- How's production going, Tray?
- Good.

278
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:46,215
And there's a lot of buzz.

279
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:47,583
Can you hear it too?

280
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:49,218
Or is my tinnitus acting up?

281
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:53,756
Hey! That food
is for Dotcom productions only.

282
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:56,058
<i>TGS's food is backstage.</i>

283
00:11:56,126 --> 00:11:57,726
But they don't have
women's sports bars.

284
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:59,895
Men can have cramping too,
you know.

285
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:03,632
Mr. Donaghy, I have representative
Bookman on the line. Oh.

286
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:05,067
Representative Bookman.

287
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,701
Mr. Donaghy,
I'm in New York right now.

288
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,236
Some colleagues of mine and I
are taking meetings

289
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:10,437
on wall street
and then we're doing

290
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:12,106
<i>a sex and the city walking tour.</i>

291
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:15,441
Magnolia bakery?
Oh, sorry, hips.

292
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,243
But it looks like
I'll have time to stop by

293
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,777
and continue our conversation.

294
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:20,346
Good.
I welcome it.

295
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:21,546
As I was trying
to say the other day,

296
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,281
this company has
a long-standing commitment

297
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,149
to diversity and inclusiveness.

298
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:28,686
Yo, Jackie D, I had dinner
with don Imus last night.

299
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,023
He told the following joke...
- Good-bye, congresswoman.

300
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:36,445
I can't believe
they rejected me.

301
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:37,579
Well, of course they did.

302
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:39,347
The bridge was supposed to be

303
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:41,449
shuffle-ball-change,
maxi Ford, Cincinnati,

304
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:44,552
Cincinnati, double-time
shim-sham-shimmy, toe punch.

305
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,152
I don't know
what you were doing.

306
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,654
I'm sorry, miss maroney.

307
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:49,055
And where was your sparkle?

308
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:52,525
You embarrassed me in front
of all the other mothers.

309
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,494
If you think you're going
to sizzler tonight, Jenna,

310
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:55,862
you got another thing coming.

311
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,863
Oh, you'll be practicing
your steps in the garage

312
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,464
until the school boat comes.

313
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:01,965
If I hadn't seen you come out
of me in that parking,

314
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:05,168
I'd swear you weren't
my daughter.

315
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:06,602
Oh, my God.

316
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:07,736
What just happened?

317
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:11,405
I think you just turned into...
let me get there.

318
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:13,207
I've turned into my mother.

319
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:16,443
And I turned you into me.

320
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,710
You're welcome.

321
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:18,711
But it was wrong.

322
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,880
Well, to make it up to me...
let me get there!

323
00:13:21,948 --> 00:13:25,049
To make it up to you, I am
going to get your job back

324
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,885
or my name isn't
Yustrepa Gronkowitz.

325
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:30,921
I mean, Jenna maroney.

326
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:35,158
<i>Welcome to right on.</i>

327
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,825
I'm your host, Rutherford Rice.

328
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:39,561
With me is my co-host
Shirley Thomas.

329
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:41,196
Our topic for today

330
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:44,264
is African-Americans
and their roles in the Mia.

331
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:47,234
Our first guest
is James Spurlock,

332
00:13:47,302 --> 00:13:50,370
<i>head writer
for TGS with Tracy Jordan.</i>

333
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:51,770
- Good day, tri-staters.

334
00:13:51,838 --> 00:13:53,405
- Co.
Co-head writer.

335
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:56,575
And also with us is someone
named Elizabeth Lemon.

336
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,677
Thank you, Rutherford.
It is a pl...

337
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,679
I can tell that you're off me.

338
00:14:00,746 --> 00:14:05,015
Mr. Spurlock, do you think the
system is broken when it is news

339
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,049
that an African-American man

340
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:09,251
is a head writer
for a network TV show?

341
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:11,619
I think I can answer that.

342
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:13,187
Another question
that we could be asking

343
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:17,058
is why isn't it a big deal
that a woman is a head writer.

344
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:22,630
I would argue that TV is more of
a boys club than a white club.

345
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,569
I like your dress.

346
00:14:27,637 --> 00:14:30,071
Do you have to wear
a bra with it?

347
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,906
I will let you get back
to Toofer.

348
00:14:31,973 --> 00:14:32,973
Who's Toofer?

349
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:33,974
I don't know.

350
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:38,011
<i>James, when people think
of TGS,</i>

351
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,746
they think of Tracy Jordan,
Jenna maroney,

352
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:42,716
the mysterious crew deaths,
the Angela Lansbury lawsuit.

353
00:14:42,783 --> 00:14:45,084
What they don't think of is you

354
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,420
working long hours
late into the night,

355
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:51,223
giving up any semblance
of a life.

356
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,591
Well, James Spurlock,
you can finally take your bow.

357
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,495
<i>You are right on's
Arthur Ashe of the week.</i>

358
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,063
Okay, you know what?

359
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,831
I get it.
I shouldn't be here.

360
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,067
I should have realized that
when I saw the masks

361
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,669
and the picture of black Jesus.

362
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:05,770
That's me in college.

363
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:06,804
All righty.

364
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,072
All right, I said
I was leaving.

365
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,407
You don't have to have your boss
come and...

366
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,841
that's a security guard.
That's not great.

367
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:15,610
Sir, representative Bookman
is on her way up.

368
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:17,344
Jonathan, what did we talk about?

369
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:19,512
But, sir,
I was born in Palo Alto.

370
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:20,778
[Indian accent]
I will go get her, sir.

371
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:22,613
A thousand apologies.

372
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,815
- Jack, it's an actor
me-mgency.

373
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,452
I want to get Kenneth
back into the page program,

374
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,322
but whatever this is
won't let me.

375
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:31,857
What? Who care Jeffrey,
just hire Kenneth back.

376
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:33,158
But Mr. Donaghy,
the only...

377
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:34,926
I don't have time for this.
Just do it.

378
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:36,294
Thank you, Jack.

379
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:39,631
- Mr. Donaghy. - Representative
Bookman, welcome to NBC.

380
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:41,799
This is the perfect place
to begin our tour.

381
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:46,269
Studio 6h, home to one of NBCs
biggest stars, Tracy Jordan.

382
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,604
Mr.
Jordan, Regina Bookman.

383
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:50,873
We met at the congressional
black caucus fundraiser

384
00:15:50,941 --> 00:15:52,274
you crashed
your motorcycle into.

385
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,809
And thank you, representative.

386
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,477
What you're doing
is very important.

387
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:57,845
I can assure you
that NBC is committed

388
00:15:57,913 --> 00:16:00,147
to making diversity a priority.

389
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:02,815
Then just walk away
and don't try to kiss her,

390
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:06,084
Tracy,
and don't say that last part.

391
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,556
Hey. You eat
from your own table, remember?

392
00:16:12,624 --> 00:16:14,891
Our food is separate.
Separate!

393
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,826
I'll kill you, white devil!

394
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,329
[Screams]

395
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:22,465
Let's just head this way.

396
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,143
So how was your flight?

397
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:37,145
Congresswoman,
this is Jeffrey Winerslav.

398
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:38,913
He heads our diversity
and hiring initiative.

399
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:41,315
What's the latest
from H.R., Jeffrey?

400
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,483
Well, I'd like to tell you
that we filled the minority slot

401
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:46,319
in the NBC page program
with a native American fellow

402
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,020
named wants to get sandwiches,

403
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,522
but you made me hire
that guy instead.

404
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:52,490
Oh, brother.

405
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:55,892
Mr. Shoelace, you're being silly.

406
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,662
You call that a diversity hire?

407
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,696
Maybe.

408
00:16:59,764 --> 00:17:01,732
That young man is a hillbilly

409
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,201
with a girl's middle name
and, because his county

410
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:07,037
never rejoined the union, a foreigner.

411
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:10,840
Now you're untied?
Have you two been talking?

412
00:17:11,843 --> 00:17:15,745
There's James.

413
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,614
Attention, everyone.
Oh, give me a break.

414
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:24,019
I present you, James Spurlock,
with the 2010 Tavis Smiley

415
00:17:24,087 --> 00:17:26,355
excellence in broadcasting
award.

416
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:28,524
Thank you for making us
all smiley.

417
00:17:28,591 --> 00:17:30,459
[Applause]

418
00:17:30,526 --> 00:17:35,429
Mr. Spurlock, how long have
you been head writer here?

419
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:37,764
- One day.
- Mm-hmm.

420
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:42,067
And who is the real
head writer of this show?

421
00:17:42,135 --> 00:17:43,536
I am.

422
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:49,975
Ah. Tell me, you obviously
lonely and tired woman.

423
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,077
Do you have to put up
with this nonsense every day?

424
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:54,913
- Yes. - You know, they
say 90% of the work

425
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:57,081
is done by 10% of the people.

426
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:58,882
Thank you for being that 10%.

427
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,083
You're welcome.

428
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,183
After what I just saw,

429
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,386
you may be the only person here
I respect.

430
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:07,489
You get an "I met
a congresswoman" sticker.

431
00:18:07,557 --> 00:18:09,691
Thank you.
Finally.

432
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,593
That's all I wanted...
This country was founded

433
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,061
on certain principles.

434
00:18:14,128 --> 00:18:15,062
Oh, brother.

435
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,932
Freedom, troops, America, flag.

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,901
Now I might not ow
where I'm going with this,

437
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:25,471
but I know
we will get there together!

438
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,974
[Applause]

439
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,075
Who loves pizza?

440
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,143
[Cheers and applause]

441
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,579
Congresswoman, a word.

442
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:44,386
Okay, fine, I was putting on a show.

443
00:18:44,454 --> 00:18:45,687
I was tap dancing.

444
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,489
But you made me tap dance.

445
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:50,658
Did someone say tap dance?

446
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:54,194
What was I supposed to do?

447
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:56,062
This is
a multibillion-dollar deal.

448
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,497
There are thousands of jobs at
stake, hundreds of second homes,

449
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:01,898
and your ridiculous grandstanding
could ruin the whole thing,

450
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:05,167
like luffing your spinnaker
during a yachting regatta.

451
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,468
I know I'm not helping myself.

452
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,935
Sorry.
Grandstanding?

453
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,770
Do you not think
I believe in this?

454
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:12,473
It's just political theater.
You're up for reelection.

455
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,110
Yes, maybe I get carried away
sometimes with my love

456
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:21,283
for this great country and the
troops and the flagtroops...

457
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,350
you're doing it.

458
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:23,651
And I apologize.

459
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,320
But I only talk this way
so I can get people to listen.

460
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:27,721
I care about these issues.

461
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,189
And so do I.

462
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:30,823
If you just give me a chance

463
00:19:30,891 --> 00:19:32,592
instead of ambushing me
in front of the congress

464
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:34,593
and my own employees.

465
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,595
You think I don't take diversity
seriously?

466
00:19:36,662 --> 00:19:37,962
Only a fool doesn't.

467
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,997
Diversity is the engine
that drives this country.

468
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:41,866
We are an immigrant nation.

469
00:19:41,934 --> 00:19:43,701
The first generation works
their fingers to the bone

470
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:44,869
making things.

471
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:47,304
The next generation goes to
college and innovates new ideas.

472
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:51,974
The third generation...
Snowboards and takes improv classes.

473
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:54,410
We always need people
who are pulling themselves up

474
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:56,045
by their bootstraps.

475
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,446
I did it.

476
00:19:57,514 --> 00:20:00,182
And it's my job to help others
do it too.

477
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:01,883
How do I know
you really mean that?

478
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,651
How do I know
you're not just grandstanding?

479
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,219
Oh, I'll show you how.

480
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,555
Unless you give me
a real reason not to,

481
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:09,156
I'm voting no on this deal.

482
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:11,090
Then I've got three months
to change your mind.

483
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:14,327
I'll show you
that this company...

484
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:17,362
I'm cutting
that fat cracker's head off.

485
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,364
I'm part eskimo.
Hate crime!

00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,034
Three months, congresswoman.

488
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:24,168
We were here first!

489
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,504

490
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:28,572

492
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,764
They closed the plant.

493
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:48,365
I gave those people 30 years.

494
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:50,100
I didn't even get a watch.

495
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,269
All I got was this pink slip.

496
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:55,906
You think you got it hard,
I've got two dates tonight.

497
00:20:55,974 --> 00:21:00,110
Stanley, even for a dog,
you are a dog.

498
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:02,479
Yes! Great fix, Grizz.

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,221
- Uh-oh.
Ain't life a bitch?
