Hey, what was that sound?
It was opportunity knocking.

2
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:07,437
No one knocked.
You just barged in.

3
00:00:07,504 --> 00:00:09,272
- Knock knock.
- You were right, Donald.

4
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:11,440
It makes more sense
for you to enter first.

5
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:13,375
It's okay, daddy.
We'll just start over.

6
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:15,544
Uh, you know,
why don't we just dive in

7
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:17,243
to whatever this is?

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,146
Okay, you remember Donald,

9
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:21,165
my son who's two years older
than me.

10
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,875
Ah, yes, please.

11
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:26,560
As I recall, you own

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,906
You wouldn't believe this,

14
00:00:28,974 --> 00:00:30,422
but that business failed.

15
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,702
I blame Obama.

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,224
But the good news is,

17
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,836
Donald has
a brand-new venture.

18
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:36,319
Sell him, son.

19
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:39,241
It's a theme restaurant
in Times Square.

20
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,721
Well, the theme restaurant
business model does work.

21
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:44,606
Nascar's fat load cafe
is a gold mine.

22
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:45,946
Well, we got a bunch of capital

23
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,624
from Brown and Folderson.

24
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,139
And we wanted to get you a seat
on this rocket

25
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:51,945
before it takes off.

26
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:54,826
So it's decided.
Jack's on board as an investor.

27
00:00:54,894 --> 00:00:56,369
Ah, not so fast.

28
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:59,781
So...it's...decid...

29
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:02,529
Uh, let's just bottom-line
this thing.

30
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:04,339
I never invest without doing
my research.

31
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:07,150
I'll do a site visit tonight
and kick the tires.

32
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:09,891
All right, but if some other
investor comes along,

33
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,201
it's your loss.

Gah!

You have no idea how special.

Oh. We're celebrating
our six-month anniversary

I will say yes
when Paul proposes...

61
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,623
That we make a sex tape
and leak it on the Internet.

Oh, I thought
you meant marriage.

63
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:38,100
God, no.
Marriage is like death.

64
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:40,807
You settle into a routine.
You lose all the spark.

I don't know.

66
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:43,144
I always thought
the whole point

67
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:44,681
of being with someone
for a long time

68
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,817
is to get to the comfortable
routine part.

No. Relationships
are like sharks, Liz.

If you're not left

then something's wrong.

Well, nothing's wrong
with me and Carol.

73

I mean, we haven't spoken
in five days,

74
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,273

because we are not sharks.

That's an excellent question.

The answer is
questions like that.

your problems on

and then get on

Ugh. I'm trying. I just can't
find someone I like.

87

I mean, have you ever been
to a shrink?

88
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:35,571
No. I believe
that when you have a problem,

89
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,773
you talk it over
with your priest,

90
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,810
or your tailor,
or the mute elevator porter

91

at your men's club.

so I could track gas prices
around the state

162
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:35,206
for a cool chart
that I was making.

163
00:06:35,274 --> 00:06:36,741
We'll get back to that later.

164
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:37,742
When I didn't get it,

165
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,343
my dad blamed Santa Claus.

166
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:42,913
Well, Santa made an enemy
that day.

167
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:44,447
And the next year
when he returned

168
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:47,718
to the Schuylkill galleria,
so did vengeance.

169
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:51,755
Ho ho ho. What can Santa
bring you this year?

170
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:53,090
What does it matter?

171
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,259
You didn't bring me
what I asked for last year,

172
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,127
you fat fraud.

173
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:59,763
You're a bigger disappointment
than our current president

174
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:00,931
Jimmy Carter.

175
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,799
I am a fraud, little boy.

176
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:03,933
[Gasps]

177
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,434
My wife still thinks
I work at the bank.

178
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,367
I guess Santa Claus
was the first man

179
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,869
to ever betray me.

180
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:11,070
That must've been difficult.

181
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:13,906
It was.

182
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:16,675
But it feels good
to talk about it.

183
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:17,710
Thanks.

184
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:18,777
Miss Lemon,

185
00:07:18,845 --> 00:07:20,145
there's a reason
God gave us two ears

186
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:21,612
and only one mouth.

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,481
Listening is twice as important
as talking.

188
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,950
But he gave us ten fingers.

189
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:30,486
He must really want us
to poke things.

190
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:34,756
- Oh.
- Poke poke poke poke.

191
00:07:34,823 --> 00:07:37,324
[Exhales]

192
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,497
Oh. It's the vacant lot

193
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,599
where we had our first
face kiss.

194
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,067
Who stole my canteen?

195
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,103
Jenna, what we have
is so beautiful.

196
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,038
People need to see how happy
we make each other.

197
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,974
And I think we're ready
to take that step.

198
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:00,644
So over Christmas,
I want you to come to Ohio

199
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,144
and meet my parents.

200
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:07,149
- What?
- Happy anniversary.

201
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:10,318
Hey, get a room!
Whatever that is.

202
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:15,189
Well, Tracy, I went
to the restaurant last night.

203
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,490
That place is a disaster.

204
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,558
Damn it, you think
I don't know that?

205
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:20,727
I've poured more cash
into Donald's restaurant

206
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,662
than my money pit
in Connecticut.

207
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,330
You have a house
in Connecticut?

208
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:26,765
No, I do not.

209
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,701
Jack, I need other investors
besides me.

210
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:32,170
What? You're the only one
bankrolling this?

211
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:33,871
What about Brown and Folderson?

212
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,339
That's what I call my wallet.

213
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:38,208
I've bankrolled every one
of Donald's dumb ideas.

214
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:40,978
But what choice do I have?
I'm his father.

215
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,646
But you're doing him no favors

216
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:45,949
as a business partner
or a father.

217
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,783
You need to cut him off.

218
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:50,619
Come on.
The boy's only 43 years old.

219
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:51,786
Tracy, listen to me,

220
00:08:51,854 --> 00:08:53,954
not everyone is cut out
to be a businessman.

221
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:57,525
For example, curly-haired men
and people who need glasses.

222
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:59,193
But I can't crush his dreams.

223
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,727
You're not.
You're just letting him fly

224
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:02,062
with his own wings.

225
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,330
I bankrolled that too.

226
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:07,633
Thank God we tested it
with a monkey first.

227
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:09,802
Oh, miss Lemon,
I'm signing people up

228
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,570
<i>for the TGS softball team.</i>

229
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,171
So far I have eight nos

230
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,573
and 25 shove it up
your goon-holes.

231
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:17,708
- Shove it up your goon-hole.
- Okay.

232
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:20,110
You know, ever since we had
our little talk yesterday,

233
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,878
I've been doing some thinking.

234
00:09:21,946 --> 00:09:23,045
Oh, good.

235
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,480
If I remember correctly,

236
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,815
we were discussing men
and trust.

237
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:30,084
Yeah. And it got me thinking
about my aunt Linda.

238
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,720
- What was she like?
- Great until she got divorced.

239
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,421
My Uncle Harry
was cheating on her.

240
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:37,323
Another male betrayal.
Go with that.

241
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:39,525
My parents used to make me go
to Linda's house

242
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:41,060
just so she'd have company.

243
00:09:41,128 --> 00:09:42,728
I hated those visits.

244
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:45,130
Your uncle never liked
my cooking.

245
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,132
But you do, right, Elizabeth?

246
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:49,400
You love your aunt Linda.

247
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:51,102
Here's a fun game:

248
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,503
Put on Harry's cologne

249
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:54,605
and give me a backrub
in the bath.

250
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,540
[Laughs]

251
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:59,576
[Cries]

252
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:02,110
To this day, whenever I hear
someone's getting divorced,

253
00:10:02,178 --> 00:10:05,846
I can still taste that egg
and I...

254
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,347
Oh, my God.

255
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:08,748
My trust issues
and my food issues

256
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,049
are connected.

257
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,917
Uncle Harold is the reason

258
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,184
eggs make me gag.

259
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,454
Kenneth,
you're the perfect therapist.

260
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:17,455
I can dump
all of my problems on you,

261
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:20,424
walk away, and move on
with my life.

262
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:25,762
It's a win-win.

263
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,198
Why did she have
to say "Harold"?

264
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:33,402
Liz.

265
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,636
Last night was a disaster.

266
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:35,671
And not the good kind

267
00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:36,939
where I get to sing
at a benefit.

268
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,206
What happened?

269
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:39,640
Paul's idea
of moving things forward

270
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,341
is me meeting his parents.

271
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,944
He said they live
in a "soo-borb."

272
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,146
Suburb. Come on, Jenna.

273
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,814
It's not what you wanted,
but it's progress.

274
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:49,548
In the wrong direction.

275
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:51,382
I think I know
what's really going on

276
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,583
between you and Paul.

277
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,583
You're in love

278
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,084
and it's terrifying to you.

279
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:57,085
You're trying to sabotage it.

280
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:58,686
Sabotage?

281
00:10:58,754 --> 00:11:01,455
I'm the one trying to make
this relationship work.

282
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:03,457
Which is why I'm gonna have
to be the one

283
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:06,095
to propose the sex tape.

284
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:07,262
Call me old-fashioned,

285
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,664
but I think
that's the man's job.

286
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,566
Jack, I found a therapist
and I've made

287
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,935
some big breakthroughs.

288
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,270
I know you don't know
what this means,

289
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:16,904
but I'm eating eggs again.

290
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:19,140
I know it means
this conversation is disgusting.

291
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:21,141
[Laughs]

292
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,544
Okay, Donald is on his way up.

293
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:26,479
I know cutting him off is hard,

294
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:27,714
but it's your duty
as a parent...

295
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:28,881
[laughs]

296
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,783
Tracy, do not laugh
at the word "duty."

297
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,419
Be strong. Be rational.
[Inhales] No emotion.

298
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:37,488
- Unemotional. Got it.
- Daddy, what's going on?

299
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,256
[Crying] I just love you
so much!

300
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,124
I love you too, daddy.

301
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:44,126
[Both bawling]

302
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:45,528
Okay, stop it.

303
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:46,929
Donald, what Tracy
is trying to tell you

304
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,197
is that you're an adult

305
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:51,166
and he will no longer
support you financially.

306
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,500
Is that true, daddy?

307
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:54,836
For the love of God,
stop calling him "daddy."

308
00:11:54,903 --> 00:11:56,303
It is true, little man.

309
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:58,805
But I need you
to be a big boy on this.

310
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:00,841
You're just not meant
to be a businessman.

311
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:03,442
Fine. I'll be okay.

312
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,911
I got other ideas.

313
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:08,246
Like a microbrewery
that also serves frozen yogurt.

314
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:11,315
I'm gonna call it
"Microsoft."

315
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,354
I have this recurring dream.

316
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,288
Actually, is it recurring
if you wake yourself up

317
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:21,891
with a [snorts]
and then return to it?

318
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,359
Anyway, in the dream,
I'm a baby.

319
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:29,697
[Voice echoing]

320
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:33,533
I think it has to do
with my issues with sex.

321
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:36,869
<i>Lemon, what are you doing?
Is Kenneth your therapist?</i>

322
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:40,305
- Well, kind of.
- He can't handle that.

323
00:12:40,372 --> 00:12:42,774
Look at his head shape.
He has no brain pan!

324
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,476
It's fine, Mr. Donaghy.
I'm okay.

325
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:48,378
[High-pitched voice]
And so am I. I'm Cheryl.

326
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:53,149
This is exactly why I told you
to see a professional.

327
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:56,051
You dump your problems
on some half-baked Barney fife

328
00:12:56,119 --> 00:12:57,319
and you can start
a chain reaction

329
00:12:57,387 --> 00:13:00,155
of mental anguish.

330
00:13:00,223 --> 00:13:01,723
Look what you've done to him.

331
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:06,360
But he's such a good listener
and he takes my insurance.

332
00:13:06,427 --> 00:13:11,631
I'm going to help you.
Lie down.

333
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:14,366
Put your mental burden
in my mind vice

334
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,367
and I will crush it.

335
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:17,702
Kenneth, who is Harold?

336
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,539
He...Was a role model
of mine growing up.

337
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,207
[Whispers]
Please let Harold be human.

338
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,875
Harold was a pig.

339
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:30,245
You see, my father passed
when I was just a young boy.

340
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:34,282
After that, I was alone a lot
and awful sad.

341
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,917
But that pig saved me.

342
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,251
In some ways,

343
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:41,087
Harold was the only thing I had

344
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,355
that was like a father.

345
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,423
You had a void to fill.

346
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,457
Continue.

347
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,792
Then one day,

348
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,228
my mama told me
we had to sell him.

349
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,329
I knew what that meant.

350
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,398
Harold was off
to the slaughterhouse.

351
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,966
- I know it's difficult...
- I'm not done, sir.

352
00:13:57,034 --> 00:13:58,234
It gets worse.

353
00:13:58,302 --> 00:13:59,735
With Harold gone,

354
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:02,205
there was nothing keeping me
at home.

355
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:04,207
It was time for me to move
to New York

356
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:06,175
and follow my dreams.

357
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,710
But I needed $300

358
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:12,980
for the river ferry-
train-ox cart-train-bus ticket.

359
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:15,382
And that's when I saw the sign.

360
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,652
I knew I could win
that contest.

361
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,787
Heck, I'd once eaten
an entire witch.

362
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:21,688
A pig was nothing.

363
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:24,290
And then they brought me mine.

364
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:29,661
I would have recognized
those eyes anywhere.

365
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:32,062
- Kenneth, no.
- It was Harold.

366
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,966
And I ate all of him.
Even the face in case of a tie.

367
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,636
- Good God!
- I ate him, sir!

368
00:14:39,703 --> 00:14:42,271
I ate my father pig!

Okay! Or you gave

I guess that is true.
Thank you, sir.

375
00:15:04,123 --> 00:15:06,724
I'll think on that.

And you're sure you're okay
hearing about all my problems?

Fine. I guess we're just done
having any adventure

like a normal couple?

Okay, this isn't about us
being adventurous.

to settle down with me.

for you,

about Carol anymore.

I'm just sorry I messed you up
like that.

Don't worry. I had my brain
cleaned by Mr. Donaghy.

Oh, I told him everything.

00:17:26,607 --> 00:17:27,808
No, no!
Don't tell me your story!

Oh, my! So tiny.

your share of our profits

434

Too late.
Look how we're positioned.

439
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:57,231
Kenneth told me
a story earlier...

440
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,632
a story about fathers and sons.

441
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:00,033
And despite my best effort,

442
00:18:00,101 --> 00:18:02,802
it unearthed a memory
from my own childhood.

443
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,304
As a boy, I wanted to be
an astronaut,

444
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:07,973
or a deep-sea diver,
a man of science.

445
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,475
But I was raised
by Jimmy Donaghy,

446
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,243
a man who projected his own
failed dreams

447
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:15,312
on to his family.

448
00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:16,580
When I was in third grade,

449
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:18,348
my class put on a science play.

450
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:20,316
The night before,
Jimmy came home drunk

451
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:21,984
and found me rehearsing
my lines.

452
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:24,487
I was struggling
with the science terms.

453
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:28,223
And Jimmy laughed and said
"well, looky here.

457
00:18:35,396 --> 00:18:38,597
The next day,
I was up on that stage.

458
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:41,633
I looked out at the audience,
I saw Jimmy, and I froze.

462
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:53,411

my shell collection,
my map of the stars.

who is supposed

00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,653
to make their kid think
they can do anything.

they go to Arizona state.

tear your kid down.

Am a protein!

479
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:47,922
All living organisms
need me to function.

480
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,592
A basic building block
of the human body.

481
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,929
I'm made from amino acids
found in ribosomes.

482
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,865
Proteins give energy
to everything

483
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,866
from flowers and butterflies

484
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:06,605
to heroes who turn in
communists.

485
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,007
I am a protein.

486
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,146
Daddy, can I have $50,000
to start a business

487
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,615
where people can call in
and get air quality reports

488
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:20,883
from all across
the United States?

489
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,651
- I'm gonna call it...
- Donald, no.

490
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:28,156
- American airlines.
- And it's going to work, son!

491
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:34,026

492
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:35,931
This is what happens
when you work at being happy.

493
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:38,066
Godzilla sits next to you
while you're eating

494
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,034
an egg salad sandwich.

495
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:42,503
- What a world.
- What's the point?

496
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:44,237
I moved here to make it
to Broadway.

497
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,573
Now look at me.
I'm pathetic.

498
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,909
I've got no real skills.
A degree in theater tech.

499
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:51,310
So you move back
to Pennsylvania.

500
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:52,978
Live with your parents.

501
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:54,646
All of your old friends
have kids and careers.

502
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:55,914
And what do you have?

503
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:57,516
Maybe your name on a TV show

504
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,051
that no one will even remember.

505
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,586
I should've moved to Cleveland
with that guy

506
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:04,223
when I had the chance.

507
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,791
<i>Damn you, Gojira!</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
