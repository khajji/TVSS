00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:04,406
Hey, Jack...
The vending machine is broken!

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,706
I know... I broke it.
I needed to speak with you,

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:09,142
and I knew that was the fastest
way to get you up here.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,012
You bastard!
I trusted you!

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:14,647
Lemon... Lemon!

6
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,516
Is there any news
about Tracy?

7
00:00:16,567 --> 00:00:18,235
As of this morning,
he was still

8
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:19,853
saving lives in Africa.

9
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,022
I'm doing God's work
here in Africa.

10
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:23,190
Why, just yesterday,

11
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:24,925
I kicked two naked people
out of a garden.

12
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:27,828
- But Tracy, we need you here.
- Simba Rafiki!

13
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:29,530
Click, click, click.
Yeah, that's right.

14
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,965
I just put you
in your place in African.

15
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,701
<i>TGS with Tracy Jordan</i>
<i>without Tracy Jordan</i>

16
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,204
is an oxymoron...
like "liberal government"

17
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:38,238
or "female scientist."

18
00:00:38,306 --> 00:00:39,907
Or "Princeton football."

19
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,409
We were 4 and 3
in Ivy league play last year.

20
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,711
Our quarterback,
Henry Chang...

21
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,280
it doesn't matter.
The point is

22
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:49,333
that without Tracy,
<i>TGS</i> is going on...

23
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,151
A forced hiatus.

24
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,220
Forced hiatus?
Okay.

25
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:55,622
So what should I tell
the troops?

26
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,691
It's simple.
Sit them down individually.

27
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,977
Tell them the network
still supports the show

28
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,395
and that this is temporary.

29
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:02,930
But you're lookin' out
for us, right?

30
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,015
Pounding on desks and...

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,516
Doing whatever this is called.

32
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,902
Power wagging.
And I'm doing what I can.

33
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,804
But I spent a lot
of political capital

34
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,539
buying a new network
for Kabletown.

35
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:13,774
Is it TNT?
Are <i>Rizzoli and Isles</i>

36
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:14,775
friends in real life?

37
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:16,610
It's a small cable network

38
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:18,712
targeted towards
gay male viewers.

39
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,547
It's called <i>Twinks</i>.

40
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:21,715
That's the name
of your network?

41
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:23,083
Isn't twink a term

42
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,501
for a young,
hairless gay man?

43
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,353
Nonsense.
Twinks is an acronym

44
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,689
designed to project
a positive gay image.

45
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,024
"Twinks... Television
with individuals...

46
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,493
naive, kinky, shaved."
Okay.

47
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:36,463
If the network were thriving,
it would be one thing.

48
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,049
But my programming
has yet to find its footing.

49
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,067
Uck. No!

50

00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,704
Boring! Who?

52
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,006
Twinks could be
extremely lucrative.

53
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:48,342
Advertisers covet
this demographic.

54
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,510
When I was with D'Fwan
on <i>Queen of Jordan,</i>

55
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:53,680

on chihuahua outfits

for himself.

57
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,918
Okay, well,
don't worry about <i>TGS.</i>

58
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:00,454
I'll take care of
this hiatus thing myself.

59
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,689
Thank you, Lemon.
I'd like to help.

60
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,825
But <i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>my hands are tied...</i>

61
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,027

The important thing is this
forced hiatus is only temporary.

65
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:33,253
We'll be back
before you know it.

Start booking me
stand-up gigs.

68
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,559

we're going on
a forced hiatus.

until Tracy comes back.

It's okay, Jack.

160
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,130
You made a bad decision
and bought something

161
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,498
you didn't understand,

162
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,567
like when I bought tickets
for <i>Black Swan.</i>

163
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,669
Remember when a movie was just
a fellow with a hat

164
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,872
runnin' away from
a fellow with no hair?

165
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,174
- No.
- The point is...

166
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:15,375
You failed.

167
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,178
But unless there's
a gay Jack Donaghy

168
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:20,914
locked up somewhere
who understands all this stuff,

169
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:24,684
let's just chalk this one up
to never again...

170
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,686
And enjoy our lunch.

171
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,989
Hank...

172
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,790
There is a gay Jack Donaghy.

173
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,895
His name is Devin Banks.

174
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,863
Man: Are you okay?

175
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:38,865
I sense something...

176
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,001
A presence I've not felt
since...

177
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,100
Lemon!

178
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,700
I decided to hire...

179
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,195
- Devin banks.
- Banks? But he's your Nemesis.

180
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:54,597
That would be like me
hiring that mouse

181
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,332
that keeps pooping
in my slippers.

182
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,367
Devin is the perfect man
to fix <i>Twinks</i>.

183
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:00,269
He's a gay shark,
like the actor who played jaws.

184
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,271
But he's gonna come in
and try to ruin everything,

185
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,206
and everything
is already ruining itself.

186
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,508
Not this time.

187
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,444
Banks put all of his eggs
in the Obama basket.

188
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,112
When the administration
started to falter

189
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,248
because of our conspiracy...

190
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,550
I mean, Obama's ineptitude,

191
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:17,403
he tried to distance himself
publicly from, uh,

192
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,455
your president.

193
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,956
The recession
we're emerging from

194
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,259
was primarily caused by
lack of responsibility

195
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:24,393
and accountability.

196
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,762
Then he tried to rejoin
us capitalists,

197
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,598
showed up at John Paulson's
sweet 16 billion party.

198
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,901
Nobody would talk to him.
Not even Ira.

199
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,836
Then he was all, "Oh, I'll just
look at these books,"

200
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,638
then pretended to
get a text and left,

201
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,606
and we were all like
"Whatever. We'll go to IHOP.

202
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:38,874
"And not tell him."
[Snickers]

203
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,376
- Where is he now?
- I tracked him down

204
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,078
to an address in Brooklyn.

205
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:43,913
He's on Linkedin, Lemon.

206
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,098
[Laughing]
He might as well be dead!

207
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,416
So I throw him a lifeline,

208
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:50,853
and he comes crawling back
like a, uh...

209
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:52,521
Crab, I guess.

210
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,689
What else crawls, Lemon?

211
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:55,891
Babies, Jack.
You have one.

212
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,727
Hank Hooper
is a traditionalist.

213
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,094
He had his first heart attack

214
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,730
when he saw pineapple
on a pizza.

215
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,532
He'll hate Banks
and his hairless nostrils.

216
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,668
And men should have
nose hairs.

217
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,936
Hooper will hate Devin,

218
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,454
and he'll never be able
to go over your head.

219
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,906
Exactly. I'll pay him
for his ideas and, uh,

220
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:12,475
kick him out the door.

221
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:14,210
Speaking of TV ideas,

222
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,746
would you buy a show about
a girl television writer

223
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,315
trying to have it all
in the city

224
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,617
and... also,
she's a vampire, I guess?

225
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:22,918
I like the end part.

226
00:08:22,986 --> 00:08:24,470
Lemon, why do you have
a blank note pad

227
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:25,788
with "Plan B" written on it?

228
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,323
Because I'm freaking out.

229
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,475
I told everyone
about the forced hiatus...

230
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,393
Wait.
You said "forced hiatus"?

231
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,163
Yeah. I didn't know
it was code for canceled.

232
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:35,564
I thought
we understood each other.

233
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:37,032
I thought we understood

234
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,168
that you are never to think
that I understand anything!

235
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:40,770
And you have no Plan "B"?

236
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,738
I've been telling you to
prepare for the end of <i>TGS</i>

237
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:44,774
for the last two years.

238
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,659
Well, there have been a lot
<i>Amazing Races</i> on since then,

239
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,577
and I had to watch them and
go online and comment on them.

240
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,513
Here are your options...
you can go to L.A.

241
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,314
[Groans]
I've been to L.A. once.

242
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:54,116
Olive just turns into Barham?

243
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:56,519
- Justice for Rodney King!
- How do I get to 10?

244
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:57,837
[Sirens blaring]
It's <i>The</i> 10!

245
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,156
Rodney King!

246
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,724
You can't afford to be
selective.

247
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,026
Opportunities for writers
are fewer and farther between.

248
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,195
What about opportunities
for storytellers?

paintings of Lascaux, mankind...

00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,574
Yeah.

254

Do you know Nick Lachey?

260
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,069
I hear he doesn't even
let you sit in the meeting.

261
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,687
He just screams at you
to see how you react.

262
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,622
Wait, you're not really
applying for this job, are you?

263
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,524
Of course I am. You gotta
take work where you can find it.

264
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,693
Especially now.
Our craft is dying

and poking each other
on Facebook.

267
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,298
What is poking, anyway?
Why won't anybody do it to me?

268
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,499
I'm cool!

So it's really
that bad out there.

Xdo you know how to beat <i>11-4?</i>

272
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,090
It's just a red guy
and a green guy.

273
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,475
The key is do not use
the green guy as a boomerang.

274
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,544
- Did we just go in a circle?

Not that it matters.

Mr. Sorkin,

Mr. Lachey, huge fan.

Oh. You'll be proud of me,
Miss Lemon.

286
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:23,339
It is not easy coming up
with ideas to save the show.

287
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,407
But this morning,
I held up this sign

288
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,043
in the <i>Today Show</i> window.

289
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,379
Now, I'm just waitin'
for the phone to ring.

290
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,415
Kenneth, you may not be able
to save the show.

291
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:34,750
If you wanna save
this dumb show,

292
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:36,785
you gotta get the fans
involved.

293
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:39,188
You know, like sometimes
people mail stuff to networks

294
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,756
to show how passionate
they are.

295
00:10:40,824 --> 00:10:43,893
They sent light bulbs
to save <i>Friday Night Lights,</i>

296
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,594
hot sauce to save <i>Roswell,</i>

297
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,863
and douche bags
to save <i>Entourage.</i>

298
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,199
Okay. So we just need
to think of something

299
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:54,536
that fans can send
to Hank Hooper that says <i>TGS.</i>

300
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:56,772

00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:35,477
so no one would know
whose baby is whose.

316
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:39,281
Now... have you had your fun
looking at the freak?

317
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,983
I'm here to offer
an olive branch.

318
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:42,368
I'm working
with Kabletown now,

319
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,320
and we've acquired
a network called <i>Twinks</i>.

320
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:47,122
I could use someone on it
full-time, a subordinate.

321
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,092
[Laughing]

322
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,329
You came all the way
out here to Brooklyn

323
00:11:53,396 --> 00:11:56,298
to offer me, Banks, a job?

324
00:11:56,366 --> 00:11:59,001
You must be desperate, Jack.

325
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:02,304
Twinks must be exploding,
and not in a good way.

326
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,206
You thought
that I would lick your boots,

327
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,774
but you need me.

328
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:08,811
So now I'm gonna make you
let me lick your boots.

329
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,145
I'll keep you
on a very tight leash.

330
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,547
- Fantastic. Continue.
- I will not

331
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,148
gay set you up again,
so I'll be very clear.

332
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,450
You'll be under me,

333
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:16,285
and if there's one slip-up,
your ass is mine.

334
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:21,123
You couldn't resist coming
to see how far I'd fallen.

335
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,491
But that was your mistake.

336
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,828
Down came the rain
and washed the spider out.

337
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,429
No. You are the spider.
I am the sun.

338
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,914
I dry up all the rain.

339
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,166
Yes! Freeing me, the spider,
to climb up the spout again!

340
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:33,068
[Whispers]
You bastard.

341
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,941
Now... Who wants
some num-nums?

342
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,541
Hey, Simon...
what's up?

343
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,480
Any word from <i>The Sing-Off?</i>

344
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:48,698
It's a pass.

345
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:51,468
But Lachey hated you.

346
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:53,503
- So what now?
- [Under breath] You're fired.

347
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,505
- What?
- [Mumbles] You're fired.

348
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,874
Are you dropping me
as a client?

349
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:59,709
What am I gonna do?

350
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,379
Jack can't help me.
You don't want me as a client.

351
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:04,197
I have no other skills.

352
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:06,816
Liz, I'm gonna tell you
what I tell my dog clients

353
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,151
when I drop them...
Chuh, chuh!

354
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:09,152
Chuh, chuh, chuh!

355
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:10,687
- Simon...
- Chuh!

356
00:13:10,755 --> 00:13:13,023
Chuh, chuh.

357
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:20,697
Jack. We've been waiting
almost an hour

358
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,148
for this Banks fellow.

359
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:23,883
The only explanation
I can think of

360
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:26,119
is that he keeps stopping
to perform good deeds.

361
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:28,138
No, he's pulling a power play,
right out of the gate.

362
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,372
He's making us wait

363
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,858
so it looks like I have
no authority over him.

364
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,710
[Laughs] Well, I'm
a straight shooter, Jack.

365
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:35,645
Except at the urinal,
but that's just a little

366
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,514
shrapnel side effect
from Vietnam.

367
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:39,149
So when it comes to business...

368
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:42,218
[Chuckling] I don't like
these kinds of games.

369
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,255
Boy, I hope my tone
is conveying how annoyed I am.

370
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,890
You should be annoyed, Hank,
of course.

371
00:13:46,957 --> 00:13:48,825
Devin's crude attempts
at manipulation

372
00:13:48,876 --> 00:13:50,860
don't work
with a man like you.

373
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:53,096
Banks is not a straight
shooter like you and me.

374
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,831
For now... we need him.

375
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:56,499
But as soon as he stops
being useful...

376
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,867
We throw him in a ditch.

377
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:00,203
My apologies, gentlemen.

378
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:01,538
I tried to call,

379
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,907
but somebody spilled milky
all over daddy's phoney.

380
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:05,675
Didn't you,
little Mykonos?

381
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:08,011
Together: You brought a baby
to a business meeting.

382
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:10,780
I'm so sorry, but this
little guy's really sick.

383
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:12,582
He threw up
all over my jacket,

384
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,067
and I just couldn't
leave him, but...

385
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:16,953
Of course, I didn't want to miss
this fabulous opportunity.

386
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:19,122
I'm always just trying to
balance work and family.

387
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,857
It's kinda
what I'm all about.

388
00:14:20,925 --> 00:14:24,527
Well, son, you're gonna do
great here at Kabletown.

389
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:25,628
Damn it!

390
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:27,030
You know,
one of my grandchildren

391
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,448
is just about the same age
as Mike here.

392
00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:30,633
- We should set up a playdate.
- How's tomorrow?

393
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:33,303
Uh, Hank, could Devin and I
just have a moment, please?

394
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,637
Of course!

395
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:37,540
I'll just entertain
this little bundle of joy

396
00:14:37,608 --> 00:14:39,459
with one of my Uncle Hank
stories.

397
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:42,445
The VC was everywhere.

398

Yes, they were.
Yes, they were!

This is a new low...
Even for you, Banks.

Using your own baby
to get in with Hooper.

401
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,321
I brought
the sexiest one, too.

402

His cheekbones
are like granite.

403
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,725
And old Hank the family man
fell right into my trap.

404

This isn't even baby vomit
on my jacket.

It's mine!
All mine.

This... is not over.

407
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:07,487
Oh, look how much
he just loves his Uncle Hank!

408
00:15:07,571 --> 00:15:08,988

teaching, sir?

swung a bat at me.

What are you doing
with those sugar cubes?

415
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:27,423
Starting a fan mailing
campaign to save the show!

416
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:30,493
People will send sugar cubes
to Hank Hooper

417
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:32,512
to show that
they're sweet on <i>TGS.</i>

418
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:34,647
I've already sent about
100 of these,

419
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,465
even though licking
an envelope is a sin.

420
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:38,635
Unless you're married to it.

421
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:41,437
So I had to marry each envelope,
and then divorce it.

422
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:42,939
Which brings me
to my ninth point...

423
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,341
so you're putting
a sugar cube in an envelope

424
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,343
and then mailing it
to Hank Hooper.

425
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,511
But then when he opens it,

426
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,013
it will have been crushed

427
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,482
into a fine, white powder.

00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,433
He has really superlative
tummy-time.

473
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:34,951
Oh! I almost forgot.

474
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:37,587
Hank... Uncle Hank...
wants to expand overseas,

475
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,423
and he's chosen me to be the
face of the company in Europe.

476
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:42,825
That's right.
I've been promoted.

477
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:44,110
But Europe is my purview.

478
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:45,561
I was supposed to go there
next week.

479
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,163
I was going to take a picture
where it looked like

480
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:48,831
I was holding up
the Leaning Tower of Pisa!

481
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:50,900
Now I'll be taking
that picture.

482
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:53,469
Do you have idea
how strong I'll look?

483
00:17:53,537 --> 00:17:56,306
I vanquished you
in one day!

484
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,640
I was trapped in a world

485
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,909
of wet wipes
and rectal thermometers.

486
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,995
Then the babies came,
and life changed.

487
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,946
But you set me free, Jack.

488
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,798
Now it's weekends in New York,

489
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:08,751
then Jet-Setting around
the world in economy plus.

490
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:11,804
I'll be thousands of miles away
from the chaos in Brooklyn.

491
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:13,840
Do you know what it's like
to have triplets?

492
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,341
It's just everything
times three.

493
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:16,926
Three pairs of grabby
little hands

494
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:19,812
smearing food all over your
brand-new chihuahua outfits.

495
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,932
Three pairs of feet in their
weird, soft little shoes.

496
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,535
Three Paris of eyes,
brown...

497
00:18:25,602 --> 00:18:27,503
Like my husband's.

498
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:30,373
Three perfect little mouths...

499
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:34,277
That smile every time
I walk through the door.

500
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,112
Three tummies...

501
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,015
That just want their num-nums
and zerberts.

502
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,851
Oh, God, I just love
my gaybies too much.

503
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,037
I can't leave!

504
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:46,155
That's it?

505
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:48,657
You're just going to talk
yourself out of it?

506
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,876
I'm sorry, Jack.

507
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,227
But I had stuff planned.

508
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,729
I was going to
<i>Trading Places</i> you.

509
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:55,965
I was bailed out of prison
and told to come up here.

510
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:58,568
That was weak, Banks.

511
00:18:58,635 --> 00:18:59,969
I don't expect you
to understand.

512
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:02,004
You don't know
what it's like to have kids.

513
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:03,339
Actually, Devin, I do.

514
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,308
I have a baby daughter,
Liddy.

515
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,677
And yet you still managed
to be here all night

516
00:19:07,745 --> 00:19:09,479
trying to figure out
how to bring me down.

517
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:11,864
Well, damn, Jack...

518
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:13,149
You are strong.

519
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,318
You're like Dora's friend...

520
00:19:15,386 --> 00:19:17,687
Both: Benny the bull.

521
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:18,854
Thank you.

522
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:24,527
Jonathan, call my car.

523
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:29,065
[Sighs]

524
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:38,441
Okay. Here's an idea.

525
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,977
We keep <i>TGS</i> going
as a Magazine.

526
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:43,079
Miss Lemon, it's over.

527
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,081
I applied
to transfer to News.

528
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:47,683
I'm sorry.
I couldn't save the show.

529
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,852
Here.

530
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,021
I'm actually
not that hungry.

531
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:53,356
That's funny.

532
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,857
This is the same place
Mr. Jordan

533
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,359
gets pizza from in Africa.

534
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,726
I'm sorry, what?

535
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,562
Oh, when Mr. Jordan and I
talk on the computer,

536
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:02,031
sometimes he's eating
this exact same pizza.

537
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:03,466
Africa's great.

538
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:05,902
We got Juju monsters...

539
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:07,353
Gum-gum trees...

540
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:08,704
And horsicorns...

541
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,274
Which is a unicorn
with a horse's head.

542
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,210
Kenneth,
you beautiful goon!

543
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:15,578
He's not in Africa.

544
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:17,263
He's somewhere
in the delivery zone

545
00:20:17,347 --> 00:20:18,765
of Federici's Pizza!

546
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,800
We can find him
and bring him back here,

547
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:22,785
and no more forced hiatus!

548
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:24,620
I did it!
I saved the show!

549
00:20:24,688 --> 00:20:26,122
I won't have to go work
at News!

550
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,224
And I won't have to be
the world's worst hooker!

551
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,592
You wanna party?

552
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,728
It's 500 for kissing,
10,000 for snuggling.

553
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,831
End of list.

554
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:35,982
No!

555
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:40,002
I'm <i>hungry</i> again!

556
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:47,902
Have you made
friends in Africa?

557
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,402
Oh sure!

558
00:20:48,404 --> 00:20:52,002
Ladysmith Black Mambazo,
Paul Simon and Victus.

559
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,002
So, what's the weather like?

560
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:56,102
Crazy! It's the snowiest winter

561
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:59,102
we've had in years
in New York... in Africa.

562
00:20:59,303 --> 00:21:01,302
Well sir, I had a
very interesting morning

563
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,602
Oh, oh. It's nighttime.

564
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,602
Gotta go to bed, or I'll
anger the gods.

565
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:08,602
They must be crazy!
Africa!

566
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,012
I probably should have realized
he was in New York sooner.

567
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:16,005
Bird Internet.
