481
00:19:17,337 --> 00:19:19,471
Yes, you are
the sexual equivalent

482
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:21,607
of a million hindenburgs,
but you deserve

483
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:23,475
someone like Carol
in your life,

484
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:24,942
and he deserves you, because...

485
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,677
and I'm only gonna say this
once a decade...

486
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,279
you're great.

487
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:30,747
You're Liz Lemon, damn it.

488
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,415
In certain lights, you're an 8

489
00:19:32,483 --> 00:19:34,250
using east coast over-35
standards,

490
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:35,618
excluding Miami.

491
00:19:35,686 --> 00:19:36,819
Thanks, Jack.

492
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,487
You go in there,
you grab Carol,

493
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,489
you take him into one of those
unisex family bathrooms,

494
00:19:40,557 --> 00:19:42,057
pull down
that diaper-changing thing,

495
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:43,992
and go to town on him.

496
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,026
I'll try,
but if I couldn't get it done

497
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,994
in Vegas
after a Penn & Teller show,

498
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,762
I don't know
how it's gonna happen here.

499
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,831
Wait a minute.

500
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,799
You had your problem
with Carol in Las Vegas?

501
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,500
- So?
- The Tom Jones poster.

502
00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:58,668
Tom Jones plays Vegas
all the time.

503
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:00,269
He has billboards everywhere.

504
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:01,570
No kidding.

505
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:03,705
There was one right
outside our hotel-room window.

506
00:20:03,773 --> 00:20:05,106
Oh, my God.

507
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,541
Think back
to your college boyfriend.

508
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:07,910
- Was there any...
- Yes!

509
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,612
When this happened with Joel,

510
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,014
<i>what's new pussycat?
Was playing</i>

511
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:12,248
on the bus we were on.

512
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:13,482
I mean, the room we were in.

513
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,616
And when it happened
with Dennis,

514
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:15,784
he had just gotten a perm.

515
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,352
Tom Jones is the trigger.

516
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,154
He makes you remember your
mother taking the people away.

517
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,855
Does this mean I'm fixed?

518
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,423
Oh, God, no. You've got years
of therapy ahead of you,

519
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,724
probably electroshock.

520
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,259
But this is a breakthrough,
Lemon, and a big one.

521
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,694
Jack Donaghy, in my book,
you're better than Reagan.

522
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:32,462
I appreciate that, Lemon,
but if you ever speak ill

523
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:35,230
of Reagan again, I will smack
those teeth straight.

524
00:20:38,434 --> 00:20:41,469
U-S-A! U-S-A!

525
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:44,305
U-S-A! U-S-A!

526
00:20:47,176 --> 00:20:48,776
He's at JFK.

527
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:50,545
I wrote it down wrong.

529

[car door closes]

530
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,505
- How is the sex?
- Fast and only on Saturdays.

531
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:07,172
It's perfect.

532
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,807
I have been sexually rejected

533
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:11,409
by not one, but two guys

534
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,544
who later
went to clown college.

535
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:15,746
And one time at summer camp,
I kissed a girl on a dare,

536
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:17,481
but then she drowned.

537
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,749
It was the first gay guy
I ever kissed.

538
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:21,518
Standing up?
What?

539
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:22,752
How does that even work?

540
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,187
- You haven't had sex?
- Shh.

541
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,089
We have, of course,
pleasured one another.

542
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:28,390
No, stop.
I believe.

543
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,558
Ugh!
Stop saying, "relationship."

544
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,493
I'm sorry.
I was going to say, "climax."

545
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:33,995
Ah!

9999
