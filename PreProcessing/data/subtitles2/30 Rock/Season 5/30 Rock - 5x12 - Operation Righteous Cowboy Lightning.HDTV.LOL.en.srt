1
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:05,512
It doesn't matter how long
you've lived in New York,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,147
it's still fun to look up

3
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,317
and pretend all the buildings
are giant severed robot penises.

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,319
Be quiet, Lemon.

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:13,553
It's happening.

6
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:20,027
Wow...

7
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,396
Out with G.E.,
in with Kabletown.

8
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:25,532
It seems like one of us should
sing <i>The Circle Game</i> right now.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,101
30 years at G.E....

10
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:30,204
Now it's on to phase two.

11
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:33,173
I'm like Keats' "Stout Cortez,"

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,709
staring at the Pacific
with a wild surmise

13
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:37,878
and daring to imagine what...

14
00:00:37,946 --> 00:00:41,548
New planets might swim
into my ken.

15
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:44,051
So will we be getting
new employee I.D.s?

16
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:45,886
'Cause I'd really like
to retake my photo.

17
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:47,221
Good God, what happened?

18
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:48,722
I was holding in a "snart,"

19
00:00:48,773 --> 00:00:51,775
and then right
when she took the photo...

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,260
Don't you want to know
what a "snart" is?

21
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,594
I can tell you now.
It's 10:00.

22
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,096
10:00 in the morning.

23
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:11,777
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

24
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,253
Ugh.

25
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,955
FYI, Tracy's
phoning it in today.

26
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:22,956
What else is new?

27
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:24,658
No, mother, literally.

28
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:27,361
Are you also staying
at this hotel?

29
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:28,462
Line.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,767
Tracy, we have been
playing this game

31
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:34,968
for five years now.

32
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,904
- When is it ever gonna stop?
- I don't know.

33
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,273
After I win a bunch
of awards for my movie,

34
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:40,541
it's not gonna get better.

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,209
I don't see how
it could get any worse.

36
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,911
Good question, Liz Lemon.

37
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,546
When you win an Oscar,
it opens up

38
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,181
an elite level
of actor craziness...

39
00:01:47,248 --> 00:01:49,249
throwing telephones
at hotel employees,

40
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,386
speaking to the U.N. about
some messed-up crap in Africa,

41
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:54,989
and I'm definitely
getting a private island.

42
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:56,423
You're getting an island?

43
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,892
Every crazy A-lister
owns an island...

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,027
Nicholas Cage,

45
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:02,096
Celine Dion, Charles Widmore.

46
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,566
This is a whole new world
in front of me, L.L.

47
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,369
I'm like Stout Cortez!

48
00:02:08,436 --> 00:02:10,771
He's my gardener.
He's easily amazed.

49
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,523
You have two choices here.

50
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,842
Either you can stay
in your room, like a child,

51
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,977
or you can get out there
and do your job.

52
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:20,731
Thank you.

53
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,783
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was misleading.

54
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,418
I'm not gonna rehearse.

55
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:26,820
I'm gonna get a sandwich
and then eat it on the toilet.

56
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:38,132
- What are you wearing?
- My NBC page dress blues.

57
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,200
I want to look good,
in case I get on camera.

58
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:41,535
On what camera?

59
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:42,970
Well, Mrs. Jordan's
reality show

60
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,406
is gonna be following Mr. Jordan
around while he's at work.

61
00:02:45,473 --> 00:02:46,573
- What?
- I know!

62
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,941
Isn't it exciting?

63
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:49,777
I've never been on TV before.

64
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:52,112
I hope I photograph okay,

65
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,048
because when I look
into a mirror,

66
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,749
there's just a white haze.

67
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:58,252
Who told Tracy
he could bring cameras here?

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,987
Well, Mr. Donaghy.
Uh, here...

69
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,739
I couldn't put the memo
in your mailbox,

70
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:03,890
'cause it's full
of unread adoption materials.

71
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:05,159
Yeah.

72
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:09,063
Hey.
Are the reality cams here?

73
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,369
Oh, God, Lutz, why?

74
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:17,504
What?
I don't want tush lines.

75
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,174
Oh!

76
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,708
You know...

77
00:03:21,776 --> 00:03:23,310
I have enough problems
with Tracy.

78
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:26,146
I don't need cameras following
him around while he's here.

79
00:03:26,214 --> 00:03:28,082
Do you know what pays
for your show, Lemon?

80
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:30,517
Our product placement with
Sullivan Psychiatric Clinic.

81
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,785
"Sullivan Psychiatric...

82
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,654
You'll drool over
our crazy prices."

83
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,522
Reality TV.

84
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,192
A woman with "hundruplets,"
a live execution,

85
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,361
<i>the real transvestite hoarders</i>
<i>of Orange County Penitentiary.</i>

86
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,163
Ugh, that show is upsetting.

87
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,931
Why does the warden
let Lady Extravaganza

88
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,433
have so many spoons?

89
00:03:46,484 --> 00:03:49,369
Programs like that are
the lifeblood of this industry.

90
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,937
They're cheap, promotable,

91
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,439
and even if they're terrible,

92
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,275
you get a rating and move on
to the next idea.

93
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,460
Everybody wins.

94
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,744
Well, I happen to think

95
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,980
we are in a new golden age
of scripted television.

96
00:04:00,048 --> 00:04:01,315
Shh, shh.

97
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:02,816
Lemon, it's okay.

98
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,853
As I begin phase two
of my jack attack on Kabletown,

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,971
I've been doing some research.

100
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:10,023
Do you know what the most
successful reality events

101
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:11,525
of the past five years are?

102
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:14,294
Celebrity benefits
for natural disasters.

103
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:16,830
The viewership is huge.

104
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,332
Yes, but those ratings
mean nothing.

105
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,534
All the networks air those
benefits at the same time,

106
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:21,735
so no one gets an advantage.

107
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,404
True, unless only one network
is carrying it,

108
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,573
because only one network
is ready to broadcast

109
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,509
a benefit on the night
of the disaster.

110
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:29,710
But that's impossible.

111
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:31,011
There's not enough time
to put it together.

112
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,314
Unless you've pretaped
the show beforehand

113
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:38,085
and filmed options for every
possible disaster scenario.

114
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,153
You're going to pretape
a benefit

115
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,089
for a disaster
that hasn't happened yet?

116
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,491
- Yeah.
- That is bad karma, Jack.

117
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,193
I mean, this morning,
I stole a cab

118
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,895
from a pregnant lady
on crutches,

119
00:04:47,962 --> 00:04:49,897
and I am just waiting...

120
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,666
Uh, my goodness, Lemon.

121
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,535
The people affected
will still get money,

122
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:55,669
but so will NBC.

123
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:56,737
Everybody wins.

124
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,205
Oh, and I need Jenna to sing.

125
00:04:58,273 --> 00:04:59,439
I'll do it!

126
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,859
But I hate my dress.

127
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,004
All right, listen up,
everybody.

128
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,789
I need ideas from you people

129
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,924
for potential
natural disasters...

130
00:05:10,992 --> 00:05:14,094
Anything that might require
a televised celebrity benefit.

131
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,229
I need something new,

132
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:17,097
and I need it
by the end of the day,

133
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,700
so...

134
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:21,869
Let's get to work.

135
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:25,639
Well, I just finished
a screenplay

136
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,875
where a tidal wave
destroys Washington.

137
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:30,127
Someone write down tidal wave.
Shut him up.

138
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,013
What about a tornado
that hits a handgun factory,

139
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:35,249
and it's just spinning around
shooting handguns?

140
00:05:35,316 --> 00:05:37,351
What happens
when the second flood comes,

141
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,420
and you aren't allowed
on reverend Gary's ark?

142
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,121
Especially since
reverend Gary made it clear

143
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,873
the ark is just
for teenage boys.

144
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:44,625
You know, with global weirding
and everything,

145
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,393
stuff like that
could totally happen here.

146
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,195
There was a cyclone
in Brooklyn last year.

147
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:51,198
It destroyed two vintage-t-shirt
stores and a banjo.

148
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,466
If something does happen,

149
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:53,700
it'll probably be
while we're at work.

150
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:55,169
I mean, this is where we spend
all of our time.

151
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:56,403
We should have a plan in place.

152
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,921
If we don't, I will freak out

153
00:05:58,006 --> 00:05:59,473
and start
karate-kicking people.

154
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,975
Everyone needs
an emergency plan.

155
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,395
For instance,
right before the ark leaves,

156
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,847
I'm supposed to castrate
reverend Gary.

157
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,986
I see you finally
decided to come to work.

158
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:13,954
Of course.

159
00:06:14,022 --> 00:06:15,272
I'm just continuing

160
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,957
my consistent
professional behavior.

161
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,826
Let's laugh together, friend.

162
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:26,467
- What's going on with him?
- First of all, good morning.

163
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:29,837
And to answer your question,
it's Angie's cameras.

164
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:31,438
These reality shows
want crazy behavior,

165
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:32,940
so Tracy's keeping it boring...

166
00:06:33,007 --> 00:06:34,775
Give them nothing
that could make him look bad.

167
00:06:34,843 --> 00:06:36,977
Since when does Tracy care
about looking bad?

168
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:38,645
Since he got nominated
for an Oscar.

169
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:40,981
Then once he wins,
it's on to the next level,

170
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,483
which I am not looking
forward to.

171
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,802
That island he wants to buy
is filled with scorpions.

172
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:46,620
Let's do it again from the top.

173
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,155
I want to get it perfect,

174
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:50,424
because perfection
is my middle name...

175
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:52,826
"Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy."

176
00:06:58,032 --> 00:06:59,616
So here's the plan.

177
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,935
If anything happens, we meet
outside under the Atlas statue,

178
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,437
walk to the 59th Street bridge,

179
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:05,005
and try to get
to my mom's house in Queens.

180
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:06,006
Okay, good.

181
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,274
We've got a wide skill set

182
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:08,842
for any
post-apocalyptic scenario.

183
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,178
I'm good at archery
and kind of want to die.

184
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,180
I can use my glasses
to start a fire.

185
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:15,282
Toofer can get us
through black, gay,

186
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,551
and nerd-controlled
neighborhoods.

187
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:19,820
Cerie will be some sort of queen
in the new society.

188
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:22,623
I will do sex with cannibals
as needed.

189
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,891
I can talk to animals.

190
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:25,125
Well, not talk to 'em...

191
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:28,011
I can take commands from 'em.

192
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,964
Huh. Lutz... What can he do?

193
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:33,150
Well, he's slow and a coward.

194
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:35,903
I'm not useless.

195
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,971
I mean, I've got a car.

196
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:39,573
Oh, I didn't know that.

197
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:41,408
All right, Lutz is the driver.

198
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:42,993
W-wait.
How big is your car?

199
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,811
- Can it fit all of us?
- Oh, right.

200
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,480
It's actually pretty small.

201
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:49,550
I could only take
three of you...

202
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:53,253
So I'll have to choose.

203
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,088
That sucks.

204
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:57,925
It's like a reality show
where you guys get to compete

205
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:01,728
for a seat in my car
by proving how much you like me.

206
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,435
Tracy, I need you
to do something.

207
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:09,770
Of course, friend.

208
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,672
Teamwork is the key to success.

209
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,006
Yeah.

210
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:15,609
You need to stay late
for a wardrobe fitting tonight.

211
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:17,377
It should take about two hours.

212
00:08:17,445 --> 00:08:18,745
Okay.

213
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,180
No problem.

214
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,950
After that, I need you
to record that DVD commentary

215
00:08:23,017 --> 00:08:25,452
that you've been putting off
for five years.

216
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,121
Hope you didn't have
plans tonight.

217
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:30,691
No, I wasn't gonna buy
two blimps

218
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:33,126
and crash them into each other
to see what sound they made.

219
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:36,129
Look, is there anything that
you two could maybe fight about?

220
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:38,465
An argument that culminates in
a racial slur would be lovely.

221
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:40,467
Sorry, this is gonna be nice
and boring.

222
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:43,070
Tracy's even going to agree
to attend a fundraiser

223
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:44,972
for my cousin's dance studio.

224
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,406
Aren't you, Tracy?

225
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:51,612
So we're good?

226
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,247
Never better.

227
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:56,049
I'm as happy as a clam
that wants to kill some woman.

228
00:08:56,117 --> 00:08:58,185
Great.
You're the best.

229
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,353
Love you!

230
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,122
Love you more!

231
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:06,893
Boy, I-I don't know, Jack.
This just doesn't feel right.

232
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,428
Bob, it's for charity.

233
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:11,131
And if you don't do it,
I'll have MSNBC tell the world

234
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,599
you grew up in England.

235
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,468
But I'm
so identified with New York,

236
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:15,736
you bloody tosser!

237
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:18,739
Bob...

238
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:20,924
Okay.

239
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:23,010
Disaster options, take one.

240
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:25,078
"We'll always remember
where we were

241
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,948
"when we heard that tornado
had hit a handgun factory.

242
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,484
"Two days ago, when people
thought of a mudslide,

243
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:32,819
"they just thought of getting
drunk in an Applebee's.

244
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:36,256
"But now we know it as
the thing that destroyed Denver.

245
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,458
"When the birds first
started attacking us,

246
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:41,295
"we all thought it was pretty
funny and made Hitchcock jokes.

247
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:42,963
"But we're not laughing now,

248
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:46,033
"because our laughter excites
the birds sexually.

249
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,702
"This devastating wildfire.

250
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,370
"This horrible flood.

251
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:52,139
"This wonderful flood

252
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:54,608
"that put out
that devastating wildfire.

253
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:57,911
These super-intelligent sharks."

254
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,682
Tracy, I just thought

255
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:03,583

260
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,464
This is great stuff,
but that's Billy Joel's.

261
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:18,999
Anything you sing
to that tune, uh...

262
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,400

Fantastic, Jenna.
You really brought

293
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,864
the songwriting computer's
words to life.

294
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:50,534
Wow, you're actually
doing this.

295
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:52,603
Yes, all I'm missing
is the disaster.

296
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,137
Well, I'm in the middle
of a Tracy disaster.

297
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:56,006
I thought I could use
Angie's cameras

298
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:58,442
to make him behave,
but he found a loophole,

299
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,661
and now, to close it,
I need $80,000

300
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:02,379
to buy the rights
to <i>Uptown Girl.</i>

301
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,547
Lemon, it sounds like

302
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:05,048
you're trying to fight crazy
with crazy.

303
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,516
Yeah, because crazy
is the only language

304
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:07,718
that Tracy is fluent in.

305
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,186
But you'll never
out-crazy Tracy,

306
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:10,520
so why don't you have it out
with him

307
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:12,155
once and for all,
like two adults?

308
00:12:12,223 --> 00:12:13,557
Because we're not
two adults, Jack.

309
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,692
One of us is an actor,
and actors are not people.

310
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,061
Someone get a P.A.
to feed me baby food,

311
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:20,330
or I will drop a "d"
in the green room!

312
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:21,732
Yeah.

313
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,469
Last week you thought
I was crying wolf, didn't you?

314
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,853
Lutz is the best.

315
00:12:26,938 --> 00:12:29,323
- Nice feet, Lutz.
- I like Lutz the most.

316
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:30,974
Look at all of you
trying to impress me.

317
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,543
I feel like the bachelor.

318
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:37,147
But, uh,
whom shall I give my rose?

319
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:43,537
It's so hard to choose
when everyone loves me so much.

320
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:47,174
But only three of you
can ride to safety in my car.

321
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:48,342
Mmm!

322
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:52,829
I don't really have a car.

323
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:59,903
Tracy, your little
singing game is over.

324
00:12:59,971 --> 00:13:01,905
I got auto-tune
for my computer,

325
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:04,308
and if you try to sing,
I'll just take out the melody,

326
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,976
and no one has to pay for that.

327
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:07,844
♪ Liz Lemon won ♪

328
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,313
♪ do do do do ♪

329
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:11,848
That was me singing the Beatles'
<i>Here Comes the Sun</i>

330
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:12,883
for free.

331
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,184
L.L., please.

332
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:16,536
I'm way ahead of you.

333
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:17,888
And I'm not rehearsing.

334
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:19,856
I'm going to shoot
garden gnomes with a handgun

335
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,024
at Tupac's house.

336
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:22,576
Yeah, Tupac is alive.

337
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,544
I bet you'd like to have that
on your show.

338
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,029
Yes, Tracy, obviously.

339
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,364
But again,
I can't use any of it

340
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,699
when you're wearing that mask.

341
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,384
The Rangers logo
is trademarked.

342
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:32,169
Okay, fine.
Jack was right.

343
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,370
I can't out-crazy you.

344
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,255
So we're gonna talk, right now.

345
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,506
No cameras.

346
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:43,380
All right, Tracy,
the kid gloves are coming off.

347
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,316
Oh, that explains it.
Those are gloves.

348
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,418
No wonder they're
so coarse and wrinkly.

349
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:51,321
Five years ago,
I rescued your career.

350
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:52,773
And how do you repay me?

351
00:13:52,857 --> 00:13:55,325
By making my life harder
at every turn.

352
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:57,560
You are late.
You blow off rehearsals.

353
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:00,330
And your online romance prank
was not funny!

354
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:01,565
I fell in love with you!

355
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,751
You wore a yellow hat
to that coffee shop.

356
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:06,937
You know what's actually funny
about all this?

357
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:08,572
You think I'm the problem.

358
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,474
Have you ever tried to work
with you?

359
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,576
Really?
You're trying to blame me?

360
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,011
Five years ago,
I saved your show.

361
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,080
I rode in here on a white horse

362
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,815
that you made me leave
in the lobby.

363
00:14:18,883 --> 00:14:22,319
All you do is stifle me
when you should be thanking me.

364
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:23,854
Oh, yeah,
I should be thanking you.

365
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:27,474
Without me, do you have any idea
where you would be right now?

366
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:30,193
This honky grandma be trippin'

367
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,295
over surfmaster's
mid-range jet skis!

368
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:35,315
Where do you think
you would be without me?

369
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,817
Now, Jerry, in rehearsal,

370
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:38,769
it's okay
to play with yourself.

371
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,337
But when we do the show...

372
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:42,772
Hey, dummy, you got
to drive me to paintball,

373
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,040
and no complaining.

374
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,459
The only reason
why I got that DUI

375
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:47,144
is 'cause it was your birthday.

376
00:14:47,211 --> 00:14:50,113
What's up, Jerry?
That's awesome.

377
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,316
Well, at least Jerry
bothered to come to rehearsal.

378
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,302
And in my alternate reality,

379
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:57,621
Dennis dies,
and I win the lottery.

380
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,623
But then I would run you over
with a jet ski!

381
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,624
Damn it!

382
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,962
Jonathan, come in here!

383
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,630
Fantastic news...

384
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:09,900
There's been
a natural disaster.

385
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,435
Was it in Indian Kashmir?

386
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,937
May Durga's trident pierce them
from the skies!

387
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:16,506
No. A typhoon just hit
an island in the South Pacific,

388
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:18,208
and news is going
to full-time coverage!

389
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,577
It's perfect.
The island is called Mago.

390
00:15:20,645 --> 00:15:21,878
It's near Fiji.

391
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:23,646
Heavy structural damage,
no fatalities...

392
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:25,081
Sad, but not too sad.

393
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,284
We'll get footage
of beautiful Polynesian people,

394
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:28,535
proud and topless,

395
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,821
maybe a pelican
near some diapers.

396
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,022
I don't know.

397
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:33,573
Oh, it's all happening so fast.

398
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,258
We haven't even given
this plan a code name.

399
00:15:35,326 --> 00:15:36,543
Haven't we?

400
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,996
Operation Righteous
Cowboy Lightning is a go.

401
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:47,671
Okay, first of all,
I look weird there

402
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:48,772
because I'm "snarting."

403
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,807
You "snarted"
in my dressing room?

404
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,143
And second of all,
I said no cameras.

405
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,946
That footage cannot be shown
on television.

406
00:15:56,013 --> 00:15:58,114
I'm trying to buy
a island over here.

407
00:15:58,182 --> 00:15:59,599
I'm sorry, Tray,
but now I just need

408
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:00,984
a heartfelt resolution.

409
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:02,986
So we're gonna use
a little reality-TV magic.

410
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:05,322
We call it staging it or lying.

411
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,190
We'll shoot you guys
meeting in the hallway.

412
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,959
Uh, you apologize, you hug.

413
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:11,094
Ugh.
You are disgusting.

414
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:13,797
And I have absolutely no reason
to apologize to him.

415
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:15,298
And I have no reason
to hug her,

416
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:17,767
other than my love of having
boobs pressed against me.

417
00:16:17,835 --> 00:16:18,902
If I hugged you,

418
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,420
I would angle it
so that you got no boob.

419
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,172
And I would anticipate
your angling,

420
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,406
and I would get there.

421
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:25,976
I would get there.

422
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,795
Yah!

423
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,616
Hey, buddy, I made you
an apocalypse road trip mix.

424
00:16:32,683 --> 00:16:34,284
I hope your car
has a CD player.

425
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:35,919
It has two.

426
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,587
And it has flames on the side.

427
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:38,922
Oh.

428
00:16:38,973 --> 00:16:40,941
Lutzy, guess what.

429
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,642
A friend of mine works
for Marvel,

430
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,661
and he got me four tickets
to a test screening

431
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:46,613
of <i>Captain America</i> tonight!

432
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:48,097
Nice!

433
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:50,984
Chris Evans' body
looks amazing in the trailer.

434
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:52,669
When's his
<i>Men's Health</i> cover?

435
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:57,040
Okay, so who you gonna take
with you besides Frank?

436
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:08,885
Dude, make up your mind.

437
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:10,453
We have to be in Harrison
by 6:00.

438
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:12,422
Wait.
It's in New Jersey?

439
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,957
How are we getting
to New Jersey?

440
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,892
You're going to drive us,
obviously.

441
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:21,131
What am I gonna do?

442
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:23,132
Where have you been, sir?
Have you seen the news?

443
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:25,301
I don't have to, Jonathan.
I know what's on it...

444
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:26,836
The poor people of Mago Island

445
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,972
and their brave
shorts-wearing police force.

446
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,540
If you're just joining us,

447
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:32,075
this is NBC's
continuing coverage

448
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,010
of the devastation in Mago...

449
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:37,530
the Fijian island owned by
controversial actor Mel Gibson.

450
00:17:37,615 --> 00:17:38,531
Good God.

451
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:40,450
We are receiving reports

452
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,118
of extensive damage
to the main house,

453
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,504
as well as the house
for Gibson's cars.

454
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:46,823
No word yet on the fate
of Gibson's collection

455
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:50,343
of anti-semitic
and misogynistic literature.

456
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:52,329
No!

457
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:54,881
No, this is not a prank.
This is Jack Donaghy.

458
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:57,968
And I'm calling about Operation
Righteous Cowboy Lightning.

459
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,603
Hello?

460
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,204
We are joined now by a relative

461
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,506
of the island's owner...
Oskar Gibson.

462
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:04,708
G'day.

463
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:07,861
First off, the holocaust
never happened.

464
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:11,531
Aah!

465
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:16,853
We go now to NBC's exclusive
primetime benefit

466
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,089
for the victims
of the devastation in Mago,

467
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:21,825
specifically Mel Gibson
and his houseguest,

468
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:22,892
Jon Gosselin.

469
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:28,665
Why do bad things
happen to good people?

470
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,767
We'll never know.

471
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,736
But look at these pictures.

472
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:35,538
Look at these
beautiful souls...

473
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,590
And pick up the phone.

474
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:39,776
Every dollar
you give to help...

475
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:41,144
Mel Gibson...

476
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:42,762
Will go towards rebuilding...

Now, you can't all fit, so...

484
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:10,173
Dude, did you just buy
that car?

485
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:11,441
What?

486
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,176
There's a dealer sticker
in the window,

487
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:14,611
you got no plates,

488
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,880
and you made these flames
out of magic marker and tape!

489
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,782
I'd rather die
than ride with him.

490
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,583
- Let's go.
- Uh, okay.

491

00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,446
Tracy, I need you.

- Of course, friend.
- So we're good?

Don't. You already said it

You said it all.

Hey.
Are you okay?

It was our highest rating
since that episode of <i>SVU</i>

520
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:41,829
where the detectives
watched <i>American Idol.</i>

521
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,464
It was a train wreck.

522
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:44,549
It was reality TV.

523
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:45,900
It can be good.
It can be terrible.

524
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,435
It just can't be
anything in between.

525
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,319
You know, some people
actually craft stories.

526
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:54,939
And when the story doesn't have an ending
you don't just create one out of thin air

527
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:58,561
by playing music or having people
give each other meaningful looks.

528
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:00,511
Sure, that might manipulate the audience

529
00:21:00,631 --> 00:21:03,284
into thinking they're feeling something,
but it sucks.
