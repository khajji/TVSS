Please. I don't even think
about you.

You're nothing.

9
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,334
I know the photo shoot
for Randi's dog's funeral

10
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,853
is the wrong place
to tell you this,

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,090
but I'm going to Africa.

I have an important meeting

Since Tracy
is off helping people in Africa,

20
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:55,355
I finally have a chance
to focus on me.

21
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,323
That is why I'm launching
my music career.

22
00:00:57,374 --> 00:00:58,858
It has been my dream
to be a singer

23
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:00,426
ever since I was a little...

24
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,962
drunk the other day and
rented out a recording space.

25
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,135
Oh, Angie, thank you
for coming in.

00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,337
NBC could not be happier...

About <i>Queen of Jordan.</i>

28
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,373
For the first time
in six months,

00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,842
we beat all the music
choice channels

except, of course,
Latin Beats.

31
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,113
Well, Angie's thinking
of the next move now.

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,248
As you know, my single
"My Single is Dropping"

33
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,050
- is dropping.
- What's happening?

34
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,852
My single is called
"My Single is Dropping"

35
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:26,853
and it's dropping.

36
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:27,987
Angie,
"My Single is Dropping"

37
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:28,988
is the reason I wanted

38
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,290
the three of us to meet.

39
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,191
With Tracy gone,

40
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,610
another "Best of" Special.

Actually, legal says
we can't use the word "best."

42
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:36,963
Either way,
the studio is free,

43
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,781
so I thought we would have
your release party there.

44

You would perform
and Lemon here

will help you put it
together.

46
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,136
What? No. I thought
we were here

47
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:45,622
to talk about getting Tracy
back from Africa.

48
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,341
Look, I love Tracy.
But he is work.

49
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,411
Angie, look what the banister
did to me!

50
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,079
Do know how much of my time
he wastes?

51
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,982
- Let's role play.
- Tracy, we're gonna be late!

With Tracy away, it's time
to let Angie be the star.

54
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,273
I hope Tracy doesn't come home
for months.

55
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,525
Months? No. We can't make it
that long without Tracy.

56
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,360
- You can't do this!
- Are you giving me orders?

57
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,611
Am I the waiter?

58
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,146
Is this the restaurant
that I'm opening up

59
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,814
with Dennis Rodman
and Webster?

60
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:15,601
No. I just thought
you would be on my side.

00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:18,454
"Yes, we can."

is tomorrow night.

for me to reveal

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,828
my shocking, secret past.

70

in Delaware.

so that's not an option.

into your crazy
reality show nonsense.

77

Liz, I'm so mad at you
for that thing you did.

Am I trying
to instigate fights

79
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,716
by throwing wine at people
just to get on camera

80
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,586
and maybe also promote my new
lifestyle web site:

81

Jennas-side.com?

82
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,823
Of course not.

83
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,659
I mean, is wine throwing
something that even gets you

84
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,060
on a reality show?

85
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,768
God, Jenna, I told you
not to buy that domain name.

86

- Say it out loud.
- Jennas-side... Genocide.

I'm not hearing it, Liz.

Hey, guess who's getting out
of jail.

they didn't collect $200.

Lynn Onkman.
Remember her?

91
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,019
Oh, sure,
that hot teacher from Queens

92
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:41,354
who had an affair
with her student.

Oh, my God.
Check out this picture.

Frank, is that you?

95
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,362
You never said
you were in Lynn Onkman's class.

96
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:52,398
- Sure, I did.
- What?

97
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,217
Do you know the kid
she had an affair with?

98
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,636
No. Yes. I don't know.
Shut up.

99
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,921
- It was you.
- I don't want to talk about it.

100
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,440
Well done, sir.

101
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,309
Guys, a teacher preying
on a student is wrong...

102
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,644
Yeah.

103
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,579
If the teacher is male
and the student is female.

104
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,715
What happened to Frank
is awesome.

00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,718
- Standing ovation.
- You don't understand!

It was love!
We were in love!

107
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,994
I need to look good
for my party.

108
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,963
And I refuse to wear anything
in my size

109
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,099
or appropriate for my age.

Wow.
If only Tracy were here,

113
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,142
he'd be, like, "Damn, woman,

"I want to make love
to your neck."

how I think Portia has no class.

- Yeah, you heard me, Portia.
- Uh-uh.

I will not be in the same room
as that woman.

00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:31,465
Again?

148
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:32,549
When I was at Princeton,

149
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,384
I played baseball
and football.

150
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:37,287
And back then,
football players went both ways.

151
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:40,924
Really?
So you went both ways?

152
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:44,778
Yeah. We all did.
It was the '70s.

153
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:48,031
So when you played baseball,
were you ever on the DL?

154
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,934
Yeah. I was on the DL
most of my junior year.

155
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:53,620
Mm.
DL can mean "disabled list."

156
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:56,907
But it can also mean
"down low" or "secretly gay."

157
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,809
Which one

00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:48,652
It's not a weave. Gah.

314
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:07,260
♪ It's the beauty
by of redemption ♪

315
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:08,427
Jenna, will you accept
the help

316
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:09,495
we're offering you today?

317
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:10,763
Of course.

318
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:14,967
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

319
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:21,541
Jenna, this is Charles.
He has his van waiting outside.

320
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:22,942
How nice.

321
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,327
He's gonna take you
to the airport

322
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:25,695
and then fly with you

323
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,782
to the Alternatives Treatment
Center in Minnesota.

324
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,003
Well, of course, 'cause that's
how interventions end.

325
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:35,621
And I can't back out now

326
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:37,489
otherwise they can't use
any of this.

327
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,991
Oh, God.

328
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,826
Anyway,
that's why I did it.

329
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:42,345
One, To see the fear
in her eyes.

330
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,430
And two,
Without Tracy or Jenna,

331
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,265
we can file a claim
against the show's insurance

332
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,734
and keep getting paid
without working.

333
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:51,904
So this is kind of the best day
of my life.

334
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:56,709
After my second husband
shot me the second time,

335
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:59,879
I realized that love
is the most important thing

336
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:01,881
in the world.

337
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:05,985
I just hope Frank does
the right thing.

338
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:08,354
[Gasps] Oh, Frank.

339
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:10,356
How did you know
where I work?

340
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:11,858
It's one of the benefits
of being in love

341
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:14,493
with a registered
sex offender.

342
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,897
Frank, about what happened
at Randi's Strippercise Studio...

343
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:22,585
No. You were right.
I have been afraid to grow up.

344
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,087
Well, what are you doing?

345
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:27,539
I'm throwing out
my kid stuff.

346
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,041
I want to become the man
you waited for.

347
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:30,259
The man you helped cheat

348
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:32,044
on the presidential physical
fitness test.

349
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:33,846
Well, if you didn't get better
at the shuttle run,

350
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:36,232
they were gonna put you
in the hospital.

351
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:38,517
Oh, no. That's your favorite.
You can't.

352
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:42,054
Skeletor's not my favorite.
You are.

353
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:46,558
Are you throwing toys
in the fryer?

354
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,094
You're fired, Onkman.

355
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:50,229
Now give me a waiver to sign.

356
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,666
The world has to be educated
about blurry face syndrome.

357
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:59,738
Angie's changed her hairstyle
since this last photo was taken

358
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,709
and D'Fwan
is a queer-fectionist.

359
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:07,263
Wow.
She gets a whole window?

360
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:10,082
Wait.
What used to be there?

361
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,815
Oh, Angie,
a Queen of Jordan indeed.

362
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:27,316
- Muah.
- Nnn.

363
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:31,904
Jack, I also suffer
from Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

364
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:35,741
It was the chair. Oh.

365
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,743
I hope you're not this clumsy
on the dance floor.

366
00:17:37,794 --> 00:17:40,446
- I am not clumsy.
- You know why you're so tense?

367
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:42,748
It's 'cause you have
a secret locked up inside you.

368
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,917
A man-sex secret.

369
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,836
You know what, I give up.

370
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,588
If this idiotic show insists
on portraying me

371
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,591
as some clumsy,
gay flatulent, so be it.

372
00:17:52,643 --> 00:17:55,344
I am extremely secure
in my athleticism,

373
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,097
my masculinity,
and my rectal integrity.

374
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:00,816
- Mm-hmm.
- "Mm-hmm," indeed, D'Fwan.

375
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,435
I know who I am.

376
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:06,022
So if you want to dance,
it would be my pleasure.

377
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,852
Yeah, he's straight.
That boy cannot dance.

378
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,456
I know what D'Fwan said
about me and it is on.

379
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:25,124
I'm a superb dancer.

380
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:27,827
At Princeton, I played Maria
in an all-male production

381
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:30,296
of <i>West Side Story.</i>

382
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:34,433
Oh, forget it. You people should
be ashamed of yourselves.

383
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:36,218
Ah.

384
00:18:36,303 --> 00:18:37,970
Jenna,
what are you doing here?

385
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:39,672
You're supposed
to be on a plane.

386
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,007
I explained to Charles
that I was just pretending

387
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,877
to be an alcoholic
to get on camera.

388
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:46,178
And we laughed.

389
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:48,647
And he said I can drink
as much as I want.

390
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:51,384
So cheers to good friends.

391
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,285
You... you're insane!

392
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:55,788
In the lobby, she pulled
a wrench out of her purse,

393
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:57,189
hit me over the head.

394
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:59,291
I will never go
to Minnesota.

395
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,543
"My Single is Dropping"

396
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:03,062
is not just
about a single dropping.

397
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,631
It's about a woman
learning to fly.

398
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:09,218
A woman who doesn't need a man
or anybody

399
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:12,254
except Josh at Sidney Bernstein
Management,

400
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,039
Sidney at Josh Bernstein
Accounting.

401
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,808
Shut up, Angie.
Just shut up!

402
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:18,911
I'm sick of your selfishness.
People's jobs are at sake.

403
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:22,264
I'm selfish?
You are a joke.

404
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:23,866
And everybody thinks so.

405
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,351
Let me talk.
I am talking.

406
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,086
Will you let me talk?
Can I talk for once?

407
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:28,954
You need to call Tracy
right now

408
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:30,556
because I know
that he is your man,

409
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:32,274
but he is my man too.

410
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,443
And <i>TGS</i> is my family.

411
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:38,730
And my family
is thick as thieves.

412
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:41,733
Now who here wants
to teach me how to fight?

413
00:19:41,785 --> 00:19:45,004
[Cries]

414
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:46,672
Attention everyone.

415
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,041
I found a glove
in the elevator.

416
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:53,846
If anyone is missing a glove,
I may have found your glove.

417
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:56,348
Angie, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to make you cry.

418
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:02,221
No. It's not you,
Liz Lemon. It's them.

419
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:06,025
I miss my weird love,
but he won't come back.

420
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,359
What?

421
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:09,662
I've been trying
to get Tracy to come back

422
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,481
ever since he left,
but he won't.

423
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:15,968
So I sit and act
like this is what I want.

424
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:19,155
But what I really want
is for everything to go back

425
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:21,407
to the way it used to be.

426
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:22,958
I just want to wake up
in the morning

427
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:26,128
and look over
at my husband asleep...

428
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,947
On our neighbor's roof.

429
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:30,833
But if you can't get him
to come back, who can?

430
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,001
What if he never comes back?

431
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:34,786
What is going to happen
to all of us?

432
00:20:34,838 --> 00:20:38,624
Wait. You know what,
this is my glove.

433
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:42,178
If anyone sees another glove,
I've lost one of my gloves.

434
00:20:42,262 --> 00:20:44,180
Thank you.

00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,847
You'll never get me Charles.

439
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,347
- Why are you mad at me??
- Because the way you ****

440

I never said it.

441
