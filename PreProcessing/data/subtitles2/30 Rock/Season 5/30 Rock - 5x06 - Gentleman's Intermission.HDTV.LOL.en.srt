1
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:04,804
I know I'm jumping
the gun a bit,

2
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:09,233
but I had this made
for the baby at hermes.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,104
So she can ride the maid!

4
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:13,496
It is adorable.

5
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:15,387
Uh, but are we still in love
with the name "Charlotte"?

6
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:17,969
I think so.
Why do you ask?

7
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:21,163
Charlotte?

8
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:23,629
Are you serious?

9
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:25,825
Lemon went to middle school
with a Charlotte

10
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,388
who used to rub herself
against a tree during recess.

11
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:30,221
I want to know
why you would tell Lemon

12
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:31,753
something so personal.

13
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:34,221
I know that my relationship
with Lemon may seem strange,

14
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,520
but I am her mentor.

15
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:39,153
And the Donaghy mentoring
experience is immersive.

16
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:40,850
There need to be boundaries.

17
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,883
That woman is your employee.

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,615
No, she's more than that.

19
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:46,781
I don't choose
my mentees lightly.

20
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,748
They have to have
the drive and ambition

21
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,180
to be worth my time,

22
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:51,981
the intelligence to understand

23
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,414
the challenges
they're going to face,

24
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:54,848
the humility to accept my help,

25
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:56,348
and finally,

26
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:59,382
a life that is a bottomless
swamp of chaos.

27
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,249
Drive, intelligence,
humility, chaos...

28
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:04,716
or the acronym "dihc."

29
00:01:04,784 --> 00:01:06,717
I'm looking for dihc, Avery.

30
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:08,717
And I'm gonna take it
wherever I can find it.

31
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:11,084
It's been four years, Jack.

32
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:12,918
Maybe it's time
for Liz to graduate.

33
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:15,952
Maybe it's time for you
to carry this baby.

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,152
Maybe you and Liz can raise it.

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,619
Oh, no.

36
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:24,088
Crazy hormone swing.

37
00:01:24,155 --> 00:01:27,222
Why does everything
smell like onions?

38
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,223
Lemon.
Boundaries.

39
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,157
Got it.

No!
No, it can't be!

45
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:08,678
I'm not done with him, Jacob!

46
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:11,479
He stays on this side!

47
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,580
Kenneth, Tracy's not dead.

48
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:14,814
Nbc news makes obituaries
for celebrities

49
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:16,048
to have them ready.

50
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:17,149
They're just updating Tracy's

51

to include his recent
submarine d.U.I.

52
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:21,418
Oh, thank goodness.

53
00:02:21,485 --> 00:02:24,486
Say, do you think I could
get a copy of that

54
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:26,254
to show Mr. Jordan?

55
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:28,522
That way, he can see
his own funeral,

56
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,189
just like Tom Sawyer!

57
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:31,790
Well, Tom was a fellow
from my town

58
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:33,891
we accidentally buried alive.

59
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,226
Funny story,
after we dug him back up,

60
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:37,660
he tried to kill all of us.

61
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,363
- Hello?
- Hey, Liz.

62
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:44,598
It's your father.
Dick Lemon.

63
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,932
Dad, you don't have to say
your name every time.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,101
Telephone etiquette
is important, Liz.

65
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,069
It lets people know your race
even when they can't see you.

66
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:54,404
Anyway, got a busy week?

67
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:56,238
Not really,
I was gonna take this class

68
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,339
called "cooking for one,"

69
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,040
but the teacher killed himself.

70
00:02:59,108 --> 00:03:00,141
Well, what about a visit?

71
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,942
Really?
That would be great.

72
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,743
With you and mom here,
the doormen will have

73
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:06,745
to eat their words about me
never having friends over.

74
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,713
Well, it'll just be me
this time, Elizabeth.

75
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:09,847
Your mother isn't coming.

76
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,715
What? You and mom
always travel together.

77
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,283
Well, she's not
coming this time.

78
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,584
I just want to have
a little fun by myself.

79
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:16,951
Can't a guy have a little fun?

80
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,620
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

81
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:21,188
Your mother's home.

82
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:24,290
This conversation
never happened.

83
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,593
What? What?

84
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,694
I am a Jedi!

<i>Tracy Jordan,
star of the fat bitch movies,</i>

86
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:36,631

representation of a black man"

87
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:37,798
nine years in a row.

88

Perhaps best known
for his fcc fines...

89
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:43,736
And thank God
I didn't [bleep] anybody,

90
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,637
and thank God
I [bleep] my [bleep].

91
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,372
And giving the queen parvo.

92
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,073
This is terrible!

93
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,341
When I'm dead,
that's what I leave behind?

94
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,443
That's how my grandkids
will remember me

95
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,143
as they fly around
in their jetpacks?

96
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:58,246
Well, it's not fair
out of context.

97

was sending signals.

98

It doesn't matter.
That's how the world sees me...

99
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,618
as some idiot millionaire.

100
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:07,186
Who, mark Cuban?

101
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,287
That guy ran me over
with a jet ski.

102
00:04:10,756 --> 00:04:12,324
What is he so upset about?

103
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:13,658
It's my fault.

104
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:15,726
I let Mr. Jordan
see his obituary.

105
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,094
He's dying?

106
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:19,462
Fine, I'll sing at his funeral.

107
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,763
No, ma'am.

Nbc news makes celebrity

109
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,634
Typical liberal media.

110
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:28,203
They do?
Well, then I need to see mine.

111
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,938
If they used any of the footage
from my shoplifting arrest,

112
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:33,673
that would be great because
my arms looked fantastic.

113
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,811
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

114
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,713
My dad just called, and...

115
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,581
Lemon, uh, I'm sorry.

116
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,948
If this is about
a personal matter,

117
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:45,149
we can't discuss it.

118
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:47,184
- What? Why?
- It's Avery.

119
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:48,952
She's going
to be my wife someday,

120
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,554
and understandably,
the nature of our relationship

121
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:53,256
is a little confusing to her.

122
00:04:53,323 --> 00:04:55,057
Oh, she feels threatened.

123
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,159
It must be my "sesuality,"

124
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:59,928
because I am
so very "sesual."

125
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,496
You like that?

126
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:04,398
And maybe Avery is a little
emotional these days.

127
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:06,700
She's put on considerable
boob weight.

128
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:09,269
She's not used to that,
and sometimes she

129
00:05:09,337 --> 00:05:10,670
just falls over.

130
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:12,005
It's stressful.

131
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:14,340
But she might have
a point about us.

132
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,742
Maybe it isn't appropriate
for you to still come to me

133
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,010
with every little
problem in your life.

134
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:20,879
Oh. Okay.

135
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:23,481
Great. Fine.

136
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,549
I'll solve my own problems.

137
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:34,157
Blammo. Solved it.

138
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:36,493
What do you mean,
I don't have an obituary?

139
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,295
I'm Jenna Maroney.

140
00:05:38,363 --> 00:05:39,829
I played arts and literature

141
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:41,666
in the film adaptation
of trivial pursuit.

142
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,133
I know who you are,
miss Maroney,

143
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,967
but you're not on the list.

144

for people they think are,

145
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:48,804
you know, important.

146
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:50,739
Like who?

147
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,841
Kim Jong-il?

148
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,877
I never heard of her.

149
00:05:54,945 --> 00:05:57,479
I should be on here.

150
00:05:57,547 --> 00:05:59,147
You wanted to see me, sir?

151
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:01,016
Jonathan,
I may be in the market

152
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,451
for a new young person
to mentor.

153
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,819
Oh, my God.

154
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,454
Sir, I have dreamed
of this moment...

155
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:11,057
but my fear is that you don't
have enough ambition.

156
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,894
The drive to deserve
my mentorship.

157
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,262
No, sir, there is nothing
in the world

158
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,697
that I wouldn't do for you.

159
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:20,032
My attorney is waiting
in his office.

160
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,302
He will present you
with a contract to be my mentee

161
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,837
if you bring him...

162
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,539
My pinky.

163
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:28,974
No, sir.

164
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:31,009
Then you wouldn't
be perfect anymore.

165
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,010
- I won't do it.
- Exactly.

166
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,412
I knew that you wouldn't.

167
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,713
No, no, watch!

168
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:39,116
I'll cut off my pinky
and tell him it's yours.

169
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:41,985
Jonathan.

170
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:45,521
Ambition is the willingness
to kill the things you love

171
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,156
and eat them
in order to stay alive.

172
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:50,323
Haven't you ever read
my throw pillow?

173
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,633
- Dad.
- Hi, sweetheart!

174
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:02,867
Mwah!

175
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:04,369
Where are your glasses?

176
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:05,970
And what's with that shirt?

177
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:07,271
I don't need my glasses,

178
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,473
and this is
an Edward Hardy shirt.

179
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,810
A very hip Latino-sounding
blur at Mervyn's

180
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:14,444
said I looked good in it.

181
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,246
Dad, what are you doing?

182
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:17,780
You're traveling alone,

183
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:20,316
you show up here looking like
you've been on spring break

184
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:21,817
for 300 years,

185
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:25,020
and earlier, mom called
and told me to give you a hug

186
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:26,822
before your colonoscopy.

187
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:28,556
- Uh-oh.

188
00:07:28,624 --> 00:07:31,392
Dad, look at me.
What is going on?

189
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,294
Honey, there's no easy way
to say it.

190
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:34,761
Your mother and I
are taking a little break.

191
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,096
A break?
After 45 years?

192
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,765
Honey, it's complicated.
We're having problems.

193
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,134
Really, does mom know
you're having problems?

194
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:43,535
'Cause she thinks
you're at the doctor.

195
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,104
Your mother and I
don't laugh like we used to.

196
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:48,105
I don't know what happened.

197
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:51,041
Where has my best friend gone?

198
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:54,345
Ugh!
What are you talking about?

199
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:57,581
You're just pretending
like there's some big problem

200
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,983
so you can come up here
and, what, try to pick up women?

201
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:03,318
You think they won't notice
that you're 80

202
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:04,953
because you took
your glasses off?

203
00:08:05,021 --> 00:08:08,156
I will not be spoken to
this way, young lady.

204
00:08:08,223 --> 00:08:09,890
You know what,
you're not staying here

205
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,424
during your little time-out.

206
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:15,095
Your
"gentleman's intermission."

207
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,931
Go to a hotel.

208
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,166
Or better yet, go home to mom.

209
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:21,602
Fine.
I don't need you.

210
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,270
I'm meeting up
with my old army buddy Gary.

211
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,705
Tonight,
we're doing a push-up,

212
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:28,541
and tomorrow, we're going
to a bar called "Swingles."

213
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,344
Gary's wife just died
a couple of days ago,

214
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,112
and he hasn't returned
the hospital bed yet,

215
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,413
so I can sleep there!

216
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,348
Now, where's the door?

217
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,416
I'm not telling!

218
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,421
Cold.

219
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,489
Colder.
It's...

220
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,225
ha ha!

221
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,894
Hello?

222
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:10,636
Hey, girl!

223
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:11,970
What do you want, Liz?

224
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:13,672
Look, I know
I shouldn't be calling,

225
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:14,839
but my dad is in town,

226
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:17,475
taking a break
from being married.

227
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:19,009
It's a
gentleman's intermission.

228
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:21,510
And you want to talk
about this with your boss?

229
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:22,778
Well, when you put it
like that...

230
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,379
with the mean voice and all...

231
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:26,981
good night, Liz.

232
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:37,257
What's wrong, tray?

233
00:09:37,324 --> 00:09:39,592
Why are you sitting
in your sadness spotlight?

234
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,728
I seen my nbc news obituary,
Jackie d.

235
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,061
I look like a fool in it.

236
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,796
Well, certainly
you can't be surprised

237
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:47,631
that there's a lot of negative
stuff about you out there.

238
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:48,832
Don't you ever Google yourself?

239
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,700
Sure, I Google myself
all the time.

240
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,134
Like when Angie's
not in the mood,

241
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:55,003
or I'm alone in the hotel.

242
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,438
Uh, Tracy, you do know
that googling yourself

243
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:59,440
means looking yourself up
on the Internet.

244
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:00,874
I did not know that.

245
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:04,244
That explains why Liz Lemon
was so cool the other day.

246
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,080
Liz Lemon, you mind if I
Google myself in your office?

247
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,782
- Sure, Tracy.
- Can I use your computer?

248
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,084
How else are you gonna do it?

249
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:14,520
Tracy, you are someone
with a lot of problems,

250
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,255
who needs constant guidance.

251
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:18,090
And don't forget,
I never listen.

252
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:21,127
If you're open to it,
I'm very good at giving advice.

253
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,128
For example,
with your obit problem.

254
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:26,163
Now, you've spent years creating
a certain public image.

255
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:28,031
But you can change that.

256
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:29,466
You just have to do
what prince hal did.

257
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,034
Who's prince hal?

258
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:32,535
<i>From Henry iv.</i>

259
00:10:32,603 --> 00:10:35,070
You played him
in central park last summer.

260
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:37,372
I don't know any of my lines!

261
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,507
Everyone thought prince hal
was a drunken wastrel.

262
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:41,975
But when he became king,

263
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,643
he transformed himself
into a wise and just ruler.

264
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,111
He changed the headline.

265
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,812
That's what
you have to do, Tracy.

266
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,247
You know something, Jackie d.?

267
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,517
That thing I said earlier about
prince hal got me thinking.

268
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,555
I have to change my headline.

269
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,323
Yes, that's what I just said.

270
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,791
Now, if I can help you...

271
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,259
No, no, no, Jackie D.

272
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,929
I don't need your help.
I'm Tracy Jordan.

273
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,599
When I go to sleep,
nothing happens in the world.

274
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,936
He failed the test of humility.

275
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:15,171
I cannot be his mentor.

276
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,840
Well, I'd love for you
to be my mentor, sir.

277
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:20,875
But unfortunately,
I already have one.

278
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:23,712
Stop calling me!

279
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:29,618
Okay, what would Jack
tell me to do?

280
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:31,353
First, he would
probably explain

281
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,855
that evolution
makes men promiscuous,

282
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:36,157
even when they're 80,
like my pathetic dad.

283
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:37,856
Is your dad pathetic,

284
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:41,325
or is he maybe,
on some level, admirable?

285
00:11:41,393 --> 00:11:43,126
Maybe his sons would
respect him more as a man.

286
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:45,161
Maybe they'd stop calling him
a "bald wang"

287
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:46,595
in front of the babysitter.

288
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:49,263
I mean, can you imagine
Dick Lemon at a singles bar?

289
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:51,565
It makes me want to barf.

290
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:54,668
Ugh, those old men that hit
on you at clubs are so lame.

291
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:57,238
Lame?
Or... or is it heroic?

292
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,340
Why can't they see
how idiotic they look?

293
00:11:59,408 --> 00:12:01,342
With guys like that,
I always just say,

294
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:03,610
"who's younger...
me or your daughter?"

295
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:07,513
That usually creeps them out
enough that they leave.

296
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,681
That wouldn't work on me.

297
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:10,683
Jack.

298
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,718
Why does Tracy have a news obit
and I don't?

299
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:13,852
Huh.

300
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,254
I never thought of you

301
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:16,889
for the Donaghy
mentoring experience,

302
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:19,891
but you are an unceasing
onslaught of dysfunction.

303
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,226
Dr. Drew called me
"unfixab."

304
00:12:22,294 --> 00:12:24,428
Let's think this through.

305
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,530
You don't haven obit
because you haven't done

306
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:27,698
as much as Tracy has.

307
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:28,699
His movies gross millions,

308
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,634
his comedy albums go platinum,

309
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,835
and he owns the world's only
giraffe basketball team,

310
00:12:32,903 --> 00:12:34,203
the New York necks.

311
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,837
- So your problem...
- My problem?

312
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:38,672
Nbc news has the problem.

313
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,173
No, I don't think that's right.

314
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:41,508
And you know
what I'm going to do?

315
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,142
I'm gonna make my own obituary,

316
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,178
and show them
how wrong they are.

317
00:12:45,246 --> 00:12:47,079
Then I'm afraid
you're on your own, Jenna.

318
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:49,415
You have failed
the test of intelligence.

319
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:52,651
Oh, really?
Well, so are you!

320
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,025
- Hello, Lemon.
- Hey, Jack.

321
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:03,760
How's business things?

322
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:07,297
I made several overseas
phone calls today.

323
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:08,965
Well, I'm doing great.

324
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:12,401
Like the song,
I am taking on my business.

325
00:13:12,469 --> 00:13:14,770
Uh, no, it's, uh...

326
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,472
right.
Forget it.

327
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,447
Shoulders back, Lemon.

328
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,748
You're not welcoming people
to castle frankenstein.

329
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,789
I can't read any of this,
Gary, can you?

330
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:41,726
Uh, give us this third thing.

331
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:47,965
Uh...

332
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:51,068
Hello, miss.
My name is Ricky.

333
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:52,236
I'm...

334
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:53,837
Dorothy Michaels.

335
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:56,840
And you don't look stupid
in that shirt at all.

336
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:58,342
What do you gentlemen do?

337
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,910
We work for the FBI.

338
00:13:59,978 --> 00:14:03,613
Mm-hmm,
female body inspectors.

339
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,751
Tell me, was your father
a donkey herder?

340
00:14:07,818 --> 00:14:10,621
- Because that ass is...
- No, no!

341
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:13,891
My father worked
at Philadelphia power and light.

342
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,194
It's me, your daughter.
Elizabeth Lemon.

343
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:19,230
Elizabeth, what are you doing?

344
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:22,033
Ugh, this woman's trying
to hit on her own father!

345
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:23,401
No, no!

346
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:25,603
Good people of Swingles,
hear me out.

347
00:14:25,671 --> 00:14:28,306
My married,
80-year-old father

348
00:14:28,374 --> 00:14:30,876
is taking
a gentleman's intermission.

349
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,577
That's a great name
for what I'm doing.

350
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:34,579
Just what are you trying
to accomplish

351
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:36,882
with this stunt, young lady?

352
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:39,218
I am trying to show you
how disgusting you are.

353
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:40,919
No, you're the disgusting one.

354
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,589
Yeah, that was a terrible plan.

355
00:14:43,656 --> 00:14:46,058
Come on, Gary.
Let's go hit that bar

356
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,761
with the cool rainbow flags.

357
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,506
- A two-time cable ace
award nominee,

358
00:14:56,574 --> 00:15:00,243
and three-time
Tony...Shaloub sex partner,

359
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,980
Jenna Maroney is perhaps best
remembered for being beautiful.

360
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:08,983
Jenna Maroney, dead at 32.

361
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:13,154
♪ Jenna, you ripped
through our lives ♪

362
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:16,991
♪ like the passin of the wind ♪

363
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,159
read back what we have so far.

364
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:21,996
"Ideas to change
Mr. Jordan's headline."

365
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:24,464
Then you said,
"read back what we have so far."

366
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:26,566
Why is this so hard?

367
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,636
All I want to do is turn
into a worldwide hero overnight.

368
00:15:29,703 --> 00:15:30,770
Coming up
in our next half hour,

369
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,105
we're gonna meet a heroic cat

370
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,175
who saved its owner's life
by dialing 911.

371
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,144
What an amazing story.

372
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:38,712
That cat's a hero.

373
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,749
If I save it,
I'm a double hero.

374
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,217
Ken, I need your help.

375
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:44,818
Well, I actually have
an important church...

376
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,787
Denied!

377
00:15:46,854 --> 00:15:47,821
Hey, what's going on?

378
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,155
I got a message
you wanted to see me?

379
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:51,691
Yes, I know you're
interviewing John Boehner later.

380
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,293
You should know that he has
very tiny has, so...

381
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:56,061
Let him hold a miniature golf
scoring pencil

382
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:58,597
to make them look normal,
obviously.

383
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:00,598
But why are you...

384
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,834
oh, my God.
Are you trying to mentor me?

385
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:05,736
- All right, calm down.
- I am squared away, Donaghy.

386
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:07,204
I get four hours
of sleep a night,

387
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:08,472
eat 1,200 calories a day,

388
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,207
and my closet has been
on the cover

389
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:12,210
<i>of organized living twice.</i>

390
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:14,445
Damn it, I knew you'd fail
the test of chaos.

391
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:15,480
Is it really that difficult

392
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,348
to find someone new to mentor?

393
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,449
It's impossible.

394
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:19,683
I would never say this
to her face,

395
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,084
but Lemon is above average.

396
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:23,220
She's got just the right amount
of dihc for me.

397
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:25,254
I hear it, and I don't care.

398
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,789
I've cast a wide net, but even
the junior executives here...

399
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,191
there's something wrong
with this generation.

400
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,726
Hey, are you Jack?
Sorry I'm late.

401
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:33,161
B.T. Dubbs,

402
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,129
I gotta leave for my ironic
kickball league in about ten.

403
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:37,365
Also, I'm not interested
in this position

404
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,767
unless I'm gonna be
constantly praised.

405
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,402
And I won't cut my hair.

406
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,574
It's go time, Ken.
Are you ready?

407
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,675
I've got my hammer,
I've got my mask.

408
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,410
You just stop me
before I get to that cat.

409
00:16:50,478 --> 00:16:52,212
I'll be right behind you.

410
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,214
And finally,
the weekend box office crown

411
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:56,851
<i>belonged to the indie darling
hard to watch.</i>

412
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:58,553
Critics have been praising
the gritty drama,

413
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,888
and the performance
of its star Tracy Jordan.

414
00:17:00,956 --> 00:17:02,657
Now, not to editorialize,

415
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,859
but if Jordan doesn't
win the Oscar,

416
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:06,761
that would be
the stupidest thing

417
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,530
since the following segue...

418
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:09,731
speaking of cats...

419
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,832
An Oscar.

420
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,067
If I won an Oscar,

421
00:17:12,134 --> 00:17:13,635
everyone would have
to respect me.

422
00:17:13,703 --> 00:17:16,238
My obituary will read
"Oscar winner"

423
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:18,607
instead of
"children's soccer heckler."

424
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:21,843
It would change my headline.

425
00:17:24,414 --> 00:17:27,449
I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

426
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,685
I left Tracy Jr.
in Atlantic City!

427
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:36,059
Die, hero cat!
I hate you!

428
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,698
I said I'm gonna kill that cat!

429
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,867
Killing cats is wrong!

430
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,670
Unless it's to make a hat!

431
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:48,872
My skull!

432
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,674
Jenna Maroney just saved
the hero cat!

433
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:54,507
That makes me a double hero!

434
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,376
Try to deny me my obit now,
you jags!

435
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,778
And tell people
in lieu of flowers,

436
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,313
they can pour jewels
into my open coffin.

437
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,050
I'm very injured.

438
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,023
You wanted to see me?

439
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:16,658
- No, Lemon.
- I did.

440
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:18,226
Albino ninja!

441
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:20,395
Look, I never should have
interfered with, um,

442
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:21,862
whatever this is.

443
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,197
- Work husband-slash-uncle.

444
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,498
- Coworker-slash-little brother.

445
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:27,199
Right, well, she's not ready
to move on.

446
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,567
It's true.

447
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:31,169
I'm wearing a Duane reade bag
as underwear today.

448
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,203
All right.
And for whatever reason,

449
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:35,538
he needs you too.

450
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:37,407
It's a symbiotic relationship.

451
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:39,208
I'm a mighty
great white shark, Lemon,

452
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,743
and you are a remora,

453
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,978
clinging to me
with your suction cup head.

454
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:45,313
I give you a free ride,
and in exchange,

455
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:47,583
you, uh, eat my parasites.

456
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,651
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

457
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:51,919
I already briefed him
on your problem.

458
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:54,321
The gentleman's
intermission, yes.

459
00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:56,256
Uh, Lemon, does your father
have a cell phone?

460
00:18:56,324 --> 00:18:58,658
Yes. Jack is back.

461
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:01,761
If anyone can talk sense
into my dad, it's you.

462
00:19:01,828 --> 00:19:04,630
Oh, no, I'm not gonna
talk sense into anybody.

463
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:06,098
Your father's being irrational.

464
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,068
And irrational behavior
doesn't respond to rationality.

465
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:11,270
It responds to fear.

466
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,440
Hello?

467
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:16,608
Yeah, is this Dick Lemon?

468
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:17,877
This is he.
Who's calling?

469
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:20,179
I'm tricia's boyfriend,
you scumbag.

470
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,880
She told me what happened
with youse last night.

471
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:23,115
Now I'm gonna come
and find you,

472
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,483
and I'm gonna
kick your ass so hard,

473
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,050
you're gonna be
throwing up my toenails.

474
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:27,952
No, no, no, no, no.
There's been a mistake.

475
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,154
I did not do anything
with anyone last night.

476
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:31,522
Certainly not a tricia.

477
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,690
Oh, now you're telling me

478
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,191
my tricia's not
good enough for you?

479
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:35,960
She's an angel!

480
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:37,361
I'll tell you what,
I'm getting my brothers,

481
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:38,863
and we're coming over there,
and we're gonna...

482
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,306
Dick Lemon speaking.

483
00:19:48,373 --> 00:19:50,374
How dare you hang up on me.

484
00:19:50,442 --> 00:19:53,478
I'm a corrupt cop!
My brother's a corrupt fireman.

485
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,213
He's gonna set you on fire,

486
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,781
and I am not gonna
investigate it.

487
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,082
That won't be necessary.

488
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,317
I'm leaving
for Philadelphia today.

489
00:20:00,385 --> 00:20:02,753
Dick, listen,
tricia told me you're married.

490
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:03,921
I know men are meant
to be promiscuous

491
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:05,156
because of evolution,

492
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:07,658
but you made a commitment
to a woman you love.

493
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,327
I do.
I do love her.

494
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:10,895
Yeah, that's right.
You're a lucky man.

495
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:12,130
"A," because you have a family

496
00:20:12,198 --> 00:20:14,165
and "b," because I have not
curb-stomped you

497
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,400
in front of your grandchildren.

498
00:20:15,468 --> 00:20:18,136
Actually, I don't have
grandchildren.

499
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,438
Why not?
Tricia told me you have

500
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:20,506
a 40-year-old daughter.
What's wrong with her?

501
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:22,074
- Okay, mm-mm.
- I gotta go.

502
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:23,508
I'm taking tricia
to laser zeppelin.

503
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:25,978
You take care now.
Go necks!

504
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,318
Can I show you
a weird thing on my leg?

505
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:34,954
Yeah.

506
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:36,789
That's gotta be removed.

507

508
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,084
Claire?

509
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,418
Claire?

510
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,454
Joanne?
Okay.

511
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:45,589
Well, I look forward
to visiting her

512
00:20:45,657 --> 00:20:47,190
and her wife...
On their farm.

513
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:48,458
Jacqueline?

514
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:49,926
Like, named after you?

515
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:51,995
Like a little Jack,
but with boobs?

516
00:20:52,062 --> 00:20:55,732
Hi, I'm Daphne Donaghy
I saw a turtle!

517
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,166
Kylie.
Great.

518
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,101
She can strip her way
through community college.

519
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:00,369
Come on.

520
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:03,039
Oh, I don't know
about Christina.

521
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:04,540
'Cause then everyone
calls her Tina.

522
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:07,543
And every Tina I've known
is a real judgmental bitch.
