Lemon, why does
your crew look drunk?

165

00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,950
- Sometimes a place can be so
special to you

317
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,670
that it feels like it

318
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,230
couldn't possibly continue
after you're gone.

319
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,430
But after I left kentucky
mountain Bible college,

320
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,550
it still kept going.

321
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,190
Until it was shut down
because of the wolves.

322
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,190
Maybe this is really about you
not being able to let go.

323
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,230
- Tell me, Kenneth.

324
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,470
What did you major in
at that college?

325
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,230
- Television studies with
a minor in Bible sexuality.

326
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,910
- So not psychiatry.
Thank you.

327
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,230
But if you
really want to help me,

328
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,030
stick your hand in There
and see if you get a shock.

329
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,110
- Aah! My hand!

330
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:14,550
- Damn it,
it's supposed to do that.

331
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,550
- Everyone enjoying
the ice cream?

332
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,230
- Yes!
- Yeah!

333
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,550
- I don't even care
that we've taken

334
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,670
a 73-minute break
To eat it.

335
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,150
[dog barking]
- Oh!

336
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,990
Hey, somebody brought
a dog to work.

337
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,270
Oh, and it definitely
doesn't have

338
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,190
any of its own waste
on its feet--oh!

339
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,710
- Hey, why is Tony sulking?

340
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,190
- I couldn't go
to the bar

341
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,430
and now I can't
have any ice cream.

342
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,630
- I totally forgot, broseph.

343
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,830
You're a lactose-intolerant
alcoholic.

344
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,350
- I tried to forget too,
But Liz made me remember

345
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,510
in front of everybody.

346
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,350
- Poor Tony.
- Not cool, Liz.

347
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,030
- How not cool is this?

348
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,030
I remembered how special
Tony is,

349
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,670
and that's why
I got him this watch.

350
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,230
- Hey, you think
of everything.

351
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,150
- Lizard, lizard, lizard!

352
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,230
- Lizard, lizard!

353
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,510

Lizard! Lizard!

357

- [Jack's voice]
Pete, can I tell you a secret?

358
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,550
- Of course.

359
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,470
I told you about my blankie.

360
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,870
- [Jack's voIce]
I'm lonely.

361
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,630
Would you like to come
to my office

362
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,710
tomorrow Evening
and Hang out?

Bring your guitar

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,110
and some beer in Cans

365
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,270
and we will jam.

366
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,630
- Okay!
Yeah, great.

367
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,230
And with the kabletown stuff,
maybe we could

368
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,670
talk about some
new opportunities for me?

369
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,670
- [Jack's voice]
Yes, I will make

370
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,030

371
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,270
Make sure you wear one
of those mexican ponchos.

372
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,550
- Okay.

373
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,510
- Yes, nice.

374
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,190
- Yeah!

375
00:14:52,190 --> 00:15:00,390
- All right, Kenneth.
Simulate a rainstorm.

376
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,270
- Sir, I was wrong
about the hypothermia.

377
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,950
I don't even
feel cold anymore.

378
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,550
I don't feel anything.

379
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,110
- Quiet.
Look.

The display
is malfunctioning.

Defrost. Power.

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,830
Time. Left. Pizza.
- Oh, really?

383
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,590
That's how much time is left?
Pizza?

384
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,630
- Mr. Donaghy,
I don't know

385
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,910
what point
you think you're proving.

386
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,910
Who would microwave something
in a freezing rainstorm?

387
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,590
- Why don't you ask choctee,

an inuit who wants
a hot bowl of naglak...

389
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,150
a man and food I just made up
to illustrate a point?

390
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,590
- Sir, you have to let go.

391
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,630
At least that's what
my Nana is telling me

392
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:36,630
from that tunnel of light
behind you.

393

I've told you this before.

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,470
Your Nana is an idiot.

395
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,590
- Liz, we're pranking Pete,
and It's going too far.

396
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,710
Please stop us.

397
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,190
- Why would I?
I love pranks.

398
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,190
I'm not the r.A.

399

- Hello, gentlemen.
Remember me?

404
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,670
- Yes, I had the greek salad.

405
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,190
- You know
I'm not a delivery man.

406
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:18,270
I'm wearing a suit
and carrying a microwave.

407
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:23,590
A so-called perfect microwave.

408
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,070

Start time. 1985.

409
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,190
- 1985. That's not a time.

410
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,310
I guess it could be a year.

411
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,830
The year I started
working here, actually.

That's interesting.

1985.

- Yes, 1985.
Thank you.

I have never allowed

- [Jack's voice]

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,870
- The point is,
my legacy here is--

419
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,070
- [Jack's voice]
over.

420

Done. Over.

30 years ago.

427
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,590
A young man who dreamed
of running this company,

428
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,190
who made a lot of sacrifices
in pursuit of that dream.

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,670
- [Jack's voice]
Goodbye. Potato. Goodbye.

It's over.

- Are we racist, or do
Those guys look a lot alike?

- You ready for this,

Jam out,
drink some brews?

Talk about everything
and nothing.

what I am ready for.

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,670
And do you know what
the r.A.'s purview is?

476
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,550
Rules.
And guess what?

477
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,510
According to the nbc
employee handbook,

478
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,550
your little card game lottery
constitutes gambling.

479
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,270
So you're not doing it
anymore.

480
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,590
- What?
- Come on.

481
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,670
- Boo!

482
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,790
- Also, the next time
I see someone

483
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,670
throwing a football in here,
there will be fines.

484
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,470
And if I see that
filthy dog again,

485
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,430
I will put it down.
- [all gasp]

486
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,190
- I will put it down
with a smile.

487
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,670
Back to work, everyone!

488
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,990
[crowd booIng]

489
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,910
I love you too.

490
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,310
High-fiving
a million angels.

491
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,230
- Hey, Pete, how do I know
that the colors you see

492
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,310
are the same
as the colors that I see?

493
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,590
Maybe what I see as red,

494
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,470
you perceive as green.

495
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,110
- We should be writing
this stuff down.

496
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,470
- Oh, I didn't think
anybody would be in here.

497
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,550
I mean, I brought
you guys a pizza.

498
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,190
- Lemon, think fast!

499
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,510
- What is going on here?

500
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,550
- Join us.

501
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,790
Pete and I are having
a little college night.

502
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,510
- Oh, yeah?
Want to see me shotgun this?

503
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,910
- Oh, god,
she means the pizza.

504
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,380
- No, she's unhinging
her jaw!

505
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,950
- Come on,
we were just pranking Pete!

506
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,510
How long
do we have to do this?

507
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,830
- You wanted college
to go on forever?

508
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,310
You got it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
