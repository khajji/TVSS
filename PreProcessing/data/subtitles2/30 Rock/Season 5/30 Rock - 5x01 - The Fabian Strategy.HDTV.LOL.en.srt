1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,368
- Lemon, it's Jack.
- Who's Jackie?

2
00:00:06,436 --> 00:00:07,970
Oh, Lemon, Avery and I
just got back

3
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:11,639
from the most amazing vacation
on Paul Allen's yacht.

4
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:13,675
And for four glorious weeks,

5
00:00:13,742 --> 00:00:16,410
my naturally blonde
lady love and I basked

6
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:17,911
in the three "s"s...

7
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:20,280
surf, sun, and...
Sandwiches?

8
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:23,019
Heh, we didn't need
sandwiches, Lemon.

9
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:25,520
It was so warm you could pick
fully cooked lobsters

10
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:26,656
out of the water.

11
00:00:26,724 --> 00:00:28,421
Sheer bliss.

12
00:00:28,488 --> 00:00:31,246
Avery is the most perfect woman
ever created.

13
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:35,246
Like a young bo Derek
stuffed with a Barry goldwater.

14
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:37,455
You sound weird.
Do you have a beard?

15
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:40,563
Not for long.
It's back to reality.

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,312
No more making love
on the beach

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,121
surrounded by a privacy circle
of English-trained butlers.

18
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:46,502
But I've got to get out
of island mode

19
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,928
and back into work mode.

20
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:49,952
How was your summer?

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,054
Get this, my gynecologist
committed suicide.

22
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,699
And I'm back!

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,117
Carol!

24
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:01,003
Hey, Lizzie,
I'm about to take off.

25
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:02,279
I'm in lambert, St. Louis,

26
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:04,165
and I can see the arch
from here.

27
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:07,158
No, wait, actually that's
a half-burned-down McDonald's.

28
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:10,316
Anyway, weather's great,
and I just have to go

29
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:12,973
St. Louis-Newark,
Newark-Atlantic city,

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,888
Atlantic city to Newark,
and then I'll be there.

31
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,236
Who flies Newark
to Atlantic city?

32
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,351
Black bachelorette parties.
Gotta go.

33
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:24,959
Hello?

34
00:01:25,027 --> 00:01:27,873
Yo, I'm calling to say
that I'm giving you

35
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:29,719
110% this year.

36
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:32,070
I'm relaxed, I'm focused,

37
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:33,710
and I'm gonna be churning out
the good stuff

38
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:35,955
like you've never seen.
That's great, Tracy.

39
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:37,566
Oh, I misdialed.

40
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:39,377
I thought I was calling
my nutritionist.

41
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:41,556
Good-bye.

42
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,800
Okay, season five.
Here we go.

43
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:56,923
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

44
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:04,598
What about office supplies?

45
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,965
Can you come down 5% there?

46
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:07,400
I'll try.

47
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:08,801
We're already printing
all of our internal memos

48
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:10,535
on the back of my kids' art.

49
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:13,438
In order for this merger
to stay attractive

50
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,973
to our friends at Kabletown,
we have to seem like

51
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,708
a sexy, profitable company.

52
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,409
And we're almost
pulling it off.

53
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:21,911
<i>The Harry Potter theme park
is a huge hit</i>

54
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,580
with both anglophiles
and pedophiles.

55
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:26,348
The movie division has
a James Cameron movie

56
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,083
the whole world will see,
whether they like it or not.

57
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,819
Only NBC continues to be
the engorged whitehead

58
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:34,088
on the otherwise flawless face
of universal media.

59
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:37,324
Lemon, why are you spending
so much money on wigs?

60
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,659
Tracy's head size
keeps changing.

61
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:42,728
Hang on, what is this
pay increase for Jenna?

62
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,063
Oh, boy.

63
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,666
<i>Look, as we enter
the fifth season of TGS...</i>

64
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,334
and remember, no one ever
thought we'd make it this far...

65
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,568
I believed in us.

66
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,169
That was actually an oversight.

67
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,004
Jenna has some crazy stuff
built into her contract

68
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:55,272
that kicks in now.

69
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,440
Like what?

70
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:58,541
Eye contact.

71
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,076
"Everyone must make eye contact

72
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:02,978
with Miss Maroney
at all times."

73
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,613
She also gets a producer credit.
What?

74
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:05,914
Oh, it's just
a vanity credit, Lemon.

75
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:08,183
A low-cost way to make someone
feel more important.

76
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,685
Like executive producer
Ashton Kutcher,

77
00:03:10,753 --> 00:03:12,820
or secretary of state
Hillary Clinton.

78
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:17,258
Am I late
for the producers meeting?

79
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:20,160
Eye contact.

80
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:21,794
Thank you.

81
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:24,863
- Hey, k-k-k-k.

82
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,531
First day back's
gonna be a busy one.

83
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,535
First, I need you to go
to the dry cleaners for me

84
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:31,471
and find out
how martinizing works.

85
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,707
I've always been curious.

86
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,209
Then I need you
to be back by noon

87
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:36,743
to make the bathroom smell
like sandalwood

88
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:37,877
before I wreck it.

89
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:39,779
You got that,
k-pax-o-gum?

90
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:43,181
I'm not Kenneth, sir.

91
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:44,382
My name's Brian.

92
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,551
Kenneth got fired
at the end of last season.

93
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,685
Of course.
I knew that.

94
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:55,023
Good meeting.

95
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,458
- So how are things with Carol?
- Good.

96
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:59,126
Did you know that
if you're a pilot,

97
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:00,694
that chili's will seat you
right away,

98
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:02,561
even if the pilot's
dinner companion

99
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,462
has just been yelling
at the hostess?

100
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,564
You are the Jackie o
of our time.

101
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:08,866
And pilots get
all these travel points

102
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,500
at Starwind hotels.

103
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:12,135
The one in midtown has
free Internet.

104
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,636
He doesn't stay with you
when he's here?

105
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,471
<i>Why would he?
Those Starwinds are nice!</i>

106
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:27,946
I mean, the bathtubs are
so much cleaner than at home.

107
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,962
It's almost as bad
as "climax."

108
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,181
You can't just do
the vacation part.

109
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:34,333
At some point you have to
go home to the same house,

110
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:37,628
unpack your dirty laundry,
and have a life together.

111
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,155
Then one of you says,
"we should redecorate."

112
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:42,041
And the other one says,
"please, Avery,

113
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:43,851
I'm using the commode
right now."

114
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:45,845
Ooh, she wants to redecorate?
She just moved in.

115
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:48,498
Avery, uh, has opinions.
I love her for that.

116
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,082
Unfortunately,
she wants to repaint

117
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,167
the upstairs hallway
in a strie faux finish

118
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:53,544
called "husk."

119
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,396
I prefer the color
that's already there...

120
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:58,023
a reddish-brown shade
called "elk tongue."

121
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,508
So tell her no.
It's your house.

122
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,318
This is how I know
you've never had

123
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,502
an adult relationship.

124
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,188
If I say no,
then I will be required

125
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:07,040
to say yes to something else
in the future,

126
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,691
and the stakes in the future
might be higher.

127
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,011
- Then say yes.
- If I give in,

128
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,297
then I'm no longer the Alpha
in my house.

129
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:13,907
Before you know it,
she'll have me wearing jeans

130
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:14,950
and reading fiction!

131
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:17,076
Yeah, well, yes and no
are kind of

132
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:18,452
your only two choices.

133
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,581
For most men, sure.
But there is a third option.

134
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:24,309
The Fabian strategy.
I know this.

135
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,794
If an apple and a feather
fall at the same time...

136
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:28,746
the Fabian strategy
derives its name

137
00:05:28,814 --> 00:05:32,207
from the Roman general
Quintus Fabius Maximus.

138
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,367
He ran away, Lemon.
Rather than engage in battle,

139
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,853
he would retreat and retreat
until the enemy grew fatigued

140
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:38,529
and eventually made a mistake.

141
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:41,124
Although I abhor it
as a military strategy,

142
00:05:41,191 --> 00:05:44,526
it is the basis for all of my,
uh, personal relationships.

143
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,578
So Avery is your enemy.
That sounds healthy.

144
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:49,497
You're in no position to judge.

145
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:51,482
Meeting someone in a hotel room
twice a month

146
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,143
is not a relationship...
just ask any hooker.

147
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,261
Oh, stop saying "relationship"!

148
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:57,403
I'm sorry,

149
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,123
I was going to say "climax."
Aah!

150
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:01,784
A line item budget.

151
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,579
Oh, I love this.

152
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:07,940
It takes people and turns them
into amounts of money.

153
00:06:08,008 --> 00:06:11,169
Except for Tracy,
I'm the most person on the show!

154
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:12,820
At do we do now?

155
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:15,748
Oh, okay, well, Jack wants me
to keep the budget flat,

156
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:17,400
but I don't want
to deny people their raises.

157
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:19,418
You should fire grace
from wardrobe.

158
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,570
She doesn't do anything.
Fire grace?

159
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,189
Come on, you'd have to be
a heartless monster...

160
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,007
I'll do it.

161
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:28,593
Grace, your position
has been terminated,

162
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:30,444
effective immediately.

163
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:34,682
<i>But I've been here
since the Jack Paar show.</i>

164
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:35,891
Your health insurance will
remain in effect

165
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,276
until the end of this sentence.

166
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,428
Come on. Chop chop.

167
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,651
What a shank job.

168
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:48,145
Kenneth,
I knew you'd come back!

169
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,230
Let me smell your head.

170
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:51,173
Mmm...
Come on!

171
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,549
This is a woman's blazer

172
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:55,344
from a very expensive
blazer shop called Rico's.

173
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:58,173
I'm sorry, but my heart is
playing tricks on my eyes.

174
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,558
Just like my kidneys did
to my lungs that time.

175
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:01,843
Are you okay?

176
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,453
I keep hallucinating Kenneth.

177
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:04,838
Am I going crazy again?

178
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:06,823
Should I get my rainbow wig
out of storage?

179
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,776
No, Tracy, it's normal.

180
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:11,537
Kenneth was very special
to you, and now he's gone.

181
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:14,123
The next time you hallucinate,
just tell yourself,

182
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:16,617
"this is not real.
I am in control of this."

183
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:19,369
Like the world cup.

184
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,055
I'll try.

185
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,109
♪ ♪

186
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:33,708
No, this place is
too full of memories.

187
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:35,994
I gotta clear my head.

188
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:38,246
Okay, well, we've only been
back to work, like, an hour...

189
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:42,051
And bye.

190
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,703
Liz, get in on this.

191
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:46,932
Would you rather have to
start every sentence you say

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,861
for the rest of your life
with Urkel's catchphrase,

193
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,137
"Did I do that?"

194
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,907
Or be siamese twins
with Sharon Stone for a year?

195
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,469
Did I do that?

196
00:07:58,537 --> 00:07:59,812
Carol!

197
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,431
So, Carol,

198
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:04,026
you ever join
the mile high club?

199
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:07,488
Try five miles high.
And no, I have not.

200
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:09,307
Did you ever see
a UFO up there?

201
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,126
No, but once,
when I was in the air force,

202
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:12,336
I saw Mr. t in a pizza hut.

203
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:14,088
<i>Was the air force
like top gun?</i>

204
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:15,706
Yeah, but with
a lot more volleyball.

205
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:16,815
You ever kill anyone?

206
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,737
Sucked a mechanic
into my engine once.

207
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:21,641
Are you on Facebook?

208
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,839
And these are for you.

209
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:32,509
Passenger left them
in the first-class lavatory.

210
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:33,543
Ooh.

211
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:34,578
Hey, I couldn't get a room

212
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:36,013
at any of the Starwinds
this weekend.

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,748
You think it'd be all right
if I stayed at your place?

214
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:40,217
Uh... uh, yeah. Of course.

215
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,219
I'll just have to
run home first

216
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:43,821
and take some plates
out of the bathroom.

217
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:44,922
But it would be nice

218
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:46,256
staying together
at your place, right?

219
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:49,993
Yeah, it'll be a fun...
Step for us.

220
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,328
I just can't believe that
every Starwind suite

221
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:52,729
in the city is taken.

222
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,331
Me neither. The lady said
they're all booked up

223
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:58,334
for something called jackfest.

224
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,202
How many rooms did you book?

225
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,871
It's for your own good, Lemon.

226
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:03,272
I just want you to have
what Avery and I have.

227
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,473
I am a grown woman.

228
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,574
I have been doing things
my way for a long time.

229
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:10,076
I don't like my life stuff
mixing with my dude stuff.

230
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,543
- A middle-aged woman
saying "dude stuff"...

231
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:15,509
is that on my sadness
scavenger hunt?

232
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:18,043
Why, yes, it is.

233
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:20,211
Carol and I enjoy

234
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:22,144
our separate-but-intersecting
lifestyles.

235
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,412
It's perfect.

236
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,112
I'm like that woman
on the food network

237
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,347
whose husband only comes home
on the weekends,

238
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:28,847
and she spends the rest
of her time

239
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:30,615
eating and drinking
with her gay friends.

240
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:32,415
<i>Her name is
the Barefoot Contessa, Lemon,</i>

241
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:33,948
and you will never be like her,

242
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:35,680
starting with
the barefoot part.

243
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:37,912
I'll have you know that
I wore sandals this summer,

244
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,847
over socks...In a dream.

245
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,181
<i>Welcome to the late show
with David letterman.</i>

246
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:46,782
Please have your tickets out.

247
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,951
And now, as with all
studio audiences,

248
00:09:49,018 --> 00:09:52,053
we will sort you
according to attractiveness.

249
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,454
Front, front, back,

250
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:56,724
balcony, front, front...

251
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,024
Mr. Jordan!

252
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:01,294
No, you do not exist!

253
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:03,096
I'm in control of this!

254
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:08,067
Want to watch TV?

255
00:10:08,135 --> 00:10:09,201
First thing you need
is tequila...

256
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,536
Stop. Wait. No.

257
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,137
<i>The Barefoot Contessa...
I love this show.</i>

258
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,438
Me too.

259
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:15,707
This is one of the three things
in the world I like...

260
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,709
Ina Garten, sweater weather,
and...

261
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:19,043
When Muppets present
at award shows?

262
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,579
- Wow, yes!
- Me too.

263
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,282
We really see eye to eye
on a lot of stuff, don't we?

264
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,550
Absolutely. I've never
met anyone before

265
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:26,985
who had the exact
same idea as me

266
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:28,220
about what to do
with Palestine.

267
00:10:28,287 --> 00:10:30,421
- It would work, right?
- Of course it would work.

268
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:32,856
And don't you agree
that our situation

269
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,591
is perfect right now?

270
00:10:34,658 --> 00:10:36,426
We have these great visits
together,

271
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:38,160
but then we still have
our separate lives.

272
00:10:38,228 --> 00:10:42,631
We're like Jeffrey and Ina.

273
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,802
No, no, I can't...
I can't live like this anymore.

274
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,405
I'm not like Jeffrey Garten.

275
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,406
I'm not as strong as that guy!

276
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:54,608
Don't have too much fun
without me, okay?

277
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:57,044
I need to know where
this relationship is going,

278
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:59,145
and I can feel you
resisting it.

279
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:02,749
No, no...
It okay.

280
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,851
Don't be cry.

281
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,820
I'm a pilot, Liz.

282
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:11,655
You know, I've spent
my entire adult life...

283
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:15,492
just casual girlfriends
in different cities.

284
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,295
I... I can't go from woman
to woman to woman anymore.

285
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:21,263
How many women
have you been with?

286
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:24,499
I'd rather not say.
It's shameful.

287
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,800
<i>I mean, I'm a pit.</i>

288
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:30,537
Six.

289
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:33,872
Oh, that's not so great.

290
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:35,474
- I want grown-up love!

291
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,314
- Hello?
- Thanks.

292
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:50,249
Carol had a complete meltdown

293
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,683
about the state
of our relationship.

294
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:54,386
I can't believe I tried
to clean my bathtub for this.

295
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,389
No, this is healthy, Lemon.
Where is Carol now?

296
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:57,891
I finally got him to sleep.

297
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,326
I had to spoon him
for, like, an hour.

298
00:11:59,393 --> 00:12:00,861
And I was the outer spoon.

299
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,128
Welcome to adulthood.

300
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,230
As for me, I have
successfully retreated

301
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:05,265
for another day.

302
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,700
When Avery got home from work,

303
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,069
I noticed that she had
some paint samples in her purse,

304
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:11,271
so I immediately asked her
if her sister had done

305
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,540
anything crazy lately,
and guess what...She had.

306
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,376
Avery talked about that
for about an hour,

307
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,245
her anger eventually
transforming

308
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,248
into some rather
interesting sex.

309
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:20,717
And now she's sleeping
peacefully

310
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:23,221
while Fabius has retreated
to his den,

311
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,757
where he is drinking scotch
and playing snood.

312
00:12:25,824 --> 00:12:28,527
- Uh-huh. Does Avery's work
email go right to her phone?

313
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:30,128
- Why?
- Nothing.

314
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,829
Just sending her a link
to this cool site...

315
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,032
funkyvintagewallpaper.com.

316
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:36,600
Lemon, don't! She keeps
her blackberry in bed with her.

317
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,568
- And send.
- Damn it, Lemon!

318
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,669
It has to be elk tongue!

319
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:43,872
Oh...

320
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,041
Eww... No!

321
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,376
This Jenna promotion
is the greatest thing

322
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,644
that has ever happened to me.

323
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:50,745
Do you understand how much
free time I have now?

324
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,314
Yesterday, I went to the gym.

325
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,883
And this morning,
I made love to my wife.

326
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,151
And she was still asleep,
so I didn't have to be gentle.

327
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:02,021
That's one of the most
upsetting things

328
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,222
I have ever imagined.

329
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:06,419
Are you sure?
Think about it again.

330
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,190
Yes.

331
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,294
Liz, the writers can't take
a car service at night anymore.

332
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:15,496
I've crunched the numbers,
and it's cheaper for us

333
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:18,098
to just replace anyone
who gets murdered.

334
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:24,870
So did Avery like
my wallpaper idea?

335
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,473
- She did. Heh heh.
- Huh...So why are you happy?

336
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,942
Because the Fabian strategy
is working.

337
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,177
Every new pattern
Avery showed me,

338
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,447
I would simply say,
"yes, I like that one too."

339
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,449
And she was so overwhelmed
with the choices

340
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,750
that she made a mistake.

341
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,619
She suggested that we consult
her old college friend,

342
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,821
who's an interior designer.
- Uh-huh.

343
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,156
He's coming here
to meet with me today.

344
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,290
His name is James.

345
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,392
Not Jim, not Jimmy...

346
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,894
<i>Jamessss.
I get it.</i>

347
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:53,597
She's sending her army
into unknown territory.

348
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:58,735
And I am flanking her...
With these.

349
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:00,403
Have you seen my eyes, Lemon?

350
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,171
Yep.
They're very blue.

351
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:03,572
Like a mikonos sky.

352
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,006
Mark Foley once
called them "piercing."

353
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:06,474
Hmm.

354
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,176
Avery has really made
a misstep here.

355
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:10,778
Do you know what a prize I am
in the gay community?

356
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:15,549
There's a term for it.
I'm a bear...And I'm a

357
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:16,783
I'm a daddy bear.

358
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:19,186
Just one hour
of flirty chatting with James,

359
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:20,186
and you know what I'll get.

360
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:24,089
Not a Glaad award, I know that.

361
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:26,758
Elk tongue.

362
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,993
Well, I'm glad to hear that
you've almost

363
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:30,795
vanquished your girlfriend.
Thank you.

364
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:33,097
And you versus Carol...
how's that going?

365
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,600
I don't know. We had
a pretty emotional breakfast.

366
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:43,106
He says he's leaving early now.

367
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,108
I don't know what to do.
I know it's difficult, Lemon.

368
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,876
But now you have
an adult decision to make.

369
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:50,779
Would you rather let go
of your precious autonomy,

370
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:52,280
and let Carol into your life?

371
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:55,149
Or would you rather
teach your cat to dial 911?

372
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:57,517
First of all, I'm tired
of playing "would you rather."

373
00:14:57,585 --> 00:15:02,720
<i>And second of all, you know
that I have life alert.</i>

374
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:06,056
Oh, I pushed it.
I need a phone.

375
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:11,460
Mr. Jordan.
Mr. Jordan, please stop.

376
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:12,995
You're not real.

377
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:14,363
If I threw you
in front of a car,

378
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,164
it would drive
right through you!

379
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:18,834
No! No...Sir!

380
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:20,201
I am real!

381
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:22,403
Would an imaginary me know
that you have a mole

382
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,473
on your list of pets to get?

383
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,208
Or that your favorite color
is rainbow?

384
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:30,379
<i>Of course it would.
It would know anything I knew</i>

385
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:33,581
because it sprung
from my imagination.

386
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,953
Sir, it's really me!

387
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:47,862
Oh, my God!

388
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,065
Oh, no, I missed it!
Do it again!

389
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:54,433
I love you, Ken-word.

390
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,768
<i>Why don't you come
back home to TGS</i>

391
00:15:56,836 --> 00:15:59,036
and pick the peas
out of my fried rice?

392
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:01,102
And the rice.
I just want carrots.

393
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,602
I can't do that, sir.

394
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,570
But don't you miss
rubbing my foot

395
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,105
back into the shape of a foot?

396
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,573
Of course I do.

397
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,642
But I'm real happy here at CBS.

398
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,945
<i>They gave me a tote bag
with the mentalist on it!</i>

399
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:18,082
- I guess this is good-bye.

400
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:20,884
Obviously, I'm going to need
the tote bag.

401
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:29,058
James, tell me,

402
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:31,360
which one of these do you like?

403
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:35,396
Because with my untrained eyes,

404
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:39,967
the strie is bland,
and the, uh...

405
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:42,569
Wallpaper just looks busy.

406
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:45,904
Oh...I don't know.

407
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:52,509
Do you see something, uh,
here that you like?

408
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:59,180
It's so frustrating.

409
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:07,757
♪ ♪

410
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,792
I think I found a way

411
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,327
to get the budget down
to where Jack wants it.

412
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:13,762
<i>That's my girl!
You are en fuego.</i>

413
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,832
I was looking it over,
and I've realized something.

414
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,633
There's one too many
producers, Pete.

415
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:22,502
Okay, I get it.

416
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:25,238
But please...
I have five kids...

417
00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:26,673
That I don't want to be
at home with.

418
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:30,343
No, Pete, it's me.

419
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,645
As great as I am at this,
I'm not really necessary.

420
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,413
Hmm, the last time I said that,

421
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:38,116
I was in a three-way
with two of the backstreet boys.

422
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,150
No, Jenna, you can't quit.

423
00:17:39,218 --> 00:17:40,952
I'll take a pay cut.

424
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,353
We can fire Liz!

425
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,721
This is hard for me too, Pete.

426
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,089
But it's because
I'm a genius producer

427
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:49,191
I know that you have to
fire me.

428
00:17:49,258 --> 00:17:53,027
Take my producing fee
and amortize it

429
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:56,130
to cover the gaps
in transport and electric.

430
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:01,168
Hey, Liz, would you rather...

431
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:02,369
- Oh...
- Be with the person

432
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:04,071
you love forever,

433
00:18:04,138 --> 00:18:05,572
but you always
have to wear a shirt

434
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:06,773
made out of their pubes,

435
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,742
or be alone
for the rest of your life,

436
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,110
but you get to wear
whatever you want?

437
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:13,278
Shirt of pubes.

438
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,847
I thought you left.

439
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:17,782
I came back.

440
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,618
I mean, I had to kick
an obese teen off the flight

441
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:22,519
to get a seat, but
I really wanted to talk to you.

442
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:24,788
Look, I'm not sorry
you saw me cry.

443
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:26,156
I'm an emotional guy.

444
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:28,424
That's actually not even part
of my personality.

445
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:30,159
That's just something
that happens to people

446
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:31,827
who change altitude
more than four times a day.

447
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:33,462
Is that also why you got so mad

448
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,496
watching the giants game?

449
00:18:34,563 --> 00:18:35,997
No, that was because

450
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:38,032
why does Geico have
three different spokespeople?

451
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,567
They have the caveman,
the lizard,

452
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,367
and then the stack of money
with the eyeballs.

453
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:43,202
And the fake Rod Serling guy.

454
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,971
Oh, my God, right.
Thank you.

455
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,140
I mean, you see how good
we are together?

456
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:50,242
Look, Liz, I want this.

457
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,910
But if we're gonna go for it,

458
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:55,413
we gotta move forward a bit
with each visit.

459
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,748
Two minutes to air.
Cast, please set yourselves.

460
00:18:57,816 --> 00:19:00,217
Look, you have to get back
to the airport, I have a show.

461
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:02,852
How do we move this forward
in the time allotted?

462
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,487
All right, let's each say
one thing about ourselves

463
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:06,488
that the other person
doesn't know

464
00:19:06,556 --> 00:19:08,690
on the count of three,
all right?

465
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,191
Ready? One, two, three.

466
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,292
I'm on a waiting list
to adopt a kid.

467
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,493
Touched by a priest...
it's fine.

468
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,694
Wait, what?

469
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:16,930
Okay...
That was a step.

470
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:18,898
Yeah.

471
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:20,667
See you October 14.

472
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:27,369
Cast for "would you rather"
set yourselves, please.

473
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,438
I never thought you'd
make it this far, Lemon.

474
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:32,106
I know, season five... We were
supposed to get cancelled.

475
00:19:32,174 --> 00:19:34,308
Not just the show, I mean you.

476
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,776
You're in an "adult dude"
situation.

477
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,277
You're wearing
a beautiful blazer

478
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,379
from Rico's husky-boy
collection...

479
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,114
<i>Is that what
ragazzi robusti means?</i>

480
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,849
I'm just saying
I'm happy for you.

481
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,384
Thank you, Jack.

482
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,121
And I'm glad that you're getting
to keep your wall "elk tongue."

483
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,424
Actually, no.
The fabulous James and I

484
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:52,558
came up with an excellent idea.

485
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:53,860
We're taking that wall down.

486
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,128
That way we can make the master
bedroom closet bigger

487
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,365
and gain a nice
architectural symmetry.

488
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:01,503
Huh. You think maybe that's
what Avery wanted all along?

489
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:05,673
Oh, my God.

490
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,175
Hannibal defeated Fabian
with a decoy army.

491
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:09,476
James was a plant.

492
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,777
The strie wall finish
was a decoy.

493
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,345
She hannibaled my Fabian!

494
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,849
Lemon, Avery and I are
perfect together.

495
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:20,118
Like...Whiskey and hunting.

496
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:24,722
"Soul mate" doesn't even begin
to do it justice.

497
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,791
She's my...

498
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,926
She's your pube shirt.

499
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,494
Pube shirt.

500
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,616
That's our show.
Good night.

501
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:37,951
Good night, Miss Maroney.
Good night, Mr. Jordan.

502
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,287
<i>Good night, TGS band,</i>

503
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:42,089
with your funny-smelling
dressing room.

504
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,124
Good night, bear!

505
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:47,460
Good night moon...Soon park
from accounting.

506
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:49,461
Good night, Miss Lemon.

507
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:52,730
Good night, Mr. Donaghy.

508
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:54,565
I lied to Mr. Jordan.

509
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:58,369
I miss you all so much.

510
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:00,670
Sir?
Is it really you?

511
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:01,703
Sure is.

512
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,506
Wanna go kiss in the prop cage?

513
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:04,808
What? No!

514
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,844
