Absolutely.
But it's not your fault.

as our school mascot,
but, well, I was outvoted.

164
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:43,114
So our new mascot is a slut.

165
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,717
So you're interested
in marine biology.

166
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:47,218
Hmm.
Who do I know?

167
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:50,021
You've probably never heard
of the explorer Bob Ballard.

168
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,589
[Gasps]
You know Dr. Ballard?

169
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:54,492
He discovered the <i>Titanic,</i>
<i>the</i> <i>Lusitania,</i>

170
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,693
and according to his website,

171
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:57,562
a guilt-free cheesecake
recipe.

172
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,063
I'm also on the board
of the American Museum

173
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:00,298
of Natural History.

174
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,399
Ah!

175
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:02,834
If you like,
I could have Dr. Ballard

176
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,602
give us a private tour
of the museum.

177
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,137
Oh, my gosh!

178
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:08,740
Mr. Donaghy,
that'd be so cool!

179
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,176
Okay, now, please follow me
to Brian Williams' bathroom,

180
00:06:12,244 --> 00:06:16,047
which is also
J. Fred Muggs' skull.

181
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,455
Okay, guys,
Abby is on her way up.

182
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:29,327
[British accent]
West Ham drew nil-nil at wolves?

183
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:30,628
Stop that!

184
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:33,314
Are you guys changing your
personalities for Abby?

185
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,266
Is she here yet?

186
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:37,902
Subhas, you are married.

187
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:40,905
Okay, this is exactly
the kind of male douchebaggery

188
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,141
that is about to take
a real hit around here.

189
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,644
Don't you know I'm talkin'
'bout a femolution?

190
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:47,645
Tracy Chapman.

191
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,347
She's a woman, right?

192
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:51,749
It's a new era at "TGS."

193
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,201
Let's see the blogosphere
try to say

194
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,452
that I hate women now.

195
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,320
[Gasps]

196
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:59,323
Look at all these dudes!

197
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,210
I knew I smelled sausage.

198
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:03,961
Yes!

199
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:04,962
Abby?
I'm Liz.

200
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,664
Liz!

201
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:08,182
Thank you!
Oh!

202
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:09,967
Our nips just touched.

203
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:12,020
[Giggles]
Mine are so hard.

204
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:14,972
Mine are different sizes.

205
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,474
Abby, these are the writers.

206
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:18,175
Oh, where's little Abby
gonna sit?

207
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:21,646
Guess I'll have to sit
on somebody's lap.

208
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,114
You could sit there.

209
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,682
- Eenie...
- Please God.

210
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,284
- Meenie...
- Come to mommy.

211
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:27,852
- Minie...
- Me. Pick me.

212
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,840
Moe!
[Giggles]

213
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:35,326
Give me strength, oh, Oprah.

214
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:38,843
When I first started working here,

215
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,907
an eight-year-old
Shirley Temple

216
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,698
taught me how to roll
a cigarette.

217
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,885
Lemon, who thinks
gesturing with one's thumbs

218
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:48,005
is for poor people and is going
to be the next CEO of Kabletown?

219
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,284
This guy.

220
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,969
Already?
What did you do to her?

221
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:51,763
Nothing.

222
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,130
She wants to be
a marine biologist.

223
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,205
Kaylie is playing right
into my hands.

224
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,741
I also had a youthful
fascination with exploration

225
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,224
and I know exactly what any
14-year-old science geek wants to do.

226
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,509
Practice frottage on a poster
of Linda Ronstadt

227
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:06,210
and meet your idol.

228
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,379
Like when I met Jacques Cousteau.

229
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,650
I will never forget
what he said to me.

230
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:13,851
Oh, I did forget.

231
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,153
It was so long ago.

232
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,287
When I was a kid, I got to meet

233
00:08:16,338 --> 00:08:17,989
the "where's the beef" lady.

234
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,857
With my connections, I can
make Kaylie's dreams come true.

235
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,493
I should dig up my old shell
collection and give it to her.

236
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,362
Complete the seduction
after Bob Ballard and I

237
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,363
double-team her.

238
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,631
Word choice, Jack.

239
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,635
Withdrawn.

240
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:31,869
Lemon, is that the new woman
you hired?

241
00:08:31,937 --> 00:08:34,889
Is it cold in here
or is it just that

242
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,875
I'm not wearing any underwear?

243
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:38,943
[Giggles]

244
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,428
She should be careful
around the crew.

245
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:41,729
New York gives us a tax break

246
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:43,514
for employing sex offenders.

247
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,400
- It's a terrible program.
- What's that?

248
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,251
Oh, I don't know.
Is it a stain?

249
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,903
Nobody knows.

250
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,688
What is that?

251
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:52,457
Ow.
That is Abby Flynn.

252
00:08:52,524 --> 00:08:53,891
She's a guest writer.

253
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,577
She's being hot
and doing baby talk?

254
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:58,496
I invented that.

255
00:08:58,564 --> 00:08:59,664
Summer of '98,

256
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,566
I took it to a whole new level.

257
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,368
[Cooing]

258
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,337
There can't be two of us, Liz.

259
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,239
She must be destroyed.

260
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,725
Uh-huh.
I don't know how I got here.

261
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,844
No, Jenna.
That is exactly the problem.

262
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:15,763
Men infantilize women and women
tear each other down.

263
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,148
Exactly.

264
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,083
I'll start by spreading
a destructive rumor about her

265
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,886
like the famous one I made up
about Jamie Lee Curtis.

266
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:24,589
[Whispers]
That she has two butts.

267
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,774
Look, you and I actually
want the same thing,

268
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:28,559
but we're not gonna destroy Abby.

269
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,461
We're gonna fix her.

270
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,764
Yes, like you fix a dog.

271
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,232
We'll sterilize her.

272
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,234
No, I'm gonna show Abby
that she doesn't need

273
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,468
to act like this.

274
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:38,703
Hi. I'm Jack.
It's nice to meet you.

275
00:09:38,754 --> 00:09:39,921
Hi.
I'm Abby. Hi.

276
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:43,374
[Laughter]

277
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,109
Ugh.
Whatever.

278
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:47,178
So what do you think, Kaylie?

279
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,764
Oceanography's
a pretty cool life.

280
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:52,784
I can't believe I'm talking
to Dr. Robert Ballard.

281
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,952
You're not.
"Bob" is short for "Bobert."

282
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,304
Oh.

283
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,523
[Gasps]
Oh, my gosh.

284
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,557
An anglerfish.

285
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,727
<i>Lophius piscatorius.</i>

286
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:04,495
That was my favorite fish
as a boy.

287
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,563
Look at those teeth.

288
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:07,398
You know that's a female.

289
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,433
The male is much smaller
and is basically a parasite

290
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,802
that lives on her.

291
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,037
Until mating, of course.
Then the male dies.

292
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:15,139
Yes, the scientific term
for that is "marriage."

293
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:16,474
[Chuckles]

294
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,110
Don't tell Gina I said that.

295
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:21,612
The ocean really is
the final frontier, Kaylie.

296
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,948
And we keep finding new things.

297
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:27,285
Giant tube worms
that breathe hydrogen sulfide.

298
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:28,853
Arctic jellyfish.
Oh!

299
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:31,856
And a chemical in kelp
that scientists think

300
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,091
might one day cure
ice cream headaches.

301
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,127
There's so much left to discover.

302
00:10:36,195 --> 00:10:38,029
And you could
be the one to do it.

303
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,530
I kind of envy you.

304
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,533
Youngsters are the future
of ocean exploration, Kaylie.

305
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,435
I mean, I'm not gonna
live forever,

306
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,604
no matter how much gold
I give Poseidon.

307
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:50,708
That's why I'm making you
a student argonaut.

308
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,327
[Gasps]

309
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:54,712
I can't believe
this is happening!

310
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,847
[Shrieks]

311
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:57,415
You already speak dolphin.

312
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,817
Excellent.

313
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,788
Is there an age cutoff
for the student argonauts?

314
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:06,290
What if you gave me a sticker
as a joke?

315
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,292
[Chuckles]

316
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,194
You know, Mr. Donaghy,
it...

317
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:12,430
It seems you really love
this stuff.

318
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:14,398
Maybe you should have been
a deep-sea explorer.

319
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,766
Oh, no, Kaylie.

320
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,468
That was a boyhood fantasy.

321
00:11:17,536 --> 00:11:18,686
I'm an adult now.

322
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,505
I don't have fantasies anymore.

323
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:24,742

There she is, men.

326
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:38,022
The elusive northern right whale.

Yes, sailor?
What is it?

We're moving on.

Hey, Liz!

335
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:00,478
Abby, thanks for meeting me here.

336
00:12:00,545 --> 00:12:02,263
This place is very special to me.

337
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,916
Is this where you got
your v-card punched?

338
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,284
What?
No.

339
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,935
Does this look like the makeup
room of a clown academy?

340
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,270
No, this is a statue...

341
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,023
and I know you know this...
of Eleanor Roosevelt.

342
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:13,491
First lady to the world,

343
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:14,892
champion of the rights of women,

344
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,078
and the lid on my high school
lunch box.

345
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,563
Look, I know it can be hard.

346
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,565
Society puts a lot
of pressure on us

347
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:23,668
to act a certain way.

348
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,369
But "TGS" is a safe place,

349
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:28,372
so you can drop the sexy baby act

350
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,590
and lose the pigtails...

351
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,375
But I like my pigtails.

352
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:33,311
My uncle says they're sexy.

353
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,946
Enough with the gross jokes.

354
00:12:35,013 --> 00:12:36,480
And that voice!

355
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,115
I want you to talk
in your real voice.

356
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,583
This is my real voice.

357
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:42,186
And the whole sexy baby thing
isn't an act.

358
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,722
I'm a very sexy baby.

359
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,259
I can't help it if men are
attracted to me.

360
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:49,827
Like that homeless guy.

361
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,929
He likes what he sees.

362
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,147
Okay.
That could be for me.

363
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:57,234
It's not!
It's for her!

364
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:59,453
- Abby, I'm trying to help you.
- Really?

365
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,973
By judging me on my appearance
and the way I talk?

366
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,658
And what's the difference
between me

367
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,978
using my sexuality and you using
those glasses to look smart?

368
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:08,312
[Scoffs] I am smart.

369
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,497
I placed out of freshman German.

370
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,682
Or Lutz using that sexy
English accent

371
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,150
to get me in the sack?

372
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:15,285
No! You didn't!
Lutz?

373
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,587
Is that even possible?

374
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,288
I mean, I was there
when he belvedered.

375
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,425
God, Abby, you can't be that
desperate for male attention.

376
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:22,593
You know what, Liz?

377
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:23,728
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

378
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,429
My life is none of your business.

379
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,631
Except it is
because you represent my show

380
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,299
and you represent my gender
in this business

381
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,168
and you embarrass me.

382
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:32,503
Kiss!

383
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:35,439
Dude, I am sorry,
but this is who I am.

384
00:13:35,507 --> 00:13:36,807
Deal with it.

385
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,976
Now are we gonna give
the gentleman

386
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:42,113
what he asked for or not?

387
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,864
Ugh.

388
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:54,095
Kenneth, when I'm gone,

389
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:56,314
how do you think people
will remember me?

390
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:58,316
Actually, sir, I've already
started to compose

391
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:00,819
a heroic ballad commemorating
your life.

00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,493
"Hey, remember Jack Donaghy?

396
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:11,029
"He wore a lot of suits and went
to a lot of meetings.

398
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,567
Sounds like you're asking some
pretty big questions.

399
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,435
When I have problems,
I like to talk

400
00:14:17,503 --> 00:14:19,404
to the man upstairs.

401
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:21,473
Unfortunately, Mr. Guzelian
got put in jail

402
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,807
for attacking his father.

403
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,677
I mean, what are we put
on this earth to do?

405
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,663
I'm still young, Kenneth.

406
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:30,749
I could devote the time I have
left to other interests.

407
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:32,450
Let Kaylie run Kabletown.

408
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,669
I'll join Ballard's group
and become

409
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:35,670

Now, that...

411
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:39,174
Would be a legacy.

412
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,693
I hope my legacy is
a <i>Sesame Street</i> type TV show

413
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:45,263
that promotes illiteracy
in girls.

to the erasable pen?"

426

Besides pencils,
who's saying that's a bad idea?

427
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:18,696
I've always thought that,

428
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:20,632
but I never had
the courage to say it.

Is that Abby?

430
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:24,669
I knew her boobs were fake.

431
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,072
And that baby voice is fake too.

432
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:29,774
You know, as someone
who speaks very naturally,

I'm offended.

434

She's taken on
a whole new identity.

She changed her nose, her teeth.

436

She even changed her name.

437
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,384
It's not Abby Flynn.
It's Abby Grossman.

438

Well, that's understandable.

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,554
I mean, "Grossman"
is a little bagel-y.

Abby used to be a strong,
smart, beautiful woman.

441

Why did she transform herself
into that baby hooker?

00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,185
I was trying to make you think
you didn't want

488
00:17:20,252 --> 00:17:22,420
to run Kabletown, while you
were doing the same thing to me.

489
00:17:22,488 --> 00:17:24,806
What a super sleuth.
[Gasps]

490
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,924
You're just like Vanessa from

491
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:27,458
the "Vampire Detective
Mysteries."

492
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:28,993
I'm not familiar
with that reference,

493
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,697
but I assume that Vanessa
is some kind of cool genius.

494
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,299
You don't even like
the ocean, do you?

495
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,834
I hate the ocean.
It's for tools.

496
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,169
The ocean's awesome
and for winners.

497
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:39,304
You're for tools.

498
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,439
You can't beat me,
Mr. Donaghy!

499
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,474
You worked your way
into this world,

500
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:47,529
but I...
I was born into it.

501
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:51,916
I breathe it.
[Inhales]

502
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:54,252
So watch your step.

503
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,687
[Childlike voice]
'Cause I can always tell Pop-Pop

504
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:57,021
you gave me alcohol.

505
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,856
And I can always seduce
one of your teachers

506
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,091
and get her to fail you.

507
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:01,859
- I'd be into that.
- Me too.

508
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:03,361
[Bell rings]

509
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,997
Better pick up your books
or you'll be late for class.

510
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:07,865
This is my free period.

511
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,867
Well played.

512
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:17,208
Megan, books!

[Sighs]

514
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:23,698
You know what sucked about
my last lesbian orgy?

515
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:25,416
Right in the middle of it,

516
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:28,019
one of us had to get up
to go use the bathroom

517
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,488
and then we all had to go!

518
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,224
Okay, there's something
everyone here needs to see.

519
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:35,059
Abby, you might want
to sit down for this.

520
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,761
Yeah, come sit on my <i>struikgewas.</i>

521
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,997
On a chair.
Come on, Sue.

522
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:40,999
Abby, this is for your own good.

523
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:44,552
Open apple, tough love time.

524
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:47,872
Has anyone ever actually
had a good time at brunch?

525
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,674
- You know...
- Is that you?

526
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:51,676
I don't know where
you found that,

527
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,945
but I am taking it down.

[Giggles]

529
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:57,381
That's what she said!

530
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,050
Hey, first of all,
Steve Carell owns

531
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,151
"that's what she said."

532
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:01,402
He owns it.

533
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:03,404
And second of all,
it's time to stop hiding.

534
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:06,391
A young person helped me
online post this

on joanofsnark.com.

Yes!
There's your real voice.

There's Abby Grossman.

00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,433
To quote Eleanor Roosevelt,

[imitating Eleanor Roosevelt]
"We are all..."

Do you understand
what you've done?

542
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,937
You have signed my death warrant.

How's that now?

544
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,507
My ex-husband
is gonna see this.

545
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:23,708
He's gonna find out where I am

546
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:24,709
and he is gonna try
to run me over

547
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,744
with his car again.

548
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:29,914
I changed my appearance
to get away from him!

549
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:31,549
Oh, 'cause I thought
it was, like,

550
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:33,284
pressure from society.

551
00:19:33,352 --> 00:19:34,385
You're right, Liz.

552
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:35,953
I was hiding from a man

553
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,255
who went insane after
being electrocuted

554
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,058
while watching
<i>Sleeping with the Enemy.</i>

555
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,359
I was cut out of that.

556
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:43,260
Oh, yeah, I am desperate
for male attention,

557
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:45,163
because I feel safer
having men around

558
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,098
in case Troy comes back.

559
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,567
That is why I slept with Lutz.

560
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:51,486
And I shall protect her.

561
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,570
Is there an Abby Flynn here?

562
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,655
That's her, Troy!

I'm on your side!
Get her!

Geez, Lutz.
It's the ups guy.

565
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:59,811
Okay, I think we all owe
Abby an apology.

Great.

I have six hours
to start a new life.

I'll have to be
a redhead this time.

You must really hate women, Liz.

wrap-up scene between

After all, they spent
the whole episode

trying to help young women.

But, first,
I would like to correct

00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:51,792
some of the science
we saw tonight.

588
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,663
There is no oil in kelp that
helps cure ice cream headaches.

589
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,659
No, the only thing that will
cure ice cream headaches

590
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:00,223
is having sex on a motorcycle.

Kailey was not speaking dolphin.

When a dolphin expresses excitement
