1
00:00:03,888 --> 00:00:05,088
This better be important, Jack.

2
00:00:05,155 --> 00:00:06,255
I was in the middle of bidding

3
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:07,857
on a bag of bras on eBay.

4
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,258
Lemon, Hank Hooper
is on his way

5
00:00:09,326 --> 00:00:10,359
up from Philadelphia,

6
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,828
and he wants to meet
with both of us.

7
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:12,896
Why does he want to meet me?

8
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:14,163
Do you think it's a good thing?

9
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,966
It's not, hon.

10
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,266
I saw that in a movie once,

11
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,268
but in the movie,
the guy was dead.

12
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:20,769
Nice tie, Jack.

13
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:23,005
How long have you been there?

14
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,707
I was sitting in that chair
a minute ago.

15
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,141
Nope.
That was me.

16
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,176
What can I say?
I smell like leather.

17
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:31,246
And you must be Elizabeth Lemon.

18
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,015
Oh.

19
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:34,083
Well, I'll be Bake McBrided.

20
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,584
I know a Philly gal when I hug one.

21
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:38,019
Now, Elizabeth, I like
to look someone in the eye

22
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:41,122
and smile when I say that what
you're doing is bad.

23
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:42,690
It's just horrible.

24
00:00:42,758 --> 00:00:45,893
Without Tracy, your show
is like my cholesterol.

25
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,996
The numbers are killing me.

26
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:49,764
So I'm gonna cancel <i>TGS.</i>

27
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,398
Hank, as you know,

28
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:54,300
tonight is <i>TGS's</i> 100th episode.

29
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,903
And we've been getting
some good media buzz.

30
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,371
Got on Wikipedia this week.

31
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,675
So you did 99 shows
against all odds and reason.

32
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:03,110
That's something.

33
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:04,878
- Now it's time to rest.
- Really?

34
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,847
You want to cancel the
only show on your network

35
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:08,814
starring a 42-year-old woman?

36
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,184
A show that is number one
in its time slot

37
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:12,652
among men 18 to 49

38
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,919
months left in prison?

39
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,155
I thought this company was a family,

40
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:17,157
but I guess it's that Austrian family

41
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:18,358
and I am the girl in the basement,

42
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,893
and you are the dad
who has been brutally--

43
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:22,428
Thank you, Lemon.

44
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,496
What Liz is neglecting to tell you

45
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:26,632
is that Tracy Jordan is back.

46
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:27,832
Oh.

47
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, that's something.

48
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:30,469
And I would consider it
a personal favor

49
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:32,504
if you would let them
do the 100th episode

50
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:36,975
and then reevaluate
the show with Tracy in it.

51
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:38,477
All right.

52
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:39,778
You get one more shot.

53
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,546
Just like the army doctor
said to me

54
00:01:41,613 --> 00:01:43,914
after my weekend in Okinawa.

55
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:47,451
You know, Jack,
I'm amazed at how much

56
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,354
you will stick your neck out
for your people.

57
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:53,424
It's no wonder you're here with
us good folks at Kabletown

58
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:54,925
instead of running GE.

59
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:56,093
They're mean.

60
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,860
Jack Welch once smacked a pretzel

61
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:03,132
out of my hand at the Super Bowl.

62
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,334
Is Tracy back?

63
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:06,203
I'd hate to think I just lied to Hank.

64
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,537
Geez, I'll get it done.

65
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,172
You know I'll do whatever it takes.

66
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,540
Lemon-style.

67
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:12,974
♪ Everybody dance now ♪

68
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:17,045
You gonna get me
another sandwich

69
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:18,880
or I'm gonna cut
your face up so bad

70
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:19,981
you'll have a chin.

71
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,650
I will waste you!

72
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,453
You'll have to go through
this old bastard first.

73
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:26,021
And I don't really
think it's fair

74
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:29,557
for me to be on a jury
because I'm a hologram.

75
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,858
What is the holdup with Tracy?

76
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,059
I thought you found him.

77
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,462
I did find him,
but he's still crazy.

78
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,063
He thinks he can't be
funny anymore

79
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:37,465
because now's a big Oscar winner.

80
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,066
People respect him too much.

81
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:42,803
He told me he feels like
a Bartram's Scrub-Hairstreak

82
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,305
trying to crawl back
into its silky cocoon.

83
00:02:45,406 --> 00:02:47,807
Which is a butterfly metaphor,
by the way,

84
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,276
and not, as I first thought,

85
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:50,877
a list of African-American
hair pduducts.

86
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,879
Well you just need to turn
the beautiful butterfly

87
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:55,382
back into  a drunk,
incompetent caterpillar.

88
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,750
And I have a plan.

89
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:58,518
I booked him on every morning
show in New York.

90
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:01,920
Traci will destroy all his
goodwill in time for rehearsal.

91
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:03,589
I've been prepping him all week.

92
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,358
So, Tracy Jordan,

93
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:07,826
My wife Joey and I were
in Maralago--

94
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:10,429
Jesus was black!

95
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,131
Just get him back
in time for the show.

96
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:13,499
I have a very full plate.

97
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,200
Really?
Is it from that pie place?

98
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,368
And I'm tired of going to bat

99
00:03:16,435 --> 00:03:17,369
for you and your show.

100
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:20,004
Oh, okay.
Fine.

101
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:21,139
But just to be clear--

102
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:22,140
There is no pie.

103
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,108
Okay.

104

Congratulations, everyone.

In 100 shows,
we've done Pam 107 times.

113
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,777
Can you believe it's been five years

114
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:02,545
since we first started doing this?

115
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:03,980
Um, that wasn't me.

116
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:05,347
There used to be another guy.

117
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:06,481
I don't think so.

118
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:09,084
Happy 100th show, miss Maroney.

119
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,186
Danny and I were just talking about

120
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:11,987
what an amazing five years we've had.

121
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:16,325
I will choke you to death
with your boyfriend's wig!

122
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,160
Give me back my man, bitch!

123
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,461
Can you reminisce about something

124
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,862
that's happened since I've been here,

125
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,396
'cause I couldn't see any of that.

126
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:23,932
I'll never forget what you said to me

127
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:26,134
after that first show, miss Maroney.

128
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,601
Terrific show, ma'am.

129
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,704
If I know anything about television,

130
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,206
<i>The Girlie Show</i> is a hit.

131
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:32,273
Oh, please.

132
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:33,541
If this turkey goes 100 episodes,

133
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,543
I'll have your baby.

134
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,877
I said that?

135
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,478
I was so young.

136
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,779
Wait. I saw that.

137
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,448
How? Am I dead?

138
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,783
Well, it's been 100 episodes.

139
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,719
I better lay you across my
grandmother's lap

140
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,054
in the mating shed.

141
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,622
But seriously, imagine if Jenna

142
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,891
really was a mother.

143
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,759
It would be horrible.

144
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,626
The only thing I want latched
to my funbags

145
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,062
are celebrity DJs.

146
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,263
I don't know, miss Maroney.

147
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,931
I think you'd make a wonderful parent.

148
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,300
You could sing the baby to sleep

149
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:04,203
and tell it fairy tales and
act out all the witch parts.

150
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,574
You're serious?
You albino goon.

151
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,842
I wish.
Albinos get to be watchers

152
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,612
in the mating shed.

153
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,448
I can't even imagine you pregnant.

154

"Who wore it best?"

157
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,055
I did.
I wore it best.

158
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:27,958
A baby gets you attention.

159
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,493
Listen up, friends.

160
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,794
It's pep talk time.

161
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:32,829
I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything here.

162
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:34,398
If we don't get Tracy back

163
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:36,967
and do the best show
that we've ever done,

164
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,036
we're cancelled.

165
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:41,871
So we're counting on Tracy?

166
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,639
Forget it.

167
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:46,009
Frank, put that hat back on.

168
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:49,645
Look, we've been through
bad times before.

169
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:50,713
All right.

170
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:53,950
Ride it straight to hell!

171
00:05:54,018 --> 00:05:55,151
Here come the roofies.

172
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:57,819
Where's my Mac and cheese?

173
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,822
And we've had some good times.

174
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,525
Who wants--
my puddings!

175
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:08,030
And I know what you are
all capable of.

176
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:09,864
This is your moment.

177
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:14,135
Tonight, <i>TGS</i> will not be
the worst thing on television.

178
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:16,438
It'll be John Stossel.

179
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:17,705
Who's with me?

180
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:18,840
Yeah!

181
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:19,841
Let's do it.

182
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:20,942
Good job.

183
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:32,286
Gas leak, huh?

184
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:33,620
Great.

185
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:34,655
Damn it.

186
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,123
Why now?

187
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:37,825
On my last day before retirement.

188
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:40,627
Here. Let me show you guys something.

189
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:42,863
That's my girl.

190
00:06:42,931 --> 00:06:44,198
We're getting married
when I get out of here.

191
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,132
Why am I showing you guys this?

192
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,633
It's gonna jinx everything.

193
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:48,868
Plus you're a couple of pervs.

194
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:52,105
Should be all right
as long as the leak

195
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,506
doesn't get into--

196
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:55,775
ah, damn it.
Look at this.

197
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:58,144
It's going right into
the sixth floor air duct.

198
00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,446
Damn it again!

199
00:06:59,513 --> 00:07:01,881
Well, we're gonna have
to evacuate the sixth

200
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,115
until this thing's taken care of.

201
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:05,617
Who's up there?
<i>TGS?</i>

202
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:07,453
Isn't that show already
half-dead?

203
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,557
Who wants to kiss?

204
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,559
What do you say we get
some fresh air?

205
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,919
Jack, we´ve a problem- There's
a gas leak in the studio.

206
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:23,320
Do you know what
I find fascinating?

207
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:25,022
Mystery novels
written by janitors?

208
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,691
How everyone who comes
through my door

209
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,759
seems to want to talk about <i>TGS</i>

210
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:31,261
as if it's also
the only thing in my life.

211
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,763
Now, I may not be the head of ge,

212
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,865
but that doesn't mean
I'm not a very busy man.

213
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,800
I've got other things going
on too, you know.

214
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,101
See?
I got a new hair.

215
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,803
It's white and it hurts,
but--

216
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,870
How bad is this leak?

217
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,172
It's pretty bad.

218
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,640
Prolonged exposure
could lead to incapacitation

219
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,076
or even death.

220
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:48,444
Other possible side effects include

221
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:50,346
hallucinations, revelation of secrets,

222
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:53,348
telling of truths, flashbacks,

223
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:56,185
headaches, nostalgia.

224
00:07:57,553 --> 00:07:58,687
Can you believe this is
happening to me

225
00:07:58,755 --> 00:07:59,722
on my last day of work?

226
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:01,156
My last day.

227
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:02,424
I don't know if there
was a party planned--

228
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,426
Evacuate the sixth floor.

229
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,095
I don't care if anyone dies.

230
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:08,730
I refuse to have long,
gas-induced conversations

231
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,164
with any of you people.

232
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:11,799
Boy, you know,
over the past five years,

233
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,268
we've had a lot of crazy characters

234
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:16,204
and guest stars drop by <i>TGS.</i>

235
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:19,506
Thank you, Pete.

236
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:22,009
Thank you, Pete.

237
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,214
I can't believe it's been 100 shows.

238
00:08:27,282 --> 00:08:29,149
More like 100 little strokes.

239
00:08:31,953 --> 00:08:34,221
You know, <i>The Girlie Show</i>
was working just fine,

240
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,857
and then Jack came along
and forced me to hire Tracy,

241
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:38,024
and now look at us.

242
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:40,394
Oh, life was so much simpler
back then.

243
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:42,228
I had a boyfriend.
Dennis.

244
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:43,896
Sure, he was an idiot,
but he made great chili,

245
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,798
and he didn't care
if I watched TV during sex.

246
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,169
Yeah, maybe I was better off then.

247
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,874
Liz, we have to evacuate the floor.

248
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:56,342
There's a gas leak.

249
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,643
What?
What about the show?

250
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,944
Everyone, evacuate immediately.

251
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:01,012
This is not a drill.

252
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,014
The gas is not affecting me yet,

253
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:04,783
so I can lead you to safety.

254
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,386
Just follow these...
Troll penises!

255
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:11,390
Oh, God!
What have I done?

256
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,424
He is an Oscar winner for his role

257
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:17,027
as D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda in
the movie <i>Hard to Watch.</i>

258
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:21,031
Please welcome Tracy Jordan.

259
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:25,369
Tracy!

260
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:26,771
Tracy.

261
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:27,905
Tracy?

262
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:29,273
Why don't you shut your mouth,

263
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,240
back that ass up
and make me a sandwich?

264
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,509
He's awesome.

265
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:34,444
You are still in character

266
00:09:34,512 --> 00:09:36,579
as the verbally abusive D'Jeffrey.

267
00:09:36,647 --> 00:09:39,382
I mean, he's become
such a part of him.

268
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,750
So, Tracy Jordan.

269
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,919
You asked to come on our show

270
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:44,354
because you had a revelation

271
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:46,689
about your post-Oscar
trip to Africa.

272
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:48,390
I lied to all you ugly white ladies.

273
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:49,758
I didn't go to Africa.

274
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:51,627
I was hiding in a warehouse in Queens,

275
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:53,529
watching vintage pornography.

276
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,797
I love your honesty.

277
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,900
It's because you didn't feel

278
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:01,469
like your authentic self

279
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,971
that you walked away from success.

280
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,273
That's actually very brave.
Don't you think?

281
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:07,908
No! It's unbrave!

282
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,744
- You should hate me!
- I can't.

283
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,213
You fly free.

284
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,581
I'm a bird in a cage.

285
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:14,982
Hey, you got to stay around.

286
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,917
We've got our no-cook cooking,
hair make-unders.

287
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,285
What does that even mean?

288
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:20,620
It's new haircuts,

289
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,322
but you can make salads with them.

290
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,194
A true artist...

291
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,029
He feels things we don't.

292
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,599
This is <i>Today</i> on NBC.

293
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,900
No, we can't do another Pam.

294
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,335
Not tonight.

295
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,436
Frank, what is this?

296
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,004
"Broken eyboard alk show"?

297
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,038
I write what I know.

298
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,107
Also I broke my keyboard.

299
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,509
No, we're throwing everything out

300
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:44,877
and starting over.

301
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,813
Only home runs, guys.
Focus up.

302
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:48,881
It's just hard to concentrate.

303
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,382
It's so nice working outside.

304
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,421
Tracy, how'd it go?

305
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,455
Are you on your way back?

306
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,990
It was a disaster!

307
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,525
What happened?
What about our plan?

308
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,460
I'm so beloved, I can do no wrong.

309
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,295
Now everyone's after me.

310
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,697
Unicef, the Gates foundation.

311
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:08,064
And what is Farm Aid?

312
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:10,567
Is it a drink?
Is it a drug?

313
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:12,669
Is it a bandage you put on a barn?

314
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:14,438
See, that's the kind of
lazy stand-up

315
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:15,839
I'll never do again.

316
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:17,908
Tracy, just come back,
do the show tonight,

317
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,376
and we'll figure all this out.

318
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,044
F-u, l.l.

319
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:24,781
Spells "full," because you're
full of BS, Liz Lemon.

320
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:26,482
Listen to me.
There's still time.

321
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,418
The media won't let you
embarrass yourself.

322
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:31,153
Be like Michael McDonald
and take it to the streets.

323
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:33,122
Get the public to hate you,
and the media will follow.

324
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,524
And then you'll get
your old life back.

325
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,591
Trust me.

326
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,359
You better be right, Liz Lemon,

327
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:40,094
'cause I can't take much more of this.

328
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:43,097
I think Bono got in my limo.

329
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:48,269
Liz!

330
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:49,805
Do you think I'd be a good mother?

331
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,173
No.

332
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:53,974
And I wasn't even drinking anything.

333
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,375
I just feel like I'm
at a point in my life

334
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:56,744
where I'm starting to have
this real desire

335
00:11:56,812 --> 00:11:58,378
to nurture... my career.

336
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,213
I think pregnancy would
be a great PR move.

337
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,281
Oh, my God.

338
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,250
You want a baby to help your career?

339
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:05,385
Look... <i>TGS</i> may be going away.

340
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:07,421
Being pregnant is a great excuse
for why I stopped working

341
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:08,489
instead of the truth.

342
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:09,989
I'm in my 40s, very difficult,

343
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:13,960
and not that good
at playing <i>La Realite.</i>

344
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,061
Jenna, think about this.

345
00:12:15,128 --> 00:12:16,295
You will have a child.

346
00:12:16,363 --> 00:12:18,064
Who will grow up to be
a little gay fancy man.

347
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:19,766
Well, good luck finding
a man willing to ride

348
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,233
that crazy train.

349
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:22,969
I'll have you know I talked
with a man this morning

350
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,604
who thinks I'd be a wonderful mother.

351
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:27,405
He must be an idiot.

352
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:31,276
He is an idiot.

353
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:32,878
What about a sketch

354
00:12:32,946 --> 00:12:34,212
about how the Empire State building

355
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,914
is controlling us with electricity?

356
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,383
Come on, get out of here.

357
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,291
Just maybe one more turn.

358
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:49,460
Then I can go home to my sweetheart.

359
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:51,195
I told her boy I'd hit a home run

360
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:52,797
for him tomorrow night.

361
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:54,632
Here we go.

362
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:58,535
Damn it!

363
00:12:58,636 --> 00:12:59,870
I'm getting too old for this

364
00:12:59,937 --> 00:13:02,205
"shh" sound that comes
from this gas pipe.

365
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:12,682
Who are you?

366
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,182
You're so handsome.

367
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,786
I'm Jack Donaghy,
CEO of General Electric.

368
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:20,022
Who are you?

369
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:21,289
I'm Jack Donaghy.

370
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:22,691
You <i>were</i> Jack Donaghy.

371
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,627
You <i>were</i> magnificent.

372
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:27,295
- I'm still magnificent.
- No.

373
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:29,231
I come from an alternate universe

374
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:31,266
in which I followed our plan

375
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,534
for world domination.

376
00:13:32,601 --> 00:13:33,968
I run the general.

377
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,870
I own an NFL team.

378
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:37,672
I guest-starred on <i>Entourage.</i>

379
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,940
What do you do?

380
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:40,509
I'll tell you what I don't do.

381
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,644
Wear a striped tie
with a striped shirt.

382
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:44,546
It's called "Power Clashing"

383
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,280
and I do it because I can.

384
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:48,749
I wore this on the January cover

385
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:50,518
of <i>Meetings</i> magazine.

386
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:53,054
We made the cover during
<i>meetings</i> history month?

387
00:13:53,121 --> 00:13:55,689
<i>I</i> made the cover.

388
00:13:55,757 --> 00:13:57,824
What happened to you, Jack?

389
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,261
You were supposed
to spend six months in tv

390
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:02,762
as part of your climb
up the GE ladder.

391
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:04,330
You've been here five years.

392
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:06,366
And here...

393
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:08,034
Isn't even GE anymore.

394
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:09,269
It's Kableclown.

395
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:11,504
"Town," Donaghy, and that's not funny.

396
00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:12,805
It was funny when I said it

397
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:14,174
on my syndicated radio show.

398
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,275
You bastard.

399
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,342
I'm doing fine!

400
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,010
You used to be a shark.

401
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,011
I still am.
Look at my claws!

402
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,947
Sharks don't have claws.

403
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:23,915
You don't even know
what a shark is anymore!

404
00:14:23,983 --> 00:14:25,684
Oh, God.

405
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:28,087
Do you know why?

406
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:29,088
No.

407
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:31,756
Liz... Lemon.

408
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:33,725
Lemon?

409
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:35,460
She became your focus

410
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,861
at the expense of
your own ambition.

411
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:39,830
You should have
realized within a week

412
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:41,031
that Lemon was a black hole,

413
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,634
unworthy of our mentorship.

414
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:45,869
And now it's five years later,
and what are you doing?

415
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:48,406
Are you building factories
in bangalore?

416
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:51,074
Are you dining
in the Palin White House?

417
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:52,542
No.

418
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,712
You're approving
<i>TGS</i> wrap gifts.

419
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,282
Baseball caps with stupid
sayings from the show

420
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,517
written on them.

421
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:02,219
What the hell is a "Pwomp"?

422
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:03,686
It's when two fat people--

423
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:05,555
I don't care!

424
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:07,156
What's happened to you?

425
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:08,790
To us?

426
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,926
We make me sick.

427
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,595
Mr. Donaghy?

428
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,895
- What?
- Yes, Tom?

429
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,296
The gas leak has
spread to this floor.

430
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:17,298
You got to clear out before
you start seeing things.

431
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,900
- Thank you, tom.
- I'll clear you out!

432
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:20,535
Oh, okay.

433
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,774
The real Jack Donaghy

434
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,209
could handle a little gas leak!

435
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,779
I am a Jedi!

436
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:39,730
Hey, look.

437
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:41,832
Tracy Jordan is
ironically reappropriating

438
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,267
his bad past behavior
as a commentary

439
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,202
on Fitzgerald's dictum that
there are no second acts

440
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,370
in American life.

441
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,571
I want to take a picture of him

442
00:15:48,638 --> 00:15:49,638
with my old-fashioned camera.

443
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:50,639
- No! No!
- Ah!

444
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,376
Help!
I can't swim!

445
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:54,710
Damn it!

446
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,311
He just pulled me out
of the water and said,

447
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,748
"Don't tell anyone I did this."

448
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,215
I didn't even get a chance
to congratulate him

449
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,717
on his Oscar.

450
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,651
Modesty and heroism.

451
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,855
Two words forever synonymous
with Tracy Jordan.

452
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:10,091
"Tracy Jordan saves drowning man"?

453
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,260
Ah, come on!

454
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:13,828
Why is Tracy off rescuing people?

455
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:14,896
Why isn't he here?

456
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,163
He will be, I promise.

457
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:17,265
And we need to be ready.

458
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:18,499
Lutz, what are you working on?

459
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:19,733
Breathing through my mouth

460
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:21,067
so I don't smell
the throw-up on s shirt.

461
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:23,203
I would take my shirt off,

462
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,204
but I visited my rescue chimp

463
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:25,906
for his birthday last week,

464
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,675
and another chimp got mad
and bit my nipple off.

465
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:29,777
He played with it,

466
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:30,778
and then he kissed it,

467
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:32,279
and then he ate it.

468
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:33,814
Damn it, lutz.
Focus up.

469
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:35,782
Where's my computer?

470
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,784
Cerie, did you not
bring my computer down?

471
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:39,018
You said you were writing.

472
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,386
I've only seen you use that computer

473
00:16:40,454 --> 00:16:41,954
to look at pictures of Nate Berkus.

474
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:44,457
Ah! Pwomp!

475
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,526
Hey, Jack, you're friends

476
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:47,993
with Jeter and Springsteen, right?

477
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,029
Can you call and see if
they'll be in the cold open?

478
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:51,129
They'd have to kiss.

479
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:52,531
Oh, really, Lemon?

480
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:53,832
You still need my help?

481
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,867
Five years of my business life wasted,

482
00:16:55,935 --> 00:16:57,836
and I'm still supposed
to hold your hand.

483
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:00,204
Your wet, yet somehow flaky hand.

484
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:01,907
- What just happened?
- You happened.

485
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:03,475
Sideways Jack was right.

486
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:04,643
Sideways what?

487
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,645
In here!

488
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:10,280
Did you also have
to evacuate the NBC Store?

489
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:12,115
No, it's just empty.

490
00:17:12,183 --> 00:17:13,884
This TV nonsense

491
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:15,252
was supposed to be
my stepping stone,

492
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,387
and instead, it's my gravestone.

493
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:18,956
And do you know
whose fault that is?

494
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:20,658
Sort of feel like
you're gonna say Leno.

495
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:21,826
You.

496
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:23,993
I got so sucked
into trying to repair you

497
00:17:24,061 --> 00:17:25,995
that I became
the American auto industry,

498
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:28,598
failing to recognize
that you can't fix a <i>Lemon</i>

499
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,966
Wow, yeah,
because the last five years

500
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,469
have been so great for me
with you as my mentor.

501
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:34,337
I was better off before we met.

502
00:17:34,404 --> 00:17:35,505
So what's your point, Lemon?

503
00:17:35,573 --> 00:17:37,239
You'd rather be doing <i>The Girlie Show</i>

504
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:38,341
and going home to Dennis?

505
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,608
I didn't say that.

506
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:41,076
But at least Dennis was always
there for me.

507
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,778
He's the only guy
I can say that about.

508
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:44,713
I dragged you down?

509
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:45,814
Opposite!

510
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,115
I should have gone with my gut

511
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:48,316
and fired you when we first met.

512
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,919
What?
Flashback, please.

513
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,020
Uh, Pete, hang back.

514
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:56,123
Yeah, you bet.

515
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,157
We have a problem.

516
00:17:57,225 --> 00:17:58,659
I can explain.
My zipper broke.

517
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,862
I don't think Liz Lemon's
female voice

518
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,463
is a good match for Tracy Jordan.

519
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:05,032
Firing Lemon will send a
message to the whole staff.

520
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,400
No, no, you can't fire Liz.

521
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:07,668
This show is her life.

522
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:08,836
She hasn't got much going on.

523
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,871
She threw a birthday
party for her TV.

524
00:18:10,938 --> 00:18:12,839
If you fire Liz,
then--

525
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:14,307
then I quit.

526
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,075
You'll never succeed
by sticking your neck out

527
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,276
for someone like her.

528
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:19,445
But if that's how you feel,
so be it.

529
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:23,016
The important thing
is that I fire someone...

530
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,117
Pete.

531
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:25,719
You tried to fire me?

532
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:26,785
And then a week later,
you're like,

533
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,587
"oh, I want to mentor you."

534
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:29,922
"Unlikely friendship."

535
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,023
Who do you think you are?

536
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,290
I'll tell you who I was.

537
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:33,626
That guy that fired Pete.

538
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,160
And he could have run GE,

539
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,563
but instead, he got lemoned.

540
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:39,999
I should have fired
you from my life.

541
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:43,467
I knew you were supposed to push,

542
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,336
but I didn't say anything.

543
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:46,971
Ugh.

544
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,442
Mmm.

545
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,344
The MSG is delicious today.

546
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:55,413
I'm so glad that you're able
to meet me on my break.

547
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,815
Is this just to talk,
or will you be activating

548
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:58,982
my electric underwear?

549
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,183
Just to talk.

550
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,819
Paul, do you think
I'd be a good mother?

551
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:05,155
Of course not.
And I'd be a terrible father.

552
00:19:05,222 --> 00:19:06,289
I mean, what if we had a child

553
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:07,624
that was prettier than us?

554
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:08,825
We'd have to leave it in a desert.

555
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:10,561
But Kenneth thinks
I'd make a good mother.

556
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:12,128
Oh.

557
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:13,664
Is that something you want?

558
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,230
Wasn't something I thought about

559
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:17,967
until Kenneth said I'd be good at it.

560
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,402
And of course,
it'd be great for my career.

561
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,638
Everyone would talk
about my crazy name choice.

562
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,074
Right now, it's between
"Frisbeeface" and "Glock,"

563
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,409
gender irrelevant.

564
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:28,978
I love you, Jenna Maroney.

565
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:31,145
I want to hogtie you and hide you

566
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,814
in the luggage compartment
of a Greyhound bus

567
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,215
with just a bowl of dirty water.

568
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:35,984
I love you too.

569
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,185
But I don't know.

570
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:38,519
I mean, Kenneth Parcell
may be the only man

571
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,521
in the world who thinks you
should have a child.

572
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,723
Break's over, Paul.

573
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,257
Crew meeting in
Lady Chantarelle's office.

574
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:46,561
He's pissed.

575
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,864
- Hey, dummy.
- Gah! What?

576
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:52,399
Whoa.
You look good.

577
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:53,734
You lose weight or something?

578
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:55,268
Your neck, it looks looser.

579
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,637
What are you doing here, Dennis?

580
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,739
I got your message.

581
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:01,742
What message?

582
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,447
Dennis, it's dummy.

583
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:09,749
I miss you.

584
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:10,950
Come see me.

585
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,789
Things were better
five years ago, Jack.

586
00:20:16,857 --> 00:20:19,791
I was in my 30s and everything.

587
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,002
Whazzup!

588
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,837
You've reached Dennis' voicemail.

589
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:33,005
"How you doing?"

590
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,439
Get out of here, Joey.

591
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:35,740
I'm recording
my voicemail message.

592
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,275
Is that real?

593
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:39,844
Okay, I did call you,

594
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:40,978
but I was not in my right mind.

595
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:42,212
I mean, how could I be,

596
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,981
to call you after everything
you've done?

597
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,249
Good evening, sir.

598
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:46,951
I'm Chris Hansen
with <i>Dateline NBC.</i>

599
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,686
Can I ask you what you're
doing here tonight?

600
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,621
Yeah, I'm here to boff some
chick named Mary.

601
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:53,089
Hey... threesome?

602
00:20:53,157 --> 00:20:54,157
How about it, huh?

603
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:55,258
It's Tonya, right?

604
00:20:55,325 --> 00:20:56,826
It's wonderful service.

605
00:20:56,894 --> 00:21:00,163
Could you maybe not hit
on the waitress in front--

606
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,998
Chew and screw!
Run, dummy.

607
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,134
Ah!
Damn it, Dennis!

608
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:05,802
I checked a coat.

609
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,670
But you called me, Liz.

610
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:08,771
Oh, whatever.

611
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:09,872
'Cause down deep, you still got

612
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:11,707
all kinds of queer
feelings for me.

613
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:14,276
That's why I knew someday
you'd be all vulnerable

614
00:21:14,343 --> 00:21:16,812
from a gas leak or a coma
or a super period.

615
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,846
You're disgusting.

616
00:21:17,914 --> 00:21:19,014
And I would be there for you.

617
00:21:19,082 --> 00:21:21,650
No. You know what I feel?

618
00:21:21,718 --> 00:21:22,784
You were a mistake

619
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:24,185
that I made at a time in my life

620
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:26,054
when I could afford
to make mistakes.

621
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:27,855
That's what I miss,
Dennis, not you.

622
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:29,323
Okay, gang, they fixed
the gas leak.

623
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:30,624
They're airing out the studio.

624
00:21:30,692 --> 00:21:32,293
We can start heading back up.

625
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,827
Whoa, hold on a second.

626
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:35,796
You think I'm just gonna
give up now, huh?

627
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:38,465
I'm a Duffy, Liz
and us Duffys,

628
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,234
we didn't give up when we got
kicked out of Ireland.

629
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:42,035
We didn't give up
when America sent us back.

630
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:43,804
And we didn't give up when Ireland

631
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:45,972
then just set us adrift
on a log, all right?

632
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,575
Come on, it's not over, Liz.

633
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,475
What a day!

634
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,323
Miss Lemon's gonna
get Mr. Jordan back.

635
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,991
We're gonna do the best show ever.

636
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:58,426
And out on the Plaza,

637
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:00,562
a bird landed on my apple.

638
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:03,365
I thought he was gonna eat it,
but he just sat there.

639
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:04,833
What's next?

640
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,736
A different bird landing
on a different apple?

641
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:11,705
Where are you, Tray?

642
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,907
- I'm back, Liz Lemon.
- Tracy's back!!

643
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:15,275
- Yeah!
- Yes!

644
00:22:15,343 --> 00:22:16,377
I'm gonna need
an Obama cold open,

645
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:17,745
a fart doctor, and you know what?

646
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:19,079
Write up that bum's
Empire State building idea.

647
00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:20,947
Fart doctor.

648
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:22,883
No, I mean I'm back
to where I was yesterday.

649
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,551
I can't get anyone mad at me.

650
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:26,652
I even called a woman's
basketball team

651
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,721
"Nappy-headed hos,"
but apparently,

652
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,089
I'm allowed to talk like that.

653
00:22:30,156 --> 00:22:31,090
Why?

654
00:22:31,157 --> 00:22:32,492
Tracy, come on.

655
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,293
Tracy Jordan?
Why isn't he here?

656
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:37,597
I just had a meeting
with News down on four.

657
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:40,065
Brian Williams sure gets close
to you when he talks.

658
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,467
Very feminine energy.

659
00:22:41,535 --> 00:22:42,901
Anyway, I thought I'd just swing by

660
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:45,236
and introduce myself
to Tracy Jordan, but--

661
00:22:45,304 --> 00:22:46,705
Ah!
He-- he is here.

662
00:22:46,773 --> 00:22:48,540
You know, he just likes
to learn his lines

663
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,809
in the bathroom
and communicate by phone.

664
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:52,277
Actors, am I right?

665
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:54,546
You know, I once had to speak
to the Screen Actors Guild.

666
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:56,047
Bunch of nutjobs.

667
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:59,617
But you couldn't make movies
and TV without 'em.

668
00:23:02,186 --> 00:23:03,487
I'm just kidding!

669
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:04,889
I mean, look at
<i>March of the Penguins.</i>

670
00:23:04,956 --> 00:23:05,890
Who was in that?

671
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:07,324
Good luck tonight.

672
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:10,494
You're gonna need it.

673
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:11,862
Tracy, you can do this.

674
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,898
You have to be at
the show tonight.

675
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:15,164
Tracy who?

676
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:17,233
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

677
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:19,736
Look, you think the world
has turned its back on you?

678
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:22,338
I know a place where
that's not true.

679
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:24,741
A place where you can remember
the man you used to be.

680
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:26,342
A place where you
can eat buffet ribs

681
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,878
while someone's daughter
shakes her crack at you.

682
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:31,847
Tracy Jordan, I am taking you
to a strip club.

683
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:36,585
Oh, excuse me, miss.

684
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:38,119
How much is a lap dance?

685
00:23:38,187 --> 00:23:39,387
I'm a little light on cash,

686
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:40,956
but I have a PayPal account.

687
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:43,358
Oh, my God.
Tracy Jordan?

688
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:45,093
That's right.
Party time.

689
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:47,328
When I saw you in
<i>Hard to Watch...</i>

690
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:48,529
No, no, keep it light.

691
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:50,097
You inspired me to contact

692
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:51,799
my biological father.

693
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:52,934
No daddy stuff.

694
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:55,336
I hadn't spoken to him in 13 years.

695
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,104
Maybe show him your butt.

696
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:00,074
There are tears falling
on her boobies, Liz Lemon.

697
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,376
I know you've been molested.

698
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,144
That's how we all got here,

699
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,613
but I don't want to hear about it.

700
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:08,882
I just wanted to let you know

701
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,183
that I'm going into the Navy.

702
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,586
Because like you
said in your movie,

703
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,888
"I invent my tomorrow."

704
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,523
But I wasn't even supposed
to say that.

705
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:19,692
The line was, "Shereen, I hope
Dr. Mogutu has good news

706
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,993
"about my endoscopy,"

707
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,361
but I couldn't get it right,

708
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,829
so they told me to improv.

709
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:25,263
Come on, guys.

710
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,532
I'm making it rain.

711
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,400
You see what you've done,
Liz Lemon?

712
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,903
Tracy Jordan is broken.

713
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:31,904
It's over.

714
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:33,506
Get off stage!

715
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:34,606
No whites!

716
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:37,141
You wanted to see me,
miss Maroney?

717
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,910
Oh, my.

718
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:42,346
Candles, incense, Disco music.

719
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,716
Someone's getting
into the easter spirit.

720
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:45,817
No, Kenneth.

721
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,552
Do you remember that silly joke

722
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,587
about me having your baby?

723
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,054
Yes.

724
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,990
- So crazy.
- I know.

725
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:55,592
It's crazy...

726
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,862
Unless you're into it.

727
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,930
What?

728
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,865
No, ma'am.
That would be wrong.

729
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,534
We're not married.

730
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,702
And we're different religions.

731
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,702
We can do whatever we want.

732
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,037
Miss Maroney,

733
00:25:08,104 --> 00:25:11,340
I'd do anything for you
or mr. Jordan,

734
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:12,608
but this is wrong.

735
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:16,478
But, Kenneth,
you might be my only chance.

736
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:22,117
No!

737
00:25:22,185 --> 00:25:24,953
Fine. I'll get you
when you're sleeping.

738
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:28,089
It's not rape if neither party
really wants it.

739
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:34,395
You're back.

740
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:35,864
Yeah, and this is my front.

741
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:36,865
Thanks for setting me up

742
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,367
with another classic quote.

743
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:41,001
I borrowed your whale semen candle.
It didn't work, by the way.

744
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:42,102
You can keep it.

745
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,837
I'm just packing up a few things,

746
00:25:43,905 --> 00:25:44,838
and then I'm gone.

747
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:46,574
Wait.
Where are you going?

748
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:47,875
I'm quitting show business.

749
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:49,977
I can't stop the horrible respect

750
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,979
people have for me.

751
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:54,147
Tracy, you can't do that.

752
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:56,616
Look, I would never say this
on the record.

753
00:25:56,684 --> 00:26:00,352
Of course.
This is all off the record.

754
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,355
The show needs you,
and I need you.

755
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:05,058
I'd rather do the show
than have a baby.

756
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:07,594
- But you don't understand.
- Oh, I do understand.

757
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:09,395
Look at Roman Polanski.

758
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:10,396
No, thank you.

759
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:11,964
Or Elia Kazan.

760
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:14,432
He told the government
his friends were communists,

761
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,401
then got a standing ovation
at the Oscars.

762
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:17,769
That's crazy.

763
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:19,071
A man named "Elia."

764
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:20,706
That's a giraffe's name.

765
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:22,507
You know, when you think about it,

766
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:25,477
the only celebrities who
completely undo their goodwill

767
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,711
are the murderers.

768
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:29,146
John Wilkes Booth, Phil Spector,

769
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,249
OJ Simpson,
who texted me earlier today.

770
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:35,051
Shoot someone, huh?

771
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:37,051
Nah. That's crazy, even for us

772
00:26:37,122 --> 00:26:38,990
I guess it would take
a pretty big gas leak

773
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,458
to make you think
that was a good idea.

774
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,794
All right!

775
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:47,664
100th episode, 100 hours of comedy.

776
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:48,798
Minus the commercials.

777
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:53,503
20 hours of comedy.

778
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,238
- Hey, dummy.
- Damn it.

779
00:26:55,305 --> 00:26:56,539
Look, Liz,

780
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:58,008
if this is gonna work out
between you and me,

781
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,276
you should know my tarantula
sleeps on my face.

782
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:02,377
Oh, my God.

783
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:03,612
My show is getting cancelled,

784
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,380
I'm never speaking
to Jack Donaghy again,

785
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:06,649
and the worst thing
that happened to me today

786
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:07,650
is that you showed up.

787
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:08,851
Ah, 'cause you called me.

788
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,318
When I was high on gas.

789
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:12,087
Do you not understand
what that means?

790
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:13,188
No, not really.

791
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,023
Gas has no effect on me at all.

792
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,557
When I was growing up, my school,

793
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:18,726
Gerry cooney elementary,
it was right next

794
00:27:18,794 --> 00:27:21,295
to a gas works in Queens.

795
00:27:21,363 --> 00:27:22,563
It ventilated into the Cafeteria.

796
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:24,632
We got a big settlement
from the city.

797
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,267
Our parents voted
to spend it on a boat

798
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:28,803
that the families could share,
but then that sank.

799
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:30,704
But you know what?

800
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,639
I'm still smart enough to know

801
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:35,142
that I'll never do better
than you, Liz Lemon,

802
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,877
'cause you're a cook
in the bedroom

803
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:38,011
and a whore in the kitchen.

804
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,813
So I'm gonna give you one more shot

805
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:42,049
to admit to me
that you keep bringing me back

806
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:44,818
into your life for a reason.

807
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,919
Subhas, take out the trash.

808
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,253
Don't order me around, woman.

809
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:50,522
No, I mean--
just--

810
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,192
Dennis, get out.

811
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:56,562
You'll change your mind.

812
00:28:06,806 --> 00:28:08,139
Let's rock, Duffy.

813
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:17,939
You again!

814
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:19,039
Wait a minute...

815
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,139
- You're not Sideways Jack!
- I'm Past Jack.

816
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:24,211
Because I'm from the past?
And I'm you?

817
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:25,546
- Yeah, get it.
- Do you?

818
00:28:25,647 --> 00:28:26,914
'Cause it seems like

819
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:29,584
you don't get much of anything
anymore, old man.

820
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:32,219
If you're my future,
I'm gonna jump.

821
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:33,220
Stop him!

822
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:34,221
If he jumps,

823
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:35,589
we don't exist anymore.

824
00:28:35,656 --> 00:28:37,156
I'm perfectly aware of that.

825
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:38,558
I studied time dilation

826
00:28:38,626 --> 00:28:40,560
and quantum teleportation
in college.

827
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,328
No, you didn't.
You saw <i>Time Cop.</i>

828
00:28:42,397 --> 00:28:43,930
Really?
I never saw <i>Time Cop.</i>

829
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,633
You will in 2007,
and you'll love it.

830
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:48,334
Why are you talking like that?

831
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:51,069
This is how everyone
talked in the '80s.

832
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:52,772
This is how Reagan talked.

833
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,974
Look, there's still time
to fix this, Jack.

834
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,810
You need to kick ass again,

835
00:28:57,878 --> 00:28:59,445
starting with getting rid
of that woman.

836
00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:00,946
Listen to him.

837
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:03,015
He's awesome,
and you know he's right.

838
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:04,717
Fire Lemon?

839
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:05,984
I don't know if I can do that.

840
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:07,786
Well, then, take this!

841
00:29:07,853 --> 00:29:09,888
Oh, God!

842
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:11,088
That only hurt me.

843
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:13,291
Why did I think that would
hurt you too?

844
00:29:13,358 --> 00:29:15,794
Jack, be the man
you were meant to be.

845
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:16,861
Me.

846
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,230
This tuxedo is made out
of the Puma

847
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:21,332
that I rode into
my 50th birthday party.

848
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,300
Why are you both wearing tuxedos?

849
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,536
It's after 6:00.
What are we, farmers?

850
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:27,771
Now go get rid of that woman.

851
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:33,043
Just want to check everything out

852
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,945
after your little gas scare.

853
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:36,513
Well, my pen light is working.

854
00:29:36,581 --> 00:29:37,815
That's good.

855
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:39,615
Now, can you say
the alphabet for me?

856
00:29:39,683 --> 00:29:41,884
Well, a very,
very heavy--

857
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:44,287
uh, heavy, du--
bertation tonight.

858
00:29:44,355 --> 00:29:46,856
We had a very dairse--
dareson by--

859
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:48,158
let's go ahead
and tersh-tayson

860
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:49,225
lets gotobit anhaddapit.

861
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:52,728
Excellent.

862
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:54,230
My God, Jenna.

863
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:56,365
Are you pregnant?
How?

864
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,067
Did you go swimming
in a public pool?

865
00:29:58,134 --> 00:30:00,235
No, I got in my head
about having a baby,

866
00:30:00,303 --> 00:30:02,537
and now I'm having
a hysterical pregnancy.

867
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:03,705
Well, that's redundant.

868
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:05,107
All pregnancies are hysterical.

869
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:07,376
They're started by penises.

870
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:08,510
This should be perfect.

871
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,212
I mean, all I want
is the attention.

872
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,313
So why am I not happy?

873
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:14,882
I mean, on some level,
do I want to have a baby?

874
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,584
Do I want to be a mother?

875
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:17,986
Should I be a mother?

876
00:30:18,053 --> 00:30:20,321
Bored!

877
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:21,422
Hey.

878
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,756
Greta Johannsen,
your animal wrangler.

879
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:26,060
My God, you're beautiful.

880
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:29,196
♪ if you say
good-bye tonight ♪

881

885
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:51,317
Mr. Jordan, I refuse
to accept this is happening.

886
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:54,053
You leaving is
as crazy to me as evolution,

887
00:30:54,121 --> 00:30:56,055
or a woman's right
to choose her haircut.

888
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,424
I'm sorry, Ken,
but maybe Jenna was right.

889
00:30:58,492 --> 00:30:59,557
The only way I could come back

890
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,725
is if I shoot someone,

891
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:01,859
and that's crazy.

892
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:03,528
Or is it?

893
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,030
Maybe it's a good idea.

894
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,431
I don't know.

895
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,933
It has a nice, simple logic to it.

896
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,868
Why don't we take a deep breath

897
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,238
and then both say
what we think we should do.

898
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,173
- You should shoot me...
- I should shoot you...

899
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,374
- on the roof of 30 Rock!
- on the roof of 30 Rock!

900
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,078
I only ask one thing, sir.

901
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,579
Make it quick.

902
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,915
I cannot promise you that, Ken.

903
00:31:24,982 --> 00:31:26,517
I'm a horrible shot.

904
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:27,851
To the roof.

905
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:36,926
- Hey, dummy.
- Hey.

906
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,094
You ready to sign that lease?

907
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,728
You know how we were talking earlier

908
00:31:39,796 --> 00:31:41,330
about me moving in with you
and how hard it is

909
00:31:41,398 --> 00:31:42,798
to kick a tenant out in New York?

910
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:43,866
Just think about it.

911
00:31:43,934 --> 00:31:46,135
I'll make you chili every night.

912
00:31:46,203 --> 00:31:47,270
I'll provide for you.

913
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:48,604
I have a new business idea.

914
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:50,472
It's like Netflix,
but you go to a store,

915
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,608
and you pick out your video
from a limited selection.

916
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:54,509
- It'd be like five years ago.
- Exactly.

917
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:56,478
I can move my stuff
in tonight, right?

918
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:58,614
I just have one duffel bag
in a sidecar.

919
00:31:58,682 --> 00:31:59,648
My motorcycle got impounded

920
00:31:59,716 --> 00:32:01,316
from being parked too awesome.

921
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:02,618
I just need you to sign
this lease I printed up

922
00:32:02,686 --> 00:32:03,818
off the Internet.

923
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,920
Okay, I need a pen.

924
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:07,055
You don't have a pen?

925
00:32:07,122 --> 00:32:08,289
You're a writer, Liz.

926
00:32:08,356 --> 00:32:10,024
All I have is
this kick-ass laser pointer

927
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:11,826
that I point at nerds'
crotches in the park.

928
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:13,394
Oh, wait.

929
00:32:13,462 --> 00:32:18,066
All <i>we</i> have is
this kick-ass laser pointer.

930
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,166
Come on, baby.
Let's go find a pen.

931
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:25,371
Okay.

932
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,576
Oh, no.

933
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:31,078
Let me introduce myself.

934
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:33,080
I am--

935
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:34,715
Future Jack, obviously.

936
00:32:34,782 --> 00:32:36,315
Is that what we're wearing
in ten years?

937
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:38,017
More like 35 years.

938
00:32:38,085 --> 00:32:40,686
You're 87 years old?

939
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:42,421
My God, I'm outstanding.

940
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:44,123
I like to think so.

941
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,692
I've come all the way
from the future--

942
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,161
which is a lot harder
than coming from the past--

943
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:50,496
Whatever, pops.

944
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:52,764
To warn you not to listen
to the other Jacks.

945
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:55,667
In the future, you're happier
than you ever imagined.

946
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:59,904
You have grandchildren and a
gorgeous Polyblasian wife.

947
00:32:59,972 --> 00:33:03,407
That's a new race
that emerges in 2030.

948
00:33:03,475 --> 00:33:04,709
They're incredible.

949
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:06,978
- What happened to Avery?
- Oh, you'll see.

950
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:08,646
It's hilarious.

951
00:33:08,713 --> 00:33:11,849
Yeah, but what about his,
your, our career?

952
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,684
Don't we wanna be this dude?

953
00:33:13,752 --> 00:33:17,821
Younger me's, business
is only a part of life.

954
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:20,057
- Real happiness...
- Ah, shut up.

955
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,825
Don't listen to his crap, Jack.

956
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:25,094
If you choose my path,
you'll be plenty happy.

957
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:26,295
You'll spearhead GE's development

958
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:27,864
of the electric vagina.

959
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:29,666
You won't be married,
but you'll have a house

960
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,433
with a lot of glass, and it's cold.

961
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,536
And you'll own the Buffalo Bills.

962
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:35,638
You didn't say it was the Bills.

963
00:33:35,706 --> 00:33:36,873
Look, right now,

964
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:39,241
Liz Lemon is downstairs
about to sign a lease

965
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,408
with Dennis Duffy.

966
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,177
If she does that, you'll lose her.

967
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:43,879
In three years, they'll be married

968
00:33:43,946 --> 00:33:46,314
and living in Jacksonville, Florida,

969
00:33:46,382 --> 00:33:49,184
where he operates
an unlicensed alligator park.

970
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:50,351
Jacksonville?

971
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,320
Her hair can't handle that humidity.

972
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:54,756
No, I don't care.
I'm tired of saving her.

973
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,191
To quote Liz Lemon,
"Opposite!"

974
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:59,160
You'd be saving yourself.

975
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:01,328
The only way to get my life

976
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:04,264
is to be distracted
from your blind ambition,

977
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:06,000
and you can't do that

978
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:08,268
without Liz Lemon in your life.

979
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:10,204
Jack, this guy
is just trying to justify

980
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:11,471
his own bad choices.

981
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,106
Go down there and fire Liz.

982
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:21,715
Okay.

983
00:34:21,782 --> 00:34:22,949
We're obviously all thinking it,

984
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,184
so I'm just gonna say it.

985
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:26,352
We're gonna have sex
with each other, right?

986
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,954
- Yeah, we are.
- Oh, my!

987
00:34:29,022 --> 00:34:31,456
Lemon, don't sign that lease!

988
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:33,558
- Why are you here?
- Just sign it, dummy.

989
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:34,626
It's a receipt for some lez pants

990
00:34:34,694 --> 00:34:38,163
- you bought or whatever.
- No.

991
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:40,599
If you have a problem,
I will fight you, Dennis.

992
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,034
That wouldn't be very fair.

993
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:43,602
I'm only trained to fight
four or more men at a time.

994
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:44,902
There are three more of me upstairs,

995
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,070
and I'd be happy to go get them.

996
00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:47,238
I can't.
I hurt my wrist.

997
00:34:47,305 --> 00:34:48,305
Hey, people.

998
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:50,441
Somebody sabotaged the gas line.

999
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:52,676
People could've died or had fights.

1000
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:54,278
What?
Who would do that?

1001
00:34:54,346 --> 00:34:57,681
Hey, grab that black guy.

1002
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,682
It was you.

1003
00:34:58,751 --> 00:34:59,883
What are you, mad at me, Liz?

1004
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:01,584
Huh?
I did it for love.

1005
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:04,087
You're insane.

1006
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:05,555
Hey, hey, hey, guys.

1007
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:07,090
Hands off the jacket, all right?

1008
00:35:07,158 --> 00:35:09,226
It's from <i>Amar'e Stoudemire's</i>
eveningwear collection.

1009
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:10,961
If I ever see you again,
I'll kill you.

1010
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:13,329
Please.
You'll be back.

1011
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:15,232
All right, the gas is clearing out.

1012
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:16,665
It should be okay
in time for the show.

1013
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:17,867
According to my device here.

1014
00:35:17,934 --> 00:35:19,201
Good work, Jennifer.

1015
00:35:19,269 --> 00:35:21,070
Oh, my God, the show.
I gotta load in an audience.

1016
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:22,972
I gotta distribute scripts.

1017
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,241
I gotta change Jenna's blood.
I need Kenneth.

1018
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:26,541
Forget about Kenneth.

1019
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:28,677
I told Hank Cooper that
Tracy Jordan would be here.

1020
00:35:28,745 --> 00:35:30,079
Where is the star of your show?

1021
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:31,180
Right here.

1022
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,446
I know you're talking about Tracy,

1023
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:33,514
but I don't care.

1024
00:35:33,582 --> 00:35:36,151
Tracy and Kenneth went to the roof

1025
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,252
with a gun.

1026
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,253
Why?

1027
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,287
Because I gave Tracy the idea

1028
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:40,755
to kill the only man

1029
00:35:40,823 --> 00:35:42,123
who would ever have a baby with me.

1030
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,151
- Nothing to see here, Mr. man.
- No, sir.

1031
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,987
Hello, Kabletown family members.

1032
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:59,457
And my favorite actress, Jenna.

1033
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,158
When <i>TGS</i> gets cancelled, I mean if,

1034
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,694
when <i>TGS</i> gets cancelled,

1035
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,496
we need to talk about your future.

1036
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,663
I know what my future holds, Hank.

1037
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:07,664
Motherhood.

1038
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,999
It's a surprise to me,

1039
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,767
but I have so much love to give.

1040
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,935
Well, why couldn't you be a mother

1041
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,704
and do a daytime talk show?

1042
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,405
Well, because the talk show
will be my baby.

1043
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,974
I'm not gonna be held back
by some uterus turd.

1044
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,275
Let's call my agent.

1045
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,345
Oh, my God.
Your stomach.

1046
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,417
For some reason,

1047
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,285
I'm starting to rethink this, sir.

1048
00:36:30,353 --> 00:36:32,221
We all have doubt,
k-tel records.

1049
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:33,990
But we made a decision.

1050
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:35,791
And we'll look stupid
if we don't follow through.

1051
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:36,993
Okay.

1052
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,395
Just please tell my mother--

1053
00:36:40,462 --> 00:36:42,463
My bad.
That was an accident.

1054
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:44,900
Tracy, stop!

1055
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,135
Don't startle me
when I'm holding a gun.

1056
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:48,737
Use your head, Liz Lemon.

1057
00:36:48,804 --> 00:36:52,273
For God's sakes, Tracy,
give me that gun!

1058
00:36:52,341 --> 00:36:53,708
Ugh!

1059
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,075
Do you have any idea
how much paperwork

1060
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,844
I would have to do
if you shot Kenneth?

1061
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:59,246
I didn't know that, Jack.
I'm sorry.

1062
00:36:59,313 --> 00:37:03,517
I'm just trying to get people
to stop respecting me.

1063
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:06,420
Tracy, you want to destroy
the goodwill you have

1064
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:08,822
so you can go back
to your easy TV job?

1065
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,157
Yes, even more than
I want to shoot Kenneth.

1066
00:37:11,224 --> 00:37:12,725
Then all you have to do is go back

1067
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:14,193
to your easy TV job.

1068
00:37:14,261 --> 00:37:16,596
- What?
- Do TV.

1069
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:20,099
And no one will ever
take you seriously again.

1070
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:22,635
Doesn't matter how big
a movie star you are,

1071
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:24,003
even if you have the kind of career

1072
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:27,039
where you walked away
from a blockbuster franchise

1073
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:31,209
or worked with Meryl Streep
or Anthony Hopkins,

1074
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:33,912
made important movies
about things like civil rights

1075
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,881
or Pearl Harbor,

1076
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,883
stole films with supporting roles

1077
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:40,351
and then turned around and
blew them away on Broadway.

1078
00:37:40,419 --> 00:37:43,454
None of that will matter
once you do television.

1079
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:45,556
You could win every award in sight

1080
00:37:45,624 --> 00:37:48,459
and be the biggest thing
on the small screen,

1081
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:49,760
and you'll still get laughed

1082
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:53,064
out of the <i>Vanity Fair</i> Oscar party.

1083
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:55,600
by Greg Kinnear.

1084
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,969
Tracy, your career hit rock bottom

1085
00:37:58,036 --> 00:38:00,470
the first time
you decided to do <i>TGS.</i>

1086
00:38:00,537 --> 00:38:04,240
You want it to hit
rock bottom again?

1087
00:38:04,308 --> 00:38:05,642
Go on Network television.

1088
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,478
Let's make some TV!

1089
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:11,214
- Yeah.
- We have five minutes!

1090
00:38:13,283 --> 00:38:15,117
Whoa, whoa, uh-uh.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

1091
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:16,451
I'm sorry, folks.
While we were working

1092
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,220
on the gas line,
we somehow broke the elevator.

1093
00:38:18,287 --> 00:38:19,387
She's an old building.

1094
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:23,025
You're gonna have
to take the stairs.

1095
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,694
I'm okay!

1096
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,631
Least I made it
through my last day.

1097
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,105
Darn it.

1098
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:39,073
Excuse me.
The elevators are out.

1099
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:41,743
- Do you know how--
- Shut up, Garkle.

1100
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,279
Well, if it isn't Jack

1101
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:46,681
and Kenneth and Tracy and Liz.

1102
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:49,082
Hey, I have a bone to pick
with the four of you.

1103
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,186
Screw, Williams!

1104
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:53,487
Hey, get out of my home!

1105
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:55,356
Sorry, recurring hobos.

1106
00:38:58,426 --> 00:39:02,396
♪ ♪

1107
00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:04,130
I'm back, everybody.

1108
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:05,498
You're welcome...

1109
00:39:05,566 --> 00:39:08,000
For the adventure...

1110
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:10,803
My absence...

1111
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:12,172
Whew...

1112
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,173
Provided.

1113
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,541
30 seconds.

1114
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:16,176
Liz, I was checking the cue cards,

1115
00:39:16,243 --> 00:39:18,511
and we have a problem.

1116
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:20,179
It all seemed so funny
when they were writing it.

1117
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:22,514
During Dennis' gas leak.

1118
00:39:22,582 --> 00:39:24,816
Yes, this'll work.
Just flip the top of act two.

1119
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,918
Danny can't make the
wardrobe change that quick.

1120
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:28,720
Best show ever!
Yeah!

1121
00:39:31,057 --> 00:39:33,458
Guys, I don't know about this.

1122
00:39:33,526 --> 00:39:36,960
Oh, my God.
We don't have a show.

1123
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:44,168
- Ten seconds.
- Just start.

1124
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,312
I should call Dennis.

1125
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:03,386
Let's meet our contestants.

1126
00:40:03,454 --> 00:40:06,523
Dr. Steven Poop is
a homemaker and a centaur.

1127
00:40:09,158 --> 00:40:10,392
You did it.

1128
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,896
You're picked up
for a million more episodes.

1129
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:17,933
Where am I?

1130
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,402
Am I back in Vietnam?

1131
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,803
What charity are you playing for?

1132
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:23,904
The Grimace Foundation, Jeremy.

1133
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:26,905
Keeping milkshakes purple
for over a million years.

1134
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:27,874
Hold on.

1135
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:30,745
Tracy's back on TV again?

1136

00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:37,151
I know, disappointing.

1140
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:39,553
Take him off
the official A-list.

Well, I don't have the password.

This may be the gas talking,

but I was wrong about Dennis.
