1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,138
Hey.

2
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:05,320
Do you have a neck pillow? I blew mine
and Alex's smells like my mouth,

3
00:00:05,862 --> 00:00:08,188
I never sleep on planes.
I don't want to get incepted.

4
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:10,067
Are you going somewhere?

5
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:11,720
Carol has a flight
to Raleigh-Durham,

6
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:12,955
so I'm going with him,

7
00:00:13,023 --> 00:00:14,044
and we're gonna drive out
and spend a few days

8
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:15,153
at an inn at Nags Head.

9
00:00:15,177 --> 00:00:18,629
You're going to NagsHhead?
Isn't that redundant?

10
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:24,755
You're going to Nags Head?
Isn't that redundant?

11
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:31,635
You will hand me an envelope
predicting my joke about Nags Head.

12
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:33,034
That is solid.

13
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:36,268
Avery and I are also having a
little romantic weekend together

14
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:37,339
before the baby comes.

15
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:39,910
We're going to Toronto
for the G-8 economic summit.

16
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,068
It's going to be...

17
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:42,966
Very erotic.

18
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,888
Look at us, being all adult-y.

19
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,700
I packed underwear...
[Whispers] That isn't gray.

20
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:48,834
- [Gasps]
- Isn't it nice

21
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,146
dating someone you have so much
in common with?

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,816
Like you, Avery
is a type-"A" nut job.

23
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,584
And, of course,
you and Carol share

24
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:57,051
your trademark stubbornness.

25
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,836
We are not stubborn.
We're principled.

26
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,054
Have a nice trip, Lemon.

27
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:01,689
Break out those underpants,
but be careful.

28
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:04,342
Dating yourself
is a double-edged sword.

29
00:01:04,426 --> 00:01:06,694
It means you also
share the same flaws.

30
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:09,230
Well, that would only be
a problem if I had any flaws.

31
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:10,898
Not only is your fly open,

32
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:15,069
there's a pencil
sticking out of it.

33
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:17,205
Good day to you, sir.

34
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:32,151
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

35
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:41,379
Tracy, congratulations
on egot-ing.

36
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:44,916
You got an Emmy, a Grammy,
an Oscar, and a Tony.

37
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:48,853
You are more talented than I.

38
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,559
You're ready, mirror Jenna.

39
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,563
Tracy, congratulations on e...

40
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:00,398
The Empire State Building
will be lit

41
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:01,899
in the color of your choosing.

42
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,501
- Clear.
- Seaworld will now

43
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:05,737
let you borrow a killer whale
for spring break.

44
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:08,306
- I'll need a whale saddle.
- And Steven Spielberg

45
00:02:08,374 --> 00:02:10,075
wants you to star
in his next movie.

46
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,276
Kate Capshaw's husband?

47
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,712
[Sighs]

48
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:17,182
Tracy, congratulations.

49
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:19,083
I loved your acceptance speech.

50
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:22,420
Tracy Jordan asked me
to accept this on his behalf

51
00:02:22,488 --> 00:02:25,190
- because his mouth is full.
- [Muffled] Pop tarts!

52
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:27,925
So I guess you've
made it to "The Next Level."

53
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:29,828
I look forward to seeing
how this empowers you

54
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:31,129
to make my life more difficult.

55
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:32,831
As am I, Liz Lemon.

56
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:35,033
It'll probably involve
a guitar-playing chimpanzee

57
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,134
that I bought this morning.

58
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:37,469
- No.
- Uh, hold on.

59
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,804
Dotcom is confirming
that he drowned.

60
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,272
Oh.

61
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:43,174
Why are you putting me in a suit?

62
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:45,610
I still haven't memorized
my Torah passage.

63
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:47,979
Oh, you're going to a lunch
for the council on poverty.

64
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,614
And this afternoon,

65
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:51,616
you're speaking
at the Clinton Foundation.

66
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:52,967
Speaking?

67
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:54,669
That doesn't sound like me.
That sounds like work.

68
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,838
Yeah, well, the next level
isn't all fun.

69
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,456
Success is
a double-edged sword.

70
00:02:58,524 --> 00:02:59,924
You're actually respected now.

71
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,526
Like it or not,
people are gonna expect you

72
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:02,827
to use that power for good.

73
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,329
Come on, sir.
Arms.

74
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,234
There's a line, sir.

75
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:10,735
I realize you're more important

76
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,303
than everyone else on the flight,

77
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:14,038
what with those jet sweatpants.

78
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:15,407
Excuse me, young lady.

79
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:17,075
Are you old enough
to be traveling alone?

80
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:19,611
I don't know.
I'm going to visit my nana,

81
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:20,745
but I'm scared.

82
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,547
Ooh, wait.
That's too young.

83
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:25,884
Roger that.
Ugh, look at sweatpants guy.

84
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,985
This is a $90 million aircraft,

85
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:29,838
not a Tallahassee strip club.

86
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:32,724
Stewart,
21-18 that guy.

87
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,093
Excuse me,
Mr. Sweatpants.

88
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:37,328
We're gonna need
to check that bag.

89
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,665
And that is sky law.

90
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:47,939
Hey.

91
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:50,408
Going to Raleigh
for a business meeting.

92
00:03:50,476 --> 00:03:52,444
I'm a businessman.

93
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,112
I'm not an air marshal.

94
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,080
[Over P.A.]
Good afternoon, folks.

95
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,715
This is Captain Burnett
from the flight deck.

96
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:59,184
There's some traffic
on the runway.

97
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,585
Should be about a half hour,

98
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:02,187
then we'll have you on your way.

99
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:03,755
So sit back, relax,
enjoy your flight.

100
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:06,391
- Thanks for choosing Air Bike.
- The pilot is my boyfriend.

101
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,260
So if you have any questions
during the flight,

102
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:11,429
maybe I can...
There's a man on the wing.

103
00:04:11,497 --> 00:04:12,964
Oh.
[Chuckles]

104
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:16,434
We haven't taken off yet.
It's just a mechanic.

105
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:21,639
And this is
the prime minister's suite.

106
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:23,541
Oh, there it is...

107
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:25,410
The Metro Toronto
Convention Center,

108
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:29,881
site of the G-8 summit.

109
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,449
Let's do it on the balcony.

110
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,051
You might have to start
without me.

111
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:34,319
No problem.

112
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:35,904
Well, if you need
anything else...

113
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:37,906
- Ah!
- Oh, God, you're breaking

114
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,058
the extra bone all Canadians
have in their hands.

115
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,727
Oh, Jack!
I think the baby's coming.

116
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:45,079
What?
You're not due until March.

117
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,948
Why did I buy a beryllium mine

118
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:48,933
if her birthstone
isn't going to be aquamarine?

119
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,201
We need to get to the airport.

120
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,170
Airport? We need to get you
to a hospital.

121
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:55,106
No, we can't go to a hospital.
This is Canada!

122
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:57,625
- If she's born here...
- Good God.

123
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,877
She'll be Canadian.

124
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:00,545
At the risk
of sounding incredibly rude,

125
00:05:00,613 --> 00:05:02,714
I would beg your pardon
and ask you, in your opinion,

126
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:04,516
what's so bad
"aboot" being Canadian?

127
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,818
Your milk comes
in bags... Bags.

128
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,686
Your pavilion at Epcot
doesn't have a ride.

129
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:10,855
And if Canada
is so nice and friendly,

130
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:11,956
why does most of our meth

131
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,725
come from your Asian drug gangs?

132
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,527
[Gasps] Are we not
even making our own meth?

133
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:17,562
What is happening
to American manufacturing?

134
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,231
Take our things downstairs
and get us a car to the airport.

135
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,933
Oh, my God.
Jack...

136
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:24,135
If our child is born here,
she can't be presid...

137
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:25,537
Don't even say it.

138
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:29,140
We're having an American,
and she will be president,

139
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,142
no matter how ridiculous
that sentence sounds.

140
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,578
If only we were in Kenya
right now, we'd be fine.

141
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:35,113
[Both laughing]

142
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,514
[Gasps] Oh.

143
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:38,983
[Choking] If this
is helping you, I'm fine.

144
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:43,521
And in conclusion,
bless you, Tracy Jordan.

145
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:47,191
Your gripping portrayal
of D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda

146
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,361
in <i>Hard to Watch</i>
<i>has given a voice</i>

147
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,848
to the voiceless...
America's poor.

148
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,234
[Applause]

149
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:00,538
I'm not scared of you people.

150
00:06:00,606 --> 00:06:02,357
And I don't think those cashews

151
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:05,209
look like a bowl of baby penises.

152
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,178
[Sobbing] Being an egot is fun!

153
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:09,881
Here's to me
spending the rest of my life

154
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,549
in rooms like this.

155
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:13,585
[Applause]

156
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:15,920
[Baby crying]

157
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,890
[Sighs]

158
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,225
Didn't they say
half an hour over an hour ago?

159
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,994
[P.A. beeps]
Excuse me.

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,587
you could listen
to that conversation.

318
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:39,888
But continue.

319
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:42,424
Imagine if Mr. Hornberger
were in your shoes

320
00:12:42,492 --> 00:12:44,793
and he turned his back
on his community,

321
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:46,061
on the world.

322
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,063
How would he sleep at night?

323
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:51,700
How would he look
his children in the eye

324
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:54,403
or perform
his husband bedroom duties,

325
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,154
for instance
painting the bedroom?

326
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,206
Think about the shame.

327
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:00,042
He would be run out of town.

328
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:01,476
Al Sharpton would denounce him

329
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:03,145
at a press conference
on the street,

330
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,514
because Al Sharpton
doesn't have an office.

331
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,015
Exactly.

332
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,184
I thought going to the next
level would be amazing, Ken,

333
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,653
like guitar-playing
chimpanzee amazing.

334
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:13,588
God bless and keep him.

335
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,891
But now everybody expects me
to do all of this stuff,

336
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,661
and I don't want to let
anybody down, but I'm scared.

337
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:23,231
[Chuckles]

338
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,300
You don't know the meaning
of the word scared.

339
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,135
And I know, because
I've looked it up for you

340
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:31,206
a dozen times.
[Laughing]

341
00:13:31,274 --> 00:13:33,859
[Horn honking]

342
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,944
- Oh, thank God!
- Hop in!

343
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,579
No, no.
Don't go back there.

344
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:39,114
- You guys drive.
- What?

345
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:40,916
You drive while
we hide out in the back...

346
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,417
Hang out in the back.

347
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,919
Everything's normal.

348
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:45,554
No smoking.

349
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,889
Uh, y-yeah, okay.

350
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,424
Okay.

351
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:51,243
Thanks, honey.

352
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,966
Great.
I'm Lorne.

353
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:01,236
If you're a cop,
you have to tell me.

354
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:04,139
I'm just kidding.
We're all on vacation.

355
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:08,076
[Hissing, liquid bubbling]

356
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,512
Ah!

357
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,514
[Whispering]
Is this a mobile meth lab?

358
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:13,815
[Whispering] Yes, it is.

359
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:16,118
- Look, if you want to quit...
- Quit?

360
00:14:16,185 --> 00:14:17,619
I've never quit
anything in my life.

361
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,655
I'm still in Girl Scouts.
I have 9,000 badges.

362
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:23,492
Hey, I'm still looking for
a golf ball I shanked in 1987.

363
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,260
I am not taking that
penalty stroke.

364
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:26,862
Good.
We agree.

365
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:29,131
Now, let's drive
this bomb to Buffalo

366
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:30,432
and get this
little bitch out of me.

367
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:37,405
[Man crying]

368
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:48,683
- We've been offered a gate.
- What?

369
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:49,951
Well, what are
you doing back here?

370
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,319
- Come on, let's go!
- Oh, we'll go.

371
00:14:51,387 --> 00:14:53,588
We'll go back to the terminal
and the lounge

372
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:55,690
with the reclining chairs
and the turkey wraps.

373
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:58,593
[Stomach growling]
Turkey wraps.

374
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,795
And we'll forget
any of this ever happened,

375
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,464
like the fact
that you insulted me

376
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:04,799
in front of my entire crew,
especially Stewart,

377
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:06,968
who often makes up
hurtful nicknames for me,

378
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,454
- like "Mr. Bumpy Landing."
- Great.

379
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,907
And I'll forget the fact that
you treated us like animals.

380
00:15:11,974 --> 00:15:13,575
Oh, well, I've already forgotten

381
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,210
that you said
I was bad at my job,

382
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,146
when everything <i>TGS</i>
<i>has been so great recently.</i>

383
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:21,550
Austin Powers on <i>Crossfire...</i>
<i>Timely stuff.</i>

384
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:23,001
Uh-huh.
And I'm not even gonna ask

385
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,253
what the hell that voice
is that you use on the intercom.

386
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:28,223
[Mockingly] "Uh, folks, half
an hour means forever, uhhhh."

387
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,474
[Laughing]

388
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,509
Can I tell you
what I hate about you?

389
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,062
You're so stubborn
when you think you're right,

390
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,232
even when the answer is
on the trivial pursuit card.

391
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,985
The card was wrong.
And you're no better, Carol.

392
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,304
You built that bookshelf
incorrectly!

393
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:44,372
I did not!
I wanted the books to slide off.

394
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,358
Okay, listen, Liz...

395
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:47,842
We will get through this

396
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,346
if, for once,
you can just let it go.

397
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:53,315
I will take us back to the gate

398
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:57,118
when you stand up in front
of my crew and my passengers

399
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:58,553
and admit that you were wrong.

400
00:15:58,621 --> 00:16:00,188
- What?
- Admit that I,

401
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:02,857
as captain of this vessel,
was in the right.

402
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,559
You were wrong to question me,

403
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:05,961
and I was correct in my treatment

404
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:07,696
of you and your fellow animals.

405
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:09,931
I'd rather die on this plane.

406
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,000
That can be arranged.

407
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:23,312
Um, you saw the back of the winny.

408
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,142
You know we picked you up
to get past border control.

409
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:26,344
So what are you guys carrying?

410
00:16:26,411 --> 00:16:28,212
- I'm sorry?
- In her fake stomach......

411
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,147
You smuggling
unpasteurized cheese,

412
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:31,515
prescription drugs,

413
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,584
maple syrup from the sacred tree
of souls in Winnipeg?

414
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:35,786
No.
She's pregnant.

415
00:16:35,854 --> 00:16:37,888
What? Those contractions
she's been having are real?

416
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,423
Because they sound
very sitcom-y.

417
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:43,027
Ughhh, zoinks!

418
00:16:43,095 --> 00:16:44,829
What is taking so long?

419
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,631
You guys should be in a hospital,

420
00:16:46,698 --> 00:16:48,666
not driving to Buffalo
in a snowstorm.

421
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,268
Thank you for your input, Lorne,

422
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,870
but Avery and I want our
daughter to be born in America,

423
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:54,672
so she can one day become
president

424
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,508
and declare war on Germany,
like back when we were awesome.

425
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:59,310
You know, you remind me
of my parents.

426
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:00,845
I find that very hard to believe.

427
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,513
They were both really intense.

428
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:04,849
They wanted me to grow up
to be prime minister,

429
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,151
so as a kid,
I had to win the spelling bee.

430
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:08,386
They made me memorize

431
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:10,688
all 700 words
in the Canadian dictionary.

432
00:17:10,756 --> 00:17:12,223
And then I had
to go to Law School.

433
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,492
- You went to Law School?
- For one day.

434
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,861
I was just so tightly wound
that I got kicked out

435
00:17:16,928 --> 00:17:18,229
for karate chopping my roommate.

436
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:20,898
I know. [Chuckles]
I'm a stereotype...

437
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:22,900
All guys from Quebec
are good at karate.

438
00:17:22,968 --> 00:17:25,002
God.

439
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,437
Oh, my God, where are my manners?

440
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,372
Do you want to try meth?

441
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,007
- What are you doing?
- I'm quitting.

442
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:32,209
I'm calling 911
and getting an ambulance

443
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:33,744
to take us
to the nearest hospital.

444
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:35,579
Actually, you dial 272 here.

445
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:37,081
I will not do that.

446
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,035
Kenworth, I was thinking
about what you said,

447
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,253
and you're right.

448
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,155
I'm Oscar-winner Tracy Jordan.

449
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:45,656
And as scary as it is,

450
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:47,658
I have a responsibility
to fix the world,

451
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,660
starting
with the worst place ever.

452
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:50,928
Ikea on a Saturday?

453
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:53,064
Africa.
I leave today.

454
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,032
Good-bye.

455
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,267
[Startled shout]

[Soft beeping]

458
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:03,774
[On P.A.] Well, folks,
from the flight deck,

459
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,409
it looks like it's gonna be
about another half hour,

460
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:08,029
and then we'll be on our way.
Uhhhhhh...

461
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:09,747
I have an announcement.

462
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,515
Our pilot has gone insane.
[Soft beeping]

463
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,284
[On P.A.] No, don't listen
to her. Don't...

464
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:15,386
Having seen <i>Crimson Tide</i>
<i>on Showtime last weekend,</i>

465
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,188
I believe the only course
of action available to us

466
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,322
is passenger mutiny.

467
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,423
I am Denzel.

468
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:21,125
[On P.A.]
I am invoking sky law.

469
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:23,461
You are now silenced,
shrieking harpy.

470
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:24,995
Stop speaking.

471
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:26,881
We could've gone back to
a gate, and he wouldn't take us!

472
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:28,899
[All grumbling]
Do not blame me.

473
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:32,203
I wouldn't take us, because she
wouldn't admit to being wrong

474
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,904
for challenging my authority.

475
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:35,973
Why not?
What's wrong with you?

476
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,475
I am right, and he knows it.

477
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,009
He could've given us food...

478
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:41,011
Maybe this is one
of those times when both of you

479
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,813
just say, on the count
of three, "I was wrong."

480
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,432
Both: One, two, three.
Never!

481
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:47,251
How are you two dating?
You're too similar!

482
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:50,821
Where are you going?

483
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:52,123
I am pulling
the emergency exit slide,

484
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,091
and we are all getting off
of this plane!

485
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,593
I'll be a folk hero,

486
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,294
like that guy
everybody hates now.

487
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:59,997
Don't you even think about it!
That is a federal offense!

488
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:01,265
Just try to stop me.

489
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,100
Oh, you be careful
what you wish for.

490
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,302
[All scream]

491
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,971
I will waste you!

492
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,741
You'll have to go through
this old bastard first!

493
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:13,144
[Choking]

494
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:22,353
Soren, Eglantine,

495
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,789
your journey is at an end.

496
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:26,757
Sorry.

497
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,728
I hope we can still be friends.

498
00:19:32,898 --> 00:19:36,867
[Cell phone vibrating]

499
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:39,603
- Hello?
- Lemon, we had the baby.

500
00:19:39,671 --> 00:19:41,672
- We? We?
- Shh, you need your rest.

501
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,041
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

502
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:45,843
Wait.
Aren't you in Canada?

503
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,878
Yes, my daughter
is Canadian-American,

504
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:50,714
but I'm going to treat her
just like a human baby.

505
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:53,050
We tried to get back home,
Lemon, in a meth lab.

506
00:19:53,118 --> 00:19:54,885
Avery and I fed
each other's craziness,

507
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,720
but one of us was brave enough
to step back and...

508
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:59,123
- Just quit. He quit.
- Didn't they give you Percocet?

509
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,358
That's what it takes.

510
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:04,195
Somebody needs
to be willing to quit.

511
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:06,430
I hope you and Avery can make it,

512
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,649
because you have
a whole lifetime ahead of you

513
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:11,469
of that double-edged sword
just swinging around

514
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:13,204
trying to cut your faces off.

515
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:14,371
Thank you, Lemon.

516
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,207
This was supposed to be
a joyous occasion.

517
00:20:16,274 --> 00:20:17,575
I'm glad I called.

518
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:20,377
I'm sorry. Your daughter
is a very lucky girl.

519
00:20:21,546 --> 00:20:23,314
- Carol and I have...
- Jack.

520
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:24,849
- What?
- This woman's trying to tell me

521
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,667
that we don't have to pay
for any of this.

522
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,319
Right. The Canadian
health-care system...

523
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:29,687
Oh, no, you don't.

524
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,423
We will not be party
to this socialist perversion.

525
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:33,858
You will take our money.

526
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,826
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't do that.

527
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:37,294
Oh, this is gonna be good.

528
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,214
- Avery, can you walk yet?
- I am right behind you, Jack.

529
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:43,200
Let's go find a Canadian
who will take our money.

530
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,214
- How's Africa, sir?
- It's amazing.

531
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:49,032
This morning I taught
the local schoolchildren

532
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,600
all the words to <i>Monster Mash.</i>

533
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:53,236
So when do you
think you'll be coming back?

534
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:55,695
<i>TGS</i> has a show in a couple weeks.

535
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,878
Don't you get it?
This is bigger than all that.

536
00:20:57,998 --> 00:21:00,602
Like how an egg is much bigger
than a smaller bug.

537
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:02,680
Well, that's another way to say that sir...

538
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,687
I have to go.

539
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,656
This was a really good decision.

540
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:06,925
Good bye, Kenneth.
