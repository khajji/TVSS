She's asleep.

6
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:19,158
Hey, it's mommy!

7
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:21,060
- I'm in Beijing!
- Shh.

8
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:23,229
- Liddy just went to sleep.
- Well, wake here up, Jack.

9
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:25,264
She needs to hear
her mommy's voice.

10
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:27,200
No, when she's ready,
Dr. Kevorkian says

11
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:28,539
we have to put her down.

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,774
He's a very good pediatrician,

13
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:30,942
but that is
an unfortunate name.

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,610
Oh, come on,
she'll fall back asleep.

15
00:00:32,678 --> 00:00:33,945
No. Call back tomorrow.

16
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,847
She has babynomics at 11:00.

17
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:37,581
Liddy! It's your mother!

18
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,052
Imprinting! Imprinting!

19
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:45,890
God, Tracy could have
cleaned up before he left.

20
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:48,860
And why did he leave
all this soda here?

21
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,528
What are you doing?
That's his urine.

22
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:52,697
He is not well.

23
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:55,533
Someday this place is gonna be
a kickass duplex,

24
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,784
like on <i>Different Strokes.</i>

25
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:58,936
Conrad bain once slapped me
in a men's room.

26
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:00,705
I've just gotta get rid
of all these boxes.

27
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:02,907
I don't even know
what this stuff is anymore.

28
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:09,280
<i>Comence a estudiar </i>these,
but then <i>yo</i> gave up.

29
00:01:09,348 --> 00:01:11,916
Here's the novel
I never finished.

30
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:13,851
Hmm...

31
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:17,622
"Liz stabbed Jenna
repeatedly."

32
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:18,923
<i>The Secret?</i>

33
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:20,224
I gave you this
five years ago.

34
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:21,959
- You still haven't read it?
- Ehh...

35
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:24,462
It works, Liz.
Look at me.

36
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,230
Ever since I started
secreting,

37
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:29,067
I've become a TV star,
I found my soul mate,

38
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:31,936
you saw how flat Gwyneth Paltrow
sang at the oscars...

39
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:34,372
I visualized all of that.

40
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,207
Jenna, the only way
to make things happen

41
00:01:36,275 --> 00:01:38,309
in the real world
is by taking action.

42
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:39,577
Oh, I've taken action.

43
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:42,246
It dries your mouth out,
but the sex is amazing.

44
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:44,415
No, I'm talking about
taking control.

45
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,584
Like I do every day at work.

46
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:48,486
I found Tracy,
I saved the show.

47
00:01:48,554 --> 00:01:51,255
I always think of a third
thing when I'm listing stuff.

48
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:52,924
If taking control
is so great,

49
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:55,293
then how do you explain
your personal life?

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,261
I mean, look at the post-it
note on your sweater.

51
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,432
Oh, boy.

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,035
You're right.

53
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:05,236
I just have to care
about myself

54
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,038
as much as I care
about work.

55
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,106
Starting right now.

56
00:02:08,173 --> 00:02:09,574
I'm gonna clean this apartment

57
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,559
while I learn Spanish.

58
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:13,511
Last year, I used <i>The Secret</i>
to learn Spanish,

59
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:14,946
and now I'm fluent.

60
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:16,280
Rosa,

61
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:18,216
I know you stole
my necklace.

62
00:02:18,283 --> 00:02:21,052
I'll have your son deported.

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,222
Oh, wait,
I found my necklace.

64
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,723
Oh, boy.

65
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:36,734
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font> | <font color="#FF8C00">Corrected by Alice</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

66
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,576
Great news, Jack.

67
00:02:45,644 --> 00:02:48,513
I've got a new life philosophy
that I call <i>Lizbeanism.</i>

68
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,731
I see. And how did you
come up with that name?

69
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:52,283
Well, I'm Liz,
and obviously,

70
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,852
my philosophy is simple,
like a bean.

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,554
I'm fixing problems
in my personal life

72
00:02:56,622 --> 00:02:58,289
the same way
I fix problems at work.

73
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:01,325
I saved the show,
now I'm gonna save me!

74
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:04,996
Because lizbeanism means
that I am a dyke...

75
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:07,632
against the rising waters
of mediocrity.

76
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,834
- Good for you, Lemon.
- Check this out, Jack.

77
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:12,153
Tile samples.
First, I redo the bathroom,

78
00:03:12,237 --> 00:03:15,490
then I redo the whole apartment,
and then the world.

79
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:18,442
I'm impressed, Lemon.
You're talking like a winner.

80
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,845
I'm going to give you...

81
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,883
One of my neckties.

82
00:03:29,288 --> 00:03:30,788
This is a big moment for me.

83
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:32,423
You're taking control
of your destiny.

84
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:34,058
No matter how strait
the gate

85
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:35,993
or charged with punishments
the scroll,

86
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:38,129
I am the master of my fate,

87
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,965
I am the captain of my soul.

88
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,400
That's from <i>Invictus!</i>

89
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,001
Wait, who was the white guy
in that?

90
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:46,821
Maybe someday
you'll be like me,

91
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:48,606
running a billion-dollar
corporation,

92
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:50,358
having people pay you
for the privilege

93
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:52,743
of cutting your hair...
raising a child.

94
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,545
<i>You're</i> raising a child?
Come on.

95
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:56,047
I think Avery is probably
doing that.

96
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,748
Not really. Avery's been
traveling a lot

97
00:03:57,816 --> 00:04:01,419
as part of NBC news' hot blondes
in weird places initiative.

98
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:03,154
So she's been out
of the baby loop

99
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:04,889
until Liddy is sleep-trained.

100
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:06,156
Frankly, it might be easier

101
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,175
if Avery stays in Asia.

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,493
Be careful
what you wish for.

103
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,462
According to <i>The Secret</i>,
it'll come true.

104
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:14,232
I wish Liz Lemon would leave
so I could go back to work.

105
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,051
Oh... oh...
What's pulling me?

106
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,403
I want to stay here
and keep boring Jack!

107
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:21,305
Oh, okay.

108
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:23,641
I really fell.
I need help.

109
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:26,310
Tracy, welcome back.

110
00:04:26,378 --> 00:04:27,778
I think I speak
for all of us

111
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,113
when I say how thrilled--

112
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,849
Great impression of a guy
that sucks, dotcom.

113
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:34,852
Look, we got a lot of work
to catch up on.

114
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,571
Yes, sir.
It just feels so good

115
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:39,490
to have the three musketeers and
dotcom back together again.

116
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:40,691
Ooh. Whoops.

117
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,293
Smooth move, Ferguson.

118
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:46,330
What are you laughing about?

119
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:47,665
Oh, nothing, sir.

120
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,834
Just an inside joke
from when you were gone.

121
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:51,168
You kinda needed
to be there.

122
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:52,470
No, no, no, no, no.
No.

123
00:04:52,537 --> 00:04:55,039
You three are not allowed
to have inside jokes

124
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,540
that I'm not a part of.

125
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:59,176
I can have inside jokes
that you're not a part of.

126
00:04:59,244 --> 00:05:01,646
For example, "hot feet."

127
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:05,116
Or, "ask Melissa about it."

128
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:06,617
But my entourage serves <i>me.</i>

129
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:10,071
And "smooth move, Ferguson"
is not funny to me.

130
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:12,990
So it id forbidden.
Understand?

131
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:16,360
Next order of business,
Grizz's DVD reviews

132
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:17,962
for this weekend.

133
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,032
You wouldn't expect a movie
called <i>Somewhere</i>

134
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,434
to go absolutely nowhere.

What's that?

144
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:51,946
Tony, there's a bag
in that tree,

145
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,148
and it's right outside
the window

146
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:56,300
of my soon-to-be-perfect-life
apartment.

147
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:58,953
If you're not in the building,
I don't have to talk to you.

148
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:00,705
Trees are city property.

149
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:01,939
You have to take it up
with City Hall.

150
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:04,859
That's your mother, Liddy.

151
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:06,744
Say hello.

152
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:09,146
Who's ready for Skype sex?

153
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,300
- No, this is the Liddy call.
- What I can't see?

154
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,386
You people have
too much money.

155
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:17,588
Hi, Sherry!

156
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:20,424
I don't know why our daughter
would be afraid of Reagan.

157
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:21,859
Are you accusing me
of not doing

158
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:22,993
enough Reagan time with her?

159
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,129
No, of course not.

160
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:28,065
Listen, news wants me
to extend the trip.

161
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:31,302
But I can get out of it
if you need me there to help.

162
00:06:34,005 --> 00:06:37,441
No. You stay.

163
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:40,111
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

164
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:42,213
Bring back some
throwing stars for Liddy.

165
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,447
I will.

166
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:46,450
And thank you for being
the best husband ever.

167
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:51,322
Hey, do you want to watch me
eat jelly beans...

168
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,491
Real slow?

169
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:54,992
Yes.

170
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:00,931
Smooth move, Ferguson.

171
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:02,133
I knew it!

172
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,801
I knew you were saying that
behind my back.

173
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:06,837
- How long were you in there?
- I knew you wouldn't stop!

174
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:09,690
And now your failure leaves us
with only one option.

175
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:13,511
Explain to me why "smooth
move, Ferguson" is funny!

176
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:17,915
Well, while you were away,
we ordered Mexican food.

177
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,717
And the delivery guy
tripped,

178
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:26,157
and then mister Griswald
said, "smooth move, Ferguson."

179
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,292
That story is not funny!

180
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,327
Sir, you had to be there.

181
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,862
Then I will be.

182
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,964
We are going to recreate
all the events

183
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,933
surrounding
"smooth move, Ferguson"

184
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,935
exactly as they occurred.

185
00:07:38,003 --> 00:07:40,037
Maybe then we can
get on with our lives.

186
00:07:40,105 --> 00:07:42,206
Let's get to work.

187
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:50,147
Jonathan, what is going on?

188
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:51,849
Sir, you need to see this.

189
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,317
Even if it ruins
whatever you had planned

190
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:55,102
for Secretary's Day,
like a poem you wrote for me,

191
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:57,721
or whatever.

192
00:07:57,773 --> 00:07:59,774
We go now
to a pre-taped statement

193
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:02,777
from super-crazy
Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il.

194
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,131
People of North Korea,

195
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,033
it is your dear leader,
Kim Jong-Il,

196
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:11,702
world's greatest golfer
and movie director,

197
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,240
and best man
at Tom Brady's wedding.

198
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:18,375
As we all know,

199
00:08:18,426 --> 00:08:20,845
the decadent Western
journalist spy Laura Ling

200
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:24,281
left us because she can't
party as hard as we can.

201
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:28,419
- I know, right?
- I know, right?

202
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,587
But now, another
American reporter

203
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,357
has come to North Korea
because it's awesome,

204
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:35,476
and we have enough food.

205
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,895
Avery Jessup.

206
00:08:37,963 --> 00:08:41,615
Her name is Avery Jessup,
and like me,

207
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
her hair is blonde.

208
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,038
One of our own,
NBC's Avery Jessup Donaghy,

209
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,406
detained in North Korea.

210
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,342
More on that as it develops.

211
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:52,943
But first,
it's never too early

212
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:54,979
to plan your dog's
Halloween costume.

213
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,414
I told her to stay.
I didn't want her at home.

214
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,116
This is my fault.

215
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:01,385
Sir, if you say
one more syllable,

216
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,954
that's a haiku.
Leave.

217
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:10,511
I'm not afraid of
you, City Hall.

218
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:12,705
Let's do this.

219
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:25,318
Don't go in there!
Run, citizen!

220
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:34,461
Look, Boehner,
we're all upset.

221
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:35,495
I mean it's my wife!

222
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:37,431
John, stop crying.

223
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:39,433
I--I can't understand you!

224
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,834
- I said he's busy!
- Busy, Jonathan?

225
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,169
I've got a bag stuck
in a tree.

226
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,471
Jack, I have a bag stuck in a
tree outside my apartment,

227
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,772
and I can't get it down.

228
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,641
And I don't know why
it's making me so crazy.

229
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,576
Yes, you do.
You said it yourself.

230
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,678
It's not just about a bag
or a view.

231
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,079
It's about taking charge
of your life

232
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:54,247
and solving problems.

233
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:56,616
I'm facing a similar
situation myself.

234
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:58,118
Lay it on me.
Two-way street.

235
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:00,387
Avery has been kidnapped
by Kim Jong-Il.

236
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,305
What? Why?
Is she a spy?

237
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,057
Oh, my God,
I already know too much!

238
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:06,626
Kim Jong-Il runs
a vast propaganda machine.

239
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:08,628
Evidently, his latest
insane idea

240
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:09,896
is to bring in
a Western journalist

241
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:11,965
to report on how
the free world

242
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,167
is being conquered
by North Korea.

243
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:19,039
And in food news, you've
had enough to eat today.

244
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:21,808
Now here with the weather
is Johnny Mountain.

245
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:24,311
North Korea,
everything sunny all the time.

246
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:26,580
Always good-time
beach party.

247
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,048
Back to you, Avery.

248
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:31,334
You have to call
president Clinton.

249
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,353
He got Lisa Ling's sister
out of North Korea.

250
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:35,388
President Inter-Bush
is out of the question.

251
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:36,823
Avery will never accept
his help.

252
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:38,792
She can't forgive him
for not hitting on her

253
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,494
during the 1996
Democratic convention.

254
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:42,095
- She's much too thin.
- I do, of course,

255
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:46,166
still have some connections,
but my best bet is fraught.

256
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:48,668
I never should have broken up
with Condi via text message.

257
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:51,104
You broke up with
Condoleezza Rice by text?

258
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,173
Me plus you equals
frowny face.

259
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,642
- Yeah, you can't call her.
- I know.

260
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,444
But I am going
to solve this.

261
00:10:57,512 --> 00:11:00,046
Just like you are going to
solve your equally important

262
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:02,616
bag in a tree situation.

263
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:04,384
<i>Invictus,</i> Lemon.

264
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,255
Now that I've killed
that bug,

265
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,557
I'd like to call this
"smooth move, Ferguson"

266
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,425
recreation meeting to order.

267
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:13,693
Kenneth, report.

268
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:16,563
Well, sir, we've got
the delivery guy booked,

269
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:18,498
but I've run into
some big problems.

270
00:11:18,566 --> 00:11:20,800
For example,
it was raining that day.

271
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:22,219
Get a rain machine.

272
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,937
Look, here,
take my credit card,

273
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:26,890
use it to break into
a special effects warehouse

274
00:11:26,974 --> 00:11:28,308
to steal one.

275
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,343
Well, sir,
even if we did that,

276
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:31,811
there are some things
we can't control.

277
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,197
We don't remember
what we were wearing.

278
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:35,515
Dotcom was sick.

279
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,850
Security footage.

280
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,785
Dotcom licks
the subway steps.

281
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:41,087
These are solvable problems!

282
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,240
Well, what about this?

283
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:45,825
Miss Maroney was here
screaming at Mr. Rossitano.

284
00:11:45,877 --> 00:11:48,328
Later that day,
she got her hair cut.

285
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:49,829
Aw, thank you.

286
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:53,500
The point is,
her hair was longer then.

287
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:56,269
J-Mo, how long would it take
for your hair to grow back?

288
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:58,138
It depends. Do you have access
to horse semen?

289
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,140
- You know I do.
- Give me three weeks.

290
00:12:00,207 --> 00:12:01,808
Then we'll reconvene
in three weeks.

291
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:02,875
Meeting is adjourned.

292
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:05,345
Oh, my God,
what happened to my bug?

293
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:10,817
Stupid grappling hook!

294
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:14,104
Can't catch one little bag?

295
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:21,695
You think I'm giving up?

296
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,330
Did I give up
when that squirrel

297
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,098
I trained to retrieve you
just ran away?

298
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,100
You will not win,
Mr. bag.

299
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:28,868
But, Liz, I already have.

300
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,003
What did you say?

301
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,371
Jack's wrong.

302
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:34,140
No human is truly
the master of his fate.

303
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,928
Even your dream apartment
can't protect you from death.

304
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:40,113
I'm not ruining your view.

305
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,849
I'm reminding you
of your mortality.

306
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,386
'Cause you know I'll be here
long after you're gone,

307
00:12:46,437 --> 00:12:48,989
the wind rustling
against my genitals.

308
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,090
That's right,
bags have genitals.

309
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:52,559
You don't know me.

310
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,093
Go ahead,
buy nesting tables.

311
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,996
Paint an accent wall.

312
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:58,898
I'll watch the EMTs
take you out in my cousin,

313
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,534
a body bag.

314
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:09,776
K-9, operation Ferguson
status report.

315
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:13,813
Rain, check.
Room temperature, check.

316
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:15,915
Miss Maroney's hair length,
check.

317
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,450
Do you like it?

318
00:13:17,518 --> 00:13:19,285
If you say no,
I'll drown myself.

319
00:13:19,353 --> 00:13:21,121
Mr. griswald,
could you put the TV

320
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,289
on the right channel--
MSNBC.

321
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:26,292
Was dotcom standing
that gay?

322
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,061
No, sir, he was not.

323
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:30,063
Today denying reports
that Jessup Donaghy

324
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:32,182
is anchoring a fake
Western news channel,

325
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,234
calling the accusations,
quote,

326
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,653
"as ridiculous as the dunk
Kim Jong-Il won

327
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:38,471
the NBA dunk contest with."

328
00:13:38,539 --> 00:13:40,807
Hey, what's my boy KJ
doing on TV?

329
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:42,876
What?
That's Kim Jong-Il.

330
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,477
Yeah.
We did a movie together

331
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,312
that he directed
and co-starred in.

332
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,086
Death to the CIA!

333
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:56,823
Let us all increase production
of millet and sunflowers!

334
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,459
I defuse bomb,
black partner.

335
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:00,760
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby!

336
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:06,499
Dude, I think you did
a North Korean propaganda film.

337
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,468
It was either that
or playing a rapping doorman

338
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:09,719
in a Kate Hudson movie.

339
00:14:09,804 --> 00:14:10,937
Oh, okay.

340
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:14,224
Oh, he's coming.
Places, everyone.

341
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:23,216
Smooth move, Ferguson.

342
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,094
I get it now!
That was so funny!

343
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:37,247
Everyone laugh.

344
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,798
Now, you sons of bitches!

345
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,043
Tracy, it's come
to my attention

346
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,745
that you know
Kim Jong-Il.

347
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:53,430
And obviously,
I'm concerned about my wife,

348
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,615
and I want to know
what she's going through.

349
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:58,318
Please, hold nothing back.

350
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:01,521
Okay, but you might not like
what I have to tell you.

351
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,326
Kim Jong-Il sometimes shoots
in a close-up too much.

352
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,027
Comedy lives in a wide shot.

353
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:11,631
And also--
this is gonna be rough--

354
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,534
his acting notes
are often vague.

355
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,303
Okay. Thank you.

356
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,372
What is this?

357
00:15:19,423 --> 00:15:20,790
My God!

358
00:15:20,858 --> 00:15:23,209
They're letting her speak.

359
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,879
For the past three weeks,
I have been honored to partake

360
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,448
in a political
re-education regimen.

361
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:31,918
I have voluntarily taken
several floggings

362
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:33,787
for being an arrogant
American...

363
00:15:33,854 --> 00:15:35,288
That's okay.
She's tough.

364
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:39,159
We do a lot of pirate-themed
sexual role playing.

365
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm a parrot.

366
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:42,445
Also, I spend
eight hours a day

367
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,980
breaking concrete blocks

368
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,965
to learn to be
an obedient worker...

369
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,734
No problem.
She pays $1,000 an hour

370
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:49,135
to do that with a trainer.

371
00:15:49,203 --> 00:15:52,222
And I have concluded
that capitalism may be flawed.

372
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:55,375
My God!

373
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:57,510
What are those monsters
doing to her?

374
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,677
Doctor Rice...

375
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:05,065
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

376
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:06,597
Hello, Condi.
You're looking well.

377
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,232
You know, I've been
to the DMZ.

378
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,634
They have signs.
Can your wife not read?

379
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:13,437
- Okay, we're all adults here.
- So what is it?

380
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,072
Is she funnier than I am?

381
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,708
She's certainly not
younger, is she?

382
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,643
Condi, we are not
doing this.

383
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,345
Oh, we are doing this!

384
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,864
I'm sorry that
I broke up with you by text.

385
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:26,851
I'm sorry I went drinking
with Karl Rove...

386
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,352
on Valentine's day.

387
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,988
I'm sorry that I said
your favorite movie was lame.

388
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,090
<i>Mars Attacks!</i> is awesome!

389
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,593
Now admit that I'm better
at the piano

390
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,895
- than you are at the flute.
- Never.

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,664
I'll see what
I can do, Jack.

398
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:15,800
Now get out of here
before this gets weird.

399
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:20,871
You're the turkey.

400
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,792
Know what, Mr. bag?

401
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,428
I <i>will</i> have a nice day!

402
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,146
I'm gonna hang you
in my kitchen

403
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,132
and fill you with other bags.

404
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,884
You will eat your family!

405
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,686
Hey, that's city property.
Put the saw down.

406
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,588
- No, I almost got him.
- Right now!

407
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,356
Don't think I won't
taser you, all right?

408
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:41,258
I've got OCD, and I love
doing paperwork.

409
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,285
Aah, it was worth it!

410
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,974
Avery?

411
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,626
Jack!
Oh, thank God!

412
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,110
I forgot the U.S.
country code,

413
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:01,745
but then I remembered
it's number one.

414
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:03,314
How are you calling me?

415
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:04,648
Nobody has ever seen
an iPhone.

416
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,133
I told them it was my razor.

417
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,918
I have to shave my legs with it,
but they have an app for that.

418
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,621
Oh, Avery, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

419
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,122
I told you to stay.

420
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,858
No, this is nobody's fault.

421
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:15,426
Except maybe that pansy
Harry Truman

422
00:18:15,477 --> 00:18:16,460
for not taking down
this country

423
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,095
- when he had the chance.
- Truman!

424
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,630
Look, my battery's dying,

425
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,098
and the outlets here
are shaped weird.

426
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,833
And I don't think they have any
electricity in them anyway.

427
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,768
So I don't want you
to worry about me.

428
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:26,203
They actually love me here.

429
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,138
I already won
a North Korean Emmy.

430
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:29,540
So if I don't ever
make it home...

431
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,808
Avery, don't say that.

432
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,210
I spoke...
To Condoleezza.

433
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,712
Really?

434
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,280
Did you also call Sally Ride
and her sister?

435
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,648
Come on, Avery, not now.

436
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,617
I am going to
get you out of there.

437
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,418
You are married
to Jack Donaghy, damn it,

438
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:42,686
and the world doesn't get
to do this to us!

439
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,155
We control our fates!
We are in charge!

440
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:48,225
Avery?
Are you still there?

441
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,398
I'm sure her battery died right
after I finished that speech.

442
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,432
Just like I wanted it to.

443
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,851
Smooth move, Ferguson!
Ha ha ha!

444
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,054
- Smooth move, Ferguson.
- Mr. Jordan,

445
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:02,189
please let it go.
It's just a joke

446
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,275
it's not about the joke.

447
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,860
It's about what the joke
represents, you monsters!

448
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,312
What do you mean, sir?

449
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:10,481
I came back,
and you were fine without me.

450
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,182
You laughed without me!

451
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,984
And that was
our special thing!

452
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,187
But no, you thought
smooth move, Ferguson,

453
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,722
was so hilarious!

454
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,575
It wasn't.
It wasn't funny!

455
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,193
There, are you happy?

456
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:25,362
You just dropped a bomb, K.
Continue.

457
00:19:25,413 --> 00:19:27,665
We were miserable
without you, sir.

458
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:31,335
"Smooth move, Ferguson"
was trying to fill a void

459
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,220
because Mr. Slattery's
political cartoons

460
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,371
weren't cutting it.

461
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,923
I can't draw hands.

462
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:38,242
You're the one
who makes us laugh.

463
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,177
Never go away again.

464
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,249
Don't ever tell me
what to do!

465
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:49,436
Quad hug, me in the middle!

466
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,288
Also, due to
a paperwork mix-up,

467
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,791
you will not be
getting paid this month.

468
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,195
I did it, Jack.
I got the bag.

469
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:59,997
You were right.
No matter how much

470
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,532
the gate is strait,

471
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,434
or who punishes the scrolls,

472
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:07,404
I am the captain
of my holes, or whatever.

473
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,239
We are in control!

474
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,175
No, we aren't.
I was wrong.

475
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:15,946
Condi tried, but Avery
plus freedom equals...

476
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,114
Frowny face.

477
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,917
I'm sorry, what's happening?

478
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,787
They're never going
to let her go.

479
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,558
Avery is now married
to Kim Jong-Il's son...

480
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,792
Kim Jong-Un.

481
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,061
What?

482
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,269
Nooo!

483
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,105
Mortality!

484
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:42,840
Smooth move, Ferguson.

485
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:47,536
Put that coffee down.

486
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:49,467
Coffee for closer only!

487
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:51,527
I'm here from Park and Kim.

488
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:53,798
I'm here on a mission
of mercy.

489
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,047
- Your name Levine?
- Yeah.

490
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:57,516
You call yourself a
salesman, you son of a bitch?

491
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,117
I don't have to listen
to this.

492
00:20:59,185 --> 00:21:01,686
No, you don't, pal.
'Cause the good news is

493
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:03,221
you're fired!

494
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:05,373
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

495
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,959
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

496
00:21:08,027 --> 00:21:10,795
You're weak!
Luke, I am your father.

497
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:12,964
Ghostbusters!
Let's go, black partner.

498
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:23,010
