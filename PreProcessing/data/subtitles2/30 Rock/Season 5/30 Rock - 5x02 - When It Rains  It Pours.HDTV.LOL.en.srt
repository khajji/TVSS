1
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:05,483
Hey, yo!

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,484
Back that...

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,920
And you can...

4
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:13,857
While I...
Off your...

5
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:15,325
Disgusting, sir!

6
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:17,026
Would you talk like that
to your mother

7
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:18,494
or your daughter

8
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:20,363
or your surgeon?

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,456
Just because my friend
is blonde

10
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:24,681
and never closes
her mouth fully...

11
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:26,027
hey, I wasn't talking to her.

12
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:27,648
I was talking to you, glasses.

13
00:00:27,716 --> 00:00:29,720
I bet you have...

14
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:34,832
...Infected penis.

15
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,960
That has never happened
to me before.

16
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:40,339
Well, I'm not surprised.

17
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,761
Not because you're not cute.
You are...

18
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,612
like a pretty refugee
on the news.

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,706
It's because you've always
put out this negative energy.

20
00:00:47,774 --> 00:00:49,456
But now that
you're with someone,

21
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:50,998
you're happy and confident.

22
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:52,814
Guys can sense that.

23
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,022
Confident, huh?

24
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,770
So can I finally wear
that cowboy hat

25
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:58,125
I bought at Kiss-FM's
lake jam '97?

26
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,171
Um...The point is,

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,852
being with someone makes
people want to be with you.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,064
You know,
when it rains, it pours.

29
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:09,260
I want your feet in my mouth.

30
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:12,810
When it rains, it pours.

31
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:25,936

32
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,456
Hello, "Javery."

33
00:01:34,723 --> 00:01:36,497
Time-saver.

34
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:37,902
Lemon, we have news.

35
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,643
Like God, I created man.

36
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,913
We're having a boy.

37
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,055
That's great.
Congratulations.

38
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:45,296
Think about it, Liz.

39
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:47,740
Every woman my boy dates
will get compared to me,

40
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,148
and they will be found wanting.

41
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:51,854
He's very lucky
to have you as his mother.

42
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:54,532
I'll tell you why he's lucky.
He's got an old dad.

43
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,169
I'm sorry?

44
00:01:56,237 --> 00:01:57,775
I had an old dad.
It was awesome.

45
00:01:57,843 --> 00:02:00,049
I could get away with anything.

46
00:02:01,824 --> 00:02:04,497
This is just what I need...

47
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:07,406
To store my rock collection.

48
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,313
Lemon, I'm not an old dad.

49
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:11,722
50 is the new 40...
For men.

50
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,295
But 50 is still 60 for women.

51
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:16,001
Whatevs, Tony Randall.

52
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,271
Whatevs, indeed,

53
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,344
because that makes you
Jack Klugman.

54
00:02:19,412 --> 00:02:21,585
Damn! I'm a writer.

55
00:02:21,653 --> 00:02:24,526
I'm messy.
I'm a loveable curmudgeon.

56
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:26,700
That is solid!

57
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,303
Advantage, Donaghy.

58
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:29,842
Hmm.

59
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,312
Rundowns are already out.

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,384
I can't believe how smoothly
everything's going

61
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:34,923
without Kenneth here.
I know.

62
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,895
Do you remember
my tattoo mishap?

63
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:38,431
It was supposed to say "peace,"

64
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:39,936
but they wrote
"white hooker" instead.

65
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,975
I forgot I was getting
it removed today,

66
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,084
but someone slipped a note
under my door to remind me.

67
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,923
Well, no one
could ever replace Kenneth,

68
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,028
but these new kids
are getting it done.

69
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:50,198
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:58,286
Liz, Tracy will not be coming
out of his dressing room today.

71
00:02:58,354 --> 00:02:59,688
Oh, come on!
What now?

72
00:02:59,756 --> 00:03:02,326
- I'm "werewolfing" myself.
- Sure.

73
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:04,565
You know when a dude knows
he's gonna turn into a werewolf

74
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:07,372
and locks himself into a jail?

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,876
Well, I'm embarrassed to say

76
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:11,148
I've missed the birth
of both of my sons

77
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:12,852
for very legitimate reasons.

78
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,624
- Cooking a French-bread pizza
and forgot.

79
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:19,266
So I promised Angie I will not
miss the birth of our daughter.

80
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:21,940
She was due yesterday,
so we're not taking any chances.

81
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,409
Grizz is guarding
the other door...

82
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:24,478
And reading.

83
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:26,116
Also, we took Tracy's
cell phone,

84
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:28,055
- his wallet...
- And my mood ring!

85
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:30,259
And I don't know
how I feel about that.

86
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,431
Well, I'm glad you're gonna be
there for Angie.

87
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,802
Good for you.

88
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:35,405
And good for you, Liz Lemon.

89
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:36,842
There's something
about you lately,

90
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,846
make me want to put
my feet in your mouth.

91
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,062
- It's your turn.
- What?

92
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,965
Editing hasn't sent up
the title sequence yet,

93
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:50,168
and it's your turn
to go down there.

94
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:52,038
God, I hate how much power
they have over us.

95
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,009
Who do they think they are...
mommy and her sisters?

96
00:03:54,077 --> 00:03:55,545
Jeez, calm down.

97
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,850
They know we need them,
so they torture us.

98
00:03:57,918 --> 00:03:59,186
How's it going?

99
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:01,759
I'm done, actually.

100
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:04,899
Okay, you know what?

101
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,535
I will take care of editing
from now on.

102
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:08,172
- Really?
- Yeah.

103
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,709
I'll go down there,
turn on the new Liz Lemon charm,

104
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:13,315
a little Julia Roberts laugh...
Ha ha ha!

105
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:15,650
- What's in your teeth?
- Corn.

106
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:21,689
70, Lemon.

107
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:25,158
I will be 70 years old when
my son graduates prep school.

108
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:27,827
- Oh, come on.
Is this about my old-dad thing?

109
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,695
I was joking.

110
00:04:29,763 --> 00:04:32,097
Will I even be there
for his first subpoena?

111
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:36,134
Will I ever experience
the father-son bonding

112
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:37,535
of realizing you were both

113
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:40,437
at the same masked orgy
in a castle?

114
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:42,706
I will be senile...
Or dead

115
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,408
for the better part
of my child's life.

116
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:46,076
Am I pulling this off?

117
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:48,544
I cannot escape death, Lemon,
but I will cheat it.

118
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:50,680
Whatever happens to me,
I must find a way

119
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:53,148
to speak to...
And guide my son,

120
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:54,783
even from the grave.

121
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,784
Woo...

122
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,219
This is a test
of the fire system.

123
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,020
Please evacuate the building.
You coming downstairs?

124
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:03,590
And stand outside
in a crowd like some Italian?

125
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:05,859
I don't think so.

126
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,494
You know,
as floor fire marshal,

127
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:08,828
Kenneth always ran
the fire drills.

128
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:12,964
Who's doing it now?
One of the new kids, I guess.

129
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:15,799
This is a fire drill.

130
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,635
All NBC employees
exit to the Plaza.

131
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:22,205
I can't leave my dressing room
until Angie goes into labor.

132
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:24,740
But the president is saying
we have to go outside.

133
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:26,308
It's okay, Tray.

134
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,443
We'll all go down together.
Then we'll bring you back up.

135
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:30,813
Just stay with your grown-up.

136
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,385
If I were a real werewolf,

137
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:38,786
I'd wear baggy clothes

138
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,788
so my nice clothes
wouldn't get all torn up.

139
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:43,424
Same rule
for if I were the hulk.

140
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:46,392
I don't get why people
like brunch.

141
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,595
What's the benefit of combining
break dancing and lunch?

142
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,829
Tray?

143
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:53,829
You're not Grizz!

144
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:56,699
Ah!

145
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,338
- Hello?
- I'm at the damn hospital!

146
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,806
Where is Tracy?

147
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:11,945
What?

148
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,584
Good morning.
Now, full disclosure...

149
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,421
most of my experience
is putting babies in women.

150
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,156
Oh.
I'ma kill that man.

151
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:23,791
You just described my morning.

152
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:25,626
Now, Mrs. Jordan,

153
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,161
I've already administered
the epidural.

154
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,463
So would you like one as well?

155
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:31,696
- I am trying to help you.

156
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:36,808
My son...
You may not remember me.

157
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,177
I am your father.

158
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:43,247
This message is coming to you
either from beyond the grave

159
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:46,182
or because I am
in the grip of insanity.

160
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,584
The purpose of these DVDs
is to educate

161
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:51,319
and guide you through life
in my absence.

162
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:54,322
I will begin
with our shared history.

163
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,656
The Donaghys originally come

164
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,824
from Ireland's
little known county Steve,

165
00:06:57,892 --> 00:07:01,493
where, historically, we were
whiskey testers and goblins.

166
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:04,296
I was raised
in Sadchester, Massachusetts,

167
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,631
I won the amory blaine
handsomeness scholarship

168
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,932
to Princeton

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,667
and then attended
Harvard business school

170
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,402
where I was voted "most."

171
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:15,772
I once hit a stand-up triple
off Fidel Castro.

172
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,407
I was the first person
ever to say,

173
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,244
"I need a vacation
from this vacation."

174
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:23,514
<i>The song you're so vain
was, in fact, written by me.</i>

175
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:25,049
In other words, I have lived.

176
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:27,050
In living, I have learned.

177
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:30,687
And now I want to impart
that knowledge to you.

178
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,789
I will begin with the basics.

179
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:35,024
You are hiking
in the Japanese highlands.

180
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:36,925
A pair of snow leopards
is stalking you,

181
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:40,428
and the blade of your katana
is frosted into its scabbard.

182
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:41,762
What?

183
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,863
What's up, edit seven gang?

184
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,265
Ritchie, Donna,

185
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,632
Ray...

186
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,767
Split the difference,
but keep the music where it is.

187
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,935
<i>- What are you guys working on?
- Piece for the today show</i>

188
00:07:52,003 --> 00:07:54,438
about how next month
is October.

189
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,139
Islanders, huh?
So you think they're gonna

190
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,009
end up trading...
Francen fren?

191
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,979
Who, Matt Moulson?
They should.

192
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,548
I'm better than that clown.

193
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,984
- So you play?
- Do I play?

194
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:06,319
I go to islanders fantasy camp
every year.

195
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:08,655
- You must be a strong skater.
- Well, I can't go backwards.

196
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,491
But, yeah, I'm good.

197
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:14,562
- Were you in the army?
- Oh. No.

198
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,897
Better...
civil war reenactor.

199
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:19,066
Kind of an expert
at getting shot

200
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:22,369
by, uh, smooth-bore firearms,
you know?

201
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:23,569
Like... kah, kah!

202
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,271
Kah, kah, kah, kow!

203
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,106
Blah, hah!

204
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,608
Gah! Kaw! Kah!

205
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,978
Kaw, kaw!
Ah, death to Lincoln!

206
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,946
- Oh, so a southern gentleman.
- Oh, yeah.

207
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,181
Well, thank you.

208
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,282
Thank you very much.

209
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,518
Ritchie!

210
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,553
Yeah.
Yeah.

211
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,288
Cool hat, by the way.

212
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,624
Hey, uh, you know what?

213
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,592
Let's switch to the other deck.

214
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,293
<i>I forgot I got to get
those TGS titles done</i>

215
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:52,463
for Liz here.

216
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:53,798
I just got to get
to the hospital

217
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,199
and wait there!

218
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,301
Taxi!
Sir...

219
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,769
I don't have any money,

220
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,703
but I need to get
to Mount Sinai Hospital.

221
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:02,304
No problem.
Hop in.

222
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:04,705
Wow. It's like
I always say...

223
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:07,538
"white cab drivers
are weird."

224
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:13,273
You're in the cash cab.
It's a TV game show

225
00:09:13,341 --> 00:09:15,374
that takes place
right here in my taxi.

226
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:16,807
Explain the rules.

227
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,006
You answer trivia questions
for money and a free ride.

228
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,606
But if you answer incorrectly,

229
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,341
the game is over,
and you're out of the cab.

230
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,142
So for me to be there
at the birth of my daughter,

231
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,977
I have to answer
trivia questions,

232
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:28,145
despite having gone
to middle school

233
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:29,345
in an exxon station?

234
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:30,846
Yeah.
You ready to play?

235
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:32,348
Bring it!

236
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,783
Your main titles, milady.

237
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:36,518
- Aha.
- And this...

238
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:39,653
Is a cd of some civil war songs
I thought you'd like.

239
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,287
It's very authentic.

240
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,156
So don't play it around
your black friends.

241
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:44,991
Well, thanks, Ritchie.

242
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,661
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.

243
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:50,530
Oh!
Wow, this is a nice hug.

244
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,667
Two becoming one, hmm?

245
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,304
Bam!
Blah!

246
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,508
What the hell, Liz?
I thought Ritchie was lying.

247
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:05,310
You know, if you wanted
to cheat on Carol

248
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:08,213
with an Italian dude
who smells like cigarettes,

249
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,949
I've made it very clear I would
flip over my futon for you.

250
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,917
Not cool!

251
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:14,819
What is he talking about?

252
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,488
Okay.
It's not a big deal.

253
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:18,423
Ritchie has just been
telling the crew

254
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:20,692
that you two
are sleeping together.

255
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,127
- What?
- Your new vibe

256
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,428
is a double-edged sword...

257
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:25,430
much like the kind Mickey Rourke
tried to kill me with.

258
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:26,831
Great.
So that's what I get

259
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,233
for being happy,
for being nice,

260
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,668
and rocking a cowboy hat

261
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:34,105
that a Kiss-FM DJ
once called a "sweet lid"?

262
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:36,140
But you can't say
anything to him.

263
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:37,508
Are you kidding me?

264
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:39,910
<i>If you do, he'll take it out
on TGS, on us!</i>

265
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,610
I'll be here waiting for edits
till 4:00 in the morning

266
00:10:41,678 --> 00:10:43,578
when I should be at home...

267
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:46,614
Which is the name of a bar
I found near the train station.

268
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:49,383
I'm sorry. You want me
to just take this for the team?

269
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:51,519
Please. You know he can make
our lives a living hell.

270
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,453
We all make sacrifices, Liz.

271
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:56,589
I had to be at work
this morning at 11:00.

272
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:57,990
Fine.
Fine.

273
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:03,794
Oh...
You got sauce on me!

274
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:05,561
You know, neighbors
who wear my exact size

275
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,096
don't die every day!

276
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,366
A gift from France
to the United States,

277
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:14,602
the statute of liberty
was completed in what year?

278
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,037
Come on, I don't know that.

279
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:17,638
You've got 15 seconds,
or you're out of the cab.

280
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:19,606
Okay.
I remember going to

281
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:21,374
the Statue of Liberty Centennial,

282
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,409
'cause that year
someone had spread a rumor

283
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:25,711
that she was gonna slip
out of her toga,

284
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,446
and I wanted to see
some green boobies.

285
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:29,380
And the mets had just won
the world series,

286
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,781
'cause that night,

287
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:32,350
I was randomly attacked
by a Mets fan

288
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,118
that I had threw a bottle at.

289
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:36,253
That was 1986.

290
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,588
And centennial is 100 years,

291
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,391
because "centipeding" means
having sex with 100 women.

292
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,127
I got it!
1886!

293
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:46,762
Yes!
That is correct.

294
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:48,430
Weighing up to 4 tons,

295
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,332
what type of mammal
is the famous shamu?

296
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,400
She is an orca, Benjamin.

297
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:57,136
Fyi, they're very difficult
to keep in a home aquarium.

298
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:59,505
- Right again!
- I'm coming, Angie!

299
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:02,173
Son, I may not be there
for your wedding.

300
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,908
It breaks my heart
to realize that.

301
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:06,676
But I want to offer you
one piece of fatherly advice.

302
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:09,445
Do not hire sting
to play the reception.

303
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:12,814
He'll insist on doing
jazz versions of police songs,

304
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,315
and it's just...

305
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,416
Demoralizing.

306
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:16,783
After I'm gone,

307
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:18,484
your mother
may meet someone else.

308
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:20,720
I want her to be happy, so...

309
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:22,421
His death must appear
to be accidental.

310
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:25,190
The secret to a strong,
healthy head of hair

311
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:26,991
is dove...Blood.

312
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,194
Remember, the backflip
is 90% confidence.

313
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:39,333
Kenneth,
what are you doing here?

314
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,434
I'm sorry, sir.

315
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:41,768
I was just sweeping
your terrace,

316
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:43,870
and then you came in,
and I was trapped.

317
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,705
Just like the time
I was cleaning my closet,

318
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:47,506
and my mom
and her friend Ron came in

319
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,607
to take one of their
grunting naps on my bed...

320
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:50,675
hang on.

321
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:52,943
Are you sneaking in here
and working?

322
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,344
I know how much
you all need me...

323
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:55,879
stop right there.
Guess what.

324
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:57,713
Other people can figure out
how to sort the mail

325
00:12:57,781 --> 00:12:59,715
and answer the phones...
we don't need you.

326
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:02,686
So move on with your life,
starting now.

327
00:13:08,428 --> 00:13:10,629
That is called tough love.

328
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,366
Kenneth is now on a journey
that will either return him here

329
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,937
where he belongs or end...

330
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,674
In his death.

331
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,978
Juggling is easier
than it looks.

332
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,080
No. It is true.
They're doing it.

333
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:25,315
Oh.

334
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:26,983
And we have this just in to us.

335
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:29,085
Ritchie and Liz
spotted in tree.

336
00:13:29,153 --> 00:13:30,552
Eyewitnesses report

337
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,521
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

338
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,457
For more, let's go
to NBC's Andrea Mitchell.

339
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,359
Thank you, Brian.

340
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:39,427
Slut.

341
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,101
Who do you think you are?

342
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:49,569
Ritchie Tamuto,

343
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:52,071
islanders fan
and role-playing slave owner.

344
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:53,972
I know what you've been
saying about me...

345
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,573
that we're sleeping together?

346
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:56,775
You know what, Ritchie?

347
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:58,876
I'm actually seeing someone
right now,

348
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,544
and he's never around,
'cause he's a pilot.

349
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:01,912
His name is Carol.

350
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,180
That sounds really fake.

351
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:04,914
I know how it sounds.

352
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:06,782
And Carol is the reason
I was nice to you,

353
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,084
because for once in my life,
I felt like being nice.

354
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,452
Well, I don't care
how you punish my show.

355
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,921
It's over.
I take my hug back.

356
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:16,256
No, l-Liz, that is not
why I did it.

357
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,557
Oh, "reallo"?
I meant to say "really."

358
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,625
I misspoke.
Continue.

359
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,793
Oh.

360
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,995
Come here,
come here, come here.

361
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:28,031
Liz, are you familiar
with the phrase

362
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:29,766
"when it rains, it pours"?

363
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,034
I don't meet a lot of women.

364
00:14:32,102 --> 00:14:34,069
Now, I started doing
fantasy hockey camp

365
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:36,637
and civil war re-creationism
to meet girls.

366
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:38,072
But I don't know
where they are.

367
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,041
So...Yes.

368
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,210
When you were nice to me,
I took advantage of it

369
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:44,812
to try to make
someone else notice.

370
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,946
Who?

371
00:14:46,014 --> 00:14:48,682
My assistant editor...

372
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,417
Donna.

373
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,118
Oh, for seven years,

374
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:56,422
I've been sitting close enough
to touch her...

375
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:58,556
But a million miles away.

376
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:01,192
I am really sorry
that I did what I did.

377
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,265
But it's just that
I am in love with her.

378
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,134
I love her so much.

379
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:09,569
Oh, Donna!

380
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:11,638
Donna Straunk!

381
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,373
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

382
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:18,971
So many memories.

383
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,874
Hello. Parcell
and a squatter's residence.

384
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,009
Where the hell is Tracy Jordan!

385
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:28,145
Mrs. Jordan?
Oh, I don't...

386
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:31,380
I'm out of my mind
on a lot of drugs right now.

387
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,116
Drugs during childbirth?

388
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:35,151
Isn't the whole point
feeling God punish you?

389
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:38,288
If that man is not
here for this, it is over!

390
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,756
You hear me?

391
00:15:44,897 --> 00:15:47,265
The lazy Susan was invented
by Thomas Jefferson.

392
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,901
I know, 'cause I'm a descendant
of Thomas Jefferson

393
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:52,269
and lazy Susan herself!

394
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:54,271
The capital
of the United Arab Emirates

395
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:55,438
is Abu Dhabi.

396
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,373
I know that,
because if I go back there,

397
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,707
I'll be executed.

398
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:00,743
There are 12 tones
in the chromatic scale.

399
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:05,047
♪ I know that because
I'm a musical genius ♪

400
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:07,015
- This is how you throw a punch.
- Wait... what?

401
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,584
"And the tree was happy."

402
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:12,684
Shel silverstein
was a communist.

403
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,550
And that...
Is the art of camouflage.

404
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,419
And this is how
you make love to a woman.

405
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:19,054
Aah!

406
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,555
Aah!

407
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:22,590
Pull, Angie, pull!

408
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:24,725
I knew you wouldn't let
me down, baby.

409
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,292
Of course not, woman.

410
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,260
I'm your husband.
Damn it!

411
00:16:28,327 --> 00:16:30,363
I got to go feed the meter.

412
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,565
Aah!

413
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:33,667
Aah!

414
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,503
Oh, hey, Ritchie.

415
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,272
Are we still on for
the music concert this weekend?

416
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,975
Liz, we need to talk...
About us.

417
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,377
Liz, we've had a lot of fun.

418
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:45,378
End it? Why?

419
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:46,947
But I need to end it.

420
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:48,249
End it? Why?

421
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:50,017
Without you around,

422
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,686
who's gonna satisfy
my sex needs... and then some?

423
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:54,421
Oh, Liz...

424
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:56,423
You'll find someone.

425
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,857
No, I won't,
not someone like you.

426
00:16:57,925 --> 00:17:01,427
How many guys out there have
a fully loaded Toyota tercel

427
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,428
or a real pinball machine?

428
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,630
How many guys
have been to Canada...

429
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:06,664
Twice?

430
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:08,099
Are you doing this to me

431
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,902
because I don't share
your love of unicorns?

432
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,237
Oh, Liz, don't blame yourself.

433
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:14,472
It's my fault.

434
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,375
See you in another life, kiddo.

435
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,078
I guess some other woman
will get to enjoy that water bed

436
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:25,047
that you're saving up for.

437
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:31,722
What's up, Ritchie?

438
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,194
Congratulations.
We're here, Tracy.

439
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:38,896
You made it!
Tracy Jordan... hero,

440
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:41,801
husband, diabetic/alcoholic!

441
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,302
Yes!

442
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,770
Hold on.
Let me unlock it for ya.

443
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:46,138
Am I pulling it right?

444
00:17:46,206 --> 00:17:47,773
- Just let go of the handle.
- Okay.

445
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,808
It's still not opening.
Stop pulling it.

446
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,109
I'm trying to pull.
You keep saying "pull."

447
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:52,611
Tracy, if you're pulling on it

448
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,813
while I'm hitting the button...
What do you want me to do?

449
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,782
Yelling at me
ain't gonna make it better!

450
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:58,750
- Stop pulling on it!
- I'm freaking out!

451
00:17:58,818 --> 00:17:59,951
Good God!

452
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,352
What's wrong with it?

453
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,788
Oh, it's upside down.
My bad.

454
00:18:03,856 --> 00:18:05,790
Well, Angie, you did it.

455
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:07,592
We did it.
I was here for you...

456
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:09,627
'Cause I love you, baby.

457
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:11,495
And I will always
be by your side

458
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:14,632
no matter what discovery channel
game show stands in my way.

459
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,667
I wouldn't have missed
whatever just happened here

460
00:18:16,734 --> 00:18:17,834
for anything.

461
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:21,704
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

462
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:23,838
And I mean it.

463
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,873
Why's that baby
covered with goop?

464
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,476
'Cause everything
about this is disgusting.

465
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:29,877
As you go through life,

466
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:32,545
I will always be here for you
through these tapes.

467
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:35,247
Also, I have given a great deal
of money to the catholic church

468
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,982
and have been assured
that I will have certain powers

469
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,151
in heaven...

470
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,486
sending messages
through animals, for instance.

471
00:18:42,553 --> 00:18:44,721
In the unlikely event
that you encounter something

472
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,256
that is not covered here,

473
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,624
find a woman named

474
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:50,261
Elizabeth Lemon,
get her advice,

475
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,996
and then do the opposite.

476
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,168
Mr. Donaghy, I am sorry,
but you are wrong, sir.

477
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:58,536
I am needed here...

478
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:00,437
More than I ever knew.

479
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:03,538
Very well.
I'll let h.R. Know.

480
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:05,538
No, sir.
If I'm going to return,

481
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:07,704
it must be
through the proper channels.

482
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:11,336
I'm going to reapply
to the NBC page program,

483
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:14,368
following standard procedures
for acceptance.

484
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,168
You do whatever
you want to, Kenneth.

485
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:18,001
I won't let you down, sir.

486
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:20,233
I really don't care.

487
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,401
Your ability to hide
your true feelings

488
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,301
is part of your great strength.

489
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:31,037
You ready for this, Jackie d?

490
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:34,340
As of today, yes.
I made all my videotapes.

491
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,042
Explain.

492
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,510
I'm not gonna be around
forever, Tracy,

493
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,411
so I recorded advice
for every scenario

494
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,713
my son could face.

495
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,881
Jackie D,
you want to make God laugh?

496
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,682
Make a plan...

497
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,017
Or read him a Dave Barry book.

498
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,419
You're worrying
about being old, Jack?

499
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,454
You could live forever,

500
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:54,357
but you still can't predict
what happens in life.

501
00:19:54,425 --> 00:19:56,159
Wait a minute.

502
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,994
There's no baby in here.

503
00:19:58,061 --> 00:19:59,595
Good God!

504
00:19:59,663 --> 00:20:01,363
Oh, she's in the crib.

505
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,098
Good.

506
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,768
Avery, I'm with Tracy.

507
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:10,371
- We're having a damn girl!
- What?

508
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,575
That Russian skank
read the ultrasound wrong.

509
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,077
Oh! I'm just so worried

510
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:17,347
about her spatial reasoning
and upper-body strength.

511
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:19,383
Jack, talk me down.

512
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,717
I'm having a girl!

513
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,752
I hate to say I told you so...

514
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,688
So welcome to Miami.

515
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,356
I've gotta make new tapes.

516
00:20:27,357 --> 00:20:30,357
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.Addic7ed.Com</font>

517
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:31,994
My daughter...

518
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,929
I am John Francis Donaghy.

519
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,297
I am your father.

520
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:39,268
If you have the blondness
and self-esteem of your mother,

521
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:41,038
you will need no advice.

522
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:42,441
Life will be easy for you.

523
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,878
Otherwise, I'd like
to introduce you to...

524
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:45,814
Elizabeth Lemon.

525
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:47,384
Good afternoon.
Let's jump in.

526
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:50,022
Every human has hair
on his or her face.

527
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,093
Some of us just have more.

528
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:53,528
I think it's nice
to occasionally splurge

529
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:54,997
on a straight-razor shave.

530
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:56,633
If you're running low
on laundry,

531
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:59,270
a bathing suit makes perfectly
acceptable underwear.

532
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,073
Bandanas are a fun,
sexy fashion accessory.

533
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,809
- This is over.
- Let me give my reasons.

534
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,744
Put potato chips on a sandwich!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
