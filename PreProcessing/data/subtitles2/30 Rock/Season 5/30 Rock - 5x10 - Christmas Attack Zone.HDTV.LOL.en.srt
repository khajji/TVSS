1
00:00:01,189 --> 00:00:03,289
Merry Christmas Eve eve, Jack.

2
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:04,722
Likewise, Lemon.
Is there any chance

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,858
you'll still be around tomorrow?
Sure.

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,059
You want to go to
the Penn Station Kmart with me

5
00:00:08,126 --> 00:00:09,293
and then watch <i>Tootsie?

6
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:10,894
I'm sorry.
That's what you're doing

7
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:12,529
instead of spending
Christmas Eve with your family?

8
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,265
It's my new thing...
Travel on Christmas day.

9
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,189
That way, I avoid
the annual Lemon family blowup.

10
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:20,388
And this year
it's gonna be a doozy.

11
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:22,730
My aunt Linda is bringing
her new boyfriend,

12
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:25,073
who is neither her age
nor her race.

13
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:27,239
And her ex-husband
will also be there

14
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,068
with his date, alcoholism.

15
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:32,005
I swoop in the next day
for presents and pie.

16
00:00:32,072 --> 00:00:33,550
Well, if you're around,
come by for dinner.

17
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:35,105
Colleen will be up
from Florida,

18
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:36,791
and, um, she'd love to see you.

19
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,809
Because my youthful energy
makes her feel young?

20
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:40,519
No, because
she views you as a peer

21
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:42,103
she can complain with
about how no one

22
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,679
wears pantyhose any longer.

23
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,335
Ah, how are we supposed
to conceal our spider veins?

24
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:49,391
Bare-legged at Christmas.

25
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,979
Okay, guys, this Kabletown promo
is the last thing we have to do

26
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:54,387
before the holiday break.

27
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:57,439
Liz Lemon, I cannot
participate in this promo.

28
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,045
Why?

29
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,415
Because it's not honest.

30
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:01,893
As an actor,

31
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,203
it is my job to tell the truth,

32
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:06,080
hold the mirror to humanity,

33
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:07,419
and sell proactiv.

34
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:10,400
I will not spout your lies,
Liz Lemon.

35
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:14,485
And I will not say
merry Christmas from Kabletown.

36
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:17,031
Ever since Tracy got nominated
for a Golden Globe,

37
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,202
he thinks he's Sean Penn.

38
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,012
Well, they have both had
screaming fights

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,682
with Wyclef Jean.

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,325
We'll just do this without him.
Merry Christmas, Jenna.

41
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:26,568
You can say both lines.

42
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:28,710
(Crying)
Merry Christmas from Kabletown

43
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:30,751
and all of us at <i>TGS.

44
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,425
I think we got it.

45
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,236
(Sobbing)

46
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,514
Wait, are... are you okay?

47
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,524
"Tom Ford and Elton John
invite you to New Queer's Eve."

48
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:43,030
What is this?

49
00:01:43,098 --> 00:01:46,240
NQE is <i>the</i> new year's party.

50
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:48,147
Everyone dresses up
as a cultural figure

51
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:49,384
from the past year.

52
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:52,126
Also replicas of the <i>David</i>
urinate vodka.

53
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:53,764
Oh, God.

54
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,036
Paul and I were gonna come up

55
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,339
with an amazing
couple's costume.

56
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,348
But now that he's gone,
what's the point?

57
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,354
This party means so much to me.

58
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,991
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without it.

59
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,991

60
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:05,099
The party or Paul?

61
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,870
The party, Liz.

62
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,374
Good news.

63
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,213
We don't have to do
these promos after all.

64
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:13,355
NBC says they want them
from every show but us.

65
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:15,494
Good year, everyone.

66
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:19,004

Why do people always say that?

78
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,755
Avery is keeping
her pregnancy a secret at work,

79
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,727
so she's been carrying around
large objects

80
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:56,132
whenever she's in the building.

81
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,069
I was wondering what was up
with your show last night.

82
00:02:58,138 --> 00:02:59,407
The market rallying today

83
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,211
despite a pullback
in gold stocks.

84
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,283
Anyway, I was gonna bring
dessert tomorrow.

85
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:05,822
So are there any foods that
are making you nauseous lately?

86
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,593
Please don't say
a half sleeve of oreos.

87
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,129
Oh, I'm not gonna be there.

88
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,269
I'm leaving tonight to spend
Christmas with my family.

89
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:12,438
Really?

90
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,176
That's why I like dating
older men.

91
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,812
Their parents are usually dead
or senile,

92
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,984
so there's never an argument
about the holidays.

93
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:19,955
Why aren't you and Colleen
going with her?

94
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:22,495
Oh, you know,
uh, Colleen is frail,

95
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:24,867
and Avery is
in her third trimester.

96
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:27,239
(Gasps)
You haven't told Colleen

97
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,311
about the baby yet.
What?

98
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,282
I have been watching
<i>The Mentalist</i> a lot lately,

99
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,319
because my tv's on CBS,
and I lost my remote.

100
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,656
I think I've become
a body-language expert.

101
00:03:35,724 --> 00:03:38,027
For instance, I can now tell

102
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:41,668
that Jack wants to kill
the person to his right.

103
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,338
Why haven't you told her?

104
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:46,177
I just haven't found
the right time.

105
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:48,515
- (Shrilly) That is no excuse!
- (Shrilly) This is so bad!

106
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,388
I cannot have the two of you
on the same side of an argument.

107
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,758
We Donaghys believe that,
when there's something

108
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:55,060
at all delicate to talk about,

109
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:56,729
it is best to suppress it

110
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:59,132
until it erupts into a fistfight
at a church barbecue.

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,767
I understand all that, Jack.

112
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,570
The symbol
on the Jessup family crest

113
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:05,006
is a knight refusing
to talk about his feelings,

114
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,975
but this baby is not bad news.

115
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,577
You don't know Colleen.
We're not married, Avery.

116
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,312
Why should that matter?
I mean, she did the same thing.

117
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,580
I mean, what did Colleen say
when you told her

118
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:16,548
you knew about your real dad?

119
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,750
(Gasps) You never told her
about Milton either.

120
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,284
I am "The Mentaliz."

121
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:21,919
You have so many secrets!
That was over a year ago!

122
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:23,520
- How do you not get hives?
- How could you not tell her?

123
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,287
For the love of God.

124
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:28,057
Sir, this came for you.

125
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:29,925
Thanks, K-L-M-N-O-P.

126
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:31,226
I've been waiting for this.

127
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,861
Oh, I didn't know you made

128
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:34,896
another <i>Chunks</i> movie,
Mr. Jordan.

129
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:37,098
That first one was a classic.

130
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:40,166
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here

131
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:42,667
to celebrate the life
of Althea Chunk.

132
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:45,269
(Farts) Damn, that's funky.

133
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:48,538
Obesity is killing the
african-american community...

134
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,407
With laughter.

135
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:52,475
Yeah, well, this sequel
is never coming out.

136
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,977
I bought the rights,
so this movie won't be released.

137
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,012
Why wouldn't you want people
to see your movie?

138
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,247
It looks so funny.

139
00:04:58,315 --> 00:04:59,683
That's the problem, Ken.

140
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,386
It's 67 minutes of me
acting like a hilarious fool.

141
00:05:03,454 --> 00:05:05,788
If this movie comes out
before the Golden Globes,

142
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,422
it'll ruin my new image.

143
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,592
Mr. Jordan, I thought
you loved acting like a fool.

144
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:13,161
No, I don't.

145
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:14,461
I'm lying.

146
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:17,064
My favorite thing in the world
is making people laugh.

147
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:18,264
But I can't now.

148
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:20,566
I had to go
on <i>Charlie Rose,</i> Kenneth,

149
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:22,368
<i>Charlie Rose!

150
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:25,204
- Oh, that's horrible.
- I have no choice!

151
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:26,705
I got to stay serious.

152
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:29,574
From now on, the only movies
Tracy Jordan makes

153
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:33,177
are about the holocaust,
Georgia O'Keeffe, or both.

154
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:36,680
I didn't care much
for the gazpacho soup.

155
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:39,149
I mean, where's the fun
of sending it back

156
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,482
because it isn't hot?

157
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,017
Mother.

158
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,552
Yes.

159
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:46,054
Avery and I are having a baby.

160
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:47,989
I see.

161
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,224
May I remind you
this is good news.

162
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,026
This is a disgrace!

163
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:56,262
What are my chums at the
death shore retirement community

164
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,231
gonna say...

165
00:05:58,298 --> 00:06:01,367
When I tell them
that my unmarried son

166
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:04,169
has knocked up a protestant?

167
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,870
Oh, I knew you would do this...

168
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:08,005
Take a happy moment
and ruin it,

169
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:09,874
just like you did
when I won that scholarship

170
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,508
at my high-school graduation.

171
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:13,410
It should have gone
to the other boy!

172
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:16,479
This is the reason I waited
seven months to tell you.

173
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:19,381
You kept this
from your own mother?

174
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,283
Oh, oh, Colleen,
don't talk to me about secrets.

175
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:24,684
I know some things you've done
that you would not want me

176
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,752
to bring up right now.

177
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,088
Most people thought
I was a hero

178
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,056
for killing Lydia's parrot.

179
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,525
I'm going upstairs now

180
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,728
and think about more comments

181
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:40,598
for tomorrow.

182
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,667
This isn't over!

183
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,269
(Line ringing)

184
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:47,737
Jack.

185
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:50,372
Guess what. They just got
caller I.D. in Vermont.

186
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,774
Milton, I hope you don't have
plans for tomorrow.

187
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:54,241
I'm having
a little Christmas dinner,

188
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,243
and I want you
to be my guest of honor.

189
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,577
Well, it is a little sudden,

190
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:00,045
but, yes, I'd love to come
to your holiday dinner.

191
00:07:00,113 --> 00:07:02,747
Christmas.
It's Christmas dinner.

192
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:08,085
(Holiday music)

193
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:10,420
Hey, Rick, can you cover
section three for me?

194
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:12,188
I'm in the weeds.
Oh, Liz.

195
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:14,391
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were a transvestite.

196
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,525
Paul, I need
to talk to you about Jenna.

197
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:18,660
Oh.
How is she?

198
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:21,029
Honestly, I don't think
I've seen her this upset

199
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,497
since hurricane Katrina.

200
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,332
The coverage preempted
a tampon commercial she was in.

201
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,101
- Oh.
- And she keeps trying

202
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:29,036
to pretend it's just
about some new year's party,

203
00:07:29,103 --> 00:07:30,937
but I think she misses you.

204
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:33,773
Look, I-I miss her too,
but it's over between us now.

205
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,708
I-I don't even think
about Jenna anymore.

206
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,677
I don't think about kissing her
or laughing with her

207
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:40,845
or photographing her
with just salamanders

208
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:42,513
covering her nipples.

209
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,115
When it's not meant to be,
it's not meant to be.

210
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,717
You can't be on the floor

211
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:49,319
without
your roller skates, Rick.

212
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,954
I'm not Rick.

213
00:07:58,294 --> 00:07:59,927
Merry Christmas, Jack.

214
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:01,528
Sorry. I finished the oreos
in the cab.

215
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:02,829
I'm glad
you could make it, Lemon.

216
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,965
Welcome
to my Christmas Attack Zone.

217
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,233
Your what?
What does that mean?

218
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,400
Professor Milton Greene

219
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,168
is on his way here
from Penn Station.

220
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:12,637
Milton, your father,
is coming here?

221
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,472
Please tell me that Colleen...

222
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:15,839
Has no idea.

223
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:18,008
The father that she hid
from me for 50 years,

224
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,943
the man
that she doesn't even know

225
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,678
I know exists,
is joining us for supper.

226
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:24,180
Uh, red or white?

227
00:08:24,247 --> 00:08:25,847
White.
Jack, what are you doing?

228
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:28,016
You promised me
a drama-free dinner.

229
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,651
I could be sitting
at the corner table

230
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,052
at the Kmart Cafe right now.

231
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,686
(Doorbell buzzes)
Oh, that must be dad.

232
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,321
Wait, does Milton know
that Colleen is here?

233
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,756
No. I want it all
to be fresh.

234
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:38,591
Will he erupt with anger
over her years of secrecy?

235
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,694
Who knows?
Milton's a hippie pacifist.

236
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,095
But I once saw Colleen provoke
a Buddhist monk

237
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,564
into whipping a battery at her.

238
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,035
My boy.

239
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:53,003
Oh, Jack, this is going to be

240
00:08:53,071 --> 00:08:55,372
the best winter's Eve
light festival ever.

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,840
Liz!

242
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,408
Ana happy
whatever you believe in too.

243
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:01,276
No.
I am not letting this happen.

244
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:04,278
Milton, Jack has an ulterior
motive for bringing you here.

245
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:06,847
Yes. It's true.

246
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,549
You're going
to be a grandfather.

247
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,685
Oh, what a blessing!
Oh, life is beautiful.

248
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:15,388
"Joy, beautiful spark
of the gods,

249
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:16,923
daughter of Elysium."

250
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,791
And, Liz,
you're already showing.

251
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,260
No, it's not me, a that
is not what he has to tell you.

252
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,628
Colleen is here,

253
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,563
and Jack is using you
to ambush her.

254
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,131
- Why would you do that?
- I'll tell you why...

255
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,400
Because when my mother found out
about your granddaughter...

256
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,201
It's a girl!
She'll be intuitive.

257
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,070
Colleen did not see it
as a blessing.

258
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:34,705
She saw it as an embarrassment,

259
00:09:34,772 --> 00:09:37,107
because my girlfriend Avery
and I are not married.

260
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,675
An embarrassment?
She has no right to judge you.

261
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:41,477
She needs to read my new book,

262
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:44,179
<i>there's no wrong way</i>
<i>to make a family.

263
00:09:44,246 --> 00:09:45,580
That's for you.

264
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,049
I agree with you, Milton,
but Colleen disapproves.

265
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:49,984
Well, that's awfully
hypocritical for a woman

266
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:51,819
who kept her son a secret

267
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,654
from his own father.

268
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:55,289
I'm gonna give her
a piece of my mind tonight.

269
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:57,923
Oh, great, Avery's here,
and she looks mad.

270
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,725
Jack, I got your message.

271
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:02,328
How dare Colleen
disapprove of me,

272
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:03,996
of us?
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

273
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:06,098
I didn't mean for my message
to make you angry

274
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:07,799
and have you come
all the way back here.

275
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,635
Now there are three people here
that are mad at Colleen.

276
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:12,070
Wait, this is Avery?

277
00:10:12,138 --> 00:10:13,938
How could that woman not adore

278
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:15,939
such a beautiful
daughter-in-law?

279
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,507
- Oh.
- By the way, we have

280
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,641
a tradition in my family

281
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:20,276
where we let the child
name itself.

282
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,777
Oh, yeah,
that's hippie nonsense.

283
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:22,978
Absolutely not.

284
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:24,647
Well, suit yourself,
but my son Spider-Man

285
00:10:24,715 --> 00:10:25,981
turned out just fine.

286
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:27,516
Okay, this is disgusting.

287
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,684
It is Christmas.
You are not going to ambush

288
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:31,587
an old woman for the mistakes
that she has made.

289
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:33,489
I mean,
who hasn't made mistakes?

290
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:35,791
I once french-kissed a dog
at a party

291
00:10:35,859 --> 00:10:37,326
to try to impress
what turned out to be

292
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:38,427
a very tall 12-year-old.

293
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,195
Lemon, we all know
what mistakes are.

294
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:41,897
I'm going to tell Colleen
what's happening

295
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,732
while you all calm down.

296
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,933
Where's her room?

297
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:49,503
(Whispering) Don't worry.
I sent her to the east wing.

298
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:52,639
It's very confusing.
It was designed by M.C. Escher.

299
00:10:52,706 --> 00:10:53,940
These stairs are weird.

300
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:56,508
Mother.

301
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:58,209
Dinner is ready.

302
00:10:58,277 --> 00:11:01,045
What are you doing here, sir?

303
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:04,147
I wasn't setting this up because
I'm spending Christmas at work.

304
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:06,214
I certainly wasn't going
to pretend those trash cans

305
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,884
were my parents.

306
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:11,019
I'm here picking up
a serious outfit

307
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,787
from wardrobe
for my event later.

308
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,256
All the big actors do
charity work on Christmas Eve.

309
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:16,925
Russell Crowe
is having an auction

310
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,960
to benefit the victims
of his own mood swings.

311
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,695
So what are you doing, sir?

312
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,763
Screening my very sad movie
<i>Hard to Watch

313
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:24,098
at a women's shelter.

314
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:25,499
It's gonna be real depressing.

315
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,734
I hate seeing you
like this, sir.

316
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:30,136
And you ruined Ludachristmas.

317
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:34,772
In the Darfur region,
the dead may be the lucky ones.

318
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Next slide.

319
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,108
What else can I do, Kenneth?

320
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,944
People only take you seriously
if you're serious.

321
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:43,713
But comedy is just
as important as drama.

322
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,114
People need to laugh,

323
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,115
especially
in these tough times.

324
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:50,885
And after all, isn't laughter
the best medicine?

325
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:53,954
Except for Insulin,
spironolactone, and bupropion,

326
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:56,189
which I have for you
whenever you're ready, sir.

327
00:11:58,058 --> 00:12:01,361
- Mother, you look lovely.
- I see you brought the bag

328
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,964
that my bastard grandchild
will come in.

329
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,932
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Donaghy.

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,734
My gift to you is the feeling
of superiority you'll have

331
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:11,303
for the next two seconds.
Is she drunk, Jack?

332
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:12,671
Because, you know,
when you're pregnant,

333
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:14,806
one bottle of wine a day,
and that's it.

334
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:18,208
Mother, you must remember
Milton Greene,

335
00:12:18,276 --> 00:12:22,012
my father
and your shameful sex secret.

336
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,514
Why would you bring him here?

337
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,315
Oh, I see.

338
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:29,151
Trying to make me look
like the bad guy, is that it?

339
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:30,385
You are the bad guy.

340
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:32,587
You kept me from my son
for 50 years.

341
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:34,155
You didn't miss much.

342
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:35,956
He's a good boy.
He got me a kidney...

343
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:37,591
From Elvis Costello.

344
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,327
All that time lost
because of you and your pride.

345
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:42,495
And think of what I've lost.

346
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:45,430
Going on father-and-son
habitat for humanity builds

347
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,199
and road trips
in my V.W. van.

348
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,601
Yeah, or other things.

349
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,537
And then you dare to judge us
and our life decisions?

350
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:54,738
Who do you think you are?

351
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:57,673
God, this house is enormous.

352
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,243
Oh, hi, Colleen.
I tried to stop this.

353
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,112
Well, mother, what do you have
to say for yourself?

354
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,048
It's speechless.

355
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:10,851
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas one and all.

356
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,834
(Gasps)

357
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:34,302
(Cell phone vibrating)

358
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,838
Jenna, this dinner
is a disaster.

359
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:38,273
My life is ruined.

360
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:41,042
I just came up with
the perfect couple's costume

361
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:42,476
for new queer's Eve,

362
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,678
and I can't use it
because of stupid Paul.

363
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:45,879
You know what?

364
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:47,480
The reason I'm not
with my family right now

365
00:13:47,548 --> 00:13:48,815
is because I didn't want
any drama,

366
00:13:48,882 --> 00:13:49,982
and that's all I'm getting,

367
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,850
first from these "jagwagons"
and now you.

368
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,752
Paul is the reason
you're upset.

369
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,421
It's not about this party.
It's about the party.

370
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:58,989
I want to eat shrimp
off an old gay

371
00:13:59,057 --> 00:14:00,558
dressed as baby new year.

372
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,926
Ugh.
(Cell phone beeps)

373
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:05,895
Hi, Colleen.

374
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:07,130
- Hmm.
- Are you all right?

375
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,599
Just thinking
about my next move.

376
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,400
No, no.
What next move?

377
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:14,435
This thing hasn't even started.

378
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:18,338
Welcome
to my Christmas Attack Zone.

379
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,740
Ladies
of the battered women's shelter,

380
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:24,242
please be quiet,
a man is talking.

381
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,013
You're about to watch a film
that holds a mirror

382
00:14:28,081 --> 00:14:30,315
up to your own terrible lives.

383
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:33,151
You're gonna see poverty,
drug abuse,

384
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:37,489
and a bunch of babies having
a hammer fight in a dumpster.

385
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:41,160
Comedy is just as important...
'Portant...'Portant...

386
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:45,097
Laughter is the best medicine...
Medicine...Medicine...

387
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:48,032
Damn it. I can't get Kenneth
out of my head.

388
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,034
Actually,
he's behind you, tray.

389
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:51,502
He rode over here with us.

390
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,903
You talked to him
the whole ride.

391
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,170
Well, he's right.

392
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:56,939
People do need to laugh,
and I'm the medicine.

393
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,640
What are you doing?

394
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,843
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

395
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,011
A long time ago?
You just got here.

396
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:05,680
Shut up, dotcom.

397
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,084
Ladies and children,

398
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:13,021
I give you <i>The Chunks 2:</i>
<i>A very chunky Christmas.

399
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,791
(Applause) Lights.

400
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,661
Damn Christmas lights blew a...

401
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:21,996
Aah!
(Grunting)

402
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:25,198
(Laughter)

403
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,674
Well, this has turned out to be

404
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:37,207
the opposite of what I wanted,

405
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,839
and I'm gonna leave
before anything else happens.

406
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:41,340
So...
Oh, my God.

407
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:44,443
My arm is numb.

408
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:45,978
What are you doing now, mother?

409
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,013
I think the stress...

410
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,581
Don't go to her.

411
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,916
Do you have
shortness of breath?

412
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,051
Are you sweating?
Do you have a neck or jaw pain?

413
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,087
I had a couple of rich men
die on top of me.

414
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:59,758
It's like something...
Like my son

415
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,227
sitting on my chest.

416
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,862
We should call an ambulance.

417
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,031
We are not calling anyone.

418
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,534
What's the matter with you?
Your mother's not well.

419
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:10,234
Can't you see
that she's faking, Milton?

420
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,668
There.
Did anybody see that?

421
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,670
(Gasps)

422
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,538
We have to call an ambulance.

423
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,607
Listen to me, damn it.
I'm a doctor.

424
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:19,975
Of history.

425
00:16:20,043 --> 00:16:22,710
In what emergency
would you be necessary...

426
00:16:22,778 --> 00:16:23,910
If someone wanted to know

427
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,611
whether the '60s
were awesome or not?

428
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,445
- They were.
- You hang in there.

429
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:30,615
You need to meet our daughter,
little Colleen.

430
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:32,783
Seems like people are

431
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,486
back on my side, Jackie.

432
00:16:38,822 --> 00:16:42,256
Paul, my ex-lover.

433
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:44,358
Listen, I-I'm not here because
I want to get back together.

434
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:48,127
Good.
Me neither.

435
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:50,129
Can I get you a cup of coffee

436
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:51,631
or an absinthe enema?

437
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:53,599
No, thank you.
I can't stay.

438
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,267
I just wanted to let you know

439
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:58,269
that I had an amazing idea
for a couple's costume.

440
00:16:58,337 --> 00:16:59,504
Well, so did I.

441
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:01,038
What's yours?

442
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:03,273
Well, maybe we should
just say them at the same time

443
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,773
and see what happens.

444
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,608
- You dress as Natalie Portman
- I dress as Natalie Portman

445
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:07,875
(Both)
from the movie <i>Black Swan,

446
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,943
- and you dress
- and I dress

447
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,277
(Both)
as former Pittsburgh Steelers

448
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,746
Wide Receiver and Pennsylvania
Gubernatorial Nominee

449
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:13,981
Lynn Swann.

450
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:16,550
We're two black swans.

451
00:17:18,352 --> 00:17:21,621
Well, it is
a druid solstice miracle

452
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:23,422
that it wasn't a heart attack.

453
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,957
Yes, I do believe
a heart is required.

454
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,558
That is enough, Jack.

455
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,126
What happened tonight
was so scary,

456
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:30,327
and the reason that it happened

457
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:32,996
is that we were not being honest
with each other.

458
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:35,398
So from now on,
no more secrets.

459
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:37,800
Okay.
I'll go first.

460
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:39,468
I have a crush
on the mentalist.

461
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,237
Just family only,
Lemon, damn it.

462
00:17:41,304 --> 00:17:43,872
There is one more secret

463
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,975
Jack and I have been keeping
from all of you.

464
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,844
We were planning to elope
in the Caribbean

465
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,879
over new year's,
but now we want you all to come.

466
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,514
Oh!
How wonderful.

467
00:17:54,582 --> 00:17:55,982
You know
what I learned tonight?

468
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,650
As hard as you try,

469
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,752
no one can escape
the horror of Christmas,

470
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,187
so it might as well be
with your own family.

471
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:04,690
I'm gonna go get a bus
to white haven now,

472
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:06,958
and I should be home
just in time

473
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,959
for aunt Linda to try
to prove that she's sober

474
00:18:09,027 --> 00:18:11,028
by holding someone's baby
while cooking.

475
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:13,463
Listen, Jackie,
everything I've ever done

476
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:16,533
in life has been
to protect you.

477
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,868
I know.

478
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,769
And if I got upset earlier,

479
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:25,439
it's because I want your life
to be perfect...

480
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:26,640
Unlike mine.

481
00:18:26,707 --> 00:18:28,274
Don't let him
off the hook, Colleen.

482
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:31,810
What he did tonight was wrong,
and he owes you an apology.

483
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:35,212
He's right.
I almost died.

484
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,649
And using your father like that
is so disrespectful.

485
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:41,851
He's a doctor, for God sakes.

486
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,820
Your mother and I are
very disappointed in you, Jack.

487
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:48,557
What are you smiling at,
you fruitcake?

488
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,993
Just my mom and dad
yelling at me together.

489
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:53,895
Milton, the Clinton boom years

490
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:55,864
were just an after-effect
of reaganomics,

491
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:59,300
and, mother,
you cannot invite anyone

492
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:00,801
to the wedding.
What happened

493
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:02,169
to the heart attack?
Let me tell you something.

494
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:05,071
(Overlapping shouting)

495
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:06,739
You insult
your own intelligence.

496
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,407
I'll invite anybody I want
to this wedding,

497
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:10,841
to this wedding
or any other wedding.

It's disgusting.

Fred, wake up.
Merry Christmas from The Chunks.
