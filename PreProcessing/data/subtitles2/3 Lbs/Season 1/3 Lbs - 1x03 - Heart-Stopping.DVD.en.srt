1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,640
WOMAN:
Is it the galaxies?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Yes, exactly. Very good.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,840
You just stumbled upon astronomy's

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,600
dirty little secret--
mostly it's gas.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,360
And what are the astrophysical
implications of that?

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,680
Come on. This is great stuff.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,760
You are infinitely tiny points
of matter alone

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,360
in an endless sack
of mostly nothing.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,120
How do we know this?

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,720
Final exam's tomorrow, people.

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
I pay attention
to what people wear,

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,160
how they walk,
their voices,

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,840
anything to help me
tell them apart.

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,240
Only now it's getting worse.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,160
I go to a movie,
the characters
blend together,

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,160
all my students...

17
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,240
When you said
"smudged faces..."

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,360
More like...
indistinguishable.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,040
I can't recognize anyone.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,960
Wears you down.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,120
And what do you teach?

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm a visiting associate
professor of astronomy.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,000
That's the only thing I wanted
to be my entire childhood,

24
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,960
an astronomer.

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,280
What happened?

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,040
My brother pinched
my telescope.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,400
You're easily dissuaded.

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,680
So, what's your absolute
favorite thing in the sky?

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
Arcturus, I suppose.

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,480
Fourth-brightest star
in the heavens.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
Impressive.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,400
You officially know more
than every single one

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,960
of my students
this semester.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
I love the night sky.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,720
It reminds me

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,360
that I'm a lucky coincidence
of water molecules

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,240
floating through
space on a rock.

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,720
Wow.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
Can we get married?

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,440
(chuckles)

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,200
So how long's this
been going on,

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,400
people looking
the same to you?

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,600
I've had trouble with faces
my whole life.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,320
Now I can't even pick my own
face out of a group photo.

45
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,240
What's happening
in my head?

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,920
When did you first notice
the double vision?

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
Yesterday.

48
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,120
Follow my finger.

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,040
You're worried.

50
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I'll tell you
when I'm worried.

51
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
I think you just did.

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,280
Hi, I'm Dr. Seger,
Dr. Hanson's Fellow.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,320
Rebecca Ellis. You must be
Hendrickson's replacement.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
No, actually, I think Zellman
replaced Hendrickson

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,560
and I replaced Zellman.

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
No, Zellman
replaced Le Fleur.

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
What happened
to him?

58
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
Le Fleur didn't last
too long.

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,480
I believe he wilted.

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,800
(chuckles)

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,200
There's a support group
for Dr. Hanson's ex-Fellows.

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,240
Chapters all over
the country.

63
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,280
We repaired a vascular

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
malformation for Rebecca
three years ago.

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,520
You make it sound
like car repair.

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,480
He clipping an aneurysm
near my brain stem

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,600
before it burst.

68
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,680
Saved my life.

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,920
Now I've got
double vision again

70
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,520
and he thinks
I've got another one.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,440
Seems that when I operated
last time,

72
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,720
I slipped with the knife

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,240
and accidentally gave her
the power to read minds.

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,360
Ms. Ellis, I'm sure
whatever's causing your
double vision is...

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
a cause of double vision.

76
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,400
Dr. Hanson hates
rosy predictions.

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,840
You're learning fast.

78
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,480
Yeah, I got the ghost
of Le Fleur in my office.

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,760
He doesn't shut up about it.

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
Dr. Seger's going
to set you up

81
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,840
with a CT angio scan
first thing in the morning.

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,600
We have a new machine.

83
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,240
So if there are
any vascular defects,

84
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,880
we'll see them.

85
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,120
Can't we use some
old crappy machine?

86
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,720
Honestly, I would
rather not know.

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,800
We'll talk after
the scans, okay?

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,160
Rebecca's back.

89
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,120
Yep.

90
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,680
False alarm?

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm afraid not.

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,280
* I need a sign,
let me know you're here *

93
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,040
* I need a hand to help build up
some kind of hope inside of me *

94
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:07,440
* I'm calling all angels *

95
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,440
* Calling all you angels. *

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,120
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

97
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,160
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@XXY
Sync:FRM@¡¤D¡¤</font>

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,680
This is so strange.

99
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,320
Shh. Concentrate.

100
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,600
Can you tell anything here?

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,880
Yeah, you're testing positive
for short attention span.

102
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,560
Seriously,

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
concentrate.

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,440
You're almost finished.

105
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
Sorry.

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,720
That one I haven't seen before.

107
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
Okay.

108
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,400
So, of the 20 faces
you were shown only once,

109
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,000
you incorrectly identified
62% as repeats.

110
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,640
Of the actual repeats,
you missed half.

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,960
What does that mean?

112
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,000
You have prosopagnosia;

113
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,360
face-blindness.

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
And that's an actual
neurological diagnosis?

115
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,840
I know it sounds very X-Men.

116
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
Until recently, there were
only 100 reported cases

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,440
in the world.

118
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,120
Now there's studies
suggesting

119
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,120
that two percent
of the population has it,

120
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,640
but we only understand bits
and pieces.

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
Well, do I get better?

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,320
That's not yet one
of the bits and pieces.

123
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,440
You could come back tomorrow.

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,640
There are few more tests
I could run...

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,480
if you fancy it.

126
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,680
I do fancy it.

127
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm giving my final
exam tomorrow

128
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,840
and then all I have
to do is pack.

129
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
You're leaving?

130
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,960
Yeah.

131
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
That's what we visiting

132
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,800
untenured associate professors
do when the semester's over.

133
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,760
We come and go

134
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
like comets in the sky.

135
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,040
There you go.

136
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,440
Hey, Rebecca.

137
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,760
Did you do your scans
already?
I'm not getting scanned.

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,640
I can't go through this again.

139
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,920
Not another aneurysm.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,080
Okay, well, we don't know

141
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
for sure
that's what it is yet.

142
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Surviving the last one,

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,680
that was the hardest
thing I have ever done.
I know.

144
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,040
My parent's
can't take it.

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,240
You remember how
my brother was.

146
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

147
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
If I have another
time bomb in my head...

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,680
Well, pretending
it doesn't exist,

149
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,400
that's going to help how?

150
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,280
Yeah, I can still take
a walk in the park

151
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,840
without thinking, "This is the
last grass I will ever touch,

152
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,480
this is the last
patch of sunlight..."

153
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
Did you do that the first time?

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,080
What?

155
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,840
Say good-bye to everybody?

156
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, jackass, everything.

157
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
See? It worked.

158
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,160
So do it again.

159
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
Come back inside
and get scanned,

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
so I can plan
your surgery.

161
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,520
You do think
I have another one?

162
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,640
You have double vision

163
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,160
and a history of
cerebral aneurysms.

164
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,520
Of course you have
another one.

165
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,640
Unless it's a tumor.

166
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,280
You're a terrible,
terrible doctor.

167
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,000
I know, but I have
very steady hands.

168
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,400
That's all you need
to care about.

169
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,240
It's not the first time

170
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,800
I've been attracted
to a patient.

171
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,720
This was the first time
I made up a reason

172
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
for him to come back.

173
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
I can't run any more
tests on face-blindness

174
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,040
because there are none.

175
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,040
And then he says
he's leaving in
a couple of days,

176
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,800
so of course he's
twice as attractive

177
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,680
because a serious
relationship's off
the table, you know.

178
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,600
It may be a bit
of "I always want
what I can't have."

179
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,400
I just want
to understand--

180
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,800
have I become
your girlfriend?

181
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,240
Because that's
how we're talking.

182
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,120
You're a colleague
with whom I'm sharing

183
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,480
a dilemma over
patient-doctor ethics.

184
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,680
Well, as long as you don't
call me a good friend

185
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,440
and start dating
my older brother,

186
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
we should avoid
the high school flashbacks.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,120
You should have
been more aggressive
as a teenager.

188
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,160
(chuckles)
Thank you.

189
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,320
So curious.

190
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,960
I spent less than an hour
with a complete stranger,

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
and for whatever reason,

192
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,840
he's starting to
take over my head.

193
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,960
I believe that phenomenon
keeps the species alive.

194
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,880
I'd love to get an MRI
of my cerebral cortex, right now

195
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,840
see where this is
coming from.

196
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
Why don't you strap on
some EG electrodes

197
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,280
and go on a date?

198
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,800
You can call it research
and skirt the whole
ethics problem.

199
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
I'm so kidding.

200
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,520
What do I do?

201
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,240
Somewhere in the oath
it I believe says

202
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,200
we treat patients,
not get to second base.

203
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Only second?

204
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Thank you again.

205
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
Excuse me, Doctor.
Hi.

206
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,200
You wouldn't have
any change?

207
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,240
You're using
the pay phone?
Yeah.

208
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,520
Oh, for real? Nobody uses
the pay phone anymore.

209
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,920
I left my cell at home.
I have to call my brother.

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,280
My nephews are
asking me about this.

211
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,200
I was, like,
"In the old days,

212
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,440
we actually had
these booths."

213
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,600
Now you can discuss
your herpes test results

214
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,360
with your doctor
on a crowded bus.

215
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,600
And where's Superman
supposed to change?

216
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,440
Like, some construction site
Porta Potti, I guess.

217
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,560
I've been up for 24 hours.

218
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,520
I get a little...

219
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,000
so I apologize.

220
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
Thank you
for that quarter.
Okay.

221
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,520
SEGER:
Rebecca Ellis.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah.
Tricky.

223
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,600
Tricky?

224
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,480
Doug, this is impossible.

225
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,240
It's giant.

226
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
Basilar aneurysm
incorporated

227
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,200
into the posterior
cerebral artery,

228
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,480
not to mention
completely inaccessible.

229
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,160
I was hoping to do coils...

230
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,480
but it's going to have
to be a bypass graft

231
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,200
under full cardiac
standstill.

232
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
It's the only way.

233
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,400
The odds against
a graft on the MCA
are small enough.

234
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,720
You add in the standstill

235
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,080
and she's only got
a 20% chance.

236
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,080
What would you suggest then?

237
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,520
That she live with it.

238
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,800
And yeah, I know, it
could burst at any time.

239
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,360
Yeah, so does she.

240
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,920
Could you live with that?

241
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,800
Odds are she dies
on the table.

242
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,200
I thought you were
the guy who went with his gut.

243
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,640
Yeah, well, sometimes my gut
says to look at the risk.

244
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,760
Odds are fear
expressed numerically.

245
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,320
They give people who don't
trust their judgment

246
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,760
a meaningless number
to hide behind.

247
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,200
A meaningless number
you have to disclose

248
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,400
before you ask her

249
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,640
to sign the consent form.

250
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
When you wake up in the morning,

251
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,480
and you hear that
the chance of rain is 80%,

252
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,880
do you always grab
your umbrella?

253
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,480
Yeah.

254
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,880
I always look out the window.

255
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,720
I know what
the odds are.

256
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,240
I'm doing the surgery.

257
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,800
Look, if you tell her
the risks straight up,

258
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,400
there is no way
she'll sign off.

259
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,560
Join us, won't you?

260
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,400
The last time
we did this,

261
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,520
it was in some awful
windowless room.

262
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,920
Yeah, that describes
half the hospital.

263
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,680
If you're giving
me bad news,

264
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,560
it's going to be out
here in the sunshine.

265
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,000
Well, I thought
you'd earned enough

266
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,920
surgery miles for an upgrade.

267
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,640
It's happening all over again,
isn't it?

268
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,120
Yeah.

269
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,200
But it is much worse.

270
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,320
The aneurysm is sitting

271
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,600
on the main artery that supplies
the blood to your brain stem,

272
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,840
and the surgery to remove it
carries a lot of risks--

273
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,960
seizure;

274
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,960
memory, vision, speech loss;

275
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
paralysis; stroke;

276
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,480
and death.

277
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,200
(laughs softly)

278
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,840
You're not done, are you?

279
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,480
No.

280
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,280
The only way for me
to get at this thing,

281
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,640
the only chance
that I have,

282
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,880
is to temporarily stop
the blood flow to your brain.

283
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,440
In order to do that,

284
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,040
I have to stop your heart--

285
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,800
and you have a one in five
chance of surviving intact.

286
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,280
Give me a minute to resent all
the healthy people in the world.

287
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,400
Especially the kids.

288
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,960
(chuckles):
So you are a terrible doctor,

289
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,600
I'm a terrible patient.
Yes, you are--
I told you that.

290
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
Do you need some time
to think about it?

291
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,320
Can you do this, Doug?

292
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,520
I can.

293
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,720
Okay, then,
I'll sign the consent form.

294
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I need a few minutes.

295
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,640
Is that straight enough
for you?

296
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,880
Hi.

297
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,720
What can we do for a man
with prosopagnosia?

298
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,800
Validate hiparking.
What else?

299
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,120
(groans):
Nothing.

300
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,840
That's what the literature
says, but I'm asking you.

301
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,680
Well, is it developmental
or acquired?

302
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
Developmental.
He's had it his entire life.

303
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,920
He's only seeking
treatment now?
That's not unusual.

304
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,680
Most people don't realize
there's anything wrong.

305
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,160
That's how adaptive
the brain is.

306
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,200
I could scan his fusiform gyrus
for abnormalities.

307
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,840
What are you looking for?
Maybe he wasn't
born with it.

308
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,640
Maybe he acquired it
at an early age.

309
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,520
A scan might unearth
something we could fix.

310
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
There's lots of "if's"
and "could be's" in there.

311
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,960
What about scanning him?

312
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,960
Wouldn't that be useful?

313
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,040
Did you just say that?

314
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,080
(exhales)

315
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,840
Hi.
Rebecca's been admitted.

316
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
You've got the O.R.
for as many hours
as you need tomorrow,

317
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,960
and Dr. Waell is ready
with his cardiac team.

318
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,440
Good. Thanks.

319
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,560
Did you come out here
just to tell me that?

320
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,760
Brad Ellis is in your office.
Rebecca's brother.

321
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,600
wonder what
took him so long.

322
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
I think the last little pig
had a house of bricks.

323
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,360
Slowed him down.

324
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,920
Mr. Ellis.

325
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,560
Well.

326
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,640
Hey, Mr. Ellis.
Jonathan Seger.

327
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,000
Mm-hmm. Now,
as I've tried to make clear,

328
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,400
the family has serious
concerns that need to
be assuaged tonight,

329
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,360
before Rebecca has any surgery.

330
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,520
My business is law,

331
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,120
so I would appreciate specifics.

332
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,040
Yes, I remember.

333
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,680
So, what do you want
to hear?

334
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,920
Well, let's start with
the odds, unvarnished.

335
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,520
(laughs softly)

336
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,520
Now, why is that funny?

337
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,760
No, it's not funny.

338
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
It's not funny.

339
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,760
Dr. Seger can give you

340
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,920
those numbers.

341
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,360
SEGER:
Okay, um...

342
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,520
Well, as you may know,

343
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,600
this procedure's
considered high-risk.

344
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,560
I mean, the success rate
is approximately

345
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,800
20 percent.

346
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,640
But left untreated,
the aneurysm

347
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,880
almost certainly ??

348
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,680
Almost certainly.

349
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,680
Give me a number.

350
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,360
Well, i-it's impossible
to say exactly.

351
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,040
This particular aneurysm

352
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,800
is so extremely
delicate, very close

353
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,120
to the brain stem,
rapidly expanding...
That wh... that what,

354
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,960
it's too dangerous
not to open her up?

355
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,760
Doctor, do you think

356
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,320
she'll survive
the operation?

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,280
I think she has
a better chance...

358
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
Yes or no?

359
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,360
In your professional opinion,

360
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,720
will she survive?

361
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
HANSON:
Objection, Counselor.

362
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,000
Badgering the witness.

363
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,240
Look, the first time,
I was out of the country.

364
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,720
You couldn't wait to rush in
and operate then, either.

365
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,960
Yes.

366
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,760
And you're welcome.

367
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,720
Is this your routine,
Dr. Hanson?

368
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,160
You talk people
into operations
where their chance

369
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,720
of dying on the table is 80%?

370
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Okay.

371
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,560
Rebecca's chances
of dying on the table

372
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,440
are 100%.

373
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,200
This operation is performed

374
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,960
under hypothermic
cardiac standstill.

375
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,480
We cool her body temperature
to 16 degrees centigrade,

376
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,000
which lowers her
brain metabolism to
practically nothing,

377
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,240
and we stop her heart--
so technically...

378
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
she's dead...

379
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,320
before we even begin.

380
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,160
Since you wanted specifics.

381
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,480
Anything else?

382
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
The surgery's off.

383
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,680
I'll have her sign a
retraction to the consent,

384
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,400
and you can release her
first thing in the morning.

385
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,920
Is this personal?
Yes.

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,400
With her-- yes.

387
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,200
He tried to stop
me last time, too,

388
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,040
and she would have died.

389
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,520
This is different,
with the standstill.

390
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,280
I mean, maybe it's for the best.

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Maybe.

392
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,680
(high-pitched whirring)

393
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,560
I didn't mean for you
to come right over.

394
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,720
I just live a few blocks away.
Oh, really?

395
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,640
Me, too.That would be so
convenient if I weren't
leaving in a few days.

396
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,160
Convenient? To what?

397
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,640
To... remain your patient
and see you for regular...

398
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,760
checkups... here and...

399
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,200
at coffee shops

400
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,000
or little restaurants,

401
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
with exam tables.

402
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,200
That's against the rules.
Lean back.

403
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
The least you can
do is cure me.

404
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,040
No promises.
It's a long shot.

405
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,560
We'll know more after the scan.

406
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,840
(turns machine on)

407
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,160
Nurse.

408
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,080
The chart says point-five
milligrams of Alprazolam?

409
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,320
Oral dose.

410
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,240
She was complaining
of anxiety.

411
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,040
She got Zolpidem
as well, 7:53 p.m.
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

412
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,360
Good. She deserves
a good night's sleep.

413
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,840
Thank you.

414
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,480
You play?

415
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
No. No, I-I used to.

416
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,440
I know it must be frightening
to see your sister back here.

417
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,480
Is this your best "good cop"?

418
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,480
I appreciate it.

419
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,280
But I'm not changing my mind.

420
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
The last time he operated
on Rebecca, were you here

421
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,720
for that?
No. Singapore.

422
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,880
There was this bank merger.

423
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,960
I wanted to get back,

424
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,560
but it happened so fast...

425
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,560
I-I wasn't here, either.

426
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,240
But I read the notes.

427
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,960
What Hanson did was...
extraordinary.

428
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,080
I mean,
maybe five guys

429
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,320
in the world
could've gotten that result.

430
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,960
It's luck.
He throws the dice.

431
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,800
When it turns out well, you're
geniuses, you beat the odds.

432
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,760
If it turns out poorly,
who's left to complain?

433
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,960
I'm not letting my sister

434
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,520
make a life-or-death
medical decision

435
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,880
in the panic of the moment
and under the spell

436
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,360
of this prima donna.

437
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,720
Not when the percentages are
as lopsided as they are here.

438
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,600
She trusts him.

439
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,920
Why are you doing this?

440
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,320
You don't even believe
she'll survive the surgery.

441
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Yes, I do.

442
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm a trial lawyer, kid--

443
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,240
I know what a bluff looks like.

444
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,720
(elevator bell dings)
Rebecca's going home tomorrow.

445
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,960
U ARE here early.

446
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
I thought you chose
neurology for the
bankers' hours.

447
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,640
I couldn't sleep.
Wrestling with your
ethical dilemma?

448
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
(chuckles):
I wish.

449
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,080
Did I just say that?
(chuckles)

450
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,560
(groans):
His scans are normal.

451
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,840
There's nothing
I can do for him.

452
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,960
All this man wanted
to do was look in the
mirror and recognize

453
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the face staring
back at him.
Are there other options?

454
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,800
You know, I read a study
that some prosopagnosics

455
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,840
retrain their peripheral vision
to access facial identity.

456
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,720
How do you know
about that?
Jonathan Seger.

457
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,200
I work in the medical field.
Pleased to meet you.

458
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,640
People come in here and have
miracles performed all the time.

459
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,280
How's Brad taking this?

460
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,040
He doesn't know.

461
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,040
I didn't page you,

462
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,480
because this is
an excruciatingly
difficult operation.

463
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,840
It can't be done by people
who think it can't be done.

464
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
It's not confidence I lack,

465
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,600
it's arrogance.
Yes, you're exactly right.

466
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,480
Maybe with all
your free time,

467
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,960
you can think about
the difference.

468
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,880
(door opens)

469
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,080
Adrianne?

470
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,520
Love the dress.

471
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,760
I was just examining
your fusiform gyrus.

472
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,120
Oh, thanks.
I've been working out.

473
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,400
I'm afraid it's
completely normal

474
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
in both shape
and function.

475
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm sorry, Nick.

476
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm afraid that really means
there is nothing we can do.

477
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,320
I wanted to give you this.

478
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,760
I found it

479
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,240
at a second-hand store.

480
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:19,720
Just don't
tell your brother

481
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,880
where you keep it.

482
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
It's fabulous.

483
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,680
How much longer do you have
till your next appointment?

484
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,840
An hour.

485
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,760
Since neurology is clearly

486
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,880
a waste of my time,

487
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
how about some stargazing?

488
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,200
Shouldn't we wait
until it gets dark?

489
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,280
Why?

490
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,960
(chuckles):
I don't know.

491
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,400
How come you're not
in the standstill?

492
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,040
I think Hanson wanted me
to guard the village.

493
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,240
It's a long story.

494
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,160
You haven't seen
the patient's brother,

495
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,200
have you?

496
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Like five-foot, ten,
outraged?

497
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,560
He's right behind me,
isn't he?

498
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,280
Be my wing man?
Dr. Seger?

499
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,680
I've already spoken with
hospital general counsel.

500
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,040
They're looking
into all of this.

501
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,280
Why don't you calm down,
Mr. Ellis.
Be advised

502
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,360
that I placed a call
with the New York
city police department.

503
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,920
How'd that go?

504
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,520
Sorry?

505
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,920
Yeah, when you called
the NYPD.

506
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
Press one if you're
reporting a robbery
or homicide.

507
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Press two if you're
really angry

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,600
that your sister legally
consented to brain surgery.

509
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,800
I said wing man not bastard.

510
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,040
I was very clear
with my wishes.

511
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,240
Yes, for your sister's surgery.
Yes, and if I'd been allowed

512
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,320
to discuss it with her,
she would never
have agreed to it.

513
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,120
Because you would
have terrified her.

514
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,760
She should be terrified
of this surgery. You are.

515
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
This was her choice.
I was there.

516
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,040
That wasn't
a choice.

517
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,160
This is blind faith
in Hanson.

518
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,120
Maybe it was blind faith,

519
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,960
but if she's willing

520
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,160
to step into that abyss
with her eyes closed,

521
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,640
then she has twice as much
courage as the rest of us.

522
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,000
Sit down, Mr. Ellis.

523
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,160
Your sister has
a long day ahead of her.

524
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
Keep an eye on him.

525
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,680
HANSON:
Okay, everyone, I'd just like to
go over what we're about to do.

526
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,160
Phase one,

527
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I go in, I navigate my way
to the aneurysm,

528
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,520
dissect the perforators.

529
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,240
Phase two, we cannulate
her femoral artery,

530
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,440
put her on the heart/lung
machine

531
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,200
and we cool her down.

532
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,960
Phase three, cardiac standstill,
when we will have 30 minutes

533
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,040
to go in, take the aneurysm,
bypass the artery

534
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,600
before her chilled brain becomes
starved for oxygen.

535
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,720
Not one minute more.

536
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,400
Okay, let's administer.

537
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,200
If I may,

538
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,560
Doctor, before
we begin...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,200
I would just like to note
that this is indeed

540
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,080
a consequential moment--

541
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,280
neurosurgery and cardiac surgery

542
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,120
joined together

543
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,960
at medicine's frontier.

544
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,560
Okay.
The procedure

545
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,320
we're attempting here today,
is risky.

546
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,600
To stop a beating heart

547
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,360
in order to repair
a damaged brain.

548
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,960
Only a handful
of these surgeries

549
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,040
in a year anywhere
in the world.

550
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,640
But one day, they
won't call this

551
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,640
cutting edge.

552
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,880
One day, perhaps,

553
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,360
they will call it ordinary.

554
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,080
One day, perhaps...
we'll begin.

555
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,320
OK SHALL WE

556
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,360
???in New York
thanks to sky glow.

557
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,560
HOLLAND:
Sky glow?

558
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,800
Light pollution.

559
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,960
All the billboards,
airports, street lights.

560
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,440
Most big cities, you can't see
the constellations anymore,

561
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,840
or meteor showers, or
the Northern Lights.

562
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
Two thirds of the world can't
even see the Milky Way.

563
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,160
You recognize that?

564
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,360
The Northern Cross?

565
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,480
My Dad showed it to me on
a camping trip when I was nine.

566
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,480
It had been raining all day,

567
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,880
and he said the nebulae
were red from rust.

568
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,240
It's funny, I can close my eyes

569
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,080
and I can always see
the Northern Cross

570
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,840
but I can't remember
what he looked like.

571
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,240
Constellations.

572
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,280
What?

573
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,680
Your face blindness.

574
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,320
Your brain can see all
the pieces of your face,

575
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,120
but it can't
recognize the whole.

576
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,160
Like seeing all the stars...

577
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,600
But never seeing
the constellations.

578
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,080
You recognize this?

579
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I see the Big Dipper.

580
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,320
It's also where the stars were
on the day we first kissed.

581
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
It's today.

582
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
We've only got an hour,
Adrianne.

583
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,760
You gotta keep up here.

584
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,920
You are my patient.

585
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,720
You said it was hopeless.

586
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,040
Excellent point.

587
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,760
We have at least
five more hours left.

588
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,840
You going to baby-sit
me the whole time?

589
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,960
Well, depends.

590
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,240
I've had a lot of coffee.

591
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,480
If I can't leave, I might
need a catheter soon.

592
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,360
(chuckles)
You think this is funny?

593
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,600
I've been up
for way too long.

594
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,400
Everything starts
to seem funny.

595
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,920
You going to be cracking jokes
if my sister dies?

596
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,720
Why can't you just be sad?

597
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,960
What?

598
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,360
Yeah, you keep looking
for a fight.

599
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,280
It's like...

600
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,840
you're in the water,

601
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,200
and if you stop
swinging your fists,
you'll go down.

602
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,280
All this and free
therapy, too.

603
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,520
I will sue
this place.

604
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,600
All of you.

605
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,880
Be sad.
Idiot.

606
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,320
Be sad.

607
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,840
What the hell do you know
about anything?

608
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,280
I don't know,
but you'll feel better.
Go to hell.

609
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay.

610
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,400
(sighs)

611
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,920
Word is the aneurysm is
in sight.

612
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,560
They're ready to put her
on cardiac bypass

613
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,080
and start chilling her down.

614
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,920
Where's he going?

615
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,640
I think next time you should
stay and I'll get the update.

616
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,840
(playing piano)

617
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
What's he doing?

618
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,840
It's okay.

619
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm getting a lot of PVCs.

620
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,200
Doug,
We need to anti-coagulate.

621
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,480
HANSON:
Not yet...

622
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,600
You're running the risk
of a clot here.

623
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,520
I know the risk
I'm running.

624
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,440
Wouldn't protocol
argue for...?

625
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm sorry, who are you again?
What is your name?

626
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,240
Helen Clark.

627
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,800
Cardiac Fellow.

628
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,040
We all feel, in light
of the bypass time-line,

629
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,360
the anti-coagulant
would be prudent.

630
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,840
Why don't we take a vote?

631
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,120
Although I have to say,
if it's split down party lines,

632
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,400
hearts outnumber brains
in this room two to one.

633
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,120
That was even more clever
than I intended.

634
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,760
No anti-coagants yet.

635
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,920
Don't ask.

636
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,160
Why not?

637
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
This surgery's going
to be on the news.

638
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
You should be in there.

639
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,320
He didn't want me.

640
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,280
Where were you?

641
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,320
On a lunch date.

642
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,720
With a man I completely
failed to help.

643
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,200
Only after unreasonably
getting his hopes up

644
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,400
for a cure, by the way.

645
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Did you kiss?

646
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,400
Then he's fine.
He's a guy.

647
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,040
You could chop his
arm off and he'd still
think it was even-steven.

648
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,040
He's taking me out
again tonight.

649
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,520
Could you

650
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,760
fall in love with someone if you
couldn't remember their face?

651
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,400
You want the answer that wins
me a prize for being sensitive

652
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,840
or the truth?

653
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,240
A face can launch
a thousand ships.

654
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,080
There's a reason the brain has
a part just to remember it.

655
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
Where are you going?

656
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,680
Get another update.

657
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,040
I wasn't invited because he said
I didn't believe in the surgery.

658
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,880
I'm sorry, but didn't the
brain-surgeon-as-cocky-bastard

659
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,920
thing kind of peak with
Dr. Frankenstein?

660
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,720
I mean, I had some reservations.

661
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,440
Doug's the one who made it seem
like a battle for my soul.

662
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,120
Yeah, but...

663
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,520
This isn't a battle

664
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,360
for your soul, is it?

665
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,400
Okay, I'm done
with the perforators.

666
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,440
Do the bypass, Henry.

667
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,160
We're having some trouble here.

668
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,000
Her femoral artery is a mess.

669
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,840
We can't cannulate anything.
Then what do we do?

670
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,320
Prudence and protocol
argue for no bypass.

671
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,920
You'll have to take
the aneurysm without it.

672
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,000
Then she'll die.

673
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
Dr. Seger.

674
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,080
I didn't take this job
to work the lobby for you.

675
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,920
Where are we here?
Well, our colleagues

676
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,080
are telling me that they
can't cannulate anything.

677
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,720
That we're going to have
to perform this surgery

678
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
without the help
of cardiac standstill.

679
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,760
Because prudence and protocol
both argue for it.

680
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,720
Who's Prudence?

681
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,760
Henry, what do we do?

682
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,840
May I?

683
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,320
What are the odds of you

684
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,960
dissecting
this woman's sclerotic artery

685
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,480
when you try and cannulate,
Dr. Wardell?

686
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,360
I would estimate almost 23%.

687
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,280
Interesting.

688
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,080
The odds of a basilar aneurysm
like this bursting

689
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,240
without cardiac standstill
are 25%.

690
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,200
I believe that means prudence
plays for our team.

691
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,320
Come on, Henry, do it.

692
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,280
If anything goes wrong,
it'll be my fault.

693
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,760
SEGER:
Nothing's going to go wrong.

694
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,200
Now that I'm here.

695
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,280
Glad you came.

696
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,280
All right, let's go.

697
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,920
(phones ringing)

698
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,760
(sighs):
This is stupid.

699
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,240
Hey.

700
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,560
Is Dr. Holland in her office?

701
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,520
Adrianne.

702
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,880
Hi.
I'm so sorry.

703
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,800
I'm used to seeing you
in your office.

704
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,440
Of course.

705
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
I have bad news.

706
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,160
Oh, no.
Doug's thrown
this whole

707
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,760
grant application at me

708
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,720
for a new
research project.

709
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,320
He's asked for it tomorrow.

710
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,640
No dinner?

711
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,520
I could bring some in.

712
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,640
No. No, I get it.

713
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,040
Been there.

714
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,240
I'm so sorry.

715
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,160
And it's your
last night, too.

716
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,640
No, no, I understand.

717
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,160
Keep in touch.

718
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,880
Okay?
Yeah.

719
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,120
Of course.

720
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,040
Thank you.

721
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,080
For everything.

722
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,360
It was fun.

723
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,600
Bye.

724
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,920
(machine whirring)

725
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,840
Body core temperature
is 16 degrees Celsius.

726
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,480
She's chillin' out nice.

727
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,280
HANSON:
How's your cannulate
holding up, Dr. Wardell?

728
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,440
No visible leakage.

729
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,680
Set the clock
for 30 minutes, please.

730
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,760
HANSON:
You ready?

731
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,320
ISAIAH:
15 degrees.

732
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,880
We're there, Dr. Hanson.

733
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,760
Okay, let's arrest her
circulation and drain her out.

734
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,520
Shut it off.

735
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,200
(beeping)

736
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,120
She's flat.

737
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,080
Start the clock.

738
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,200
HANSON:
Watch the vasculature.

739
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,200
When the aneurysm deflates,
we go at it.

740
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,880
!h
She's still draining.

741
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,480
Just watch,
it'll deflate.

742
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,880
SEGER:
Pressure's out. It's drained.

743
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,640
She's dead for...
26 minutes, people.

744
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,560
We're not done by then,
she's dead forever.

745
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,320
All right, cowboy.
Give me a break.

746
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,920
No, I like it.

747
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,200
WARDELL:
We need to restart bypass.

748
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,440
NURSE:
Three minutes.

749
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,640
Graft is almost in...

750
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,400
CLARK:
There's some fibrillation.
I'm getting...

751
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,920
A heartbeat.
What just happened?

752
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,240
What was that?

753
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,720
The heart will do that
on standstill.

754
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,400
A single beat out of nowhere.
It's a rogue event.

755
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,600
Two minutes, 45.

756
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,280
Did the graft hold?
I can't see yet.

757
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,760
Give me
more suction.

758
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,520
No, it slipped.
It's not tight.

759
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,560
Give me more.
Here you go.

760
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,960
NURSE:
Two minutes, 30.

761
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,920
We need to restart.

762
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,000
HANSON:
Hold on, wait.
Hold this.

763
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,200
Got it.
Go.

764
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,600
Pump on.

765
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,200
HANSON:
It's holding.

766
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,320
The graft is holding.

767
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,200
Okay, cut it.

768
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,600
Warm her up, Henry.
Get that heart started.

769
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,320
My pleasure, Dr. Hanson.

770
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,000
Dr. Seger,
nice job.

771
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,120
18 degrees
and rising.

772
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,720
The beat goes on, man.
She's back.

773
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,880
(alarm beeping)

774
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,920
Somebody shut that thing off.

775
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,560
* *

776
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,600
(knocking)

777
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,320
Who is it?

778
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,280
NICK:
The idiot.

779
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,480
Hello.

780
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,640
(chuckles)

781
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,200
Don't worry,
I'm not moving in.

782
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,960
I was on my way
to the airport.

783
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,280
I wanted to apologize.

784
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,480
You? It was me
who was the nitwit.

785
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,920
Standing there.

786
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,680
When you didn't
recognize me,

787
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,040
some vain little fuse
blew in my head.

788
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,000
But I should have
called you on it,

789
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,200
not walked away
like Tiny Tim.

790
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,440
I like your place.

791
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,840
Yeah? Well, next time
you're in one like it

792
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,200
and you see
a brunette girl there, it's me.

793
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,120
That's just mean.

794
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,760
When you look at me,
what do you see?

795
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,920
I see you.

796
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,560
Maybe I can't remember
your face, Adrianne, but...

797
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,400
I'm missing something
every minute I'm not with you.

798
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,000
And I have a plan.

799
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,360
Maybe I can't remember
the constellation,

800
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,760
but I can still take away
the stars that make it up.

801
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,800
Well, that would
have been romantic

802
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,280
if you hadn't taken
a picture of my nose.

803
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,760
Turn your head.

804
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,760
I want all the pieces.

805
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,800
Chin please.

806
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
When are you
coming back, Nick?

807
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,520
It's funny you
bring that up,

808
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,000
because I've been having
some troubling new symptoms

809
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,640
that you may
need to investigate.

810
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,200
Do tell.

811
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,960
I've been having trouble
remembering people's bodies.

812
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,800
Yeah, I've heard about this.

813
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,080
Body blindness.

814
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,200
Well, I may have
to run some tests.

815
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,840
Morning, Brad.

816
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,040
Dr. Hanson.

817
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,200
I need to say thank you.

818
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,040
You're welcome.

819
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,200
It looks like
she's going to be okay.

820
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,960
Yup.

821
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
But if this ever
happens again...

822
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,480
(softly):
Good Lord, Brad.

823
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,080
Shut up.

824
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,720
Becky?

825
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,040
If it happens again,

826
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,920
I guarantee you,
I will shoot myself,

827
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,560
save you both
the trouble.

828
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,560
Yeah, but with the double
vision, you'll probably miss.

829
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,480
You're a
terrible doctor.

830
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,720
Hey, want to grab
some breakfast?

831
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,600
I got a few minutes
before the first consult.

832
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,320
Yeah.

833
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,200
Hang on.

834
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,960
I heard you had
quite a night last night.

835
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,880
Yeah, it was exciting,
to beat the odds.

836
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,440
What's that?

837
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,000
It's a picture.

838
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,480
From your older brother.

839
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,680
I met him at
a bar last night

840
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,440
and we went back
to his place.

841
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,440
And now we're dating.

842
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,800
And since you're
such a good friend,

843
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,760
I'd like to tell you
all about it.

844
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
That's funny.

845
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,320
Oh, it is a sore spot.

846
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,840
He did it
more than once.
