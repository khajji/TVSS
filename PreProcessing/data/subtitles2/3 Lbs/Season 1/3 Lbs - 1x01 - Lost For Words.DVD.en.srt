1
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,200
Mommy?

2
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,160
Here, keep it.

3
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,960
- Dr. Seger?
- Yeah.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm Melania Ortiz.

5
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
Melania, in person.

6
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,160
Jonathan.

7
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't thank you enough for
all your help with the move.

8
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,560
Dr. Hanson asked me
to come meet you.

9
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,800
You're late.

10
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Wow. This is a
beautiful hospital.

11
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,280
This is an old hospital with
groaning pipes and cracking tiles

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,880
and ghosts in the attic.

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,240
Would have shut down a long time ago,
if it weren't for Dr. Hanson.

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,960
The Neuro Wing keeps
this place alive.

15
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,960
Working here is all I've thought
about since I became a surgeon.

16
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,640
When I had my interview
with Dr. Hanson,

17
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
I had no idea the position
would come up so soon.

18
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,280
Yeah, the turnover
here is fairly high.

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,440
I know how lucky
I am to be here.

20
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,000
This is the most competitive
surgical fellowship in the country.

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,600
Luck had nothing to
do with it, Doctor.

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,920
Welcome to Hanson Neuro.

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,160
He's expecting you...

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
for a patient consult in his office.
They're about to start.

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
Right now?
I haven't even unpacked my things.

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Why don't you leave 'em in the box,
see how it goes.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,760
The scans show a
well-differentiated astrocytoma.

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,400
We were playing a concert.
She was fine.

29
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,280
I can't lose my daughter, Dr.
Hanson. Not Cassie.

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,320
Uh, Melania said to come in.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,160
Is that Cassie?

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,760
No, this row here
is your daughter.

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
The others are other patients.

34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
It's like a week at a glance.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So the question is
whether this tumor

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,920
is infiltrating
eloquent cortex.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,840
Uh, that's the part of
the brain that controls

38
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
movement, language, perception.

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,920
Stretched out, the eloquent cortex
is about the size of a bathroom rug.

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,440
It's the only thing that
separates us from the crocodiles.

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,880
- Your daughter's right-handed?
- Yes, she is.

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,360
I-I... I should
break this down.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,760
- What did you just say? Astro...?
- Astrocytoma.

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,120
I need a pen.

45
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,280
Dr. Hanson's asking
you about Cassie's hand

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,400
because right-handed people will
usually have their language areas

47
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,360
in their left temporal lobe,
where her tumor is.

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,000
- Who are you?
- This is Dr. Seger, my new Fellow.

49
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
I'll be assisting Dr.
Hanson, here on the Neuro wing.

50
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,840
Hey, Lani, I need you free up a
block on the O.R. this afternoon

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,800
for an awake craniotomy,
left temporal.

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,480
O.R. One is booked.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,320
I'll figure it out.

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,280
Cassie Mack.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
Okay, we'll map the language
centers first, and then, um,

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,800
we'll go back in and take
out the tumor, okay?

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,040
Okay.

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,240
Tu...?

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,160
Did he just leave?

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Your daughter has a very good
chance of recovery, Mrs. Mack.

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,040
Dr. Hanson's the best there is.

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,520
Is that your new job?

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,120
I've been a practicing brain
surgeon for several years.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,680
No, is it your new job to
tell people how great he is

65
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,400
after he takes off?

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,600
At first,
it was just an annoyance.

67
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,760
I'd forget where I
parked my car, Doctor.

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,680
Tell me when you
stop feeling this.

69
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,120
Now. But it's gotten
much worse lately.

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,040
Now.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,360
I'll get confused
going somewhere new.

72
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,160
Even reading maps is difficult.

73
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,480
You know, this seems 
kind of old-fashioned to me.

74
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
I don't know, I just...
expected something more high-tech

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,960
from a brain surgeon.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
I'm a neurologist. We like to
try and solve all your problems

77
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,560
without actually
exposing the brain.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,280
Smell this.

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,160
C hristmas.

80
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
Peppermint.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,480
Can you tell me what smelling
peppermint has to do

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,400
with me getting
lost all the time?

83
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,520
Well, lucky for you, nothing.

84
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
Follow the light.

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
If you smelled sewage

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,880
or turpentine

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
we might have had a problem.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,560
Do you do all your
exams barefoot?

89
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Eyes closed now.

90
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Tell me what's in your hand.

91
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,320
A... rubber ball.

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,000
We have as many nerves in our
feet as we do in our hands

93
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,120
or lips,
but we box them up all day.

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,600
I think neurologists,
of all people, should go barefoot.

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,880
All right, no peeking.

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,560
Oh, you remind me of my ex.

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
She hated rules, too.

98
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,040
Is this a pair of eyeglasses?

99
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,920
Oh, I don't like random ones.

100
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,800
One more.

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,320
This is a cigar.

102
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,240
You have some
mild astereognosis.

103
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Together with the disorientation,
we should probably get some scans.

104
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,760
Hey, I didn't know if you
wanted to take a moment

105
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,600
to go over your
expectations for me.

106
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,920
This is a tricky
little astrocytoma.

107
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,760
Uh, Mrs.
Mack's pretty shaken up.

108
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,040
I reassured her this surgery was
just to map her daughter's cortex,

109
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,640
but I think she'd like to hear it
from you again, before we start.

110
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,800
Yeah, I'll have Lani
give her a call.

111
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,200
Right, well, you know, it's my
experience that the emotional state

112
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,560
of the family can impact the
physiological resilience of the patient.

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,120
Yeah, I've also found taking the
tumor out of the patient's skull

114
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,240
is fairly effective, as well.

115
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
Doug Hanson!

116
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,520
Who's that?

117
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,640
You in here?

118
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,240
Oh, hi, Penny.

119
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
How are you?

120
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,000
Meet my new Fellow,
Jonathan Seger.

121
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,400
What happened to Zellman?

122
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,600
I don't know.

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,320
Penny's a stewardess
for Air France.

124
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,080
Screw you. This is the sales uniform.
We have to wear it.

125
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,600
- Who was Zellman?
- You have his locker.

126
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,840
Hey, Penny, if you're pushing pills,
you're outta luck.

127
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,560
You're gonna have to leave
your samples with Melania.

128
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
I am not repping
pharmaceuticals anymore.

129
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,120
I sell doctor toys for Ulysses.

130
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
The Swiss company? Respirators?

131
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,600
Next-generation-image  processors.
I'm setting up a demo on the floor.

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,360
You look great.

133
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,680
Thanks, but we don't
need any new toys.

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
How about surgical robots?
We make those, too.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,840
told you I have
surgical robots.

136
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,080
They're called "interns."

137
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,240
But interns make mistakes and
they don't have four arms.

138
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Think about the imager, Doug.
The hospital will take it seriously,

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,360
- if you're interested.
- Yeah, but I'm not.

140
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,880
It's nice to see you, though.

141
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,840
Bye, new guy.

142
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,440
What do you think? Will we all be
replaced by surgical robots someday?

143
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,400
I don't know.

144
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
When a robot can't decide
what it wants for lunch

145
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,280
or flips off another robot for
not letting it merge into traffic,

146
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,800
that will be real
artificial intelligence.

147
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,400
It'll never happen.

148
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,480
The brain's too mysterious.

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,320
Don't you think?

150
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,640
It's wires...

151
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,320
in  a box.

152
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,000
How long are you staying here?

153
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,400
A week. Visiting my son.

154
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
He's busy with work, so I figured
I'd see a doctor about this.

155
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,520
What's his name? Your son?

156
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
Otis.

157
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,000
My dad fixed elevators.

158
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,760
I helped him out every summer
till I went away to school.

159
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,280
Otis's mom never knew
where I got the name until

160
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,240
we were riding on the elevator
down to the maternity ward.

161
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,000
He's a lawyer like me.

162
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,120
They work him like a dog.

163
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,440
Your father must have
been very proud.

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,320
He was.
And I still miss those summers.

165
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,240
Does this hurt?

166
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,360
No, it's loud.

167
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,280
Just scoot down.

168
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Is this gonna be bad?

169
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,880
When I opened my eyes this morning,
the alarm clock read 9:11.

170
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Bad omen.

171
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,200
I know you're going to find
something terrible in there.

172
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
That's the beauty
of being human.

173
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,040
There's not another
species for a billion miles

174
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,200
that can make itself scared.

175
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
We think too much.

176
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
She's back.

177
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,320
You might still feel a little
groggy from the general, Cassie,

178
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,280
but I'm gonna show you
some flash cards now,

179
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,680
and I want you to
name what you see.

180
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,920
Dr. Hanson will be using
a small electric probe

181
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,920
to see where the language areas
on your cerebral cortex are.

182
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Uh, don't you, like,
have to open my head up first?

183
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,440
We're way ahead of you, dear.

184
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,120
All right, let's go.

185
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Um, an umbrella?

186
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,080
Next.

187
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
A tree.

188
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,000
Good.

189
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,920
A b...

190
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
b...

191
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,040
A book.

192
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,600
Mark it. That's language.

193
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,000
Next.

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,280
Arterio-Venous Malformation.

195
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,880
That's where Mr.
Wills is getting lost.

196
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,800
What's wrong?

197
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,880
Nothing.

198
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Lilacs.

199
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,400
Sometimes the probe can
trigger a sense memory.

200
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,760
Did you smell lilacs?

201
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,360
We had these bushes outside,
by our old house.

202
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,240
Jenna and I used to
call it our oasis.

203
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,720
I could smell the flowers,

204
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,640
and the wood shingles
drying in the sun.

205
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,800
It was morning.

206
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you think you
could do that again?

207
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
Doug?

208
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,320
Let's keep going.
We have to keep going.

209
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
It's... It's best if
we don't go back.

210
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,720
It's a suitcase.

211
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,280
Who's Jenna?

212
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,440
My twin sister.

213
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,160
She was killed in a
car accident last year.

214
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,480
She died in surgery.

215
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,600
That's how come my
mom is so freaked out.

216
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,320
That's a heart.

217
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,720
- Oh, sorry.
- No... Uh, good morning.

218
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,360
- I'm Jonathan Seger.
- Adrianne Holland. Neurology.

219
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,960
Were you meditating
when I came in?

220
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,760
Uh, this girl's got a mass
right on top of Wernicke's area.

221
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
She could lose her language.

222
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,960
I've got a guy who's convinced
he was gonna have a bad day

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,960
because his alarm clock
said 9:11 when he woke up.

224
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,040
Turns out he's got an AVM.

225
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,640
Maybe the clock was right.

226
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,640
Is Hanson gonna operate?

227
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,040
He'll be supervising
Dr. Coffey.

228
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,560
You'll be there.

229
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,360
You're Hanson's shadow now.

230
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,840
When  I look at these...

231
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,080
I don't know, I feel like I'm
looking at an undiscovered country.

232
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,480
There is nothing I love more.

233
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,600
Except, except darkness.
I-I love darkness.

234
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,200
Yeah, the hospital
power's being upgraded.

235
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a bit flukey.

236
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,800
You were meditating.

237
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,240
Yeah, I-I do it before surgery.

238
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,960
Acknowledge the stress and
let it pass through me.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,880
Doug hates all that sort
of touchy-feely stuff.

240
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,480
How do you have the
time to meditate?

241
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,440
Oh, well, if I'm on the run, I'll just
be still, put my hand on my heart

242
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,520
and breathe for 30 seconds.

243
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,240
That is such a
doofus thing to do.

244
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,400
Yeah. Well, Vicky,
Vicky thinks, thinks that, too.

245
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,760
- Vicky's your wife?
- Girlfriend.

246
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,880
I-I'm trying to convince
her to move out from L.A.

247
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,840
And just like that,
the sexual tension is gone.

248
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,360
Not completely.

249
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,560
I  have been waiting
for 45 minutes.

250
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,680
No, it can't wait.
This is important.

251
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,240
Sir, everyone who walks through
those doors has something important.

252
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,440
Are you are having
a medical emergency?

253
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,680
What is this place?

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,920
We're a neurological clinic.

255
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,840
The car rental people
gave me this address.

256
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,800
- The car had a GPS.
- Okay, breathe.

257
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,320
- Tell me your name.
- Otis. Otis Wills.

258
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,800
My dad is Jim Wills.

259
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,640
His car is in your lot,
and he's been missing since last night.

260
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
- Thanks.
- Sure.

261
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,200
Excuse me, Dr. Seger?

262
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm Jerry Cole. I run
Radiation-Oncology here at St. Abigail.

263
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,680
Of course. Jonathan.
I'm Hanson's new fellow.

264
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,680
Yes, I know.

265
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,680
The sorcerer's new apprentice.

266
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
Cassie Mack is a
difficult case.

267
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I did all her scans when
they brought her in.

268
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
Yeah, they should be prepping
her for surgery right now.

269
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,640
I'd mentioned to the mother
that Gamma Knife therapy

270
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,760
might be an option.

271
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,680
I did some Gamma training
with Grady in L.A.

272
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,840
It can do amazing things.

273
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,360
It's a miracle technology.

274
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,880
Brain surgery with a
beam of radio energy.

275
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,400
Bloodless, painless.

276
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,320
Patient's in and
out in a few hours.

277
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
My practice is the fastest
growing on the East Coast.

278
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,360
It might be right for Cassie,
and I'd still trust Doug

279
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,520
to get in there and eyeball the tissue,
but I'm a surgeon.

280
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,000
It's my job to say that.

281
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,480
How's it going with
"Dr. Handsome"?

282
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,200
Fine.

283
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
He's a tough nut.

284
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,760
Where are you going exactly?

285
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm still figuring
this place out.

286
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,480
Do you think, in this business,
you have to have

287
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,920
some glaring personality defect to
be taken seriously as a genius?

288
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,480
His own kids don't talk to him,
all right?

289
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,160
I heard he literally
drove his ex-wife crazy.

290
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,880
Dr. Seger? Dr.
Flores is looking for you.

291
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,320
Jonathan, the only thing
Hanson can teach you

292
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,560
is to be exactly like him.

293
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,080
Is it bad?

294
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,400
It's a small tangle of arteries and
veins in the white matter of his brain.

295
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,760
He's probably had
it since birth.

296
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,040
So it has to come out?

297
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,840
The risk of hemorrhage is high.

298
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,080
He's scheduled for
surgery tomorrow.

299
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,400
He could be anywhere.
He could be depressed,

300
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,280
alone, lost.

301
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,960
Without his car,
he can't have gone far.

302
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
How can you give
people news like that

303
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,240
and then just send them
out the front door, huh?

304
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,680
Otis.

305
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,720
Where's my dad?

306
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
They just woke her up to
prep her for surgery.

307
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,880
She was disoriented.

308
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Any headaches, more seizures?

309
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,240
She can't talk.

310
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,880
I... I...

311
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,240
I... I... I... I... I...

312
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,840
I... I... I...

313
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,520
I... I...

314
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,640
I... I... I...

315
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,080
I... I... I... I...

316
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Sedate her. Ativan.
One milligram I.V.

317
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,560
What's going on?
What did you do?

318
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
I wonder what it's like
not to be able to speak.

319
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,560
You know when you forget your
high school P.E. teacher's name

320
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,000
and you just can't fall
asleep till you remember it?

321
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,360
Yeah, except she's got
that for every word.

322
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,200
Skulls should come
with a warning label:

323
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,760
"Removing this bone will
change you forever."

324
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Take it easy.

325
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Dr. Cole.

326
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,440
I came when I heard about the aphasia.
Is it global?

327
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,760
Expressive. She
can't speak or write.

328
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,320
Onset was acute.

329
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,480
Her mother's convinced we
did something yesterday,

330
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,160
but all we did was
probe the surface.

331
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
It's probably transient.
Some sort of focal brain seizure.

332
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,280
Yeah, she doesn't want to
hear "probably" right now.

333
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,720
She lost the girl's twin on an E.R.
table last year.

334
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,480
She's waiting to
talk to Hanson.

335
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Want me to talk to her?

336
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,680
She really wants Doug.

337
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,840
I can reassure her, you know.

338
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,360
Every minute she sits there,
she's just imagining the worst.

339
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,680
Okay.

340
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,000
But tell her
Hanson's on the way.

341
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,320
I'll use my most
reassuring doctor's voice.

342
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Dad!

343
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Dad...?

344
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,280
Dad.

345
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,680
Good guess.

346
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,520
When I left your office,
I just started walking up the stairs.

347
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,040
I figured someone who's
scared of being lost

348
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
probably woun't
leave the building.

349
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,360
If I close my eyes up here,
I'm 15 again.

350
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,480
I know about your surgery.
You're going to be okay.

351
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
I don't know.

352
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,600
I got a bad feeling about this.

353
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,920
- If I die...
- Dad!

354
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,680
If I die, Otis,
you're going to have a moment in time

355
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,880
where everything important
in life rises to the top.

356
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,800
You gotta grab that moment.

357
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,200
It's the only
chance you'll get.

358
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,240
You may live.

359
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,680
She's very encouraging,
isn't she?

360
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,920
Fear is the brain's
magic trick,

361
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,400
and you can choose to
believe it or not.

362
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,680
Come on.

363
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,280
Let's get you to surgery.

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,480
What's Cole doing in there?

365
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,880
He did Cassie's scans.
They're talking.

366
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
And that was your idea?

367
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,160
I changed my mind.

368
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm going to go with
the Gamma Knife.

369
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,400
But we already discussed
radio surgery and agreed that

370
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,240
it  might not be the
best choice for Cassie.

371
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,640
Yes, I guess that was back
when she could discuss things.

372
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,920
No, I understand, but changing
therapies this late in the game...

373
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,440
Actually, the language
mapping you performed

374
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,360
will be invaluable to
us in Gamma therapy.

375
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
Looks like she's made up her mind,
Dr. Seger.

376
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
My daughter came in
here with seizures

377
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,000
and now she can't
speak or write.

378
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,640
You did something.

379
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,760
And Dr. Cole explained to you
the risks of radio surgery.

380
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,200
Intracranial swelling,
radiation injury,

381
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,880
and it could be weeks or even months
before you even know the outcome.

382
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,520
The tumor is perfectly positioned
for me to burn it out.

383
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,200
Aren't you afraid of
missing abnormal cells?

384
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,000
With all due respect,
there's nobody in this city

385
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,800
better at reading brain scans.

386
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,400
I don't miss anything.

387
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,320
I think we need to stress the benefits
of each treatment here, not the risks.

388
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,840
Yes, and as we
discussed earlier,

389
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,280
Dr. Seger agreed that I might
have the better solution.

390
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,280
Excuse me,
I said both options are viable.

391
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,720
I didn't take a side.
I was just laying out the...

392
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,480
There he goes, walking away.

393
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,800
Your daughter has lost her language
because she has a very aggressive tumor.

394
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,560
Every minute that you hesitate,

395
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,480
it invades healthy cells.

396
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,040
You need to let me operate.

397
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,360
You act as if this is some
sort of exact science,

398
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,920
but you don't know
what you did.

399
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,000
You opened up her head with
a saw and you poked around.

400
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,760
It's primitive, is what it is.

401
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,360
No more surgeries.
I want the Gamma Knife.

402
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,480
I thought you said you
weren't interested.

403
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,960
Why don't you give
me your pitch.

404
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,080
Okay.

405
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,000
Medically, the advantages to
investing in Ulysses are obvious:

406
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,880
foremost, the fact that I
could add a deck to my house

407
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,880
and eat my sad frozen dinners
alone in the sunshine.

408
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,680
Want to take it
for a test-drive?

409
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,760
You want to scan yourself?

410
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
Yeah. Come on.

411
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,200
Quick.

412
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Okay.

413
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,280
Why don't you type
in "Anonymous."

414
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
You are one of a kind, Doug.

415
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,000
"I am what I am."

416
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,960
Was that Descartes?

417
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,680
No, Popeye.

418
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,560
See ya.

419
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,800
I didn't realize Cole was
going to be so aggressive.

420
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,280
All I said was,
Gamma was an option.

421
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,960
Who's "Anonymous"?

422
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,640
That's the default when it's
loaded from another system.

423
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,000
It's a colleague's patient.

424
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,680
What do you make of these?

425
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,400
Presenting symptoms?

426
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Visual hallucinations.

427
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
Auras? Flashes?

428
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,200
Yeah, getting more complex.

429
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,160
Like what? Flying elephants?

430
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,240
I thought you were
good at this.

431
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
My hunch is something's off.
I'd run an angiogram.

432
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,080
FMRI.

433
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,280
I don't run tests
without evidence.

434
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,720
Okay, you want the neurological
correlates of a hunch?

435
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,960
My eyes see something wrong with
this scan, ahead of my brain.

436
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,560
- I'm good at it.
- Are you?

437
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
We do things differently, Doug.

438
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,360
That's the first useful thing
you've said since you got here.

439
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,680
Oh come on, mother brings her
daughter in. We pop the top,

440
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,840
check the oil and
the engine drops out?

441
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,080
Coincidence or not,
I might change mechanics, too.

442
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,760
Gamma therapy's effective.

443
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,960
I am effective.

444
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,440
The Gamma Knife is a tool.

445
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,680
And Cole is a
glorified technician.

446
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,560
Besides, he would do
anything to steal a patient.

447
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,680
You think this is personal?

448
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,000
Of course it is.

449
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,880
He's been envious of my
success for ten years.

450
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,960
Now he thinks his new toy of
his puts him in my league.

451
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,240
What if he's right?

452
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,360
You got played, Jonathan.

453
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,520
Or maybe I'm the only one who
didn't let his ego get in the way.

454
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,840
- What ego?
- I'm sorry?

455
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,240
What ego?
I have yet to see one.

456
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,040
Do you know what "ego" means?

457
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,920
Self-- it's what opens
our eyes in the morning.

458
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,360
It's the thing that allows us
to have an effect on the world.

459
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,640
Our loved ones don't like it,
but it saves lives.

460
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,280
Do you even know
her name, Doug?

461
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Do you know that brain you
touched is a brilliant musician?

462
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,360
Do you know that her string
quartet plays as a trio

463
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,800
with an empty chair since
her sister was killed?

464
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,720
- And those details help you?
- Yeah, these details help me.

465
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,680
Then you're as dangerous
as you are naive.

466
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,560
Then I should go take polyps off colons,
because I can't

467
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,440
screw around in somebody's
head and not know

468
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,760
whose soul I'm
bumping up against.

469
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,240
Then go.

470
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,960
Melania?

471
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,320
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know anybody was in here.

472
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,960
Dr. Hanson?

473
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,080
Yes.

474
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,680
Oh, my gosh.

475
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,920
I thought you sounded
kind of manly.

476
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,600
Lucy Canet. Do you remember me?

477
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,280
Hemangiopericytoma.

478
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,400
Salud.

479
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,760
I'm here for my
six month post-op.

480
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,720
This is Ruby.

481
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,840
Makes me sound shallow, but she's
the best thing about going blind.

482
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,280
Hello, Ruby.

483
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,480
Lay down.

484
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,280
So, uh, no improvement, huh?

485
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,880
Not really.

486
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,280
I had hoped your optic
nerve would recover.

487
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,760
Do you mind?

488
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,040
I'm forgetting what
things look like.

489
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,360
Oh, no, no.
That's perfectly normal.

490
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,320
Your, uh...

491
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,280
your visual cortex is
starting to, uh...

492
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,840
reorganize to process
your other senses--

493
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,960
particularly touch.

494
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
I'm sorry about your sight.

495
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
That was the cancer.

496
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Thank God you saved the part
that can bitch about it.

497
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,920
Ooh, you should
smile more often.

498
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,960
I'll try.

499
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
Why aren't you assisting
with Wills' AVM surgery?

500
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,960
AVM's not really my specialty.

501
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,440
How about lying.

502
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,000
Is that your specialty?

503
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,040
Hanson's punishing me...
or testing me.

504
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,440
- What do you think?
- I don't know--

505
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,080
what do you call it when a cat bats
around a crumpled-up piece of paper?

506
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,440
Thanks.

507
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,400
He thinks I screwed up by letting Dr.
Cole talk to Cassie's mother.

508
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,240
Is that some traditional
way to eat those?

509
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,360
They forgot to put in a fork

510
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,440
and I'm too lazy
to go and get one.

511
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,160
I'm pretty sure Dr.
Cole is evil.

512
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,520
Who told you that?

513
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,040
Hanson, probably.

514
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,880
Look, Doug sees the world
as a purely logical place.

515
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,800
The brain is wires in a box,
all questions have answers,

516
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,400
and he knows if he can save
someone's life or he can't.

517
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,320
There's no gray area.

518
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,360
He's like Spock, you know...

519
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,600
if a girl designed the outside.

520
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,880
Do you and Doug have a history?

521
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
Not the one you imagine.

522
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,600
Meditate on that.

523
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,920
The thing about our Creator...

524
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,880
even when He ties the veins in
your head into an angry knot,

525
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,960
it's beautiful.

526
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,680
Don't mess with the output
until all the feeders are done.

527
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,800
Fine.

528
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,840
- But back to God...
- Oh, no.

529
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,200
Not today, Angus.

530
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,480
Doug, this could easily
take another three hours.

531
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
Surely we can settle
the question.

532
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,000
Intern-- God or no God?

533
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,200
I suppose I can't rule Him out.

534
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,800
Then why am I fixing
His mistakes?

535
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,520
Cancer's alive, too.

536
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,840
How do you know we're
not the disease?

537
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,840
Touche for the nobody.

538
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,200
Flores, actually.

539
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,600
I think we'll call you nobody.

540
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,880
Mrs. Mack.

541
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,400
How's Cassie?

542
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
I wish I had her drugs.

543
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,480
Dr. Cole's going to start
the treatments tomorrow.

544
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,720
I know Dr. Hanson is brilliant, 
but the surgery...

545
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,040
Cassie's sister Jenna
had the best, too,

546
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,320
and she bled out on the table.

547
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
They were so close.

548
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,480
Cassie's not Jenna, Mrs. Mack.

549
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,720
I still miss her every day.

550
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,280
I know.

551
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,960
And with everything that Hanson's
going through, personally...

552
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
Personally?

553
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,040
Dr. Cole explained
it all to me.

554
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,880
Thank you, Dr. Seger.

555
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,880
Hi.

556
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,120
Look, I know you're scared of losing
Cassie like you lost Jenna, but...

557
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,680
if you can believe, for a moment,
that it wasn't Hanson's fault

558
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,600
that Cassie stopped speaking,
then you gotta see it was the tumor.

559
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,120
That's the enemy.

560
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,760
Give us a minute.

561
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,920
I don't know what Dr.
Cole told you about Hanson,

562
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,320
but it doesn't matter.

563
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,960
The Gamma Knife is an
incredible piece of machinery,

564
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,520
but the most advanced
equipment in this hospital

565
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,320
is Doug's judgment.

566
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,920
He doesn't hold your hand--

567
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,840
he doesn't know how, but...

568
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,360
there is not another
mind on this planet

569
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,000
I would want focused on
saving my daughter's life.

570
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,880
How's Mr. Wills?

571
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,440
Yeah, good.
The surgery went well.

572
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,720
I heard Jonathan
wasn't invited.

573
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,200
Well, it was probably
a mistake hiring him.

574
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,360
I think he's gifted.

575
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,880
I think he should be teaching
medical ethics at Columbia

576
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,280
and confessing his affairs
with his graduate students

577
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,560
to his wife or his
girlfriend or whatever.

578
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,000
He would, too.

579
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,400
It's too bad.

580
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,680
He looked so good on paper.

581
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,000
You know how female
praying mantises

582
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,400
will often eat male praying
mantises when they mate.

583
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,880
That's why I have cable.

584
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,280
Well, most of the time,
they do it right before the sex.

585
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,720
Now, you'd think as far as evolution
goes, that'd be kind of retarded.

586
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,960
But it would spare you the
awkward chitchat afterward.

587
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,280
This is the beautiful thing.

588
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,560
Yes?

589
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,200
It turns out the boys perform
better without their heads.

590
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,440
- Hey.
- Hey.

591
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,200
Hi. We were just
talking about you.

592
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
You were right about Cole.

593
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,120
He's spreading rumors
to steal your patients.

594
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,040
Yes, I know.

595
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,520
But I've moved on.

596
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,680
I have acknowledged the stress

597
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,040
and let it pass through me.

598
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,240
Walk with me, Doctor.

599
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,600
Is this a school?

600
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,720
You know when you told
me that you'd rather

601
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,520
take polyps off of colons

602
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,160
than operate on a patient
that you don't know?

603
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,160
Yeah?

604
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,160
Were you just making that up?

605
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,160
I mean,
did you just come up with that?

606
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,800
Because it's very dramatic.

607
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,800
Listen, Doug, I feel like we've
gotten off on the wrong foot.

608
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,440
I'll be back in a minute.
Keep the car moving.

609
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,160
Otherwise, the moms in
line get very upset.

610
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,680
Doug? Doug?

611
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,920
Excuse me!
You can't just leave your car there!

612
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,880
Who are you?

613
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I'm Jonathan.
Are you Doug's daughter?

614
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,720
Tell me he didn't
hire a driver.

615
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,400
No, no, no, I'm...
What's your name?

616
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,080
Is my phone up here?

617
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,680
Could be worse.

618
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,520
He could be hitting
on a teacher.

619
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,400
I don't think that's
what he's doing.

620
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,800
My friend Geordie,
he says sex is like gravity.

621
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,360
He's more likely to fly than
to stop thinking about it.

622
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,720
I don't...
I don't know. Uh, Doug!

623
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Dad said he cheated on Mom
because the love was gone.

624
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
I'm pretty sure it's just
'cause he couldn't fly.

625
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,840
Wh-Why are you telling me this?

626
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,640
If you're gonna drive me every day,
it's gotta come up eventually.

627
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,360
I'm not your dad's driver;
I'm a doctor.

628
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,720
Oh... Then why are you
driving him around?

629
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,920
What are you doing?

630
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,520
- Dad...
- Yeah?

631
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,880
Joey Cole's mom is married.

632
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,680
Cole? As in Jerry Cole?

633
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,760
Yeah, he moved out
three months ago.

634
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,720
She caught him with
a maternity nurse.

635
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,520
This is how you move on?
You hit on his wife?

636
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,440
I'm just saying hi
to an old friend.

637
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,000
He can take it however
he wants to take it.

638
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,280
This is he.

639
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,480
Okay, we're on our way.

640
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,440
Roberta and Cassie Mack
want you to operate.

641
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,880
Good.

642
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,840
Hi.

643
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,360
Radio?

644
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Music?

645
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,120
Oh, yeah-- no, no, no.
Hold on. No...

646
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,800
Music's over here, okay?

647
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,360
It's safe.

648
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
Here.

649
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,480
Take this.

650
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,960
I'll get your words back.

651
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,920
She can't bring
that in with her.

652
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,960
Really? Why don't you take
it up with the surgeon?

653
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,920
See, there's some tricky attachments
here by functional cortex.

654
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,720
I think the best way in...

655
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,800
is the natural
cleavage plane here.

656
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,120
I see it.

657
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,600
There's some mass effect, too.

658
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,120
Yeah, but that tissue
should recover.

659
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,840
If you're ever resecting
tissue in my temporal lobe,

660
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,160
do me a favor--

661
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
burn out junior high.

662
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,720
Wouldn't that be great?

663
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,280
Yeah, you can take most
of high school, too.

664
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,440
Just leave the part where
Carmen Ramirez got drunk

665
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,600
and made out with
me by mistake.

666
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,080
You're sucking air.
I'm hearing bubbles in the heart.

667
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,280
It's an air embolus.

668
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,440
Damn it.

669
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,840
All right,
put her in the Trendelenberg.

670
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,600
Let's go. Let's irrigate her.

671
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,360
Internal CO2's plummeting.

672
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,600
Flush the central line.

673
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
BP's crashing.

674
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,480
There's still air in
the central line.

675
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
- Aw, damn!
- She's bradying down.

676
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,400
- Calm down. Calm down.
- She's in the 30s.

677
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,680
She's arresting.

678
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,080
V-fib.

679
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
Do it, Seger.

680
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,080
Charge it to 200.

681
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,320
She squeezed my hand
about an hour ago

682
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,720
and she's been
mumbling obscenities.

683
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,840
That's actually a very common
way to regain consciousness.

684
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,600
The more obscene the better.

685
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,120
Good.

686
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,560
I'd like to thank Dr. Hanson.

687
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,640
I'll make sure he knows.

688
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,280
Is it true you almost lost her?

689
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,120
She was gone for a moment.

690
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,880
Johnny got her back.

691
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,640
Cassie's a survivor.

692
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,520
Her language areas were being
compressed by the glioma.

693
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,280
Once the swelling goes down,

694
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,720
she can expect
real improvement.

695
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,480
You make it sound so simple.

696
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,600
Wires in a box.

697
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,440
Did you write this?

698
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,920
That's Cassie's handwriting.

699
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,800
What's it say?

700
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,720
"Jenna says hi."

701
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,160
How'd it go?

702
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,280
Why couldn't you give
those to Cole yourself?

703
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,720
Because he'd never
do me the favor.

704
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,360
He does his best work when he thinks
he's stealing one of my patients.

705
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,320
He saw something weird.

706
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,520
Said he wants to see my
friend to run more tests.

707
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,840
Is something wrong, Doug?

708
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,080
Yes.

709
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,240
It looks like we won't be
buying your fancy new scanner.

710
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,640
That was a test?

711
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,880
You just can't help messing
with people's heads, can you?

712
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,080
It's my job.

713
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,640
Want to get a drink?

714
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,320
Sure, why not?

715
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,520
Life is short.

716
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,640
T

717
