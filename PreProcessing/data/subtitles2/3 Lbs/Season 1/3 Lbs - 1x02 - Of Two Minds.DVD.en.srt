1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,760
You need a baby monitor.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,960
Not yet!

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,760
Oh...
You shouldegister
for your baby shower.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,560
At three months?
Why not?

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,120
'Cause that's just greedy.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,600
You think the only reason
you get pregnant is
to accessorize.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,000
What about a stroller?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You don't have one, do you?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,440
Check this one out.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,360
Ugh, costs more
than a house payment.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,400
Maybe you and Dennis
should just get a dog.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,560
(thud)
What is that?

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,360
What are you doing?

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,800
Kate?

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,680
Kate!

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,440
33-year-old married
woman admitted

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,200
this morning after
a grand mal seizure.

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Scans show an inoperable

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,600
grade-four gioblastoma,
and she's pregnant.

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,560
So she chooses radiation

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,960
to save herself,
she'll lose the baby.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
I know.
I read the chart.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
She's had no symptoms
before today.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,920
I mean,
completely healthy.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,480
Are you creeping up
on some pithy observation
about humanity, Seger?

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,160
Forget humanity?
How about Kate Larson?

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,920
This morning, she woke up

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,960
and wondered whether to
 have corn flakes or oatmeal.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,640
Now she has to
make the toughest
choice of her life.

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,320
Why do you do this, Seger?
I care.

31
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,960
Oh, stop it.
That's too easy.

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,440
No. Try to put yourself
in their shoes.

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,120
Oh, because fourth year

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,200
I took a seminar entitled "Putting Yourself
In Their Shoes."

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Do you really want me
to explain empathy?

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,360
Can you really empathize
with a person who's dying?

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,920
That's impressive.

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
I mean, can you
really feel what
they are feeling?

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,360
I can imagine.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
Oh, so you're pretending.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
Okay, so I shouldn't try?

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,800
Look, there are neural
epithelial cells

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,000
in Karen Larson's brain
that woke up a few
months ago

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,200
and decided,
decided to replicate

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,960
with multiple genetic
and chromosomal
abnormalities.

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,120
They don't care

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,480
what Kelly had for 
breakfast or whether
she's pregnant or...

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,880
They only care about
invading healthy tissue.

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,360
And all I care about
is trying to stop them.

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,680
It's Kate.

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,880
Her name's Kate Larson.

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
Oh. Oh.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,080
Then this will make an amusing
anecdote, won't it?

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,360
Yes, it will.

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,120
But I mean what I say.
Treat the disease.

56
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
Kate.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Your seizure was caused 
by a high-grade tumor,

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
which means it's
moving very quickly.

59
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,440
It's also involved in Broca's area,

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,600
which complicates...

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not getting radiation.

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,160
Honey, let them talk, okay?

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,480
Well, she's a step ahead.

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
But we're talking
about surgery.

65
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,080
No. We can't
remove this type of tumor surgically.

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,520
Not from this part
of the cortex.

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
The damage from surgery
would make things worse rather than better.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,120
It could impact
her language,

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,360
cognitive skills,

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,720
but surgery's not
the only option.

71
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,440
If I get the radiation,
I lose the baby.

72
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,400
That's right.

73
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,200
Okay, this is difficult
to accept, Mrs. Larson,

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,240
but you're not due for six months.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,760
If you don't
get radiation,

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,200
you may not live that long.

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,800
I appreciate

78
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,320
what you're
saying, I do,

79
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,720
but I'm not going
to lose this baby.

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
So I'll take my chances.

81
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,640
Guys, it's not a hard
decision for me.

82
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,040
Then we'll support it.

83
00:03:50,520 --> 00:04:05,200
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

84

<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@XXY Sync:FRM@Uranus</font>

85
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,480
MAN:
<i>She's seizing.</i></i>

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
???

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,080
Nurse! Nurse!

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,960
???

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm going to go out
to get a posh coffee.
Does anyone want one?

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
Everything okay?

91
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,080
Hmm? Oh, yes.

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,320
Do join us,
Dr. Holland.

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,520
I think that Dr. Seger has
finished his critique

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,680
of my handling
of this case.

95
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,920
I'm sorry you missed that.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,760
I didn't mean to...

97
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,760
Mrs. Larson's having
drop attacks which are 
rapidly becoming more frequent;

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,000
one every three hours
and the seizures are cutting oxygen off
to her baby.

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Anticonvulsants?

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
Mm-hmm. She's maxed out
on two of them.

101
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
The seizures continue, I'll
consider a corpus callosotomy,

102
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,520
and you'll monitor side-effects.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
What was your problem?

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
It's the tumor killing her.

105
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,840
She could miscarry whether
or not she gets radiation.

106
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,760
You think we should convince her
to give up her baby?

107
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Well, I think we should
take a position.

108
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,600
And if the radiation
doesn't work?

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,880
How are you gonna explain
that to Mrs. Larson

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,200
after she's given up her child?

111
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,440
What I'd say to her
isn't the point.

112
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,040
This woman is facing a decision 
that has no right answer.

113
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,680
And the only thing
that she's got going for her

114
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,960
is that she's made a choice
and she's at peace with it.

115
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,400
And you want to take
that away from her?

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,240
Don't answer.

117
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,720
Okay.

118
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
He means well.

119
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,960
It's easy to be a saint.

120
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,080
Do you know if we're
allowed to use cell
phones in here?

121
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,720
I mean in the hospital.

122
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,720
Officially, no.

123
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,160
Well, that would imply that you use one
unofficially.

124
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,360
I have no comment.

125
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
So some guy's heart-lung
machine goes out

126
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,120
and basically
it's your fault.

127
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,880
(elevator door opens)

128
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,120
Nice to meet you.

129
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,920
You, too.

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
Oh, thanks.
You are so sweet

131
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,000
for thinking of me.
What's with them?

132
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,680
Oh, Trauma brought in
a homicide suspect.

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
Always a lot
of paperwork.

134
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,960
Men in uniform.

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,040
Oh, and I thought 
mind control didn't work.

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,120
You know, I don't want some
superficial display

137
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,120
of power and authority
to have this effect.

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,080
Mmm...

139
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,520
How do you do that?

140
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,040
HANSON:
You've decided to forgo radiation for
the tumor.

141
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,800
But there is another
decision that has
to be made.

142
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,520
And that's how
we going to treat
these seizures.

143
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,320
Okay.
Right.

144
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Well, during
a drop-seizure,

145
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,640
synchronous electrical waves
pass back and forth

146
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,440
from one side of the brain
to the other, and they do this

147
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,960
via this dense bundle of nerves
called the corpus callosum,

148
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,080
which is this right here.
See this pink?

149
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,440
If we cut this neural bridge between
the two hemispheres...

150
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,960
the seizures will stop.

151
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,800
Cut the brain... in half.

152
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,720
Yes.
Is this permanent?

153
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,240
It is.
And this doesn't
affect the tumor,

154
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,320
it only stops the seizures?
Right.

155
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Well, the seizures
are dangerous.

156
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,760
For the baby.
I know, but what about you?

157
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,000
Right? This is
major surgery.

158
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,280
The seizures are dangerous
for both of them.Remember that.

159
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
When-when you cut
the callosum...

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,080
Callosum
callosum, uh...

161
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,160
what are the side effects?

162
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, normally the left
brain tells the right
brain what to do.

163
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,280
After the surgery,
you'll find that

164
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,320
that is not the case.
You'll probably find

165
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,600
that one half of your body
is going to be

166
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,320
slower to react than the other.

167
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,040
But I'll be able to move, yes?

168
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,360
And-and... walk and think?

169
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,520
That's the idea.

170
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,080
Think about it.

171
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,880
Do we know what ppened?

172
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,880
Had an argument
with his neighbor.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,600
A guy playing his
stereo too loud.

174
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,960
And the neighbor shot him?

175
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,240
No, Mr. Marks here
shot the neighbor,

176
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
killed him, and
then shot himself.

177
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,560
God, that explains the cop.

178
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,920
Any alcohol, drugs?

179
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,640
No, he's totally clean.

180
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,920
That's his girlfriend.

181
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
Where, her?

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,960
Sitting down?

183
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,520
I think so.

184
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,760
Her name is Mary.

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,320
Mary?
Yes?

186
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,680
Dr. Seger. I thought you'd
want an update on James.

187
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,120
Oh, we met on the elevator.

188
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,800
Right.
The rebel cell
phone user.

189
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,000
So you're
James's girlfriend?

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm what?

191
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
Oh, I was told...

192
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,720
I'm his lawyer.
(laughs) Oh,

193
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,000
so you thought that while my
boyfriend was in the ICU,

194
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,040
I was winking at guys
on the elevator.

195
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,560
Were you winking?

196
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,240
No, I was not.

197
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,960
So, James has fluid pressure
building inside his head.

198
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
We'll need to relieve
that tonight.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
And what are his chances of recovering?

200
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
Well, we don't know the extent of the damage
yet;

201
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,000
he probably won't be conscious for a while.

202
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,920
Is there someone
we should contact,his family...?

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,840
Yeah, his father's in a Florida
retirement home.

204
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
That's who
hired my firm.

205
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
I will let him know
what's happening.

206
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,680
They allow cell phones
in the waiting room.

207
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
So, Kate, this is Dr. Kim,the one here
with the retro glasses.

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,760
I'm putting sedative
into your IV.

209
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,600
Wait.

210
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm, I'm sorry.

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm... I'm a little freaked out.
It's okay.

212
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
We don't have to do
anything until you're ready.

213
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
Okay? Take your time.

214
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,520
What does it feel like?

215
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,280
What?

216
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,000
When you wake up and...

217
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,760
the two sides of your brain 
aren't connected anymore.

218
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,360
We had one patient
who said it was, um...

219
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,760
it was as though she had been
living with a roommate all her life,

220
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,760
 and she'd finally
gotten her own apartment.

221
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,960
You're joking.

222
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
No, I'm not, I'm serious.

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,720
Oh, this is so weird.
I know.

224
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,960
You'll be all right.

225
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,160
Okay...

226
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,280
I'm ready.

227
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,640
Okay.
Here comes the anesthetic.

228
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Which leg are we
taking off again?

229
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
(chuckles)

230
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,880
Funny every time,??

231
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,520
One piece, on the surface,

232
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,920
in the subarachnoid.
Pretty lucky.

233
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
Yeah, probably not
what he was thinking

234
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,920
when he shot himself.

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,720
"Gee, I hope I don't
do any damage."

236
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,560
I meant lucky for us.

237
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,040
You see anything else?

238
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,400
Yeah, there's that.

239
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,440
And what is that?

240
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,280
It's...

241
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,680
not the point of entry...?

242
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
All right, look at it here.

243
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,720
Oh, hematoma.

244
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
Mm-hmm. This one's
a bridging vein

245
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
with a slow leak.

246
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,560
Wait. Nothing to do
with the gunshot?

247
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,480
Separate deal?
New hematomas are white.

248
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,600
This one's black,
so it's chronic.

249
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,840
Could've been
there for years.

250
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,120
Ever had your own
head scanned?

251
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,040
No way.

252
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,760
Don't want to know.

253
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,800
Oh, Dr. Seger.
Morning, Lani.

254
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,800
I scheduled a block
in O.R. One for your surgery.
Oh, thanks.

255
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,920
You should be out in
time for a late dinner.
Great.

256
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,120
In case you have a date.
Excuse me?

257
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,800
Well, I could recommend some
nice places, too, in case...

258
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,320
you really are
on the rebound.

259
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,320
Right.

260
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,280
Thank you.

261
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,520
Hey, when you see Doug,

262
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,280
tell him our gunshot also has a chronic
subdural hematoma.

263
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,320
I'll fix it when I
go in for the bullet.

264
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,720
Better discuss it
with the patient's lawyer.

265
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Is my personal lif
some sort of Web-cam?

266
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,800
Did you ask her out?
What?

267
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
First of all, I don't
even know if she's single.

268
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
Really.
Yeah, and I need
some time.

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm still getting over Vicky.

270
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,600
You think you
need time,

271
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,080
but we don't choose
who we're attracted
to, or when.

272
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,800
It's not about
what's good for us.

273
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,520
It's the survival
of the species.

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
It's pheromones.

275
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,240
Pheromones?

276
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
We sniff out the best genetic
matchup for our children,

277
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,840
even if it's someone we
know is a complete idiot.

278
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,480
That's romantic.

279
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,760
Which is why after sex,

280
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
many couples have
nothing to talk about.

281
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,520
"Has it not been observed
how after copulation,

282
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,560
the Devil's laughter
can be heard?"

283
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,280
Okay, who said that?

284
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,640
Schopenhauer.

285
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,240
Also Wilt Chamberlain.
Right.

286
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,120
Okay, well, I'll try not to be
led around by my pheromones.

287
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,880
You'reissing the point.
And what? What is your point?

288
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,080
To resist is futile.

289
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
I could try a cartwheel.
(giggles)

290
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,840
Well, let's hold off
on that.

291
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,520
Kate?
Yes?

292
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,960
Tell him.

293
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,880
My left hand shook a little bit.

294
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,960
Tremor.
Twice. Just... for a moment.

295
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,360
Is it the tumor causing that
or the surgery?

296
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,080
It's hard to say.
Honey,

297
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,400
the seizures are under
control, the baby's okay.

298
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,840
That's the whole
point of this.

299
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you.

300
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,560
So surgery... on James...

301
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
Tuesday.
1:00 p.m.

302
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,080
1:00 p.m.

303
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,520
Oh!

304
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
(laughs):
You, uh...

305
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,280
you bring your office
with you.

306
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,840
I just came from court.

307
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,720
Highly important case.
What's that?

308
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm suing my husband
for divorce.

309
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,560
Oh. Sorry.

310
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,320
Eh. Years of marriage,

311
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
I never thought
it would come to this.

312
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
You're not married,
are you?
No.

313
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,760
Uh, going through a breakup--
<i>went</i> through.</i>

314
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
Uh, something.

315
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
Ah. In court I
kept thinking

316
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,560
how good it's gonna
feel to be alone,

317
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,800
at least for a while.

318
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,280
You know,

319
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,120
just take care of me.

320
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,520
I feel exactly the same way.

321
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,400
(music playing quietly)

322
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,760
A coworker of
mine would say

323
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,120
that our attraction to each
other is out of our control.

324
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,720
And why is that?

325
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,040
Survival of
the species.
Mm.

326
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,960
We find a good genetic
mate, our brain releases attraction chemicals--

327
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,800
that way our children--

328
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
I mean, our hypothetical
children...

329
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,400
Whether or not
you want children...
Are we having this conversation?

330
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,680
My coworker explains it better.

331
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,760
So I'm given by forces
beyond my control?

332
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,400
'Cause that's how it feels.

333
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,960
I guess we don't
really have a choice.
Mm-mm.

334
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
Kate...

335
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,160
I'm Dr. Flores.
Hi.

336
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,200
Dr. Hanson wanted
to make sure

337
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,920
everything's kosher
with the baby, which,

338
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
of course,
it will be.
Should I lie down?

339
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,840
Um, no. Take that off.

340
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,920
And I'm gonna put
some gel on your belly.

341
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,440
It'll feel
a little cold.
Hm.

342
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
Everything all right?

343
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm, uh... I'm not

344
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,840
doing this
on purpose.
Doing what?

345
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,240
Zipping it up.

346
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,080
I don't... I don't mean to.

347
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
Come sit on the bed.

348
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,240
(exhales):
Uh...

349
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,880
I can't move my leg.

350
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,400
Um... what's happening?
Page Dr. Hanson.

351
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,160
It's okay.

352
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:16,720
What's the matter?
It's okay.

353
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,840
(cries out)
Just relax. Relax...

354
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm not doing this!

355
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,600
it's ok

356
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,040
Dennis?

357
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,960
I need my other medication,
the Lamotrigine.

358
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,880
(sighs)

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,520
(yells)

360
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,080
(slow, steady beeping)

361
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,280
SEGER:
Mr. Marks, we're scheduled

362
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,520
to get that bullet
out of your head tomorrow.

363
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,560
We're also gonna drain
the subdural hematoma, okay?

364
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,680
He said he had some
pain in his face.

365
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
Uh, James, can you show me...

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
Come near me and I'll rip
your throat out of your head!

367
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,280
So the baby's okay?

368
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,920
Yes.
You said Kate
might have

369
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,040
lessened control
over one side, but...

370
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,160
is this unusual?

371
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,120
Her left side seems

372
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
to have a mind
of its own.
It does.

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,560
Each brain
hemisphere controls

374
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,560
the opposite side
of the body.

375
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,880
Right brain controls
left side, and vice versa.

376
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,640
Both brain hemispheres
are almost identical.

377
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,080
They're interested
in different things.

378
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,680
Left likes to be logical,
and the right side
is more emotional.

379
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,320
Well, that's
an oversimplification...

380
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,880
You're saying that we have
 different people in our heads?

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,960
Yeah.
No.

382
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,920
Well, anyway...

383
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,040
No, the left brain is dominant,

384
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,000
tells the right brain
what to do,

385
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,800
 it says,"Back off, I'm in charge,"
but in your case,

386
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,280
those signals are not getting
across to the right brain.

387
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
So the right brain...

388
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,600
Does what it wants.

389
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,040
And what does it want?

390
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,760
We store language
in the left brain,

391
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,760
so it's hard to ask
the right brain...

392
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,120
...what it's thinking.

393
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,000
Does it get better?

394
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,480
Sometimes.
Sometimes.

395
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,360
SEGER:
Hey.

396
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,080
Is this okay?
It's perfect. I got an hour
and about three minutes.

397
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,720
Yeah, I got an hour.
When I first got
here,

398
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,960
 I thought maybe we should just go
to my place, but then I
thought, no, this is good.

399
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,840
We'll be grown-ups
and have lunch.
Yeah, I've heard people do this.

400
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,440
They-they sit at tables
and they eat food...

401
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,040
Yeah. With their
clothes on.
(laughs):

402
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,040
The-the restaurant's
supposed to be great.
I heard that.

403
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,760
How hungry are you?
I had a big breakfast.

404
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,480
Me, too.

405
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,920
HOLLAND:
You know Adam Serkov?

406
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,600
HANSON:
Mm.

407
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,480
He developed a way of
communicating directly with the right brain--

408
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
I was thinking
it could work with Kate.
To what end?

409
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,920
Well... we might learn
what her right brain
was experiencing.

410
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,520
Why would we want to?

411
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,440
I mean, doesn't she
have enough problems?

412
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,400
If there's
no scalpel involved,

413
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,320
you think it's fringy
neurologist voodoo.

414
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,840
No... I-I do, but that's
not why I'm against it.

415
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,000
I mean, you're not just
pasting electrodes on college kids,

416
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
 you know,
for some experiment.

417
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,160
You're talking
about doing research on a pregnant woman

418
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
who has
a grade-three astrocytoma.

419
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,120
Where is the benefit
to the patient?

420
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,120
(laughs):
I feel bad for him.

421
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,200
For James?

422
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,400
Well, he <i>is</i> my client.</i>

423
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,320
And guaranteed, he's gonna have
some violent outburst

424
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
in the courtroom
and scare the jury.

425
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,680
(laughs):
He could be nicer by the
time you go to trial.

426
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,240
And why is that?

427
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,920
Well, the blood clot's
pressing on his frontal lobe,

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,920
which can make
people aggressive.

429
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,920
If we drain it, it
might mellow him out.

430
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,280
Here's hoping.

431
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,240
So, uh, you know that thing
your coworker says

432
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,320
about how we hooked up because
of genetic compatibility?

433
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,440
Yeah.
I'd take that off your list of things

434
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,960
 to tell a girl
after having sex.

435
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,360
(laughs):
Hey, of everyone
I work with,

436
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,360
I'm the one who thinks
there's more between people

437
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
than chemicals and neurons.

438
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,320
More between us?

439
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,720
S-Sure.

440
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,760
I'm gonna be late.

441
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,800
Me, too.

442
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,800
Lift both arms.

443
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,360
Both arms.

444
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
Is the left not up?

445
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,920
Not yet.

446
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,000
Now it is.
(groans)

447
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,280
I wish I knew
what was going on over there.

448
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,080
There is a way
of finding out.

449
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,520
What do you mean?

450
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
It's experimental.

451
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,080
I'm not exactly sure
what you'd get out of it.

452
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
Hey, Dr. Seger.
Eddie!

453
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,760
Where's that going?
Helping Dr. Holland.

454
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,680
This is wild, man.
What's that?

455
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,280
All right, the lady with
the... callosotomy.
Right.

456
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,840
She's answering questions
directly from her right brain.

457
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,320
It's crazy, man.
Wait a minute,
is this Kate Larson?

458
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,360
HOLLAND:
She's wearing
special contact lenses

459
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,400
to block half
of her vision field.

460
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,320
We leave out a key
word in each question,
show it to her on a card

461
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,800
so that only her right brain
gets the whole question.

462
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,520
How does she respond?
Her left hand.

463
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,520
First she was writing,
now she's typing.

464
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,160
Have you told Doug?

465
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,160
Mm.

466
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,600
Great.
Mm.

467
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,560
I know Doug-- he'll forgive us
if we learn something useful.

468
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,120
Yeah, and if you don't?

469
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,800
A little ambience?

470
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
Do you want to watch or not?

471
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,080
Next question.

472
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,240
What is your favorite...

473
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,880
COMPUTER VOICE:
Green.

474
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,320
KATE:
W-Wait, what was

475
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,680
on the card, color?

476
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,120
'Cause green is not
my favorite color.

477
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,680
It is on the right side,
apparently.
(laughs)

478
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,840
HOLLAND:
Tell me your least favorite...

479
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,920
COMPUTER VOICE:
Brussel sprouts.

480
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
(laughs):
Mm, well, we can
agree on that.

481
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,880
Name me something
that makes you...

482
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,000
Ocean.

483
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Something that makes you...

484
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,640
Baby.

485
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,040
Ah. What did
the card say?

486
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,440
HOLLAND:
Let's keep going.

487
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,520
Why does baby make you...

488
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,800
need radiation

489
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,840
It's Dr. Holland.

490
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,200
Yeah?

491
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,400
What?

492
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,880
When did you do that?

493
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
(groans)

494
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,720
(quiet chuckle):
She's still talking.

495
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,680
Hang it up.

496
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,800
Doug.

497
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,760
Are you planning
to publish? Huh?

498
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,120
I think you should--

499
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,680
and I hope that your
 results are a boon
to the scientific community,

500
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,080
because they are absolutely
no use to Mrs. Larson.

501
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,880
Her-her right brain was
telling her something.
Mm-hmm.

502
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
Sounds crazy, but it was
helpful for her to hear.

503
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,600
She already had
a difficult choice,

504
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,960
and then you gave her
the impression

505
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
that her right brain
disagrees.
Well, because it does.

506
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
She lost control
of her left side

507
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,600
when she got an ultrasound
of the baby.

508
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
And I don't think
that's just a coincidence.

509
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,560
Do you think
that every time the right brain interferes

510
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,040
with some pearl of wisdom,
some indisputable truth
from the subconscious?

511
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,880
Maybe.
But what is that
based on?

512
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,680
If there's a part of Kate
that's unhappy...

513
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,200
Then that half of her brain
should go and get therapy.

514
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,160
She can call my ex-wife.

515
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,200
But from now on,

516
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
why don't we just try to cure
the patients with tumors,

517
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,200
as opposed
to confuse them, okay?

518
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,280
No, no, no, it's okay.
I'll do it.

519
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
We've been talking, and...

520
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,640
we'd like to
reconsider radiation.

521
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,680
I don't know what I want.
Come on, we
discussed this.

522
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,360
Look, I know

523
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,520
that Dr. Holland's experiment

524
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,080
has led to some
frank discussion,
and that's... good.

525
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,600
But I would like
to point out

526
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,040
that you do not have to
listen to your right brain.

527
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,640
It has no legal rights.

528
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,320
And... frankly, I
think it's overrated.

529
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,360
I mean, all these
books about... how to
get in touch with it,

530
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,840
how to paint with it,
how to have sex with it,

531
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,880
how to, you know, I mean,
look, the truth is--

532
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
and I'm speaking to
your left brain now--

533
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,280
there is only
one hemisphere
that can be boss,

534
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,320
and that's the hemisphere

535
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,000
that can speak
and sign consent forms.

536
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,800
Y... Yes, but you said that-that
the right brain was emotional.

537
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,160
No. I never said that.
Isn't that the side that
would know what I'm feeling?

538
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,200
No. Your emotions are
gerated at the base

539
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,160
of the brain in
the limbic system,

540
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
and they're shared on both sides.
Well, so could both sides
be feeling scared and...

541
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,040
and only one side know why?

542
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,880
Y-Yes. Theoretically, yes.

543
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,240
I want to be a person who could
never give up her child.

544
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,200
I know.

545
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,040
Maybe...

546
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,320
...maybe that's not who I am.

547
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,280
What exactly is the nature
of your relationship

548
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,160
with James Marks's lawyer?

549
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,440
You've been talking
to Adrianne.

550
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,160
Actually, no.

551
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,960
For years my client has had
a blood clot

552
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,800
pushing on his frontal lobe.

553
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,560
This condition is known to cause
violent fits of aggression.

554
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,920
It's our believe that Mr. Marks
was wholly under the influence of this condition

555
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,080
when he shot Mr. Connell

556
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,760
and is not responsible
for his actions.

557
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,400
Please tell me this is
only on the Web site.
It aired this morning.

558
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
This would be
an important precedent,

559
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,920
an example of the legal system
keeping pace with science.

560
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,560
The blood clot was diagnosed
earlier this week

561
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,480
by a surgeon
at Hanson Neurological.

562
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,240
(bangs desk)

563
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,960
I need to talk to Doug.

564
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,320
Go ahead.

565
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,840
What I can't figure out

566
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,880
is how come I've been
getting so many calls

567
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,320
and they're all
wrong numbers?

568
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,880
What did they want?

569
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,200
Uh, some unnamed doctor
made a statement

570
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,840
to the press
about a blood clot?

571
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,880
Let's see, the <i>Times</i>
called, the <i>Post,</i></i>

572
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,560
Channel One-- oh, and
the New York District
Attorney's Office.

573
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,800
And they want this doctor
to come in for a deposition.

574
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,280
Does Hanson know about this?

575
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
He doesn't ask
about wrong numbers.

576
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,200
If you want to
go in still...

577
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,280
Maybe later.

578
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,440
Mm-hmm.

579
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,560
Thank you.

580
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,600
(footsteps approaching)

581
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,440
(light knock on door)

582
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,040
I came to apologize.

583
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,600
Did you.

584
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,800
I thought the experiment
would be helpful...

585
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,600
or at least harmless,
but you're right,

586
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,520
it was research
for its own sake.

587
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,000
??

588
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,480
and without clearance
from the institutional
review board.

589
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,920
Yeah.

590
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,680
And you feel terrible about it,
don't you?

591
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,640
I do.

592
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,040
Did you tape the session
with Mrs. Larson?

593
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,000
Well, <i>I'd</i> like to see it.</i>

594
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,240
Tell me your
least favorite...

595
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,600
(Kate typing)

596
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,600
COMPUTER VOICE:
Brussel sprouts.

597
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,080
KATE (laughs):
Mm, well, we can agree on that.

598
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,960
HOLLAND:
Name me something
that makes you...

599
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,760
COMPUTER VOICE:
Ocean.

600
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,360
Something that
makes you...

601
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,080
COMPUTER VOICE:
Baby.

602
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,360
KATE:
Ah. What was on the card?

603
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,680
Dr. Hanson?

604
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,920
I'm going home,

605
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
unless you need
something else.

606
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,400
Did you find what you
were looking for on that tape?

607
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,800
Yes, um,
but I will have to talk to Kate Larson

608
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,320
at some point tomorrow.

609
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,080
All right.

610
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,120
I'll walk you out.

611
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,640
Well, you don't have to do that.

612
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,560
No, it's my pleasure.

613
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,040
Well, we still
have cops in ICU,

614
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,080
but it's nice to see
a little chivalry.

615
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
(chuckles):
Leave it, it's fine.
Don't worry, it's okay.

616
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,920
I used to hate being
alone at night. Ugh!
Yeah?

617
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,520
Afraid of the dark?
Who isn't?

618
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
My father came home
from a trip once

619
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,480
with a bunch
of aboriginal masks,

620
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,200
hung them around
the apartment.

621
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,120
I still think of them
when the lights go out.

622
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,440
(chuckling):
Shall we?

623
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,560
Thanks again.

624
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,640
Mm-hmm.

625
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,760
Morning.

626
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,200
Hey.

627
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,640
Sleep well?

628
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,440
You're funny.

629
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,360
Hanson find out about
the press conference?

630
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,880
My hope is that he was
so exhausted last night,

631
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,000
he didn't have the energy

632
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,320
to pull the rubber band
off his newspaper.

633
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,560
Yeah. Let's hope his TV, radio
and telephone were busted, too.

634
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,960
Did you talk to her?

635
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,040
No, not yet.

636
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,800
Mm. Well, it could've
been worse.

637
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,600
How?

638
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,640
Well, the
shooter's lawyer

639
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,360
could've been a big, fat guy,

640
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,680
and now you'd have to
go break up with <i>him.</i></i>

641
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,320
I'm sorry I'm late.
Doesn't really matter,

642
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,400
'cause I couldn't be more
annoyed than I already was.

643
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,040
You say that my client
was driven to murder

644
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,000
by a leaky valve
in his head.

645
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm supposed to keep
that a secret?

646
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,760
I said it might
make him aggressive.

647
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,640
<i>Might.</i></i>

648
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,080
You said
there was a precedent for
a blood clot.

649
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,600
No, no, I didn't use
the word "precedent."

650
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,480
I don't use that word.

651
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,040
You implied...

652
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,600
Anyway, save it for your
big moment in court

653
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,640
or when you're on TV,

654
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,120
but leave me out of it!

655
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,080
You think this was
a career move?

656
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,120
Uh, Yeah. Yes, I do.

657
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,360
My job is to do everything
I can to defend this guy,

658
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,240
just like it's
your job to do

659
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,680
everything you can
to patch up his head.

660
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,240
It's a little
different.

661
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,200
 How?How is it
different?

662
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,320
Do you believe the blood clot
made him do it?

663
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,560
If you knew
anything about law,

664
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,760
you would know that what I
believe is beside the point.

665
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,160
And you're the one
who rants on about brain chemicals

666
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,520
and
how they make us do things.

667
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,120
Well, now I regret it.

668
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,160
I regret some things, too.

669
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,520
Doctor.

670
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Shouldn't you be in surgery or something?

671
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,920
(chuckling):
Well...

672
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,960
maybe we'll have class
outside today.

673
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,080
(laughs)

674
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,240
How are you feeling?

675
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,760
Good.

676
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,440
Look, Kate, I wanted
to talk to you...

677
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,960
because there is a
third option here.

678
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,760
You have an exceedingly
rare ability

679
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,080
to handle language
with your right brain--

680
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,840
more than we ever could
have known or expected.

681
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,280
You can combine words,
you can write,

682
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,600
you can... type responses.

683
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,280
which means that if we remove
this tumor surgically,

684
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,000
you most likely
are going to be able

685
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,320
to retain a lot
of those functions,

686
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
at least partially.

687
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,640
What will I lose?

688
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,280
Language.

689
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,600
I w-won't be able to speak?

690
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,560
Not ever?

691
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,480
No.

692
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,600
But...

693
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,960
you <i>could</i> be around 
when your kid starts to.</i>

694
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,960
Want to turn a boneflap?

695
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,920
Sure.

696
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,240
I like the
confidence.

697
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
I've used these tools before.

698
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,400
(device buzzing)

699
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,920
In fifth grade, when I made
my mother a bookshelf.

700
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,560
How'd it come out?

701
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
Lopsided.

702
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,400
That was fifth grade.

703
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,440
It's really grown in.

704
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,440
I know. A highly
vascular tumor.

705
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,960
We'll be
treading lightly.

706
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,840
You with me?

707
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,840
I am.
Okay.

708
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,200
Arterial branches
here... here...

709
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,640
probably underneath
from the sylvian fissure.

710
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,200
We'll try and avoid those.

711
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,000
Barely pierced the dura.

712
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,880
Let's give him
some manitol. Saline.

713
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,640
It's out.

714
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,760
Bullet fell out.

715
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,280
I kill myself getting
his skull open.

716
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,040
You step in,

717
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,360
the slug falls
in your hand.

718
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,240
All about timing.

719
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,000
(clink)

720
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,800
Okay, I'm gonna cut underneath.

721
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,320
I need you to put a cicada clip
right here on the MCA feeder.

722
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,680
The clip just...

723
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,360
I think it ripped the artery.

724
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,560
HANSON:
Okay.

725
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,720
Dr. Kim, I have
some bleeding.

726
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,960
I've got two units ready.

727
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,680
Okay, can you type and
cross two more, please?

728
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,920
I was putting
the clip underneath.

729
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,240
Suction, please. Suction.
Pressure's low.

730
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,480
Mm-hmm. Okay. All right.

731
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,400
Give me a clip. I gotta
stop the blood flow.

732
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,320
Clipping the MCA here.

733
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
Doctor... Aspirate.

734
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,680
All right.

735
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,360
I need to attach a
temporal artery bypass.

736
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,640
The clip's pretty low.

737
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,560
I can't think of a better
way, can you?

738
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,200
What are you saying?

739
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,920
She's paralyzed?

740
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,880
Kate suffered an arterial
tear during surgery

741
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,800
and we had to stop the
blood supply to her brain

742
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,120
for about two minutes
in order to make a bypass.

743
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
DENNIS:
So not only can she not speak,

744
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,760
she can't move.

745
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,800
At this point, no.

746
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,240
It may not
be permanent.

747
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,400
May not?

748
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,240
May not be permanent.

749
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,320
I should
have stopped this.

750
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,440
And the baby?

751
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,080
The baby's fine.

752
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,360
Baby's fine.

753
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,360
Okay, why don't you just...
try to get some rest?

754
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,080
And I will check back
in a little bit.

755
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,520
All right?
I'll be around.

756
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,680
Oh. Thank you.

757
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,840
Tell them they
can't do this.

758
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,560
They're taking him
to the prison hospital.

759
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,320
Look, he's okay to go.

760
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,360
There's nothing I can do.

761
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,240
The deal was that
he stays here

762
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,040
until all critical health conditions
have been addressed.

763
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,400
Do they look addressed to you?

764
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,920
Doc.

765
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,120
I'm sorry. James?

766
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,520
Did you just say something?

767
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,360
Appreciate what
you did for me.

768
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,200
Sorry, I... flipped out on you.

769
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,200
That's okay, James.

770
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,080
You're welcome.

771
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,120
You did it.

772
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,560
You made him nice.

773
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,160
Uh, I'm not sure I
should take credit.

774
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,480
Did you hear him?

775
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Like he'd been
to finishing school.

776
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Well, I hope it helps
with your case.

777
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,600
We can't use the blood clot
thing in court.

778
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,320
Why not?

779
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,200
According to the judge,

780
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,120
 we're responsible for our decisions
regardless of biochemistry.

781
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,120
Unless we're insane.

782
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,640
But we're not, are we?

783
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,840
Just reckless.

784
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,680
Take care.

785
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,840
??

786
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,160
How are you
doing, Kate?

787
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,040
She's moving
both hands.

788
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,080
She's not paralyzed.

789
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,800
That's wonderful.
Nice going, honey.

790
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,840
* *

791
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,880
No date tonight?
No date.

792
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,760
What happened to that
attractive lawyer?

793
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,440
Complete
disintegration.

794
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,320
Doug?

795
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,720
That lawyer--

796
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,120
you probably heard
she was on the news.

797
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,600
I did.

798
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
So do you believe that
there's a subconscious?

799
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,520
I mean, really, that there's
this other intelligence

800
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,800
there inside of us?

801
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,560
Not where I thought
you were going.

802
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,600
And?

803
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,680
Uh, well, you know,

804
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,880
I think that Freud was wrong
about some things,

805
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,480
but the right hemisphere
is pretty mysterious.

806
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,520
I mean, how do you
explain dreams? Uh...

807
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,480
inspiration?

808
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,880
Random firing of neurons.

809
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,480
If you're so sure,
then why did you ask?

810
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,440
See you in the morning.

811
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,200
'Night.

812
00:36:52,280 --> 00:37:02,080
