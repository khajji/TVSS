Ah, love.

00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,638
It starts with a simple kiss.

3
00:00:09,707 --> 00:00:13,242
A kiss that ignites
a fire so powerful,

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,211
it threatens to engulf the
natural world within its white-

5
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:17,846
Do you mind?

6
00:00:17,914 --> 00:00:19,114
Sorry.

7
00:00:19,182 --> 00:00:20,682
I'm a romantic.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,118
OK.
Back to truth or dare.

9
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:25,453
We're still playing that?
I thought we were making out.

10
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:26,521
So you concede?

11
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:27,622
No way!

12
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:29,825
Hmm.

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,026
What is that?
Road kill?

14
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:34,095
Sorry, the
answer we're looking for

15
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:36,097
is what is
Jessie about to lick?

16
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:37,397
You're disgusting!

17
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:39,166
And you're stalling,
which would make me

18
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:40,801
by definition the
winner and you-

19
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:42,236
Aaaahhh.

20
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:45,906

00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,442
Yech.

23

You're up, Tom.
Truth or dare.

Uh, dare.

25
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:55,115
Interesting strategy.

26
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:58,484
Foolish, but interesting.

Dressing like a

nakedness.

Propose...

00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:29,747
Propose, propose.

39
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,185

we are best friends.

moths and lost the Big V to that guy at judo.

Well, there's plenty of secrets
left to uncover. Trust me.

170
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,575
Really? I'm pretty much
down to my last one.

171
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:20,509

172
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:21,477
No.

173
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:23,912
Maybe.

174
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,148
Are you sure you want to marry
the guy who made you eat mud?

00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:29,383
Actually, no.

176
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:33,387
But the guy who bought me gummy
bears after judo boy dumped me

177
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:38,726
and then changed everything
with one single unreal kiss.

178

208

209
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,680

gets when she smiles.

That I was suddenly hit with the possibility

I know it's real,

418
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:52,201

have a secret I can't tell

it doesn't matter, right?

can change that.

443
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:11,997
Both at the same time.

444
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:13,498
OK.

445
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:15,500
One, two...

I mean, not just now.

449

A while ago.

I'm totally over it.

454
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,122
Kinda weird without
the fence, huh.

455
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,258
Tom, say something.

456
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:51,234
Maybe a fence is just a fence and a dare...
is just a dare.

457
00:20:51,302 --> 00:20:53,902
So what do you want to do?

458
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,472
I think the answer's
pretty clear.
