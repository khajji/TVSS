00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,991
Nothing. He's just pissed that

We all discussed it and
decided it was for the best.

98
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:14,983
You didn't discuss it with me.

99
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:16,084
Me neither.

100
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:17,585

it was for the best.

102

We're not getting an annulment.

106
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,394
Yeah. We didn't make this
decision lightly, you know.

107
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:27,461
Oh, that's right.

108
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,130
It was a dare.

109
00:04:29,197 --> 00:04:31,565
Maybe it isn't such a bad idea
to get an annulment, Jess.

110

and see where it goes.

Wait a minute; that
is not what he meant!

So when Tom moves out, do
I get his room or what?

116
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,180
If you get Tom's room, I need yours.

117

You want to marry Carter, go ahead.

00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:01,493
No, wait.

Who is he is again?

133
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,616
He's our refugee from Iraq.

Why is he here?

135
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:29,420
My country has seen much

No!
No, I mean in our house.

Now.

138
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:37,027
Are you out of your mind?

00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:39,229
Tom and Jessie can't
live in the attic.

Ben. Your mother is not
coming back from Palm Beach.

142
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,869
She moved in with her
plastic surgeon, remember?

143
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:48,137
That man is not my father
and never will be.

144
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,439
Look. I don't like this
thing any more than you.

145
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:54,810
But at least this way we'll be able to keep an
eye on Tom, make sure he's hitting the books.

146
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:57,279
We'd get a pretty penny if
we rented that space out.

What would you rather invest in?

Real estate or your son?

149
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,583
Real estate's less risky.

150
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:04,052
Fine.

What about Grandma?

161

Sorry.

The point is we could get $800 a
month if we leased this place out.

But we'd rather have you

Someone's gettin' laid tonight.

477
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:27,906
The space thing.
Right.

478
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,242
Thanks, Carter.

479
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:35,212
Mr.
Bellow.

480
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,648
Mrs.
Bellow.

481
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:40,918
Look Jessie, I know Carter
will always be your first.

482
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:43,020
But you know what?

483
00:20:43,088 --> 00:20:44,555
I'm OK with that.

484
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,156
Really.

485
00:20:46,223 --> 00:20:47,390
Good.

486
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,725
Because he may be my first but um...

487
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:53,763
you, Tom Bellow, will
always be my last.

488
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,002
What were you saying about
christening the place?

489
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,866
Something's not working.

490
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,101
Should we put it back?

491
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,436
And admit your mother was right?

492
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,869
That'd be sending the wrong message.

493
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,338
Well, it's gotta fit somewhere.

494
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:17,608
Last time, I swear!
