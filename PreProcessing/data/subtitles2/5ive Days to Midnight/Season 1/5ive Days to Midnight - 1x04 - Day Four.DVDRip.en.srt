1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,875
It seems someone wants to hurt me.
We have the top homicide investigator--

2
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:11,981
- That means murder.
- I shot this from Claudia's gun

3
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,395
Claudia's got a gun?

4
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:16,112
And a husband that she's been
on the run from for the last two years

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,808
- Roy Bremmer.
- Professor, we need to talk

6
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:19,569
about my wife.
Her real name is Angela

7
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:21,493
Three times I find her,
three times she disappears

8
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:24,079
This time, if I lose Angela,
I'm coming after you

9
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,322
You're going to die... on Friday.
The physics demand it

10
00:00:26,391 --> 00:00:27,886
- Nonsense.
- What's happening, Pop?

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,775
We're going to do exactly what
Mandy Murphy did, only better

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,491
We're going to get far away
from our oak tree before it falls

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,765
Mandy Murphy was supposed to die
underneath that tree

14
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,167
But she didn't. She's alive and well
because I changed her destiny

15
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:39,477
which means
I can change my own

16
00:00:39,545 --> 00:00:42,840
We've got a multi.crash coming in.
We lost her on the way over

17
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:32,664
"I, John Tracy Neumeyer...

18
00:01:32,737 --> 00:01:36,928
being of sound mind

19
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:38,903
and body...

20
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:43,713
do declare the following
to be my last will and testament

21
00:01:43,778 --> 00:01:48,034
# Fare thee well... #

22
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,206
Everything I own,
I leave to my daughter--

23
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:56,993
Jesse Tracy Neumeyer

24
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:01,697
I name Dr. Dan Westville

25
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:06,588
and his wife, Jan Mercer Westville

26
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,110
the legal guardians for Jesse

27
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:13,445
And I also name Dan...

28
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,643
to be executor of my estate...

29
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:24,004
# Though I go 10,000 miles... #

30
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:30,852
# 10,000 miles #

31
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,151
# My own true love... #

32
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:41,286
Now Dan, this is crucial...

33
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,059
# 10,000 miles or more... #

34
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,427
Brad... Brad and Chantal

35
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:54,244
must never have access
to Jesse's trust. Never

36
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:01,770
And Jesse, it's really...
it's funny

37
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:04,805
because I never really
gave much thought to...

38
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,227
what was coming for you.

39
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:11,304
for us

40
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,125
# That long summer's day #

41
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:21,967
# Sitting on an ivy tree #

42
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:30,824
# She's looking for #

43
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,485
# Her own true love #

44
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:39,945
JT:
Driving you to your first dance

45
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,184
watching you graduate

46
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,674
walking you down the aisle...

47
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:51,630
I can't imagine that

48
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:13,203
You know, holding--
holding your newborn child

49
00:04:29,466 --> 00:04:34,224
# Oh, come ye back #

50
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:40,920
# My own true love... #

51
00:04:40,988 --> 00:04:43,093
JT:
Okay, I'm trying to think...

52
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:45,783
trying to think ofthe right thing
to say here, the fatherly thing

53
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,821
that's going to help you through
all those moments, but I can't

54
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:50,966
So I'm going
to tell you this, Jess.

55
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,405
You are stronger
than you think you are...

56
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:59,131
and you are smarter
than the rest of us put together

57
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,087
And Jess...

58
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,093
I guess the biggest thing
I want to say to you

59
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:06,235
is that you have
a huge capacity for love

60
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:09,501
and if you give that
to those who deserve it...

61
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,814
you'll always be okay

62
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:19,771
# You've been a friend to me. #

63
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,424
Jess?

64
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:21,443
I'm sorry. You were never
supposed to see that

65
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,374
Is it real?

66
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:47,369
It seems so

67
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,886
How do you know?

68
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:54,733
Well, you know,
things keep happening--

69
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,483
the storm

70
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,440
the oak tree

71
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,228
people changing...

72
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:04,942
Everything that's in that file,
it's come true

73
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:08,007
Everything?

74
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:09,838
So far

75
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,012
But...

76
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:14,286
the only way...

77
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:18,830
Are you saying this...

78
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,169
this is from the future?

79
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,243
Who sent it?

80
00:07:23,316 --> 00:07:25,455
I don't know

81
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:27,629
Why did they send it?

82
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,741
Well, you know...

83
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:35,570
I assumed it was
to help me stop all this

84
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:41,558
But now, I think, Jess...

85
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:45,006
that maybe it was--
it was to help me...

86
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,966
prepare

87
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,007
To prepare?

88
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,318
No, no, that's like giving up.
You can't give up

89
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,328
I mean, you can't
give up because...

90
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:00,468
I mean, whoever sent it
wouldn't have picked it out for you

91
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:03,670
unless if... unless
if you could change

92
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:06,967
They chose it for you because
they knew you could figure it out

93
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,817
Okay, okay

94
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:14,488
We have to fight.
I mean, "us" have to fight

95
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:18,899
You know?
Please

96
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,884
You are right

97
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:39,541
You're right.
We do, we do have to fight...

98
00:08:40,864 --> 00:08:43,319
or at least, I do.
You have to go to school

99
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,367
- No.
- Yeah

100
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,611
Claudia!

101
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:10,748
- Can you take Jess to school?
- Is she ready?

102
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,860
- Five minutes?
- Not soon enough

103
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:14,820
I've got urgent business

104
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,618
JT: Now, Jess, I need you to be
where I know you're safe

105
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:33,597
Jesse:
What if something happens to you?

106
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:36,257
It won't, it's Thursday.
Okay?

107
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,400
Come here

108
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:43,141
Please?

109
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,406
Fine, but don't expect me
to learn anything

110
00:10:41,201 --> 00:10:43,088
You're not supposed
to be here

111
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:45,837
Well, I can't get away.
I mean that literally-- I cannot run

112
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,946
so I'm going to deal
with this thing head-on

113
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:50,058
Meaning what?

114
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,553
I'm going to remove each suspect's
motive or opportunity to kill me

115
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:55,016
- Carl, Brad, Roy--
- Wait a minute

116
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,742
You can't just "cowboy up"
on a guy like Roy

117
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:59,503
You'll only get yourself killed
a day early

118
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,744
- So arrest him, put him in jail.
- On what grounds?

119
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:03,819
You know, maybe
I should put you in jail

120
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:05,648
for your own protection.
It sounds like I should

121
00:11:05,716 --> 00:11:07,408
No, listen, he would find
a way to get to me

122
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,364
Sikorski, someone
wants to kill me--

123
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:13,172
a deliberate act.
So that means I have to act first

124
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,816
All right, well,
we'll see you around-- I hope

125
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,222
Wait a minute

126
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,840
You left out a suspect

127
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,128
Claudia.
What are you going to do about her?

128
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,463
She's your weakness,
isn't she?

129
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,417
Claudia is the least
of my worries

130
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,329
Oh, please,
don't tell me you trust her

131
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:41,655
There's more to this
than just a marriage gone bad, JT

132
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,465
There's bigger things
at stake here

133
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,856
And what do you mean
by that?

134
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:54,866
There has to be

135
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:01,402
Listen, if Claudia
really wanted to kill me...

136
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:04,055
she's so good at hiding it, there'd be
nothing anyone could do about it

137
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,776
What you should be doing right now
is focusing on the real threat

138
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:08,668
which is the homicidal husband

139
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:11,189
Where is she?

140
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:14,459
Sikorski:
It's the weaknesses that get you

141
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,520
Okay Roy,
where is your weakness?

142
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:38,666
"Acquitted."

143
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,817
"Charges dropped."

144
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,627
"Acquitted again."

145
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:38,170
- Woman: Everett Hospital.
- Dr. Dan Westville, please

146
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:40,025
Announcer:
Your attention, please

147
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:43,443
Passengers are now boarding
at platform four...

148
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,933
This is Angela Bremmer.
I need to speak to Roy

149
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,264
Carl, we need to talk.
Maybe you could ride with me

150
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,244
while I run some errands.
I don't have much time

151
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,483
You talked yesterday about a rip
in the fabric of the universe

152
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,461
- Yes, if you don't die.
- What exactly does that mean?

153
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:52,423
I mean, scientifically?

154
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:55,008
Do the laws of physics get repealed
if I'm still alive on Saturday?

155
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,830
Does gravity cease?
Does "E" not equal "MC squared"?

156
00:16:57,896 --> 00:17:00,679
Well, impossible, yes,
if you apply the bootstrap paradox

157
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:02,982
but not if you include five-dimensional
supergravity-- I don't know!

158
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:05,188
Nobody does. The point is,
we can't afford to find out

159
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,624
Well, I intend to

160
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:09,577
Professor, has it occurred to you
that by fighting your destiny

161
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:11,529
you could make things worse?

162
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,482
Hmm-- what's worse
than a bullet in the head?

163
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,449
Not for you, for everyone
and everything around you

164
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:22,375
- Where are we going?
- Oh, I had a friend check my blood

165
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:24,713
against the blood found
on the bullet fragment in the case

166
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,187
so I'm going
to check the results--

167
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,878
That's a waste of time,
it matches, has to

168
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:31,080
You want to bet? No, I'm serious,
if the blood doesn't match

169
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,059
will you drop this whole thing
and leave me alone?

170
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:34,541
And if it does?

171
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:37,420
Well, then you have to do
what you have to do

172
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,373
JT:
You can stay here

173
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,373
or you can come with me
and check the results

174
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:57,999
My name is Jesse Neumeyer.
I need to see Tim

175
00:17:58,065 --> 00:17:59,526
He's the editor. It's urgent

176
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:02,635
"Jesse-bear"?
Come on up

177
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,785
What's the occasion?
Aren't you supposed to be at school?

178
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:11,371
You know, some things are just
more important than school

179
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:13,069
Oh. You have to
tell me all about it

180
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,082
I need to know what happened
to Mandy Murphy's dog

181
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:18,090
'cause it doesn't say

182
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,258
You're right, it doesn't

183
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,700
Jesse:
Are dogs allowed at funerals?

184
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:38,161
JT: Yeah, he said
we should wait in here

185
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,875
- I hate doctors' offices.
- Um-hmm

186
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,301
In-state school doctor. Nice

187
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:53,518
- You must be Carl.
- Yeah, I must be

188
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:55,218
What about
Professor Neumeyer's blood?

189
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:57,177
Does it match the blood
on the bullet? We have a bet

190
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,825
Carl, I'd like you to meet
Dr. Fontaine

191
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,411
- Why?
- Hi, Carl

192
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:11,990
Carl, I had no choice

193
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,672
Professor Neumeyer has expressed
a great concern about you, Carl

194
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,977
- No, he hasn't.
- He explained your condition

195
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:20,980
and in my opinion,
a 72-hour observation period

196
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:22,963
would be most beneficial right now

197
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:25,949
How dare you?

198
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:29,363
How can you do this to us,
to the world, to your own daughter?

199
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:32,439
You lying, backstabbing,
son of a bitch!

200
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,813
- Fontaine: Put Mr. Axelrod in three.
- I felt sorry for you, but now

201
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,766
now you deserve
what's coming!

202
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:38,719
- You deserve it!
- Come on

203
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:41,980
You deserve
what's coming to you!

204
00:19:47,297 --> 00:19:50,331
I owe you for this one

205
00:19:51,521 --> 00:19:55,832
Well, that's good, JT, because now
I have something to ask of you

206
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:57,630
Anything you want

207
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:04,282
You want to admit me
for observation?

208
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:06,243
- I want you to admit yourself.
- Oh, no. No, no, no

209
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:09,242
This will be completely confidential.
The university will never know

210
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:13,245
Dan, I know that this whole thing
sounds very crazy--

211
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:16,700
I did not say "crazy," I didn't
say that. I think it's just stress

212
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,683
It's the anniversary
of Katherine's death

213
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:22,533
you've got pressure at work
and it's all coming out in this delusion

214
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:25,598
about a mysterious prophecy
of your murder from outer space

215
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,599
No, not outer space, Dan,
it's from the--

216
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,447
Oh, jeez.
All right, listen--

217
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:35,399
why don't you call Brad?
Ask Brad. He'll tell you

218
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:40,708
I talked to Brad. He doesn't know
what the hell you're talking about

219
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,047
Ah...

220
00:20:53,066 --> 00:20:56,995
Now Dan, listen, you saw the bullet.
The bullet, it matches the blood

221
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:59,817
Jan and I will look after Jesse

222
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:03,681
You need to start
reducing the stress right now

223
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,418
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm going to do

224
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:11,427
JT?

225
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:16,810
All those Christmases in Hawaii,
all those ski trips to Aspen

226
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:19,945
they were all my treat.
They didn't cost you and Jesse a dime

227
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:23,212
Because you refused my money.
You always had to play Daddy Warbucks

228
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,384
Oh, for God's sake,
spare me the lecture

229
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:27,397
You know what really
pisses you off, JT?

230
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:29,577
Not that I'm in trouble, no

231
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:31,623
What pisses you off
is that I'm ambitious

232
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:35,658
I tried to reach for the sky and got
slammed for it and you love that

233
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:38,599
You love it because you gave up
reaching a long time ago

234
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:44,498
If you needed money,
all you had to do was ask

235
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,450
You know what I need

236
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:50,094
The briefcase?
The briefcase is yours

237
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:52,530
As soon as I am done with it,
you can reverse-engineer it

238
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:55,279
sell the technology,
keep the profits. I don't care

239
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:58,283
You see, Brad, all I care about
is staying alive

240
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:01,673
Staying alive?
JT-- JT!

241
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:06,869
You don't really believe that
I would try and kill you over this?

242
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:16,079
Be careful, he's falling apart

243
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:29,616
We'll get everything back
and more

244
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:31,445
I promise

245
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,652
Sure we will

246
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:39,897
Recording:
"Leave a message."

247
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:43,924
This is the Professor calling.
I have something for Roy

248
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:45,937
You can reach me

249
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:49,754
at 425.555.145...

250
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,290
# All alone #

251
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:03,733
# Out at sea #

252
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:06,773
# Drifting for days #

253
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:14,295
# It's hard to believe #

254
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:19,354
# That help is on the way...#

255
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,627
- Hello?
- Professor Neumeyer?

256
00:23:33,698 --> 00:23:35,585
This is Mrs. Strom,
the school secretary

257
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,374
Yes, yes, is Jesse okay?

258
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:41,054
Well, that's just it, we don't know.
She hasn't been in classes today

259
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:49,087
# Like the world #

260
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:54,717
# Circling the sun #

261
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:04,155
# Life goes on... #

262
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:09,122
Please...?

263
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:14,624
# Oh, life goes on... #

264
00:24:14,696 --> 00:24:16,256
Yes!

265
00:24:46,157 --> 00:24:48,645
- Yes?
- JT: Claudia, Jesse is missing

266
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,244
Claudia:
Jesse? How do you know?

267
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,172
JT: The school called, she
never went in. I need your help

268
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:54,310
She's such a smart kid, JT,
I'm sure she's fine

269
00:24:54,382 --> 00:24:56,968
Just stay right there.
I'm on my way

270
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:49,264
Dad!

271
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,538
Dad, Dad!

272
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,374
- Dad!
- Why did you skip school?

273
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:59,917
It said in the newspaper clipping that
Mandy Murphy and her pet dog

274
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,748
were killed by the tree,
but then you saved them

275
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,318
Nobody could tell me if the dog died
like he was supposed to

276
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:09,076
Then it said in the newspaper about
the funeral, so I went to find out

277
00:26:09,144 --> 00:26:12,407
And he is alive. Which means
that you can change things

278
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:15,663
Did you take care
of that business?

279
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:19,000
- Ongoing. Fill you in?
- Yeah

280
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:22,417
Okay

281
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,832
Are you mad at me
for ditching school?

282
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,314
No, Jess, I'm not. I'm actually
very proud of you. You were brave

283
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:30,170
You paid attention to detail,
you didn't take anything for granted

284
00:26:30,236 --> 00:26:32,473
You checked everything
just like a good scientist

285
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,341
Yes?

286
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:39,097
This is Bremmer.
You've got something for me?

287
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,816
- Yes.
- Bring it

288
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:44,307
It's going to have to be
in a public place

289
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:48,758
It is. 1138 Grove.
Leave right now

290
00:26:48,831 --> 00:26:51,798
- Okay, I have to go out.
- Why?

291
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,188
Aw, damn. Claudia parked me in.
Tell Claudia I'm taking her car

292
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:58,298
Here, can you give those
to her, please?

293
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,136
Just tell her

294
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:05,470
- Dad?
- Yeah?

295
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:09,175
I love you

296
00:27:13,986 --> 00:27:16,670
Damn it, JT

297
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,934
Jesse: I'm changing
everything, every detail

298
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:53,345
Where is that blue parka?

299
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:56,897
Hah-- you are gone!
Ugh!

300
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:09,064
Grove Street

301
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:17,975
You know...

302
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,893
I grew up without a father

303
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:23,958
But I think it must be even harder
growing up without a mom

304
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,452
I've always had my dad

305
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,003
What would happen if he dies?

306
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,968
Would I ever see you again?

307
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:44,791
I don't know

308
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:51,777
Carl:
That's the mother lode, isn't it?

309
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:02,819
Hey, that's my case
you've got there

310
00:31:02,884 --> 00:31:04,193
- No, it isn't.
- Brad: Hey, hold up

311
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,681
Hey, slow down! Hey!

312
00:31:06,756 --> 00:31:08,796
You're JT's student.
You're Carl, right?

313
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:12,317
Professor Neumeyer gave that to me.
He wanted me to have it

314
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,594
- I don't care what he wants.
- Give me that case

315
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:18,045
- Give me the case.
- No!

316
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:20,005
Give me the case!

317
00:31:20,071 --> 00:31:22,788
- No!
- Let it go

318
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:30,781
You lunatic, will you let it go?

319
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:02,051
Sikorski

320
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:19,306
There it is

321
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,161
# ... This is what it's all about #

322
00:32:37,234 --> 00:32:39,885
# Everybody, let's shout,"Bomb
ticky.ticky, ticky.ticky bomb.bomb #

323
00:32:39,954 --> 00:32:41,994
# Bomb ticky.ticky,
ticky.ticky bomb"#

324
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,434
# It's a bomb ticky.ticky,
ticky.ticky bomb.bomb #

325
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,954
#"Bomb ticky.ticky,
ticky.ticky bomb... #

326
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:03,375
Man:
Two more!

327
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:29,934
Two drink minimum

328
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:34,354
Scotch!

329
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:43,956
- 20 bucks.
- It's on me

330
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:46,711
Roy, I have something
to show you

331
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:01,051
No, no,
no, no, no

332
00:34:01,118 --> 00:34:04,763
What's this?
This isn't real

333
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,442
- This is real.
- This isn't Angela

334
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:17,944
I gotta pee.
So do you

335
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,383
There's something else here,
you see...

336
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:24,956
this file came from a case whose
materials come 50 years in the future

337
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:27,230
Now, I know someone who can
reverse-engineer it for you

338
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,884
- That would be like having plastic--
- You think it's about the money?

339
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,449
Bremmer:
I know where she is

340
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:43,582
I can take her anytime I want,
but I'm not gonna do that

341
00:34:43,652 --> 00:34:46,303
I want you to give her to me

342
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:50,082
I want you to betray her,
so she never thinks about you again

343
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:52,800
Look at you, look at you!

344
00:35:09,288 --> 00:35:12,136
You say you're going to die
in this titty joint

345
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,391
sometime before what...
dawn tomorrow? Hmm?

346
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:22,082
You give Angela to me
before then

347
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:25,635
or I'm gonna make it
all come true

348
00:36:05,104 --> 00:36:08,333
I'll be waiting for her,
Professor

349
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,672
You've got the wrong guy

350
00:36:16,594 --> 00:36:18,765
Bremmer: Hey, hey, hey,
easy on the suit

351
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,223
- Cop #1 : Get him out of there.
- Cop #2: Let's go

352
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,242
I go to jail,
you go down, Officer

353
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,225
- Shut up, Roy.
- I mean it

354
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,530
- So do I.
- He's got a gun, arrest him

355
00:36:36,597 --> 00:36:39,248
No, I don't have a gun,
you can search me

356
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:06,291
What about the club? The girls want to
know if they're still working tonight

357
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:08,980
Shut it down

358
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:12,214
Carl Axelrod escaped
from the hospital

359
00:37:12,282 --> 00:37:15,152
Your brother-in-law
is down at the station

360
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:18,936
screaming his head off that Carl
stole his briefcase and assaulted him

361
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,687
And it gets worse--
I sent some men over to Carl's loft

362
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:24,570
and they went inside.
There's something you've got to see

363
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,923
All right, well,
I'm gonna go to the house first

364
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,884
because Bremmer
has someone watching it

365
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,858
No, I can post
a couple of men at your place

366
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,940
I need you to come with me

367
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:37,145
You're lucky Claudia called me
and warned me you were armed

368
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:44,025
Hello?

369
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:46,680
Hey, it's me,
I'm with Sikorski

370
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:48,661
Come home, please

371
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,583
No, I have one more stop to make
and then I'm going to come home

372
00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:54,910
- No, Jesse is--
- Claudia, listen, they arrested Roy

373
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,886
Sikorski is gonna have
some men at the house

374
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:59,230
You'll be safe. I'll be safe
and then I'll come home

375
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:01,850
- JT...
- Kiss Jess good night, will you?

376
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:15,234
JT:
Hmm...

377
00:39:14,988 --> 00:39:18,436
"Assuming... constant..."

378
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,923
Sikorski:
Look at this

379
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:28,465
See all this?

380
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:35,702
This is where Carl proves
that the universe will fall apart

381
00:40:35,768 --> 00:40:38,932
if I am not dead by tomorrow

382
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,456
Today



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
