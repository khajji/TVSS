1
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,755
So when did Claudia go home?

2
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:49,048
Huh, last night.

3
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:50,998
I thought...

4
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,928
Hmm, never mind.

5
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,586
Hey, Jess...

6
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:59,836
You know, now might be
a good time to talk

7
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,326
about Claudia and us.

8
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,757
That's okay,

9
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,995
I think I'm gonna go
and get dressed, you know.

10
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:10,551
Oh.

11
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,800
Jess...

12
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:15,962
Please, tell me what's in the case.
'Cause I know that you opened it.

13
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,557
Stuff for me.

14
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,183
Well, I found it, so I think
I have a right to look.

15
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:22,163
No. It has my name on it

16
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,593
and the stuff inside
is clearly meant for me.

17
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:27,636
So once I find out
what it all means

18
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:31,254
and if it's appropriate
I will show it to you.

19
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:37,784
You know what that probably is?
It's probably our loaner.

20
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:42,897
Sweet.

21
00:03:47,034 --> 00:03:49,554
- Excuse me.
- Wow!

22
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:50,738
- Mr. Neumeyer?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,687
Sorry about our rush hour traffic.

24
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,551
I'm here to take your truck
to the repair shop.

25
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:57,933
Oh, here we are.

26
00:03:57,976 --> 00:04:00,081
-
- I reckon she's found the radio.

27
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,462
- Enjoy.
-

28
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,568
Thanks, I'm sure we will.

29
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:17,931
# Broken glass
screaming at my face #

30
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,948
# Thoughts are bleeding #

31
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,707
# All around this place #

32
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:29,968
# Seems to me you're trying to...#

33
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:33,385
All righty.

34
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:37,225
You realize once the truck
is fixed, we're back to plebe status.

35
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,307
It's just fun having nice things.

36
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:42,729
I mean, really nice things like
Uncle Brad's and Chantal's nice.

37
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,200
- Oh, I see.
- Love you.

38
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,538
- Love you, bye.
- Bye, see you later.

39
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:01,157
Hey, Claudia,

40
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,437
Uh, listen...

41
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:06,374
I want to take a rain check for last
night, but that's not why I'm calling--

42
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,863
I've got a question about
the rental car you arranged for us.

43
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:12,042
- Yeah, the thing is--
-

44
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,243
Wait, I better go here.

45
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,618
Professor.

46
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:30,660
You got that file on you?

47
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:43,651
So what made you
change your mind?

48
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,204
Carl Axelrod, he's the student, right?
The one you pegged for this?

49
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:50,057
Well, if he did it, he put himself
on the suspect list.

50
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,072
Is he really that crazy?

51
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:53,667
He's...

52
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:55,561
until yesterday
I thought he was just weird.

53
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,568
He's one of the brightest students
I've ever had--

54
00:05:57,609 --> 00:06:00,162
socially inept, a little creepy,
but that's about it.

55
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,056
I'll check him for priors.

56
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,733
See who else
Carl has been messing with here.

57
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:17,501
- Professor Bradley Hume.
- It's my late wife's brother.

58
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,023
He's a friend, colleague, good
scientist, better stock picker, but...

59
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:23,844
no, he wouldn't be a suspect,
even if this thing was real.

60
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:27,390
Seven out of 10 murders are committed
by friends or family of the vic.

61
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,706
Wow.

62
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,803
- What about Claudia Whitney?
- Uh, my girlfriend.

63
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:34,909
That doesn't mean
she wouldn't want to kill you.

64
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,915
Hell, my wife, she tries to wring
my neck at least twice a day.

65
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,712
Yeah. Well, imagine that.

66
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,513
How long have you known her?

67
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:47,833
Huh, four months. We met over
term life. She's my insurance agent.

68
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:51,970
What, your girlfriend handles
your life insurance?

69
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:54,556
Did you name her executor
or name her in your will?

70
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,212
No, that's my--
my daughter is my sole beneficiary.

71
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,152
- This is interesting.
- What?

72
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:04,479
It says that they found
an unspent bullet on your body.

73
00:07:04,513 --> 00:07:07,327
That's like a calling card,
a pro thing.

74
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:11,670
I guess Carl has been watching
too much TV.

75
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:14,046
Who is Roy Bremmer?

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,535
You see, I have no idea,
no idea who that is.

77
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,844
- You'll have to ask Carl.
- I'll do that.

78
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:21,881
Can I keep this?

79
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,860
I'll make you a copy.
I need to keep this one.

80
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,684
Because I'm gonna prove this whole
thing is, you know, a hoax.

81
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:30,013
Of course, it's a hoax.
I mean, what else could it be?

82
00:07:30,046 --> 00:07:32,118
Uh...

83
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:37,045
You know,
I probably should mention this...

84
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,572
Yesterday I was given a blue parka
just like in the file.

85
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:42,329
And today, this morning,
the rental car company

86
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:44,731
drops off this green Cherokee

87
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,869
just like in the file.

88
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:55,001
You asked me why
I changed my mind about this thing.

89
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,944
When I got home last night,

90
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:59,222
my wife, she told me I had
a doctor's appointment next week.

91
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,851
I've blown off a couple already,

92
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,704
so if I miss this one,
she really will wring my neck.

93
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:09,074
Next Tuesday, 2:00 P.M.,

94
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,112
same time as the autopsy,
so you miss the autopsy.

95
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,487
- Get me a copy of this, will you?
- Yeah.

96
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,789
- As soon as you can.
- Thanks.

97
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:34,099
P.A.:
Dr. Anderson to oncology.

98
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:36,621
Dr. Anderson to oncology.

99
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:38,701
Oh, hey, Dan, Dan!

100
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:41,458
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- I need a favor.

101
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:43,696
A stress test, maybe?
Some oxygen?

102
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,220
No, can you check the blood
on this against mine?

103
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,399
- What's this?
- It's a bullet fragment.

104
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:51,054
Where would you get-- wait--
why would the blood match--

105
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:53,677
I'll explain later. I just--
I need it as quickly as possible.

106
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:56,082
-
- Thanks.

107
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:04,047
- Man: No. I've got to go--
-

108
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:07,878
That's great. No, I appreciate that.
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

109
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:11,336
Woman:
I know, that was good, thanks.

110
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,287
One moment, please.

111
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,849
This is outrageous.

112
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,955
- Spectacular work.
- How can I prove it was Photoshopped?

113
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,359
You mean, aside from you
standing there breathing?

114
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,531
Yoshi's got this big voodoo machine
down in Composing.

115
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,902
- He can scan it for tampering.
- Good.

116
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,862
Ever heard of this guy--
Roy Bremmer?

117
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,099
No. Hey, how come
I'm not on this list?

118
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:36,036
I'm a close friend. I'm definitely
badder than Brad or Claudia.

119
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,893
- How can I find out who he is?
- I can search our database.

120
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,065
Hey, lighten up, son.

121
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,726
How come you're so worked up
about this?

122
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,424
You went to the police.
They're on it, right?

123
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,533
Right, right, yeah.
Can I use your copier?

124
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:48,580
Yeah.

125
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,343
Worker #1 : Don't you just love
the sunshine today?

126
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:03,491
Worker #2:
It's beautiful.

127
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,799
Worker #1 : We should go for drinks
on the patio after work.

128
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:08,322
Worker #2:
That sounds nice.

129
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,849
Woman:
Denorvo Insurance.

130
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,962
Hi, Amy, JT, is she there yet?

131
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:18,816
Sorry, JT, as soon as she gets in, I'll
have her call you, okay?

132
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,027
Okay, thanks.

133
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:22,618
Newscaster:...this kind of weather,
you just want a light jacket.

134
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,249
That wraps it up
for the Seattle area--

135
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,558
partly cloudy
with mostly cool breezes.

136
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:27,999
Oh, this just in--

137
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:31,098
It's not going to be sunny long
according to the Doppler,

138
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,957
we have a storm
coming in off the coast.

139
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,682
Sorry, folks,
get out the rain gear.

140
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,322
Huh, Claudia, it's me.
Where are you?

141
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:42,108
I've tried your office,
I've tried your cell.

142
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:45,176
I need to talk to you about the file.

143
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,758
Call me when you get this, okay?

144
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,561
-
- All: Wow!

145
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:28,212
Blowing up stuffs for grades.
Now, how cool is that?

146
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:31,063
JT, you just missed it,
I'm so close.

147
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,722
- Yeah--
- A transparent material

148
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,575
- capable of withstanding 170 Gs.
- Bradley.

149
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:37,909
It will replace every window
in the first world.

150
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:40,016
I wouldn't mind owning the patent
on that one.

151
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:41,331
Have you been to the police yet?

152
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,538
Yeah, we got to find out
what this thing is made of.

153
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:45,364
- So you can figure out who sent it.
- Yeah...

154
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,398
Okay, let's do it.
I'll be right back.

155
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:54,155
This is really nice.

156
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:56,052
I'm gonna have
to take a shaving from this.

157
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:58,835
Yeah, do whatever you gotta do.
You know how long it's gonna take?

158
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,389
Well, it depends.

159
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:04,273
Can I blow it up?

160
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,769
Kidding.

161
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:06,739
- Call me.
- I will.

162
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:15,631
Man: I knew him.

163
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,805
- He was a dealer?
- Coke.

164
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,981
Yeah, he's a weird dude.

165
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:21,000
What's going on, guys?

166
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,627
This big cop just dragged
that Carl guy out of here.

167
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:24,843
Emphasis on dragged.

168
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:26,791
Okay, I'm gonna have
to cancel today, I'm sorry.

169
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,589
I'll make it up.
Double session on Thursday.

170
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,759
Cop:
Get closer together.

171
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:36,394
Closer together, kids,
here we go.

172
00:13:36,432 --> 00:13:40,654
- All right, ready? Smile.
- All: Cheese.

173
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:42,182
-
-

174
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:52,237
- Carl: Do not touch me.
- Come back here and sit.

175
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,059
I've seen those shows
with the good-cop-bad-cop.

176
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,817
You're gonna knock me around.

177
00:13:57,901 --> 00:13:59,559
- Carl: Professor.
- You get the copies?

178
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:03,242
- Carl: Why am I here?
- Try criminal harassment...

179
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,738
which is gonna land you in prison

180
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:08,326
where you'll acquire a whole
new definition of "physics".

181
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,273
- Hmm?
- What is that?

182
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,025
No one's gonna hurt you, Carl, just tell
us why you did it.

183
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,052
Carl, is that the special project
you said would blow my mind?

184
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,124
- No.
- Any mope can make a threat,

185
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:23,551
but a genius needs a genius twist.

186
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,569
You're a genius, aren't you, Carl?

187
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:32,356
Where did you get the paperwork?
Someone in this department?

188
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,409
This isn't my handwriting.

189
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,295
You forged my signature
to make it look real.

190
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,847
Who helped you, Carl?
Give me a name.

191
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,343
It's dated... Friday?!

192
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:55,102
Maybe it wasn't even your idea.

193
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,930
You were just a dupe.

194
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:59,235
That's weird. That's so weird.

195
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,896
That's so weird.

196
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,487
I'm giving you one chance
to get out in front of this, Carl.

197
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:06,143
Lookie, lookie, lookie,
look, look, look.

198
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,283
Look, look, look...
what's this?

199
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,274
He didn't do this.

200
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:28,282
It's all right, everybody,
let's-- come on inside.

201
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:30,908
- It looks like it's going to storm.
- Keep going, keep going.

202
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:33,663
- Here we go.
- Hurry.

203
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,901
Woman:
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

204
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:11,636
Ah, Claudia, banker's hours.

205
00:16:11,676 --> 00:16:13,203
Did Michael cut the paychecks yet?

206
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:14,738
No, he's working on them
right now.

207
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:18,042
- Forgot to pay the electric again?
- You know me.

208
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:42,966
- Man:...nasty weather.
-

209
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:51,410
Come on.

210
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,468
- No.
-

211
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,647
Yes.

212
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:12,555
Victoria Jamieson.

213
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:14,190
Okay.

214
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,890
Victoria Jamieson, my new identity.

215
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:26,987
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

216
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,449
Margaritas for dinner?
My treat.

217
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,800
I still owe you for last time.

218
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:34,412
You know what, Amy, I can't
tonight. I really need to get going.

219
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:38,028
But you know, huh...
I think you're great.

220
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:40,269
And I would love to, but I can't.

221
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:44,365
Salted brims, limes, nachos...

222
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:46,190
I can't.

223
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:54,827
- Amy: Say hi to Billy.
- Okay, see you tomorrow.

224
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:56,358
- Okay.
- Okay.

225
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,155
- Claudia. Listen, it's okay.
-

226
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,035
I'm glad I found you.
I need you to pick up Jess today.

227
00:18:01,071 --> 00:18:02,631
- I'm not--
- You know where it is, right?

228
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:04,361
It's an emergency,
I'll explain later.

229
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:05,860
- No, I--
- I'll see you later.

230
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:09,212
Hello, hello!

231
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,549
Hello, hello.

232
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,416
-
-

233
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,139
- Yeah?
- Yeah, listen,

234
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:32,693
the oak tree, it's going to fall.
You've got to get out now!

235
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,634
You got to be kidding me. This tree
has been through a lot worse than this.

236
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:37,465
Yeah, I know,
but you've got to believe me.

237
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,507
Hey, Butchie, shut up.

238
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:41,751
There's not much time, come on.

239
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:44,820
What are you? Some sort of a city
works guy or a tree maintenance guy?

240
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:46,898
- No, I'm a physicist.
- Oh, you're a physicist.

241
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:51,281
Listen, that oak tree
is not going to survive the storm.

242
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,362
It's going to fall, Mandy,
and when it does--

243
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,736
- How do you know my name?
- I--

244
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:58,616
- Get off my porch!
- No, wait, you've got to believe me.

245
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:03,054
-
-

246
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,196
Video instructor:
How does that feel?

247
00:21:10,232 --> 00:21:12,850
You need to get out now!

248
00:21:15,255 --> 00:21:17,327
- JT: Take it easy.
- Woman: let go!

249
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:19,373
- JT: Take it easy.
-

250
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:26,068
- Woman: No, no.
- JT: Come on!

251
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,848
All right, just one more step.

252
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:42,028
-
- Okay, run.

253
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,640
My God.

254
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,330
You saved my life.
How can I ever thank you?

255
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,470
It's real.

256
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:57,638
Hey, are you picking me up?
Where's Dad?

257
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,081
Something came up.

258
00:23:02,282 --> 00:23:04,321
You're getting wet.

259
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,105
JT:
Hi, Claudia, it's me. Where are you?

260
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:04,001
I've tried your office,
I've tried your cell.

261
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:07,197
I need to talk to you
about the file.

262
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:09,404
- Call me when you get this.
-

263
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:10,685
Was there
mechanical problem?

264
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,576
- JT: Not at all.
- You don't like how it handles?

265
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,616
- It handles great--
- It's the top of the line--

266
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:17,787
leather interior,
cherry sound system, GPS.

267
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:20,638
Miss Whitney
specifically ordered it for you.

268
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,559
Wait,
what did she ask for exactly?

269
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:24,347
She said "Give me
the best one in the lot."

270
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:27,612
Well, you did that. I thank you.
Now I want something else.

271
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:30,549
Okay, I'll put that on your Visa.

272
00:24:54,172 --> 00:24:56,506
-
-

273
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:20,271
Is that cop with you?

274
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:23,957
JT: No, he isn't. Carl, I'm alone.
I need to talk to you, please.

275
00:25:30,935 --> 00:25:33,007
You still have those papers, Carl?

276
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:35,567
- The thesis advisor consent forms?
- Yeah.

277
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:37,068
Yeah, why don't you get them?

278
00:25:52,372 --> 00:25:54,827
JT:
And...

279
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:59,726
Okay, I am now
your thesis advisor.

280
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:03,789
And this is your assignment.

281
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:06,347
I'm sure that you won't be afraid
of wherever that might lead you.

282
00:26:06,387 --> 00:26:08,972
I am already there.

283
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:12,207
The shadow on the form
from the paperclip?

284
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:14,381
Yeah, and other things.

285
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:17,069
But it takes time to create a mark
like that, right?

286
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:20,617
Years, decades even
and the forms are current,

287
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:22,795
but the paper is old and crumbly...

288
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,582
which means somebody
either manufactured the effect,

289
00:26:25,616 --> 00:26:27,787
or the...

290
00:26:27,824 --> 00:26:30,823
- or...
- Or?

291
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:34,410
It's from the future.

292
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:40,842
Okay, do you have proof?

293
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:44,261
It predicted a random event
which happened this afternoon.

294
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,335
- I knew it, I knew it was possible.
- Carl.

295
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:49,959
It proves the theory
of infinite parallel universes.

296
00:26:49,997 --> 00:26:52,899
Okay, stay with me. I need you. I want
you to explain how this happened.

297
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,948
Show me the math,
the physics, the implications

298
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,996
of transferring an object
through space and time.

299
00:26:57,036 --> 00:26:59,818
Okay, did it just show up on
your desk? Was it in anything?

300
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:03,015
It was in a metal briefcase. We're
analyzing the composition right now.

301
00:27:03,052 --> 00:27:04,546
Lightweight, but very strong.

302
00:27:04,588 --> 00:27:06,344
- So the file is inside the case.
- Yeah.

303
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:09,695
Inside the file are written documents
and photographs. Anything else?

304
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:12,008
My lost keys. I had them
yesterday morning.

305
00:27:12,043 --> 00:27:14,246
But by the afternoon,
they were gone.

306
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:17,130
- Before or after you got the case?
- After.

307
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,063
Anything else?

308
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,039
Yes, a spent bullet
with dried blood on it

309
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:26,561
and also a whole bullet,
which was found at the scene.

310
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:29,317
Wait-- bullets?
Oh, yeah, you die on Friday.

311
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:32,668
Well...
not if I can help it, Carl.

312
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:36,930
All righty,

313
00:27:36,968 --> 00:27:39,269
it's all here, good luck.

314
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,724
You know, maybe you can't
help it, maybe it's your destiny.

315
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:43,807
- I don't believe that.
- Believe?

316
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:46,977
Just think about all the different
things that have happened

317
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:48,541
since that case arrived--

318
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:51,265
I'm now your thesis advisor,
for one.

319
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,276
I knew a scientist
who used to tell his students

320
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:56,961
to check their beliefs at the lab door,
at least until they could be proven.

321
00:27:57,605 --> 00:28:01,598
Well, I now believe
that scientist was wrong, Carl.

322
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,681
Dad, look, you got some flowers.

323
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:00,216
I've got to meet a client.
I've got to go.

324
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:02,227
Uh, Claudia,
can you come back later?

325
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:04,690
I've got to talk to you.
It's about something very important.

326
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:07,099
JT, you son of a bitch.

327
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:08,539
- Oh, hey, girls.
- Hi.

328
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,459
Turn on the TV, your dad
is all over the news.

329
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:11,920
- Why?
- He's a damn hero.

330
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:14,385
- What did you do, Dad?
- Oh, nothing much...

331
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:17,143
- just saved a woman's life.
- What?!

332
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,797
Newscaster: Here we are at the town
of Everett's famous landmark--

333
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,906
the Weatherby Oak.
"The oak is no more"as they say.

334
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:24,368
Maybe it's the acorn. Mandy,
we hear you lost your house.

335
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,898
Mandy Murphy--
that's who the flowers are from.

336
00:29:26,938 --> 00:29:29,425
Mandy: The oak fell on my house
and everything was destroyed.

337
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,760
I've got something else for you too.
It's about that Bremmer character.

338
00:29:34,329 --> 00:29:36,914
- This is him.
- All right, so who is he?

339
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:38,643
All the action
on the South Side of Chicago

340
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,876
- is controlled by a handful of guys.
- And he's one of them?

341
00:29:41,911 --> 00:29:44,333
No, he controls
a handful of guys--

342
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:46,961
very private, very connected.

343
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,203
Mandy:
He walked through the door...

344
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:53,067
Claudia, you're from Chicago.
You ever ran into this character?

345
00:29:56,374 --> 00:29:59,090
Yeah, we used to party all the time,
him and me and the mayor.

346
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:01,581
Oh yeah, right.

347
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:03,636
I've got to run. I'm late.

348
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,840
- Can I see you for a sec?
- Huh? Yeah.

349
00:30:07,732 --> 00:30:09,455
What's up?

350
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:13,169
...and I'm just happy
that we are okay.

351
00:30:13,204 --> 00:30:15,091
Reporter:
Man's best friend and his mom

352
00:30:15,124 --> 00:30:17,327
and I guess you're both okay
and we're glad for that.

353
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:19,535
Okay, Mandy, you take care.

354
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:21,480
Goodbye, JT.

355
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:23,246
- Mandy: Thank you, bye.
- Colonel: Whoo!

356
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,617
What did you do to deserve her?

357
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,872
- Hello?
- Claudia: I have to talk to you.

358
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:35,174
- Claudia, where are you?
- Look outside.

359
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,860
-
- What?!

360
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:44,098
What are you doing out there?
Why don't you come in?

361
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,176
No, I need you
to come out here, JT.

362
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:49,213
All right.

363
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:51,165
Jess, stay here.

364
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:06,054
Claudia, you're all right?

365
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,147
What's going on?

366
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:11,393
Is it the file?

367
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,371
If it's about the file,
I wish I could tell you--

368
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:16,195
- There's nothing to it, but after--
- It's not about the file.

369
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:19,228
JT, just listen to me, okay?

370
00:32:23,812 --> 00:32:25,819
What?

371
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:30,043
I know Roy Bremmer.

372
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:40,983
You know Roy Bremmer?

373
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:47,226
Wait a minute.
I don't unders-- how?

374
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:51,227
Is he a client of yours or...

375
00:32:51,264 --> 00:32:52,889
No, he's not a client.

376
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:54,967
Well, what is he?
Did something happen in Chicago?

377
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,982
Did you cross the guy
in some way?

378
00:32:57,023 --> 00:32:58,932
Did you testify against him?
I don't--

379
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,350
Claudia?

380
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:08,339
I married him.

381
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,398
And I'm still married to him.

382
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:19,027
I'm sorry.

383
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:31,513
How did you think that--

384
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:33,522
not telling me--

385
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:36,410
why-- how--
why would you not tell me?

386
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:40,239
I've lived in five different places
in the last two years.

387
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:44,403
I've changed my identity three times
and I'm about to change it again.

388
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:47,125
I only came back here to warn you.

389
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:57,454
Why--why--
why didn't you divorce him?

390
00:33:59,192 --> 00:34:02,355
Roy takes that"till death
do us part"clause literally.

391
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:20,531
Oh, damn it.

392
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:24,914
Jesse!

393
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,501
I don't like being left out.
I want to know what's going on.

394
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,362
Hey, no!
That's enough!

395
00:34:29,396 --> 00:34:31,305
Listen, here is the deal--

396
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:34,544
you're the child, I'm the parent,
I will tell you what you need to know.

397
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,717
I will decide that.
End of story.

398
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,210
Now, go upstairs,
do your homework.

399
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:11,850
I never let myself

400
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:16,621
get too close
to anyone because...

401
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:21,035
I know soon or later,
I'm going to have to leave.

402
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:23,273
I made a mistake with you.

403
00:35:24,237 --> 00:35:27,106
I couldn't resist.

404
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:31,011
This was...

405
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:37,091
the best,

406
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:39,684
the sweetest thing

407
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:44,065
I have ever had, ever!

408
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:50,535
I ruined my life
when I married Roy...

409
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,124
and now, I've ruined yours...

410
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:59,266
and I'm sorry.

411
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:04,642
I just didn't expect
to meet you...

412
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,324
I didn't know what I wanted
in a man until I met you.

413
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,847
And I don't know, but...

414
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:17,092
I feel like maybe I woke up something
in you that's been asleep a long time.

415
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:25,379
No.

416
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:37,244
This is for you.

417
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:39,172
- You need to take it.
- What are you doing?

418
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:40,927
JT,

419
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:44,379
- Roy isn't only powerful and ruthless,
- What are you doing with a gun?

420
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,393
- ...he's insanely jealous.
- I don't understand--

421
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:47,645
- You need to take it.
- No.

422
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:50,366
You need to take it.
You're in danger. Jesse is in danger.

423
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:52,574
No, I'm not going to keep a gun
in my home.

424
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,748
JT, just take it.

425
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:01,078
JT, take it.

426
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:04,663
Claudia,

427
00:37:06,336 --> 00:37:07,929
listen, no,

428
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,423
don't go.

429
00:37:10,464 --> 00:37:12,700
Does he always find you?

430
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:15,386
Yeah, but he hasn't caught me yet.

431
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:21,044
Don't go.

432
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:24,244
Come here.

433
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:26,424
You just said he always finds you.

434
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:31,412
Sooner or later,
you're going to have to face him.

435
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,973
So why don't we face this together?

436
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,305
I mean it.

437
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:45,685
Come on.

438
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:52,021
Hey.

439
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,010
Oh, brother.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
