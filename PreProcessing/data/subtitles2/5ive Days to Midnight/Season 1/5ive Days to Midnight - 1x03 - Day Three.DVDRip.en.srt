1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,851
What is that?
It's got your name on it.

2
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:17,706
Somebody left this
at Katherine's grave.

3
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,593
- Who knew you were gonna be there?
- Remember that student... Carl Axelrod?

4
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:23,047
I forgot today is the death of
your wife, the birth of your daughter.

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,123
It's just a prank. Some junior egghead
trying to screw with you a little.

6
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:27,885
Doesn't it bother you
that your name's on it?

7
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:29,329
If it has to do with homicide,
it better be.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,475
Look at this bullet hole.

9
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,489
Is there such a thing
as "grad school for Photoshop"?

10
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:34,670
Yesterday I was given a blue parka
just like in the file.

11
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:37,871
This morning, the rental car company
drops off this green Cherokee...

12
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:40,559
Just like in the file. You asked why
I changed my mind about this.

13
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:42,768
My wife told me I had
a doctor's appointment next week.

14
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:44,877
Next Tuesday,
same time as the autopsy.

15
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:47,283
- So you miss the autopsy.
- Get me a copy of this, will you?

16
00:00:50,773 --> 00:00:53,872
That oak tree
is not going to survive the storm.

17
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,884
It's going to fall, Mandy!

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,532
- You saved my life. Oh, my God.
- It's real.

19
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:03,600
It's about that Bremmer character.
The action on the South Side of Chicago

20
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:04,883
is controlled by a handful of guys.

21
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:08,465
- And he's one of them?
- No, he controls the handful of guys.

22
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,325
I know Roy Bremmer.
I married him.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,077
- And I'm still married to him.
- Why would you not tell me?

24
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:15,501
- This is for you. You need to take it.
- What the hell are you doing?

25
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:18,032
You need to take it.
You're in danger. Jesse is in danger.

26
00:05:39,545 --> 00:05:42,033
- Er...
- I...

27
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:44,630
- I thought that...
- Sorry.

28
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,837
What are you doing?

29
00:05:47,993 --> 00:05:50,361
Er...

30
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:56,817
You know, people get killed
who keep guns in their house,

31
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:00,853
so I was trying to...
I was just gonna sort of...

32
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:05,816
Claudia...

33
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:11,315
Oh, boy.

34
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:13,724
You wanted to test
one of my bullets?

35
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:16,059
- No, Claudia...
- Go for it. I don't care.

36
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,653
- Claudia, listen...
- Do you really think I'd shoot you?

37
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,661
No. This was
a very good way to prove...

38
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:27,518
If you wanted my gun, you could have
asked, I would have given it to you.

39
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:29,723
- I didn't want to wake you.
- Oh, please.

40
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:33,917
Claudia...

41
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:42,106
All I want to do is see Saturday.
I'll do whatever it takes to get there.

42
00:06:56,994 --> 00:07:00,639
That doesn't count.
Carry, carry, carry...

43
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:04,899
Go around the corner...
down the way...

44
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:09,018
Oh, we are way
down the hall, Alice.

45
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,810
Jump, Rover. Jump.

46
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:14,692
Come on,
why doesn't that...? It does.

47
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:18,621
Why? Why?

48
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:30,300
It's real.

49
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,846
Jess?

50
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:41,830
Jesse?

51
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,509
Jesse?

52
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:50,152
- Come on, Jess, we gotta go.
- Dad?

53
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:53,887
You always tell me the truth.
Always.

54
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:56,898
Even when
I didn't want to hear it.

55
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:02,021
Er, ahem...

56
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:05,736
I just... you know, I didn't want
to burden you with any of this.

57
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:07,910
But not knowing
is worse, Pop.

58
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:10,086
Secrets are worse.

59
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:21,030
Okay.

60
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,174
I'm gonna tell you
what's in that case.

61
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:29,158
You see, Jess, it seems
someone wants to hurt me.

62
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,107
- Why?
- I don't know.

63
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,191
- Can i seet?
- No.

64
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:35,402
But maybe I can help
figure it out.

65
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:38,221
I appreciate that,
but I showed it to the police,

66
00:08:38,255 --> 00:08:40,230
and they're taking care of it.

67
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,727
As a matter of fact, we have
the top homicide investigator...

68
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:46,346
Homicide?
That means "murder. "

69
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:48,773
- No, it's... it's sort of
- Papa...

70
00:08:48,816 --> 00:08:50,955
promise me
that's not going to happen.

71
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,814
Aw, Jess,
Jess, Jess...

72
00:08:57,842 --> 00:08:59,882
I promise.

73
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:25,613
Detective Sikorski's
in a meeting.

74
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,812
- All right...
- You hungry?

75
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:31,885
Listen, I shot this
from Claudia's gun this morning.

76
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:35,406
Claudia's got a gun?

77
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:38,381
Yes, and a husband who she's been
on the run from the last two years.

78
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:40,811
Yeah, Roy Bremmer.
I found out who he is.

79
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:42,862
I know who he is.
Here's what we have to do.

80
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:45,489
We have to run a ballistics check
on that bullet,

81
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,917
get the results back
this afternoon...

82
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,164
Hold on. You've been watching
too much "CSI," pal.

83
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,339
Ballistics takes
at least two weeks.

84
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:56,402
Well, I only have two days, "pal,"
so make things happen.

85
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:59,441
Hey, I don't need
this crap from you.

86
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:12,631
I wrote a killer obituary.

87
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,569
Not to mention my eulogy...
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

88
00:10:15,612 --> 00:10:20,314
Photons to neutrons... the particle
hunter reduced to particles. "

89
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:22,487
I scanned this
from the newsprint,

90
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:25,143
and these
from the 8x10s.

91
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,148
They're clean images, unadulterated
and technically impossible.

92
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:30,808
Make some sense, Yoshi.

93
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:32,950
This is a new car, but
the photographic paper it's printed on

94
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,536
Is 40, maybe 50 years old.
The pigments, the dyes,

95
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,484
they follow a fading pattern
that only comes with age.

96
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:40,599
How does a new picture
get to be 50 years old?

97
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:43,508
It sits in a file for 50 years.

98
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,820
What?
How is that possible?

99
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:49,686
Yoshi, show me
my funeral again.

100
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,087
This is wrong. This is all wrong.
I was there two days ago.

101
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:58,518
This is empty...
there's no grave there.

102
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,179
Wait... can you read that?

103
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:08,064
M- A... M-U...

104
00:11:11,266 --> 00:11:13,633
"Mandy Murphy. "

105
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,739
What?

106
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:22,975
That means...
that means...

107
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:25,565
That means...?
What the hell does it mean?

108
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,865
Hey...! Tell Frank to keep
page three open.

109
00:11:57,704 --> 00:12:00,071
Hey, my hero!

110
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,406
- Butchle, hush up.
- I have a question for you.

111
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,961
- Fire away
- It's kind of personal.

112
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,644
- I think we're past that, JT.
- All right, okay.

113
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:12,097
Do you own a burial plot?
And if you do, where is it?

114
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,906
Yeah, I own a plot.
My parents left me one.

115
00:12:15,946 --> 00:12:18,019
- It's in...
- Evergreen Park?

116
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:21,092
- Yeah. How did you know that?
- Thank you. That is the best...

117
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,204
..best news I've heard all week.

118
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,172
Thank you. Thank you for the flowers.
They were spectacular.

119
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,462
Dog's just too little
to be that mean.

120
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,750
So catch me up here, Teach.

121
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,059
"Remedial course 101."

122
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:53,291
That photo... the file?

123
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:55,693
- Not a hoax, right?
Right.

124
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:59,502
Mandy Murphy was supposed to die...
underneath that tree?

125
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,446
That's right, but she didn't.
She's alive and well

126
00:13:01,488 --> 00:13:03,397
instead of six feet under
like in that photo

127
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,669
because I changed her destiny...
which means I can change my own.

128
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:10,025
Wait, wait a minute.
You can't leave now!

129
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:12,269
This is huge!
I need the damn story.

130
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,761
What are you doing on Monday.
I'll buy you lunch, tell you everything.

131
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:17,005
But this is gonna change the face
of the universe as we know it.

132
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:21,133
"The future is not immutable. "
You can print that.

133
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:27,723
Professor?

134
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:29,934
Ah... Mrs. Silviera, I am canceling
classes the rest of the week.

135
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,454
Excuse me, Brad?

136
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,730
JT, just the person
I was looking for. Excuse us.

137
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,740
- We have hit the jackpot.
- What are you talking about?

138
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,691
Are you okay?

139
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:56,687
Carbon nanotubes, ground
to workable length...

140
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,727
woven and coated
to make this...

141
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:04,023
an ultra light, super-strong material
that's gonna replace metal,

142
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:07,155
it's gonna replace plastic, fabrics...

143
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:09,396
I mean, the implications
for the auto industry alone...

144
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,374
It's amazing, Brad.
it's incredible.

145
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,326
I'm going out of town for a few days.
I need the case.

146
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,605
Hello, Professor.
You're not listening to me.

147
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:18,325
- I'm listening, Brad...
- We're holding the future in our hands.

148
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:20,696
Do you have any idea
what that's worth?

149
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,737
- My life.
- I can reverse engineer this,

150
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:26,739
take out a patent in both our names,
and we can buy Hawaii

151
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,567
Brad, you've been up
all night, right?

152
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,741
What?
Yeah, yeah I have.

153
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,905
- You're serious?
- I'm dead serious.

154
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,902
I've got enough data
to start lining up investors.

155
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,558
Can you imagine the bidding war?
We're gonna be bazilionares.

156
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:43,506
This is ridiculous.
It's theft.

157
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,680
"Theft"? From the future?
Come on!

158
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,652
All right, okay.
So what?

159
00:14:49,693 --> 00:14:52,596
Someone's gonna come from
the future and sue us? I don't think so.

160
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:54,612
I'm going.

161
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,748
Don't start getting all righteous on me,
okay, brother? I really need this.

162
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,239
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do!

163
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:09,172
Yes, I do.

164
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:13,591
Chantal and I really need this...
really need a break.

165
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,649
This isn't it.

166
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:24,155
I'll call you Monday.

167
00:15:44,932 --> 00:15:46,973
Let's see...

168
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:02,029
What are you doing in my house?

169
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:04,623
Er... I came to tell you...

170
00:18:04,661 --> 00:18:06,571
What?

171
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:09,997
- You're going to die.
- Eventually, yes.

172
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,908
No, on Friday.
The physics demand it.

173
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,899
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

174
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:15,951
I checked and rechecked
the Vidnet nexus,

175
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,292
every major STP...
I stayed up all night.

176
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:20,269
There's a lot of that
going around.

177
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:23,247
Don't joke about this, Professor.
It is basic, and it is bad.

178
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,971
If you're supposed to die
and then you don't...

179
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:28,397
it's like you make a rip
in the fabric of the universe.

180
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,350
Yeah, I'm listening.

181
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,367
The effects of your death
are ripples in time and space.

182
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,547
They've already been written.

183
00:18:34,585 --> 00:18:38,098
That's not science, Carl,
that's theology.

184
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:41,302
Excuse me? It's string theory
applied to multiverses,

185
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:43,542
assuming that time
and gravity can be... look,

186
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:45,585
the dog that made you
swerve on Monday...

187
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:47,961
I was wrong. It wasn't random,
it was part of the design.

188
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:51,476
Everything is part of the design,
especially births and deaths.

189
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:55,377
- It can't be changed.
- Nonsense. I changed the design.

190
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,355
I used information from the file
to save somebody's life.

191
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:02,066
Oh, my God!

192
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:07,355
Universe seems
intact to me, Carl.

193
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:11,034
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Carl, whoever sent that case

194
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:12,979
knows a lot more
about space and time than we do.

195
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:14,997
Do you think they'd risk
their existence to save mine?

196
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,552
But you have a duty to everyone
around you... to physics.

197
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,169
Take a break from physics, Carl.
You need to.

198
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:28,539
Huh...

199
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:41,147
Claudia, it's me.
I'm sorry about this morning.

200
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:44,502
But that's not why I'm calling.
I'm on my way to pick up Jesse.

201
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:48,346
We're going to the airport,
taking the first flight out.

202
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:51,201
We'll be back on Monday,
provided no oak trees have fallen.

203
00:19:51,234 --> 00:19:53,601
Listen, I really want you
to come with us...

204
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:55,642
we both do.
Give me a call. Bye.

205
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:17,885
Keep the change.

206
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,130
Excuse me?

207
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,940
We really do need to talk, Professor...
about my wife.

208
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,516
No, we don't.

209
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:30,461
Now.

210
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,039
Take five.
Have a cigarette.

211
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,686
Go.

212
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:43,040
What do you want?

213
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,383
What do I want?

214
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:59,173
Hmm? Last night,
when I saw that,

215
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:01,447
my first impulse...

216
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:04,931
was to pick up the phone
and have you...

217
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:09,507
Ah, never mind. I don't go
with first impulse anymore.

218
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,964
I'm a reasonable man.

219
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:24,973
Nobody takes phone calls
when I'm talking to them.

220
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:31,722
Okay... her real name is Angela.
She's as slippery as a fish.

221
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,148
Three times I've found her,
three times, she's disappeared.

222
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:36,842
Until now... thanks to you.

223
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,077
Oh, and...

224
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,822
lovely little girl, Jesse.

225
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:47,334
Leave Jesse out of this.
Don't even mention her name.

226
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:51,824
Angry man.
I like that.

227
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:55,273
I like that a lot.
Okay.

228
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,419
Here's the deal, Professor.

229
00:21:57,459 --> 00:22:00,688
If I lose Angela this time,
I'm coming after you.

230
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:05,552
If you warn her,
if you try to help her escape,

231
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,922
I'm coming after you.

232
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:10,444
It's as simple as that.

233
00:22:10,484 --> 00:22:12,524
Give me back my wife...

234
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:15,052
and you can get on
with your life.

235
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:18,480
Basically...

236
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,611
it's the only way
for you to have one.

237
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,156
This is JT.
Pease leave a message.

238
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:35,508
Vasco da Gama rounded
the Cape of Good Hope in 1497.

239
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,332
Now, can anybody tell me
where he sailed to?

240
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,351
Come on, people.

241
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:46,682
Jesse?

242
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:50,038
Mike?

243
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:56,956
Mr. Watkins' room.

244
00:23:58,945 --> 00:24:01,279
Recess is in 10 minutes.
Can it wait?

245
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:05,276
Okay.

246
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:07,354
Jesse...?

247
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:25,441
Whoa!

248
00:24:25,476 --> 00:24:27,811
- I thought something happened to you.
- No, no, no...

249
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:30,211
Something did happen,
but something good. Come on.

250
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:32,350
- We're gonna go on a trip.
- A trip?

251
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,950
- Yeah. Why not?
- Right now?

252
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,121
I've got to make a phone call.
I want you to stay where I can see you.

253
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:42,588
Jess, please?
Do as I say.

254
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:45,217
What happened
to your cell phone?

255
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:47,165
It broke.

256
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:01,352
- Denorvo Insurance.
- Hey, it's me.

257
00:25:01,385 --> 00:25:04,452
I've been trying to reach you. I think
there's something wrong with your phone.

258
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:07,239
Oh, my phone? Yes... I ran into a guy
who doesn't appreciate you

259
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:10,438
taking calls while he's talking to you
so he smashed it.

260
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:12,514
Oh, my God.

261
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:14,726
- Roy.
- Yeah.

262
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,065
Claudia, this is not just
about me and you anymore.

263
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,041
It's also about Jesse.

264
00:25:23,212 --> 00:25:25,187
Listen,
I gotta go.

265
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:35,398
Okay.

266
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:38,285
They found you, didn't they?
The people who threatened you?

267
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:40,293
The ones from the case?

268
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:44,133
- What's happening, Pop?
- Well...

269
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:46,280
We are doing what
Mandy Murphy did, only better.

270
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,807
We're getting as far away
from our oak tree as possible...

271
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,822
...before it falls, all right?

272
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:53,035
Hmm?

273
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,855
Jess?
Jess, listen...

274
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,969
I know I'm running low
on promises,

275
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:03,114
but we've got
to get through this.

276
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:05,291
I'll make it up to you.

277
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:08,624
Put your seat belt on.

278
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:51,286
Did the policeman
tell you to leave town?

279
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,326
No.

280
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,442
Jess, no one's following us.

281
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:07,220
Dad!

282
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:12,209
Learn to drive, you jerk!

283
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:14,705
Oh, boy.

284
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:17,528
Jess, I've got to get to a pay phone
and call Sikorski.

285
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:22,009
No, you don't.

286
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:30,869
- Sikorski here.
- This is JT, heading for the airport.

287
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:33,144
- Is Claudia with you?
- No.

288
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,090
- Wait for me.
- I'm not waiting for anyone.

289
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:37,718
Wait for me!
Damn it!

290
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:57,564
Honey?

291
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:02,875
Brad?

292
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,174
Honey?

293
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:15,226
Brad?

294
00:28:32,515 --> 00:28:34,752
Honey?

295
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:37,657
Brad?

296
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,969
Bradley...?

297
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:44,765
Stop! Stop it!

298
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:45,600
- Stop this!
- No!

299
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:48,896
Give me...
give me this!

300
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,592
Drop it!

301
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,761
What are you doing? Brad?

302
00:28:53,797 --> 00:28:57,824
Brad, what is it?
Shh!

303
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,001
Tell me, tell me, honey...

304
00:29:03,591 --> 00:29:05,534
Nobody will understand!

305
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:33,442
So, where are we going to go?

306
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:35,654
New York, if this line
gets a move on.

307
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:40,195
Come on.

308
00:29:41,355 --> 00:29:44,138
You know what, kiddo?
We're gonna travel in style. Come on.

309
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:47,785
Final boarding call
for flight 32 to Boston,

310
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,984
- Flight 32 to Boston.
First class.

311
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,996
Awesome.

312
00:29:59,438 --> 00:30:00,551
- Hey.
- Claudia!

313
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,943
Hey. We need to talk.
It's business, it won't take long.

314
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,187
Jess, could you do me
a huge favor?

315
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,524
Would you go and grab me
a pack of gum

316
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,894
and you can get something
for yourself?

317
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:15,976
There's a kiosk down there,
but make sure I can see you, okay?

318
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:26,571
- Look, Claudia...
- No, it's okay. Don't say anything.

319
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,327
I understand. If you have
to choose between Jesse and me,

320
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,395
that's not a choice.
That's why I did this.

321
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:37,486
I doubled your payout.
Jesse gets four million now.

322
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:41,551
Hey, call me callous
if you like

323
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:44,304
but I've learned the hard way
to be practical, and this is practical.

324
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:47,755
Two million is not enough these days...
not for an entire lifetime.

325
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:50,611
So all you have to do is...

326
00:30:50,644 --> 00:30:53,099
Tell me something, Claudia.

327
00:30:54,197 --> 00:30:56,106
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

328
00:30:57,525 --> 00:31:00,340
Two years ago.
I told you that. Why?

329
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:04,149
Well, you gave me
a blue parka,

330
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:06,157
you arranged for the green
Cherokee,

331
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,271
now you present me
with this...?

332
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:10,678
You think this is all
some elaborate scam?

333
00:31:10,711 --> 00:31:12,980
- You think I'm working with Roy?
- I don't know what to think anymore.

334
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:16,081
JT, I left Roy.

335
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,738
I've been running from him.

336
00:31:18,775 --> 00:31:22,518
He did horrible,
ugly things to me.

337
00:31:22,552 --> 00:31:26,033
You met him... you saw him.
There's nothing...

338
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:28,113
nothing he won't...

339
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,837
You know what? Forget it.
Do whatever you want.

340
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:34,648
Tell Jesse I said goodbye.
I'll miss her.

341
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,749
... all passengers
on flight 117 to Wichita,

342
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:44,340
that's 117 to Wichita...

343
00:31:45,307 --> 00:31:47,347
- Claudia?
- Leave me alone.

344
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,138
Claudia...

345
00:31:54,172 --> 00:31:56,889
You're coming with us, right?

346
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:11,925
Walk through, ma'am.

347
00:32:11,966 --> 00:32:14,039
Back.

348
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:31,294
Neumeyer, hold up.
Neumeyer.

349
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,369
Oh, no. Here.

350
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:38,461
Go, go. You can't do this.

351
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,702
She's a felon.

352
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:42,910
- What do you mean?
- Identity theft.

353
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:45,248
She's not Claudia Whitney.

354
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,650
Which means that gun of hers
was acquired under an assumed name.

355
00:32:47,683 --> 00:32:50,236
- That's a felony.
- It's not one I care about.

356
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:53,691
There's more.
Brad is bankrupt.

357
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:56,000
- What?
- He's not the picker you think he is.

358
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:58,371
They're ready to repossess
everything he owns

359
00:32:58,404 --> 00:33:01,121
including the gold fillings
in his back teeth.

360
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:03,196
He gets custody of Jesse
if you croak, right?

361
00:33:03,236 --> 00:33:05,571
Along with your estate?

362
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:11,202
Listen, you didn't need to come here
just to tell me this, did you?

363
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:13,377
Running
never solved anything.

364
00:33:13,414 --> 00:33:16,164
Just stay and face whatever
you have to face. I'll help you.

365
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:19,014
Look, Sikorski, I appreciate
your involvement. I really do.

366
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:21,119
But how about focusing on the only
person who's ever threatened me?

367
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,680
Claudia's husband.

368
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:26,981
- Claudia's got a husband?
- Yeah.

369
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:29,056
The flight's been canceled.
Mechanical problems.

370
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,865
All right.
Well, they can't all be grounded.

371
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:35,752
You up for a relay race?
- If you go, I can't protect you.

372
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:38,720
Well, how about helping us
instead of slowing us down?

373
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,394
Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts

374
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:49,377
and put your seats
in the upright position.

375
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,622
You have a husband?

376
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:54,977
Yeah, I do.

377
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:58,795
It's complicated.

378
00:33:58,827 --> 00:34:03,563
He's a bad guy.
And I mean literally... a bad guy.

379
00:34:03,596 --> 00:34:06,499
I didn't know that when I married him.
I just fell in love.

380
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:09,858
Thought he was rich
and powerful, like a king.

381
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,054
The truth is,
I didn't want to know.

382
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,322
What's his name?

383
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,725
Roy Bremmer.

384
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,060
Ugh... I don't even
like saying it.

385
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:27,050
I ran away from him two years ago.
He's been chasing me ever since.

386
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,152
Why?

387
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:32,232
What do you mean,
"why"?

388
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,377
If you ran away from me,

389
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:36,904
that would mean
you didn't like me anymore.

390
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,727
I wouldn't want you back,
so why does he?

391
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:05,388
You just see
the back of that one.

392
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:09,170
- Oh, look at them.
- Love Siamese cats.

393
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,992
- What was that one?
- Like...

394
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,134
- Like, "Get away from me. "
- Vampires!

395
00:35:33,495 --> 00:35:36,114
Either that, or he says, "Mouse".

396
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,175
I had a cat who liked that,
actually.

397
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,183
You could pick her up
by the tail...

398
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,054
You could pick her up
by the tail and toss her.

399
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:58,867
Sir, are you all right?

400
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,656
Heather... sir?

401
00:36:10,332 --> 00:36:12,918
Are you okay?

402
00:36:18,173 --> 00:36:21,108
Ladies and gentlemen,
may i have your attention, please?

403
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:22,524
This is your captain speaking.

404
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:25,819
Unfortunately, we have a medical
emergency and must return to Seattle.

405
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:27,862
We are sorry
for any inconvenience.

406
00:37:03,618 --> 00:37:06,521
- Claudia, I'm scared.
- Don't be scared, sweetie.

407
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:09,051
We're gonna be fine.

408
00:37:10,115 --> 00:37:12,505
- Are all these people sick?
- I don't think so.

409
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,024
- Is everything gonna be okay?
- Don't worry. Dr. Dan's gonna be here.

410
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,126
- We're gonna be okay.
- I want to go home, Dad.

411
00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:24,027
- Did you get Dan?
- No. Maybe a quarantine's not bad.

412
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:34,242
Hello, sweetheart.

413
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:36,668
How would you like
a "Get Out Of Jail Free" card?

414
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,737
Okay... everybody, you can all
take off your masks and go home.

415
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,084
Oh, good.

416
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,509
Come with me.

417
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,641
- So we're not contagious?
- No, you're not.

418
00:37:56,681 --> 00:37:58,786
- The guy on the plane...
- Is he okay?

419
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:01,127
Peanut allergy.

420
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:03,650
I kind of gotta
use the restroom.

421
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,698
Okay. I'll take you.
Meet you outside?

422
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:07,680
Okay. Come on.
See you later.

423
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,269
JT, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

424
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:14,504
Sure.
- A flight in the middle of the week?

425
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:16,547
What are you trying to do?

426
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:19,402
Change my destiny.

427
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:25,000
Take a short cut
through ER.

428
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,956
I got the results back
of that lab work you asked for...

429
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,680
your blood, the blood
on the bullet...

430
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,884
It matches, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:37,162
Listen, can you tell me
what the hell's going on?

432
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:39,402
We've got a multi-car crash coming in.

433
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:41,348
Not this one.
We lost her on the way over.

434
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,779
I gotta go.

435
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:46,506
All right, I've got it,
I've got it.

436
00:38:46,544 --> 00:38:48,846
Any trouble breathing?

437
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,084
You saved my life. Oh, my God.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
