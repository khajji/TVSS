1
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:02,619
It's Jesse's birthday today.
She's 10 years old today.

2
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:06,306
Oh, boy, happy birthday, Jesse!

3
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:08,348
Don't be so loud, Pop.

4
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,047
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

5
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,907
Thank you.

6
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:15,746
Okay, now
you've got to make a wish.

7
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,201
- Okay...
- Okay.

8
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:20,153
- Good job.
- Thanks.

9
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:23,489
I point far
but not to the nearest star.

10
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:26,653
It's too early for riddles, Pop.

11
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,951
Wow! A laser.

12
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,806
Wow...

13
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:37,303
Wow, Pop, this is great.

14
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:47,574
- Thanks, Pop, I like it.
- You're welcome.

15
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:49,555
Does this mean
I'm going to get a telescope too?

16
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:51,190
We'll just have to wait and see.

17
00:02:51,229 --> 00:02:53,498
But you've got to eat your breakfast.
We're running late.

18
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:55,604
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,278
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey, Audrey.

46
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:40,003
-
- Just put it over there.

47
00:04:45,798 --> 00:04:48,613
Newscaster:
On this day in history, June 7th...

♪ ...the weather

What are the odds of that?

52
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:09,555
Okay, why Professor Neumeyer
is not dead--

53
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,760
Someone wants
to have a go at the physics?

54
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,763
Come on, people.

55
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:17,868
Male student:
Huh-- gravity, sir?

56
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:19,468
Female student:
Terminal velocity?

57
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,896
- The speed you were driving at.
- Man: The dog.

58
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,241
Dog is random,
dog is destiny.

59
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,216
Dog is the reason
Professor Neumeyer stands here

60
00:06:26,258 --> 00:06:28,265
instead of being skewered
to his truck seat. D-O-G.

61
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:30,161
Thank you, Mr. Axelrod.

62
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,298
This is not a graduate class.

63
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,915
Please, confine your comments
to the appropriate venue.

64
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,105
Make the most of him,
kiddiewinks.

65
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:43,917
He is the best physics professor
you will ever have.

66
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:52,162
All right,
please open your books

67
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:55,172
to Willard, page 16,
"Principles of Particles."

68
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,054
So...

69
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,057
I meant to work on reality sets all
spring, but I got hijacked by this idea.

70
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:14,307
No office hours today, Carl.

71
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:17,094
Believe me, it's okay.
Here, I just need you to sign here

72
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:19,997
- and I need you to sign there--
- No, I'm not your thesis advisor.

73
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,901
- Okay, Dr. Popovich--
- Popovich is a useless collection--

74
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,430
of subatomic--
this entire lobotomized faculty--

75
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,891
Carl, you're not listening to me.
I'm not your thesis advisor.

76
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,169
Do you know M.I.T. wanted me,
Chicago, Cal Tech...

77
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:33,442
I chose
this overpriced widget factory

78
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:35,266
because of you--
Stockholm...

79
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,689
your refutation of Witten's string
theory application...

80
00:07:37,732 --> 00:07:40,033
- you anticipated membranes--
- That was a long time ago.

81
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:43,100
Yeah, but it is still in there
and I want that.

82
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,008
Carl, you can be
extremely annoying.

83
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,701
- I can?
- Yes, do you know that?

84
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:53,686
Damn, Carl, social IQ...

85
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,998
I completely forgot
what today is for you--

86
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:58,879
I mean-- death of your wife,
birth of your daughter--

87
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,628
That's enough,
no, no, no, no,

88
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,518
my personal life
is off-limits, Carl.

89
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:05,722
Right, okay,
so when I research a subject,

90
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,246
I research it, like this idea

91
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:10,805
that I have been working on
basically since March.

92
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:13,017
- Here, you forgot your jacket.
-

93
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:15,158
When you get a look
at my special project--

94
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,374
- No, I'm sure.
- --trust me--

95
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,518
- Dr. Popovich will love it.
- it will blow your mind.

96
00:08:18,556 --> 00:08:19,603
I'm sure he'll love it, yeah.

97
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:21,617
Woman:
Denorvo Insurance.

98
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,667
Claudia, it's me.
Are you busy?

99
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,648
You sound stressed.
Everything okay?

100
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:29,302
Not really. Believe it or not,
I'm calling about an insurance issue

101
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:31,672
- and I am stressed.
- What happened?

102
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:34,934
- You won't believe it.
- No way!

103
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,205
- It's amazing, huh?
- Oh, my gosh.

104
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,149
Uh-oh.

105
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:41,396
- Uh-oh...
- Come on.

106
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:43,318
It's stuck, it's stuck, oh.

107
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:45,903
I'm glad it happened
after you dropped me off at school.

108
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,625
- Yeah, me too.
- Thanks.

109
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,197
Did my mom like Pop-Tarts?

110
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:04,840
You know, I don't think
she ever ate a Pop-Tart.

111
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,169
But would she like 'em?

112
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,762
Yeah, I think she would
if she ever tried one,

113
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,322
but only on weekends.

114
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:26,921
Hey, look.

115
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:31,946
What is that?
It looks kind of like a laptop.

116
00:09:31,982 --> 00:09:35,145
Don't touch it.

117
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:39,043
Hey, look,
it's got your name on it.

118
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,505
- Come on, pick it up.
- What?!

119
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:43,587
Come on.

120
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:45,699
All right, listen.
I want you to go stand back there.

121
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:48,193
Okay, Dad.

122
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:01,412
This is...

123
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,688
it's locked.

124
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:13,443
Maybe someone knew that
you were going to be here to find it.

125
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,697
Come on, Pop, birthday puzzle.

126
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,968
We can figure it out, right?

127
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:24,094
It's difficult to open a six-digit
combination, see? See there?

128
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:25,919
Not for you.

129
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:29,434
We've got to get going. We don't want
to keep the others waiting.

130
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:30,685
Why not?

131
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:33,820
It's just not a good idea
to keep anyone waiting.

132
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:46,966
- Okay, you all set?
- All set.

133
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,654
Oh, here they come.
Quick, everyone hide!

134
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,991
-
- Okay, everybody, take your places.

135
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:14,927
Honey, just leave that.
Just come here.

136
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:17,489
- Just hide.
- Quick, quick, quick, quick.

137
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,088
Jesse loves this.

138
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,974
You mean you do this for her
every year?

139
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,064
Yes, it's our tradition.

140
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:33,332
By the way, I invited Claudia
to the party.

141
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,024
You did? Why?

142
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,573
Because.
Hold on a minute...

143
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:40,522
Dad, I know it isn't locked.

144
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:42,418
Oh, no,
I can't find my house keys.

145
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,459
Come on,
let's just get this over with.

146
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:45,840
Surprise!

147
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,882
All screaming:
Surprise!

148
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,217
- Happy birthday, sweetie.
- Thank you.

149
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,355
Thanks, Uncle Brad.

150
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,018
Hey, how you doing?

151
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,966
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

152
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,496
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

153
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:01,903
Happy birthday, Jesse bear.

154
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,910
Let me know if there's anything
I can get for you.

155
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:06,220
Fine.

156
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,299
Oh, my gosh!

157
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:10,473
Is that my favorite
organic carrot cake?

158
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:13,477
- Maybe.
- Oh, boy.

159
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,250
- How are you? You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,390
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,216
Girl:
That's an apartment complex.

162
00:12:22,252 --> 00:12:23,658
Man:
A whole apartment complex.

163
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,830
- An apartment complex?
- You guys have a soda?

164
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:29,705
- Can I get you a soda, sweetie?
- Sure, thank you.

165
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,745
- Would you guys like a soda?
- Do you have a root beer?

166
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:33,640
Yes I do.

167
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:42,980
- Uh, Claudia...
- Yeah?

168
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:45,885
maybe we should rethink these.

169
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:48,261
- Why?
- They're toy guns.

170
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:51,840
Oh, come on, it's a birthday party,
it's supposed to be fun.

171
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:54,398
Well, actually,
it's not just a birthday party.

172
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:58,398
- It's also the anniversary--
- of Catherine, Jesse's mom.

173
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:00,989
Perhaps you didn't know that.

174
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:03,035
No, I know that.

175
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,344
It's always a tough day for JT.

176
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,484
Right.

177
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:09,345
Okay, well,
why don't we ask him?

178
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:13,242
- Okay, JT--
-

179
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:20,269
- Hey, you.
- Oh, hey.

180
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:23,985
That Claudia sure has some great...

181
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,198
energy.

182
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,341
That's what I was going to say.
She has great energy.

183
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:30,248
- Yeah, she does.
- So you've got a new girlfriend.

184
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,585
You've got a new briefcase.
Is this a new JT's sighting?

185
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:36,301
- What's next?
- No, no, I didn't buy this.

186
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:38,726
Somebody left this
at Katherine's grave.

187
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,005
- That's somewhat bizarre.
- Yeah.

188
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,462
Who knew you were going to be
there? I mean, besides us.

189
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,292
Nobody.
Well, it's not true actually,

190
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:48,458
remember that grad student of mine--
Carl Axelrod?

191
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:55,110
- I'll get you!
- Get outta here.

192
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:58,531
Okay. listen to me, listen to me.

193
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:00,100
- Document everything--
- Yeah.

194
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:02,180
every conversation,
every impression

195
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,129
and get witness statements
if you can get them.

196
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,960
You're watching too much Court TV.

197
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:08,962
No, come on, you remember
that math professor at Stanford?

198
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:11,523
You've got to be careful about things
these days. You really do.

199
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:56,898
Newscaster: Headlines for today,
June 7th, 1994--

200
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:58,977
friends and family
of O.J. Simpson

201
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:01,090
are pleading with him
to turn himself in.

202
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:03,038
P.A.:
Dr. Davenport, to radiology...

203
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:10,208
I'm so sorry, JT, we lost her.

204
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,292
Come on, Pop,
let's go open up my presents.

205
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:35,701
- All right, I'll be right there.
- Okay.

206
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:51,985
Oh my God!

207
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:53,841
- Playstation 2...
- Wow!

208
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,460
- I want one of those.
- Oh, my gosh, look.

209
00:19:56,498 --> 00:19:59,083
Yeah, big score,
big score, baby.

210
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:02,666
- Jesse?
- Wow! holy cow.

211
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:05,770
- It's bigger than you are.
- It's like up to there on you.

212
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,012
Jeez, it is.

213
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:10,829
- Wow!
- What could that be?

214
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:14,441
- I don't know.
- Guess, guess... flip it over.

215
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:17,195
- It's a telescope!
- Wow!

216
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,172
She's a beaut.

217
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:21,547
-
- Thank you.

218
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,402
- Thank you, Papa.
- You're welcome.

219
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:29,221
Pop, let's set up my telescope.

220
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:31,201
I've got to go out
for just a little bit, Jess.

221
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:34,471
I cannot find my house keys.
They're on the infinity ring.

222
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:36,481
Where are you taking the case,
Pop?

223
00:20:36,522 --> 00:20:38,464
Here is what we're gonna do,
Jess, when I get back,

224
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,545
we are going
to set up the telescope together

225
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:42,690
and we're going to look
at the star nursery in Orion.

226
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:43,906
- Promise?
- Promise.

227
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:46,116
Hold you to it.

228
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:48,573
Thanks for staying, Claudia.

229
00:20:54,055 --> 00:20:56,291
Hey!

230
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:58,693
Hey.

231
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,921
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

232
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,299
Should I be taking this personally
or is it just the whole day?

233
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,998
No, no, it's been--
you've been great.

234
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:09,978
No, I just--
I have to take care of this.

235
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,580
And it can't wait till morning?

236
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,368
I tell you what, I will tell you
all about it tonight in bed.

237
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:17,560
- In bed here?
- Hmm-hm.

238
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,117
Have you spoken to her?

239
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,567
No, but I think
she'll be okay about it.

240
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:35,191
Well, I'd like to know
if she'd be okay about it...

241
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:37,335
because if she is not,

242
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:41,050
a couple of months of hot dating
is all we're ever going to be.

243
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:44,762
I agree and I think
we should play it safe.

244
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,771
Listen, I don't want
to blow this either.

245
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:48,502
We'll just be careful.

246
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:57,235
- See you later, squirrel.
- Bye, Pop.

247
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:36,354
...like this idea that I've been
working on basically since March.

248
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,779
- Here, you forgot your jacket.
-

249
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:41,156
So when you get a look
at my special project,

250
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:44,669
trust me, it will blow your mind.

251
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,614
Carl on Intercom:
Who is it?

252
00:24:57,654 --> 00:24:59,726
Professor Neumeyer,
we need to talk right now.

253
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:02,067
Step back from the door.

254
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,817
Your special project, Carl,
we need to talk about it.

255
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:07,536
Step back from the door.

256
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,743
You crossed the line, Carl.

257
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:12,910
Who is it?

258
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,587
All right, Carl.

259
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:19,725
Why don't I take this to Campus Security
and let them deal with you?

260
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:21,998
Step back from the door.

261
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:28,965
Who is it?

262
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:37,706
Don't you dare
tell me it's easy, okay?

263
00:25:37,742 --> 00:25:40,230
Forget the picture.
Just look at the shapes.

264
00:25:41,805 --> 00:25:43,877
- Oh, here.
-

265
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,372
Come here.

266
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:49,319
Northwest Psychic Hotline.

267
00:25:49,356 --> 00:25:52,225
- Hi, hey, it's me.
- Did you open the case?

268
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:55,649
Listen, I'm gonna be a little longer.
Will you tell Claudia?

269
00:25:55,691 --> 00:25:58,309
I'm stopping by Brad and Chantal's,
then I'll be home.

270
00:25:58,346 --> 00:26:00,615
You promised to set up my telescope
so I'm going to wait for you

271
00:26:00,649 --> 00:26:03,845
- school night and all.
- Okay, deal.

272
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:07,328
- Dad's gonna be late.
- No biggie.

273
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:10,597
Hey, wait a minute...

274
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:12,322
Ha!

275
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,395
Wow! Jeez.

276
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:47,191
You should have seen your face.

277
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,207
Oh, you bastard.

278
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,174
Hey, I want to show you this.
You've got to read this.

279
00:26:53,216 --> 00:26:56,793
- What is it?
- A grad student's summer project.

280
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,732
- Stick'em up!
-

281
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:02,010
This is incredible.

282
00:27:02,046 --> 00:27:03,955
Look at this bullet hole.

283
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,102
Is there such a thing
as grad school for Photoshop?

284
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:09,173
No, but it's not flawless you know--

285
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:12,659
I don't have a blue parka,
I don't own a green Jeep Cherokee.

286
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,641
And there's no way
I would ever step foot into

287
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:17,585
a redneck bar
called "Buck Naked."

288
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:19,536
What are you gonna do?

289
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:22,163
Turn it over tomorrow
to campus police.

290
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:24,852
Campus police?
Nah-ah, you need the real thing.

291
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:27,638
Come on, JT, this is really sick.

292
00:27:27,673 --> 00:27:30,039
This is what they call
obsessive behavior.

293
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:33,454
This guy is deranged.
This goes way beyond stalking.

294
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:35,404
You've got to take this stuff
downtown tonight

295
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:38,742
- and let the police deal with Carl.
- There is no way to prove he did it.

296
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:41,491
Well, is he smart enough?
Or crazy enough?

297
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,381
You know what he is?
He's a religious fanatic

298
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,268
whose religion happens to be
quantum physics.

299
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:48,945
Hey, wait a minute.
Look at this--

300
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,955
I'm on the suspects list

301
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:53,265
and he's got
my social security number.

302
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,746
My God, this could be...
Identity theft.

303
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:59,175
If you're not gonna call,
I'm gonna do it right now.

304
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:02,414
Wait, hold on.
I got a better idea.

305
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:06,639
There's a detective here,
Detective Irwin Sikorski.

306
00:28:19,598 --> 00:28:21,900
Give me tape, lots of tape.

307
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,006
Give me room to live and breathe.

308
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:39,329
- When you got here, what did you do?
- Nothing much...

309
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,344
checked for a pulse,
but he was flatlined.

310
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,841
- Dialed you straight up, Detective.
-

311
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:50,912
Let's see what we have.

312
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,356
Autopsy's going to find that--

313
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:12,447
or what's missing from that,
stuck in his esophagus.

314
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,331
Either asphyxiated,
went cardiac or both.

315
00:29:15,363 --> 00:29:18,712
No foul play, no fun for me.

316
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:21,696
Woman:
I just want to know...

317
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,999
Tell Doughnut Dan to lay us out
a few dozen murder weapons,

318
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:25,942
before I eat that evidence,
would you?

319
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:28,319
- Yeah, you got it.
- Stand back.

320
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:30,360
- I live right here.
- Excuse me.

321
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,302
Unless you're the new evidence man,
get the hell out of my crime scene.

322
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:36,474
Detective Sikorski, JT Neumeyer,
I just need a moment of your time.

323
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,583
I'll give you a moment
in my holding tank, Neumeyer.

324
00:29:38,623 --> 00:29:41,918
- Now get the hell out of here.
- It's very important, please.

325
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,856
-
-

326
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:07,094
You know, if that guy out there
chewed like his mother taught him,

327
00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:10,259
he'll be home
watching the news by now.

328
00:30:10,297 --> 00:30:11,726
How did you find me?

329
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,742
I have a friend
who works at a newspaper.

330
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:15,855
They have a scanner,
they knew you'd be here,

331
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:18,546
they knew you had a weakness
for pastrami, so...

332
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,654
I got a lot of weaknesses,
believe me.

333
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:23,182
So...

334
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:26,091
you're scheduled
to die on Friday, huh?

335
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,075
I hope not, it's inconvenient.

336
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,255
Always is.

337
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,357
Hand them out
to those guys over there.

338
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:37,584
You got anybody in mind for this?
It's obviously somebody you know.

339
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:39,528
You must have some idea.

340
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,312
Well, there's a graduate student
named Carl Axelrod...

341
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:45,287
So that's a start.

342
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,239
Why don't you...

343
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:49,582
tell this to campus police?
They live for this kind of crap.

344
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,558
Doesn't it bother you
that your name's on it?

345
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,502
Well, if it has to do with homicide,
it better be.

346
00:30:54,544 --> 00:30:58,285
I'm sorry, Professor, I don't do hoaxes,
especially ones full of holes.

347
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,318
Holes...
what do you mean by that?

348
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:05,706
It says here. I didn't attend
the autopsy, right there--

349
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:09,635
"Tuesday, June 15th, 2.00 P.M.,
investigating officer not present."

350
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,651
You know the last time
I missed an autopsy?

351
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:14,823
- Nah.
- Neither do I.

352
00:31:16,012 --> 00:31:18,913
Well, I don't know you
from a hole in the ground.

353
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:21,125
But you don't look the type to me

354
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:23,464
that hangs out in a sleaze pit
like"Buck Naked."

355
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:25,952
- No.
- It's just a prank.

356
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:29,571
Some junior egghead
is trying to screw with you a little.

357
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:31,168
- A little huh?
- Uh-uh.

358
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:34,077
I see people get screwed with a lot.
This is a little.

359
00:31:35,112 --> 00:31:37,021
It's just paper.

360
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:43,841
Why don't you go home and
just be thankful you didn't die

361
00:31:43,878 --> 00:31:46,266
with a piece of doughnut
clogged in your throat?

362
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,106
Thanks for the pastrami.

363
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:20,926
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

364
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:23,446
- When did you get back?
- About a half-hour ago.

365
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,395
Did you get everything
taken care of?

366
00:32:25,437 --> 00:32:28,950
Yeah, for tonight anyway.
I'm sorry it took so long.

367
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,922
- You know what?
- Huh?

368
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:34,517
It was time well spent.
She's a good kid. We had fun.

369
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:39,826
What do you say you run a bath
and we have a little fun too?

370
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:41,722
Huh?

371
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:45,682
I'll be right up. I'm just gonna
show Jesse the Orion Nebula.

372
00:32:58,104 --> 00:33:00,492
Those are baby stars, Jesse,

373
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:03,698
made up from gases
and space dust.

374
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:09,043
You know the light we're seeing tonight
was emitted 1,500 years ago?

375
00:33:09,077 --> 00:33:11,313
Wow!

376
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:16,813
You opened the case,
didn't you?

377
00:33:54,252 --> 00:33:56,161
Entrez.

378
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:00,546
- Care to join me?
- Absolutely.

379
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:08,639
Thank you.

380
00:34:08,682 --> 00:34:12,227
- For what?
- For being here,

381
00:34:12,265 --> 00:34:15,330
being so good to Jesse,

382
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:19,458
but most of all for being naked
in this bathtub.

383
00:34:32,388 --> 00:34:34,428
Want to wash my back?

384
00:34:34,468 --> 00:34:37,501
- You, tease.
- Absolutely.

385
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,769
I've got a present for you.

386
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,191
I thought it would be perfect
for you, so...

387
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,174
What did you do?

388
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:04,410
Do you like it?

389
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:07,670
What's wrong?

390
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:15,097
But I just bought it, JT.

391
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:18,480
How could Carl know
right down to the color?

392
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:23,093
You know, I mean...

393
00:35:23,131 --> 00:35:26,097
every second parka is blue.
It's a coincidence.

394
00:35:26,138 --> 00:35:28,177
It's...

395
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:33,682
Look, you weren't even at my funerals.
You wouldn't miss that, would you?

396
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,247
I mean, it's...

397
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:37,557
Claudia, look,
I'm a physics teacher,

398
00:35:37,592 --> 00:35:41,334
I'm a single dad.
I do jigsaw puzzles, for God's sake.

399
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,920
Who'd want to kill me?
I'm too damn dull.

400
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,081
- Do you want to kill me?
- How?

401
00:35:48,117 --> 00:35:50,419
Do you think Brad wants to kill me?

402
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:53,551
Why would Brad want to kill you?
He's your brother-In-law.

403
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:55,977
Yeah, well, but I'm gonna show you
something here.

404
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,416
- You're both on the suspect list.
- Wow, I'm a suspect.

405
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:05,898
Yeah, along with Carl
who worships me for some reason,

406
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:07,563
and there's some guy
I've never heard of.

407
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:08,910
Who?

408
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:11,687
Roy Bremmer.

409
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,217
This is really unromantic.
I think we need to...

410
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:21,038
- just put this away.
- Let's take a rain check.

411
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,852
No, I mean Claudia,
you can still stay.

412
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,966
Another time.

413
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:31,972
- Claudia, what's wrong, I--
- Nothing's wrong.

414
00:36:32,013 --> 00:36:36,649
I mean, I know this whole thing
is kind of spooky but--

415
00:36:36,684 --> 00:36:37,862
Nothing's wrong.

416
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,518
I just think it would be better
if we did it another time, that's all.

9999
