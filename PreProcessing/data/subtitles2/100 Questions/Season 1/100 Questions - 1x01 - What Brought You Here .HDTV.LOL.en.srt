00:00:01,574 --> 00:00:02,974
- Welcome to soul mate
specialists, inc.

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:06,978
Make yourself comfortable.
But not on the couch.

3
00:00:07,046 --> 00:00:09,848
As I said, I'm andrew,
your soul mate specialist.

4
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,217
- I'm charlotte,
your soul mate searcher,

5
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:13,485
Searching for-

6
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:15,921
- Please hold your comments
until I'm done.

7
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:17,122
Sorry.

8
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:18,156
Let me start by saying

9
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:20,125
Congratulations,
miss payne.

10
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,527
You're about to take
the most comprehensive

11
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,696
Personality test
in the industry.

12
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:26,664
- Sounds fun.
- Fun?

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,367
You go to a carnival
for fun.

14
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:31,903
I don't like carnivals.

15
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:35,407
- The point is, this is science,
miss payne.

16
00:00:35,474 --> 00:00:38,109
100 scientifically
formulated questions

17
00:00:38,177 --> 00:00:39,344
Answered face-to-face

18
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:42,547
To ensure the client
is honest, thorough,

19
00:00:42,615 --> 00:00:46,251
And at least within 15 pounds
of what they say they weigh.

20
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:47,786
- You might just want
to change-

21
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:49,621
I already did.

22
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:51,489
Once you've answered these
questions,

23
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,891
We will know exactly
who you are.

24
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:56,361
Then we can find
your soul mate.

25
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,397
- The thing is, I'm not sure
I believe in soul mates.

26
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:00,665
Why not?

27
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,534
- Well, when your dad has four
ex-soul mates

28
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:03,735
And your mom has three,

29
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:06,137
It does make you question
the whole concept.

30
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,539
If you don't believe in it,

31
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,307
Then why are you taking
this test?

32
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:11,676
'cause I want to believe.

33
00:01:11,744 --> 00:01:14,212
- Well,
let's get started then.

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,948
Question #1:
What brought you here?

35
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:21,152
- I guess it was a really
bad date.

36
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,488
- It always is, girl.
It always is.

37
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:26,057
- My friends and I went
to a yankees game

38
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,694
With this guy I was dating...
Rick.

39
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:36,034
- Oh, my god.
Look at the third baseman.

40
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:38,203
I don't care if steroids
shrunk his junk.

41
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:41,506
I would totally sleep
with him.

42
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:45,377
- And that makes
the entire infield.

43
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:47,779
- You know,
you should take steroids.

44
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:51,383
I'm a lawyer.

45
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:53,885
- Yeah, but you could be
a super lawyer.

46
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:58,290
- You're a wonderful girl,
charlotte payne.

47
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:00,492
Thanks, rick.

48
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:03,795
- I really enjoy spending time
with you and your friends.

49
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,730
You guys are great.

50
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,631
I feel like since I've started
dating charlotte,

51
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:09,734
You guys have become
my friends.

52
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:11,703
Like we're this...

53
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:15,874
Big group of friends.

54
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:21,880
That guy is not my friend.

55
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:25,750
Hey.

56
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:27,619
You wearing space pants?

57
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,022
'cause your ass
is out of this world.

58
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,093
Yeah. No.

59
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:38,263
I think you're looking for
someone with lower standards.

60
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:41,766
Hi, I'm jill.

61
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:43,668
- Charlotte, I need
to talk to you.

62
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:45,603
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain seated

63
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:48,773
As we have a very special
announcement.

64
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:50,842
Um, why are you standing?

65
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,810
Um, why do you have
a microphone?

66
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:55,213
Um, why are we
on the jumbotron?

67
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,448
Oh.

68
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:57,949
- Dude, we're totally on tv
right now.

69
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,318
Ha.

70
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,122
- Can I have your attention,
folks?

71
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,924
Charlotte payne,

72
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:09,894
The last three months
have been the sweetest

73
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:11,529
Of my life.

74
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,430
That is all because of you.

75
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:18,669
Bro.

76
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,809
Charlotte payne.

77
00:03:29,782 --> 00:03:32,884
Will you marry me?

78
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:40,625
- Wh-rick, I don't know
what to say.

79
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:44,896
um...

80
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:48,566
I just don't feel that way
about you.

81
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:52,570
Oh-oh!

82
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:55,974
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

83
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,976
I hope we can still be
friends...

84
00:03:58,044 --> 00:04:01,179
Friends...Friends...
Friends...

85
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:06,451
We really shouldn't have
carpooled with them.

86
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:13,341
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

87
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,066
I can't believe it.

88
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,936
<i>People throw food at us
and we get thrown out.</i>

89
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,705
- Is all the popcorn
out of my hair?

90
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:43,506
- You know, there's some hot dog
in there too.

91
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:46,409
You should really take
a shower.

92
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:49,913
- Rick cried for 45 minutes
straight.

93
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:53,650
I timed it.
It was 45 minutes.

94
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:55,252
Was it really that bad?

95
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,354
- When you said you hoped
you could still be friends,

96
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:01,091
My testicles actually hurt.

97
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:03,360
Like, physically hurt.

98
00:05:03,427 --> 00:05:05,528
Why would he propose?

99
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,430
We've been dating
for three months.

100
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:10,300
Why would someone propose
after only three months?

101
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,937
- I'll bet it's the accent.
- It's not the accent.

102
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:16,439
- Then you must be wicked
in the sack.

103
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,942
- I am not wicked
in the sack.

104
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,178
That's disappointing.

105
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,047
- Um, so what do I do?
Do I call him?

106
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:28,351
Do I go over there?
- No. Uh-uh.

107
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:33,456
You are not going over there.
That is crazy.

108
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:36,726
The last person
rick wants to see is you.

109
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,862
Think about it.

110
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:42,132
Are there any other gestures
I can make with this finger?

111
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:46,136
- God, I regret buying you
that thing.

112
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:49,973
- "meet me for a drink
tomorrow at 5:00"?

113
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,242
Who is this texting me?

114
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,178
- It's the painted guy
from the game.

115
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:57,981
I slipped him your number
when security escorted us out.

116
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,082
When?

117
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,350
- Right before that tray
of nachos

118
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,085
Hit you in the face.

119
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:05,055
Come on, leslie.
Just go on one date with him.

120
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,792
- No. It's too soon.
- It's been a year.

121
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:11,995
Jeffrey has moved on.
- You can't be sure of that.

122
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:15,598
- We watched him get married
through binoculars.

123
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,168
- Well,
he didn't look happy.

124
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:20,403
- It'll be good for you
to get out and date again.

125
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:23,940
For all of us, really.

126
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,177
- Fine. I'll go out
with the creepy painted guy.

127
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:28,945
Yay.

128
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,414
- But if I end up dead
in a ditch, it's your fault.

129
00:06:31,482 --> 00:06:35,585
- Yay.
- This is a bad idea.

130
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:37,120
That guy had the worst
pick-up line

131
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:38,488
I've ever heard in my life.

132
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:40,623
- The space pants?
It was cute.

133
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,991
Oh.

134
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:43,560
I can come up with a better
pick-up line than that

135
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,728
Off the top of my head.

136
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,629
Okay, let's hear it.

137
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,064
Okay. Fine.

138
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:50,266
Um, what's a n-

139
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:54,137
Hold on a second.

140
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,240
Are you an-are those win-
are you an angel?

141
00:06:57,308 --> 00:06:59,743
Appalling.

142
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,544
- I thought lawyers
could speak good.

143
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,179
- Oh, yeah, I thought
kindergarten teachers

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,448
Were supposed to be able
to talk-to speak-

145
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:07,584
Forget it.

146
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:10,086
- There, I did it.
I'm gonna meet him for a drink.

147
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,321
Not a date.
Just a drink.

148
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,222
So everybody just calm down.

149
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:21,398
- Okay, I cannot just sit here.
I'm going to call rick.

150
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,933
- Yeah. I want to see
if he's still crying.

151
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:27,404
- Oh, god. He can't still
be crying.

152
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:30,774
- Uh, he's crying
if he's watching this.

153
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,342
What is it?

154
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,378
- It's a video of you breaking
a grown man's heart.

155
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:37,213
It's all over the internet.

156
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:40,750
And they're calling you
the, uh...

157
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:42,718
Yankee bitch.

158
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,489
- I hope we can still be
friends...

159
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,660
Friends...Friends...Friends...
- Oh, there it is again. Oh.

160
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:52,996
- Forget it.
I can't call rick.

161
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:57,133
<i>I can never ever, ever
face him again.</i>

162
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,602
The ring is still on my finger,
isn't it?

163
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:13,116
Everybody's staring at me.

164
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,152
- No, they're not.
They're staring at me.

165
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,121
And I like it.

166
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,926
No, wait, they are staring
at you.

167
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:24,260
- Oh, hi.
My name's charl-

168
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:27,130
- Mr. Preston, the yankee bitch
is here to see you.

169
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:33,203
- Rick. Hi.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

170
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,071
It's just I left you messages
and I didn't hear back.

171
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,806
And I didn't know if it was
'cause you didn't get them

172
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,874
Or if you didn't want
to see me-

173
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,375
- I didn't want
to see you.

174
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:42,712
Now I know.

175
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,550
Yes. And I wanted
to give you back the ring.

176
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,518
There. There.

177
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:52,989
I'm so sorry, rick, about
the way everything happened.

178
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:54,390
If I could just
turn back time-

179
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:57,760
- Where's the ring?
- It's not there?

180
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,629
- You lost
my grandmother's ring?

181
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,898
- It was your grandmother's.
It was his grandmother's!

182
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:04,100
- All right, calm down.
Uh, let's retrace our steps.

183
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,335
Yes.

184
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,736
- Last night
after you humiliated rick-

185
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:07,804
Well, I wouldn't say-

186
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:09,038
We went back to your place,

187
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,740
You discovered the ring
was still on your finger.

188
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:11,941
Right.

189
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,176
- Then it got stuck
on wayne's finger.

190
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,545
- Wayne put it on?
- For, like, two seconds.

191
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:17,647
- Then he ran around the room
pretending he was gollum

192
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,216
<i>From lord of the rings.</i>

193
00:09:20,284 --> 00:09:22,552
my precious.

194
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,991
- Oh, that was gollum.
I thought he was doing yoda.

195
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:29,592
Yeah.

196
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:31,027
- And then mike did
that magic trick

197
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,928
Where he swallowed it,
but it reappeared at the bottom

198
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,197
Of leslie's wine glass.

199
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,431
no way.

200
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:36,966
oh!

201
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,835
- That is crazy!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

202
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:40,904
- That was awesome.
- Yeah.

203
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:43,373
- That ring has been
in our family for 70 years.

204
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,776
- I'm so sorry.
I will find it. I promise.

205
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:49,045
- Can you tell me
which of these men is single

206
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:53,416
And makes six figures?

207
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:59,260
- It's not here. We're never
gonna find this ring.

208
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:00,928
- Charlotte.
- Yes!

209
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,998
- I just found a big-ass check
made out to you and leslie

210
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:06,267
From max goldberg.

211
00:10:06,334 --> 00:10:07,535
Who's max goldberg?

212
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:09,470
- We planned his son's
bar mitzvah.

213
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,807
Leslie sent a collection agency
after him.

214
00:10:12,874 --> 00:10:14,708
- What should I do
with the check?

215
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,711
- Put it back in the couch.
You never saw it.

216
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:22,383
- I got it.
- Yes, the ring!

217
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,387
- Nope.
The best pick-up line.

218
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:28,022
Wayne and I are having
a competition.

219
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:29,690
You ready?

220
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:32,626
Do you have a sunburn
or are you always this hot?

221
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:35,696
- Ugh.
- Ugh. Blugh.

222
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:38,632
- My turn.
- Disgusting.

223
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,503
Do you have a sunburn
or are you always this hot?

224
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:44,605
- Aw.
- Hi.

225
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:46,707
Ah! That's my line.

226
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:48,108
- I told you, it's not
about the line,

227
00:10:48,109 --> 00:10:49,543
It's about the delivery.

228
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:51,444
- Well, you were supposed to say
something that you wrote.

229
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:52,613
I didn't write anything.

230
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:53,948
- What were you doing
this whole time?

231
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:58,152
I was drawing a ninja.

232
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,421
God, this is awful.

233
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:02,656
First I embarrass him-
- humiliate!

234
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:05,226
<i>- Humiliate him
at yankee stadium</i>

235
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:06,794
And then I lose his ring.

236
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:07,895
<i>His grandmother's ring.</i>

237
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:11,365
- Thank you very,
very much.

238
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:14,969
- So I go to meet
the body painter.

239
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,705
I walk in, scan the room,

240
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,908
And then I realize
I have no idea

241
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:22,243
What this guy
actually looks like

242
00:11:22,244 --> 00:11:24,678
Without his body paint.

243
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,414
And then...
- Leslie?

244
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,586
- Well?
- Albino.

245
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:36,590
All: Albino?

246
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:40,327
- Albino.
- What-what did you do?

247
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,696
Did you run?
Did you just run out of there?

248
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:45,165
- No.
- I would've run.

249
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:48,135
I would've just run
out of there.

250
00:11:48,203 --> 00:11:49,470
I didn't know what to do.

251
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:51,705
I just made up the first excuse
that came into my head.

252
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:54,275
I'm engaged.

253
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:55,843
Ah, the ring!

254
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:57,344
I know. I'm sorry.

255
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:00,047
It was on my finger from when
mike and I did the mock wedding.

256
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:02,015
What mock wedding?

257
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:12,726
- You fell asleep.
It was beautiful.

258
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:14,461
- Okay, wait, wait, wait,
what did he say?

259
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:16,964
- He didn't buy it.
He said "you're not engaged.

260
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:21,568
That's the ring that guy gave
the yankee bitch."

261
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:24,772
- I think that nickname's
gonna stick.

262
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,907
- So what did you do?
Did you leave?

263
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:30,244
- Actually, no.
We started chatting.

264
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:33,247
And then we ordered a drink.
And it turns out...

265
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:35,482
You like the albino.

266
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,453
I like the albino.

267
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:41,355
I told him to meet us
at the bar later.

268
00:12:41,356 --> 00:12:45,225
Oh, no, no, no, no.

269
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:47,061
No. I'm sorry.

270
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:48,495
I do not think
I can handle that.

271
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:49,964
No. This is perfect.

272
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:52,066
I'm gonna call rick,
have him meet us at the bar,

273
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,267
Give him back the ring,

274
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:55,168
And then I will be done
with this. Yes.

275
00:12:55,203 --> 00:13:00,341
one ring to rule them all.

276
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,576
- I think
that's the cookie monster.

277
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:13,454
I wish rick would get here.
I want to get this over with.

278
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:16,724
- I got something to take
your mind off the whole thing.

279
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,359
Did I just feel
an earthquake

280
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,960
Or did you just
rock my world?

281
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,562
- Ew.
- Please.

282
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:23,464
- Come on, mike,
it's getting old.

283
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:24,631
How about this?

284
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:26,300
Did I just feel an earthquake

285
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:28,201
Or did you just rock
my world?

286
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:30,270
- Aw.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:33,007
- Oh, come on, I just said
the same exact thing!

288
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,675
I will bet you 100 bucks

289
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:36,076
I can pick up any girl
in this bar

290
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:37,745
With any line you write.

291
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:39,546
anything I write.

292
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:41,281
- Yeah.
It's all in the delivery.

293
00:13:41,282 --> 00:13:43,150
You are on.

294
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:46,387
There is no way a man
could garner a woman's interest

295
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:51,291
By saying these words.

296
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:52,860
- Okay,
that's just disturbing.

297
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:55,729
- Any girl, right?
- Yeah.

298
00:13:55,797 --> 00:14:00,267
Her.

299
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:03,537
Candy from a baby.

300
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:18,819
In 1775,
cancer of the scrotum

301
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:23,290
Was a common disease
among chimney sweeps.

302
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,437
- What's your name?
- Oh!

303
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:38,605
Come on!

304
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:40,307
- Face it, mike,
there's nothing you can write

305
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,675
That wayne can't sell.

306
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:44,778
- Yes, there is.
- Oh, god.

307
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:48,715
You gonna write another fun fact
about scrotum cancer?

308
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,684
- No. I'm gonna write
the one thing

309
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:53,187
That wayne will never say
to a woman.

310
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:55,154
- Which is?
- Hello, charlotte.

311
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:58,692
- Rick! Hello.
- Where's my grandma's ring?

312
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,660
- Um, rick,
could we please talk?

313
00:15:00,662 --> 00:15:01,695
Go ahead. Talk.

314
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:02,696
Well, not in front

315
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:03,797
Of all these people.

316
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:06,633
Suddenly you want privacy.

317
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,973
- Mike, I believe, uh,
you owe me some money.

318
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,708
- Care to go double
or nothing?

319
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,078
Yeah. You got a line?

320
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:20,714
What is this?
- The truth.

321
00:15:20,782 --> 00:15:24,384
Ha. I think I'll pass.

322
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:26,787
- Did you see
the internet thing?

323
00:15:26,855 --> 00:15:28,222
I did.

324
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:33,460
- They already did
a techno remix.

325
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:36,029
I know.

326
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:39,399
60,000 hits, though.

327
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:42,269
It's terrible.
People are terrible.

328
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,638
- Man. Rick looks
really mad.

329
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:46,673
- I wish I knew
what they were saying.

330
00:15:46,741 --> 00:15:48,542
Does anybody read lips?

331
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:50,410
- I'm pretty good
at charades.

332
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:53,080
- I think it's a movie.
- Five words. Sounds like...?

333
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:55,349
<i>Children of a lesser god!</i>

334
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,986
- Guys, they're not actually
playing charades.

335
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,021
- No, it's something
with bruce willis.

336
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:02,523
<i>- Die hard.
- No.</i>

337
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:04,424
<i>- Die hard 2.
- No, no.</i>

338
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:06,193
- What's the one
where the little kid,

339
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:08,328
He sees all the ghosts?
- Hi, leslie.

340
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,597
- Aaah!
- Ah-ah.

341
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:21,175
- Oh.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

342
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:23,577
I- I'm sorry.
You startled him.

343
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:26,780
He has this thing about-
- I thought you were a ghost.

344
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:29,249
No. No, no!

345
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,787
You were stupid.

346
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:39,226
- Rick, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

347
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:40,761
Well, you did.

348
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:42,696
- And I never guessed
in a million years

349
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:44,565
That after only three months
of dating,

350
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:46,567
You'd propose
at yankee stadium.

351
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:50,904
Well, I did.

352
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:53,373
- There'll be someone out there
that says yes.

353
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:56,977
- So what is it, you're just
not the marrying kind?

354
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:59,713
- No, rick, it's not that,
it's just-

355
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,916
- It's just you don't want
to marry me.

356
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,555
I'm sorry, rick.

357
00:17:08,623 --> 00:17:12,159
Well, just for the record,

358
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:15,662
My grandma
would not have liked you.

359
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,732
- Oh, rick, please
don't be like this!

360
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,069
- Keep it down, yankee bitch!
- God.

361
00:17:22,136 --> 00:17:25,072
I am not a bitch!

362
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:28,508
Technically,
I'm not even a yankee.

363
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:37,684
- Leslie, I'm sorry I yelled
at your albino friend.

364
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:41,288
- You didn't yell,
you shrieked...Like a girl.

365
00:17:41,356 --> 00:17:43,357
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

366
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,058
Wayne, did I shriek?

367
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:49,062
Like a tiny, tiny girl.

368
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,935
- Charlotte, you're really
eating a lot.

369
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:57,471
You told me to always
tell you.

370
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:59,606
Well, I'm upset.

371
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:01,208
- Well, you got to tell us
when you're upset

372
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:03,777
So we know to order
more food.

373
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:06,413
This whole rick thing,

374
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,548
It's made me realize
that for the first time

375
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:13,086
In my entire life,
I want somebody.

376
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:14,988
I want somebody forever.

377
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,491
Wh-what if I don't
find that person?

378
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:19,793
What if the right guy
never proposes?

379
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,461
- I'm telling you,
guys are gonna propose

380
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:23,230
Simply because
of that accent.

381
00:18:23,231 --> 00:18:24,364
I've known you six years,

382
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:28,035
I've almost proposed
like 14 times.

383
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:31,605
- You had a mary poppins thing
when you were a kid.

384
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:34,074
Who didn't?

385
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,910
She's a dirty little nanny.

386
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:38,979
- Hey, guys,
I'm not up for

387
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,947
The mary poppins discussion
tonight, just so you know.

388
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:42,816
- I've got
your spoon full of sugar

389
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,819
Right here, mary.

390
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,953
Right. That's it.

391
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,221
The yankee bitch
is throwing you out.

392
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:50,122
Everyone out.

393
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:51,925
- I bet if you got
a couple drinks in mary,

394
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:57,431
She'd be supercalifragilistic-
expiali-delicious.

395
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,902
- You want us to stay?
- I'll be fine.

396
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:11,345
forgot my foam finger.

397
00:19:11,412 --> 00:19:16,116
Helps when I want
to hail a cab.

398
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:18,819
- What was written
on that napkin mike gave you?

399
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:20,587
- Uh, the one thing
I wouldn't say to a girl

400
00:19:20,588 --> 00:19:22,089
I was trying to impress.

401
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,125
- Oh, yeah?
Which was?

402
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:27,361
Eh...

403
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,301
My name
is wayne rutherford.

404
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,169
My father is a billionaire.

405
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,338
18 months ago, he cut me off.

406
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:41,208
I've never held a job
and I have no money.

407
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,244
I sleep on my friend's couch
and have no idea

408
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:48,915
What I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

409
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:51,818
Now would that line work
on you?

410
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:55,922
- Um, you're right.
That would never work.

411
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,531
- There's a guy out there
for you.

412
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,600
He's gonna turn up.

413
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,168
And he's gonna ask you
to marry him.

414
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:09,836
And it won't be because
of your accent.

415
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:14,107
And it won't be because
you're wicked in the sack.

416
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:17,544
There's only one reason
he'll want you to be his wife.

417
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:21,415
- What?
- You don't know?

418
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:24,451
It's 'cause you're
charlotte payne.

419
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,244
What are you writing?

420
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,412
This isn't the type of answer

421
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,446
People normally give,
is it?

422
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,549
Hell, no. Not at all.

423
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,486
But I think I can help you.
- Oh, great.

424
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,088
Who is my soul mate?

425
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:00,425
- Ted merman. He's an accountant
on long island.

426
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,428
- Really?
- No, that's my joke.

427
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,198
- You've only answered
one question.

428
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,301
We've got a long way
to go.

429
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,770
Now, question #2...

430
