1
00:00:02,046 --> 00:00:03,980
You know, after
answering only a few

2
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:05,448
Of these soul mate questions,

3
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:08,618
I totally see why
they're so probing and complex.

4
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:10,120
Well, I think

5
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:13,022
You're making them harder
than they're supposed to be.

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,491
I mean, you didn't
exactly have to tell

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:16,025
A whole 30 minute story
when I asked you

8
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,160
If your billing address

9
00:00:17,228 --> 00:00:20,296
Was the same as
your current address.

10
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:22,098
It was a brilliant story.

11
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,234
[phone ringing]

12
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,770
I'm not getting that.

13
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:27,771
Why?

14
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:30,073
It's my ex, renaldo.

15
00:00:30,141 --> 00:00:32,575
He's crazy.

16
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:35,845
But he looks just like
a cocoa brown Daniel Craig.

17
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:41,251
He's a bad, bad,
delicious, bad man.

18
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:43,986
Oh. Mm.

19
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:45,721
I tried a renaldo once.

20
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:47,823
Really? I can't see you
with a bad boy.

21
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:50,726
His name was Luke,
and he was a biker.

22
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:52,060
Vroom, vroom!

23
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,462
- Mm-hmm.

24
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:54,529
Jill was dating his friend,

25
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:56,565
Which should've
been my first warning.

26
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,834
But there was
something about him.

27
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:01,169
With muscles, his leather...

28
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:03,171
Tattoos, sweat!

29
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,640
This might be the first story
of yours

30
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:06,441
I actually wanna hear.

31
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,212
Then I got this one
a few months ago.

32
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,247
It's the Japanese symbol
for strength.

33
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:14,816
Yes, it is.

34
00:01:15,884 --> 00:01:20,254
And, um, what is this one for?

35
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:22,256
Well, that one there's
for my friend Rico.

36
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:23,457
He passed last year.

37
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:25,059
Man, I couldn't do anything.

38
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,928
Couldn't ride, couldn't drink,

39
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:28,763
Couldn't fight
for, like, six months.

40
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:33,968
It's hard when you lose
as many friends as we do.

41
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,403
Together: To Rico.

42
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:41,242
So you just leave
that there on the floor?

43
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,578
God, so rebellious.

44
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:47,113
- Yeah.
- Mm.

45
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,751
- Hey--whoa!

46
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,420
That is dangerous.

47
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,489
Someone should
put a cone over this.

48
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:58,191
Mike, Wayne,
this is Luke and Pete.

49
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,496
- Hi.
- How's it going?

50
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:03,663
See you later.

51
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:05,499
- Oh, we were gonna join--
- See you later.

52
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,234
- So we can't even--
- See you later.

53
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,302
Right.

54
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,938
Hey, Tony, the usual.

55
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:15,875
Hey, you know what
those guys remind me of?

56
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:19,145
- Who?
- Us.

57
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:21,647
Would not have been
my first guess.

58
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:23,249
I mean, they're biker brothers

59
00:02:23,316 --> 00:02:24,517
And we're blood brothers.

60
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,318
Remember?

61
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,387
Camp Watahatchi, summer, 1989.

62
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,222
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,991
The Watahatchi two.

64
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:35,261
I was the chief and
you were the medicine man.

65
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:36,562
Yeah.

66
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,465
My allergies were
out of control that summer.

67
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,966
That was still
an amazing six weeks.

68
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:42,368
I became blood brothers
with you

69
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,036
And I made out
with Sally Ann macintosh

70
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,271
Behind the mess hall.

71
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,273
Didn't she wear a back brace?

72
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,010
Not for long.

73
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:53,078
We're kind of done with

74
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,380
The public portion of our date.

75
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:56,816
Yeah, we're outta here.

76
00:02:56,883 --> 00:02:58,117
Nice.

77
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,223
Um, so,

78
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:07,293
Do you have any scars
or battle wounds?

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,528
Well, I got my appendix
taken out when I was eight.

80
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:11,330
We had really bad insurance,

81
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:14,032
So the doctor
was kind of sloppy.

82
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Wanna see it?

83
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,335
- Yes, please.
- All right.

84
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:19,838
Hold on.
Yep.

85
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:22,341
See, it's here.

86
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:24,042
And there's some over there.

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,310
So I'll cover this one

one of those signs, okay?

Well, I actually
didn't cut myself.

115
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:43,671
I put tabasco sauce on my hand
and shook yours.

I mean, I remember
my hand was stinging.

119

But I thought that was from

The cosmic connection

No. No.

It was from the tabasco sauce.

00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:49,661
See, back in camp Watahatchi,
I cut my--

166
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:51,129
- Are we gonna watch
the fight or what?

167
00:06:51,197 --> 00:06:55,667
Yes, we are.

168
00:06:55,735 --> 00:07:00,472
Wayne!
Oh, this is awkward.

169
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,541
I didn't realize
you'd be stopping by.

170
00:07:02,609 --> 00:07:05,043
Uh, I live here.

171
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,311
That's my bed.

172
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:07,879
- Wayne.
- Hey, Luke, right?

173
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:09,481
Yeah, that's Luke.

174
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:11,283
He is officially
one of my new friends.

175
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:16,120
In fact, all of these guys
are my new friends.

176
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,022
Hey, mark,
the fight's about to start.

177
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,959
- Mark, mike--
doesn't matter to me.

178
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,327
It's how close we are.

179
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,396
One fight coming up.

180
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:27,999
Well, uh...
I'll get out of your way.

181
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,834
Yeah, you should
probably just go.

182
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,002
What are you talking about,
there's room here.

183
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,503
We can scootch, right guys?
Come on.

184
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,538
Oh, you don't wanna
scootch on a couch like this,

185
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:37,074
It's more of a three person--
- Oh, yeah, I love that.

186
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:39,143
Hey, mark...

187
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,444
If you're
heading to the fridge,

188
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,580
You mind hooking me up
with a beer?

189
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:46,750
So after the movie,

190
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:49,987
Luke took me to
this crazy place last night.

191
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:53,690
New Jersey?

192
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:57,461
Have you been?
It's fascinating.

193
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,096
No, Jill, it's not serious.

194
00:07:59,164 --> 00:08:00,964
I'm just having fun for once.

195
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,866
It's a rather
nice change of pace.

196
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:04,568
[knocking] he's here.

197
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:14,912
Sorry I'm late, babe.

198
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:17,881
It's quite all right...
Babe.

199
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,951
You are cute as a button.

200
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,389
So what are
we gonna do tonight?

201
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:30,259
Movie, drag race, cock fight?
[laughing]

202
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,295
Actually, I got
a little surprise for you.

203
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:33,696
Oh, really?

204
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,598
Aw, you didn't have to do that.

205
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,333
Where is it?

206
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:40,069
Right here.

207
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,377
Um...Is that me?

208
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,446
Yep.

209
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:51,581
On your chest?

210
00:08:51,648 --> 00:08:54,750
Yeah.

211
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:58,821
It's official now,
you are my old lady.

212
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:06,625
I didn't sign up for forever.

213
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:09,661
This was a romp.
This was a fun little fling.

214
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,364
I was dipping my toe
into the murky waters

215
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:14,766
Of the bad boy pool.

216
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,235
Well, it looks like
you fell in face first.

217
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:18,403
[sighs]

218
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,904
What did you say
when you saw it?

219
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:21,472
I didn't know what to say.

220
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,640
So I said,
"please don't slouch,

221
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,709
You're giving me
a double chin."

222
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,244
I'm jealous.

223
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:27,879
Pete never got a tattoo of me

224
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:29,614
And we've been dating
twice as long.

225
00:09:29,682 --> 00:09:31,716
A girl tattooed
my name on herself once.

226
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:32,850
When I dumped her,

227
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:35,753
She put "smells" underneath it.

228
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,222
I'd say she won that battle.

229
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,692
Check out my new ride.

230
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,894
Now that I'm rolling
with my new best friends,

231
00:09:43,962 --> 00:09:45,863
I decided to get myself a bike.

232
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,097
What'd you get, a harley?

233
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:50,501
Well, the harley of scooters.

234
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:51,769
Got a vespa.

235
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:53,971
- A vespa?
- Yep.

236
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,640
Just tell me you didn't
get a powder blue one.

237
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:04,348
For your information,
it's called Capri blue.

238
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,752
Guys, my face is plastered on
a very dangerous man's chest!

239
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,521
We get it, Charlotte.

240
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,524
Luke likes you
more than Pete likes me.

241
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,158
You have to dump this guy.

242
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:17,493
Oh, no, no, no, no.

243
00:10:17,561 --> 00:10:19,028
You can't break up with him.

244
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:21,897
Pete told me when Luke's last
girlfriend broke up with him,

245
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,133
He went crazy.
Like, crazy, crazy.

246
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,668
Well, what am I supposed to do?

247
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:27,703
Be his old lady
for the rest of my life?

248
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:30,206
No, no, no, just
for the rest of his life.

249
00:10:30,273 --> 00:10:33,075
- Oh, my God.
- Charlotte, calm down.

250
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:35,510
I got you into this mess,
I'm gonna get you out of it.

251
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:37,012
What are you gonna say?

252
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,081
Don't worry, I'm really
good at this kind of stuff.

253
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:40,983
I'll think of something.
Okay.

254
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,985
Mike is dead.

255
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:47,990
Li'l Mike?

256
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,792
Yeah.

257
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,527
How'd he die?

258
00:10:53,595 --> 00:10:55,596
Charlotte?

259
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:01,269
An accident?

260
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:03,638
- On his new scooter?
- Yes!

261
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,674
Yes, that is exactly
how it happened.

262
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:08,242
Mike was cycling, right?

263
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,378
And he was hit by a giant...

264
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:12,713
Beer truck.

265
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,615
They found him,
like, 100 feet away.

266
00:11:14,683 --> 00:11:17,718
With his arm still saying,
"may I go right?"

267
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,319
I can't believe it!

268
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,222
Li'l Mike!

269
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,092
Wow, you're
really taking this hard.

270
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,694
Anyway,
you know how close we were.

271
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:30,097
He was sort of like my Rico.

272
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:32,433
I just can't see myself
doing anything--

273
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,268
Going out, staying in,

274
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,904
Or us even talking for
at least six months to a year.

275
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:39,206
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

276
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,707
As long as you need.

277
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,443
Thank you.

278
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,046
I really appreciate
your understanding.

279
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:49,515
Oh, you are an amazing man.

280
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,052
And I'm just lucky
to have known you.

281
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,887
Take care.

282
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,726
Wait...

283
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:01,928
When's the funeral?

284
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,529
No funeral.

285
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,732
Mike was...Alaskan.

286
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,468
You know how that goes.

287
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:10,603
Take care.

288
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:12,505
Well, he died on two wheels.

289
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:16,275
He was a brother, we should
at least pay our respects.

290
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:21,146
Well, we'll probably just
spill some things on the ground.

291
00:12:21,214 --> 00:12:22,581
Well, we'll be there.

292
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:24,583
You guys are having a memorial
for him, aren't you?

293
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,784
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

294
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:27,586
When's that?

295
00:12:27,653 --> 00:12:29,254
Tomorrow?

296
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:30,889
Tomorrow.

297
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,493
Why am I dead?

298
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,461
Why not Wayne?
Or Leslie?

299
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:39,331
In high school, she was voted
most likely to die young.

300
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,166
I was?

301
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:44,468
It wasn't my idea,
it was Jill's.

302
00:12:44,536 --> 00:12:45,769
I thought
we were gonna tell him

303
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:47,838
I'd won a cruise
around the world.

304
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:49,373
You should've
gone with my idea.

305
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:53,077
I'm not telling someone
I have a venereal disease.

306
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:55,079
At least my plan
got you out of it.

307
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:56,347
Well, not yet.

308
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:57,515
Luke and the guys
are coming around

309
00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:58,816
Tomorrow for your memorial.

310
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,284
I can't believe this!

311
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,652
I just made a bunch
of new friends.

312
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,220
Now I'm dead.

313
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:06,557
Mike, I know you're upset,
but I had to get out of this.

314
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,425
I'm so sorry.

315
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:11,694
All right.

316
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:13,262
[sigh]

317
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,066
- But it better be tasteful.
- Yes.

318
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:18,301
- With speeches.
- Yes.

319
00:13:18,369 --> 00:13:20,237
And I wanna listen in
on speaker phone,

320
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:23,173
So you'd better make them good.

321
00:13:23,241 --> 00:13:24,808
And only friends are invited.

322
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:26,576
Real friends.

323
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,045
Men of their word.

324
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:30,113
Men who do not base
an entire relationship

325
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:32,949
On a lie, Wayne!

326
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:38,554
Are you mad at me?

327
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,923
Yes, of course I'm mad at you.

328
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,858
It meant nothing to you, Wayne.

329
00:13:42,926 --> 00:13:44,794
I cut open my hand
for the promise of

330
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:46,095
A lifelong friendship

331
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:49,265
And you poured a hot,
vinegar-based condiment on it.

332
00:13:49,332 --> 00:13:51,867
Is this about the blood oath?

333
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:56,272
You know what, you're
not invited to the service.

334
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:57,273
Right, Charlotte?

335
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,209
Well, it is your funeral.

336
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:10,285
He had so much life
left to live.

337
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:13,355
You know he's not dead, right?

338
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:15,791
[phone ringing] Hello?

339
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,659
How's it going?
How many people showed up?

340
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:19,161
Did snakebite
wear his dress leathers?

341
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:20,462
Mike.

342
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,731
Well, I wanna hear it.
Put me on speaker phone.

343
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,267
God. Fine.

344
00:14:26,835 --> 00:14:28,237
I would like
to welcome you all.

345
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:31,706
We are here to remember
our dear friend,

346
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:32,941
Michael poole.

347
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:35,677
And if you don't mind,
any drink pouring

348
00:14:35,745 --> 00:14:37,545
Could be done on
the balcony or fire escape.

349
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:41,516
So is anyone gonna say
anything about li'l Mike?

350
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,618
Yes!
The speeches, of course.

351
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:45,787
I guess I will start.

352
00:14:45,855 --> 00:14:47,922
Bah!

353
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,092
Yes, this was
Mike's scooter helmet.

354
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,029
We can take comfort
knowing his last moments

355
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:56,598
Were spent riding
his beloved vespa.

356
00:14:56,665 --> 00:15:00,168
Riding like the wind
at 30 to 35 miles an hour.

357
00:15:01,637 --> 00:15:05,106
Mike had so many
wonderful qualities.

358
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,743
Jill.

359
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:10,478
Well, that sucked.

360
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:13,848
Mike was an amazing bowler.

361
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:17,285
He once bowled, like,
I don't know, like, a 63.

362
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:20,455
2! 263!
[groans]

363
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:23,490
Leslie?

364
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,730
Hi.

365
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,832
Mike and I have been friends
since I was eight.

366
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,037
His was the first penis
I ever saw.

367
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,072
It popped out of his fly
during gym class,

368
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,708
But he waited till he finished
the whole obstacle course

369
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:44,077
To put it back.

370
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:46,012
That's the kind of guy he was.

371
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,583
People saw!

372
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,652
Um, thanks, Leslie,
that was lovely.

373
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,887
So thank you all for coming

374
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,691
On this sad, sad, sad occasion.

375
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,294
So if none of you have
anything else left to say--

376
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,362
- I do.
I have something to say.

377
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,832
[gasps] Wayne!

378
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,840
Mike poole was my best friend.

379
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,676
He gave me a home,
a weekly allowance,

380
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,812
And always let me
have the last beer.

381
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,980
I just want him to know

382
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,082
That even though
I didn't cut my hand,

383
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,084
It doesn't mean
that the bond we formed

384
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,254
In our 20 year friendship
wasn't real.

385
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,656
If I could go back,
I'd cut my hand open.

386
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,526
I didn't do it because...

387
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,428
I was just too chicken.

388
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,465
I'm sorry, bro.

389
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,766
[sniffs]

390
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,168
Now that's a speech.

391
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:45,237
[sobbing] that's a speech.

392
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,874
Yeah, we're gonna get going.

393
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,476
But before we do,
I just want you to know

394
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,778
That Mike really touched
all of us.

395
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:57,214
Boys.

396
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,355
"li'l Mike."

397
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:06,824
Holy crap.

398
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,926
Pete, are you kidding me?

399
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:11,294
You can't get
a tattoo with Jill,

400
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:12,795
But you run right out
and you get a Mike?

401
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:16,065
Hey, he's a fallen bro, babe.

402
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,901
Oh, and I suppose goofy

403
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:20,904
Taking a bong hit
is a fallen bro too?

404
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:22,539
You know what,
if I'm not important enough

405
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,607
For you to get a tattoo of me,
then you can just forget it.

406
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,709
Fine.
'cause you're suffocating me.

407
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:29,579
I get enough of
this crap from my wife.

408
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:31,247
You're married?

409
00:17:31,315 --> 00:17:33,149
Yeah.

410
00:17:33,217 --> 00:17:34,584
You know what?

411
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,953
After the Motorhead concert
this weekend, we're done.

412
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,390
So why did you all get tattoos?

413
00:17:40,457 --> 00:17:42,458
Oh, they're for
the li'l Mike memorial ride.

414
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,227
Me and some of the boys
are gonna ride

415
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:47,030
From the West village
all the way to West Hollywood

416
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:48,031
In his honor.

417
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:50,733
He was gay, right?
[chokes]

418
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,969
Poor li'l gay Mike.

419
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,438
And once we get there,
our West coast brothers

420
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:57,840
Are also gonna get a "li'l mike"
tattoo with a rainbow--

421
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,143
- Fine, this has got to stop.

422
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,212
Luke, you can't go
on this ride.

423
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:04,446
Why, babe?

424
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:07,015
I feel terrible.

425
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,985
I didn't want to be
your "old lady,"

426
00:18:10,053 --> 00:18:12,754
So I may have told a lie.

427
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:14,456
About what?

428
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:17,626
Mike.

429
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:18,961
He's not dead.

430
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:23,465
You made up a story
about your friend being dead?

431
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,267
- Yeah.
- What is wrong with you?

432
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:28,670
A fake memor--we got tattoos!
- I know!

433
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,072
I know, it all got out of hand.

434
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,108
Though, in my defense,
you biker types do really

435
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,276
Jump the gun when it comes
to getting tattoos.

436
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:38,313
Um, I will gladly
apologize to your friends.

437
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,647
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no. No.

438
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:41,216
You will tell them nothing.

439
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:43,151
I have a reputation.

440
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:45,587
So here's how
she's gonna go down.

441
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:47,856
Either you keep your mouth shut

442
00:18:47,923 --> 00:18:49,791
And nobody's
ever gonna know the truth,

443
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:54,228
Or we're gonna be having
a real memorial for li'l Mike.

444
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,564
I vote for keep my mouth shut.

445
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,800
Yeah, good.

446
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,735
You know, I thought
I wanted a good girl,

447
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:05,405
But you good girls are crazy!

448
00:19:05,473 --> 00:19:09,243
Come on, boys.
Let's roll.

449
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,978
To li'l Mike.

450
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,279
Yeah.

451
00:19:16,551 --> 00:19:19,119
How do I do it, every time?

452
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:21,421
I choose the worst men.

453
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:24,725
And I try so hard.
I keep looking and looking.

454
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:27,561
Well, I would stop looking
and I'd let him come to me.

455
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:28,896
What if he doesn't?

456
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:32,098
What if he does?

457
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,001
I guess I should cross
bad boys off my list.

458
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,235
Are you sure?

459
00:19:36,303 --> 00:19:37,670
Why?

460
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:40,039
'cause I just got this bad boy.

461
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,941
What is that?

462
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,543
It's you.

463
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,578
But I felt creepy
drawing your boobs,

464
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:47,480
So I drew
a dragon body instead.

465
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,148
[laughing]

466
00:19:49,216 --> 00:19:50,516
It's pretty awesome.

467
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,485
It's really rather flattering.

468
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:54,754
Oh...Too bad I crossed
bad boys off my list,

469
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,222
I could never date you now.

470
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,324
Yeah, that is too bad.

471
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,261
[telephone ringing]

472
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:03,496
Hello?

473
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:05,531
Yeah. Hey, Mike.

474
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:08,667
Of course I heard my speech,
I said it.

475
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:11,570
Are you crying?

476
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:15,474
I-I--just hang in there,
I'll be right down.

477
00:20:15,542 --> 00:20:17,543
I have to go.
Okay.

478
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,211
Tell Mike thanks
for being a good sport.

479
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,714
And he's not allowed to leave
the building till Tuesday.

480
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:26,151
That's when the li'l Mike
memorial ride begins.

481
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:27,753
Oh, and one more thing.

482
00:20:27,821 --> 00:20:29,988
You know, this thing comes off
with soap and water, so.

483
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,191
Oh, good to know.

484
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:36,862
[door closes]

485
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,705
Dude, I'm not riding
on the back of this thing.

486
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,241
Well, only one of us
has a scooter license.

487
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:47,343

00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:53,616
