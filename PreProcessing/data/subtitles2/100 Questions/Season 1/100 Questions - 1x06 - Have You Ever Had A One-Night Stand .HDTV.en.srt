1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,567
Okay, next question.

2
00:00:02,568 --> 00:00:04,468
Well, that's a big no.

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,171
Wait, that's not fair.

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,572
What's the question?

5
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:08,707
It doesn't matter.

6
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,342
I'm trying to
save us some time.

7
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:11,743
There's a spin class
I want to get to

8
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:13,412
That starts at 6:00.

9
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,313
I want to hear the question.

10
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,182
Fine, fine.

11
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,117
Have you ever had
a one-night stand?

12
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,752
Actually- -
oh, my goodness!

13
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:23,455
Charlotte payne's
had a one-night stand.

14
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,791
Well, actually-
- oh, my goodness.

15
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:28,160
Charlotte payne's never
had a one-night and.

16
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:30,562
Oh, it was a wager of sorts,

17
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,731
And I'm not usually a
gambling type of person.

18
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,232
But this really
snowballed into-

19
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,301
Yeah, I'm definitely not
gonna make that spin class.

20
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,269
No.

21
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,140
Is it that time of year again?

22
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,376
Yep. Fashion week.

23
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:45,777
And our little
neighborhood bar

24
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,313
Has been overrun by a
flock of supermodels.

25
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,683
The swallows have
returned to capistrano.

26
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,884
Hey, guys.

27
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,920
Both depressed: Hey.

28
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,755
Look at our couch.

29
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,657
Yeah, five of them
fit into a space

30
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,093
That normally
holds three of us.

31
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,627
You know what?

32
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,528
I would much rather
date one of you guys

33
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,332
Than one of them
skinny, gorgeous models.

34
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,836
You guys have substance, a
little meat on your bones.

35
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,270
All: Shut up!

36
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,506
I don't believe it.

37
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,974
Ariel's here.

38
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,376
Ariel who?

39
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,610
Ariel goodman,

40
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,612
French-israeli supermodel.

41
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,181
I saw her in monte
carlo three years ago.

42
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,786
A prince was doing jell-o
shots off her stomach.

43
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,921
Wanted her ever since.

44
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,056
Yeah.

45
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,258
Well, I do not date models.

46
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,560
No, it's a rule of mine.

47
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,630
They are too much drama.

48
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:41,333
She is all yours. Go get her.

49
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,868
Ariel goodman,

50
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,636
Here comes the wayne train.

51
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,004
Wayne, you are a pig.

52
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,572
Well, pigs are the
smartest mammal,

53
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:49,941
So thank you, charlotte.

54
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,011
This one's on mike.

55
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,946
Whoa, sorry.

56
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:58,283
I don't date models!

57
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,353
Think you're a little low.

58
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,955
Wayne rutherford?

59
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,791
Ariel goodman?

60
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,960
I didn't even know
it was you. How crazy.

61
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,396
This is crazy.

62
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,833
Last time I saw you
was monte carlo, right?

63
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,803
Was it? I don't even remember.

64
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,571
Well, if you're
around this week,

65
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,473
We should totally hang out.

66
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,442
Totally.

67
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,381
Oh, look, that
model's on fire.

68
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,652
Whoa!

69
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:38,145
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

70
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:01,070
See?

71
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:04,640
The five of us can
easily fit on this couch.

72
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,608
Can't do it!
- My neck is hurting.

73
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:14,850
See, that is one
of the main reasons

74
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,752
I do not date models.

75
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,021
They're crybabies.

76
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:21,457
Flammable crybabies.

77
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,226
You guys, I have to
make a confession.

78
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:25,627
Right before she
caught on fire,

79
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,528
I wished for something
bad to happen to her.

80
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,431
Do you think I have some
kind of witch powers?

81
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:32,434
Well, not unless you wished
for her to catch on fire.

82
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:34,770
Oh, my god, I
have witch powers!

83
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:36,505
All right.

84
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,540
I have a confession
to make as well.

85
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:43,078
Remember how I told you
that I do not date models?

86
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:45,748
Well, the truth is

87
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:48,584
They don't date me.

88
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,487
Are you kidding?
- No.

89
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,823
Yeah, it's true, it's true.

90
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:56,558
Whenever I get around a model,

91
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,394
I get nervous, and
I get tongue-tied,

92
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,728
And I can't be myself.

93
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,964
Dude, the key to
models is confidence.

94
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:03,332
You got to be cocky.

95
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,800
You got to not
think and just talk.

96
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,568
You need to- - be
more like wayne.

97
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,670
Be more like wayne, man.

98
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:10,339
Excuse me, folks,

99
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,075
Anyone here see how
the fire started?

100
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:16,578
Me. I did.

101
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,546
Would you mind
filling out a report?

102
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,783
I'll fill out a report.

103
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,752
Mike, get your own report.

104
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,790
This one's mine.

105
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,124
What's with her?

106
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,759
You don't recognize that guy?

107
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,927
That is mr. November

108
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,695
From the new york
fire fighters calendar.

109
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:35,998
Yeah, mike, I'm surprised
you don't recognize him.

110
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,301
Well, do you think
charlotte knows that?

111
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:44,139
Oh, she knows.

112
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,874
Oh.

113
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,812
He is unbelievably,
spectacularly, crazy hot.

114
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,015
Ew, ugh, you're a
pig, charlotte payne.

115
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,717
Oh, please, it's different.

116
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:58,320
You are acting just
like when I saw ariel.

117
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:00,189
No, I'm not.

118
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,159
Didn't say I wanted to give
him a ride on the payne train.

119
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:06,128
That's because you can't
have a one-night stand.

120
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:07,396
You're not capable.

121
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,264
I've had plenty of
one-night stands.

122
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,632
With who? Name one.

123
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,034
And even if I haven't,

124
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:13,969
Everybody has to
start somewhere.

125
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:16,772
Mr. November. His
name is cade rollins.

126
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,308
Born June 15, 1977.

127
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,843
He is a gemini.

128
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:22,511
He enjoys skiing and sailing,

129
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:24,246
And he's a vegan.

130
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:26,882
I guarantee that
you will not have sex

131
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,552
With a vegan fireman
named cade rollins.

132
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,454
Is that a challenge?

133
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:35,757
All: Ooh.

134
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,426
It's a bet.

135
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,095
All:
Oh-oh-oh.

136
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,731
I can certainly make love-

137
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:45,367
Sex.
- Ooh.

138
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:47,703
Oh, we're not
gonna do that one?

139
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,571
Fine, I guarantee

140
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:52,040
I can make s-sex with cade

141
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:55,711
Before you get into
ariel's tiny little pants.

142
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:57,678
It is on.

143
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:00,816
I think that charlotte
should have some sort

144
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:02,684
Of a head start, because
she hasn't had sex in, like-

145
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:05,921
Doesn't matter.

146
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,361
Are you guys ready to order?

147
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:13,929
We're waiting for a
vegan fire fighter.

148
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,330
We heard he eats
here all the time.

149
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:17,299
Oh, you mean cade.
- Yeah.

150
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,767
We have a dish
named after him.

151
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:20,502
The five alarm tofu chili?

152
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:22,804
No, the cade wrap.

153
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,139
Oh.

154
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,208
I'll check back.

155
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:27,943
There he is.

156
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:29,311
Oh, brilliant.

157
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:30,445
Got to get his attention.

158
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:31,613
Cade!

159
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,782
Oh, hey.

160
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,217
Charlotte, right?

161
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:37,019
Yeah, hi.

162
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,987
So you guys are vegans?

163
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:40,155
I am.

164
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:42,858
Yeah, veggies,
veggies, veggies.

165
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:44,626
I do all that healthy stuff.

166
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:45,627
Do you do yoga?

167
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,196
Do I do yoga? Do I do yoga?

168
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,231
Jill, he's asking
me if I do yoga.

169
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,199
Do you do yoga?

170
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:52,634
Um, yeah.

171
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:54,970
Only, like, five days a week.

172
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,507
Right after I recycle
and rescue animals

173
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:01,577
And donate blood to them.

174
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:04,146
There's a great yoga
studio across the street.

175
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:05,714
You should come take a class.

176
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:06,715
When?

177
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:10,151
Noon tomorrow.

178
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:11,987
Ugh, noon tomorrow.

179
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:13,589
Yeah, I'll be there.

180
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,224
Great. See you then.

181
00:07:15,225 --> 00:07:17,359
Yeah.
- All right.

182
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:22,364
Wayne is going down.

183
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,700
You guys ready to order?

184
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,668
No, we're not
eating this crap.

185
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:29,204
Thanks.

186
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:33,742
So I guess I should
get this out of the way.

187
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,577
I'm not a billionaire anymore.

188
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:38,647
Oh, it still
hurts saying that.

189
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:40,716
So what are you going to do?

190
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,951
Well, I'm watching
a lot of tv,

191
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:45,487
<i>Mastering call of duty.</i>

192
00:07:45,555 --> 00:07:47,789
No, about me.

193
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:50,425
Now that you've lost
your superpowers,

194
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:52,227
How will you get the girl?

195
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:53,762
Well, we're gonna have
to go back to your hotel,

196
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:55,264
'cause I got a
bit of a situation.

197
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:58,100
It's not going
to be that easy.

198
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,068
I'm gonna make
you work for it.

199
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,470
All right, fine.

200
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:02,904
What do you want me to do?

201
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:06,775
I want you to woo
me, wayne, hmm?

202
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:09,244
The good old-fashioned way.

203
00:08:09,312 --> 00:08:10,812
Wooing.

204
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,247
I can totally do that.

205
00:08:12,248 --> 00:08:13,482
You'll see, I'll be all like,

206
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,484
"woo! Woo!"

207
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:16,918
Yeah, don't do that.

208
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,220
Yeah, sorry, that was bad.

209
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:19,588
Where you going?

210
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:22,658
Oh, don't worry
about where I'm going.

211
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,927
You've got work to do. Hmm?

212
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:28,063
Oh, yeah, yeah, the wooing.

213
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,565
Yeah, I'm on it.

214
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,933
How'd it go with ariel?

215
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:33,735
Not very well.
She wants me to-

216
00:08:33,736 --> 00:08:37,105
Who the hell are
you supposed to be?

217
00:08:37,173 --> 00:08:38,507
You.

218
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:41,543
Told me to be more like
you. I'm being more like you.

219
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,545
And don johnson. It's
a bit of a hybrid.

220
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:47,549
Check it out.

221
00:08:52,388 --> 00:08:55,290
Hi.

222
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,526
What do you say
we get outta here?

223
00:08:57,593 --> 00:09:00,629
What do you say
you get outta here?

224
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:06,068
Okay.

225
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:09,371
Now this is food.

226
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,339
Vegans think that
non-vegans hate animals.

227
00:09:11,374 --> 00:09:12,507
I love animals.

228
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:15,644
I'm loving every
animal on this pizza.

229
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:19,047
Hey.

230
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:21,316
What's with your hair?

231
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:23,719
He's trying to be like me.

232
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:27,222
So wayne, how'd
it go with ariel?

233
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,624
It went great.

234
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,159
No, it didn't.

235
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,694
She wants you to woo her
the old fashioned way.

236
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:33,995
Mike, a little support.

237
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:36,431
It went great.

238
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,233
No big deal.

239
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:40,235
I got this.
- Really?

240
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:43,171
'cause it looks like what
you thought was a dunk slam

241
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,740
Isn't.

242
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,441
The term is slam dunk.

243
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,143
Don't be coming over
here to our country

244
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:50,912
And screwing up
our catch phrases.

245
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,581
You're just mad 'cause ariel's

246
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:55,650
Not falling for your
big, dumb brown eyes.

247
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:58,987
Well, your eyes are big
and dumb and brown too.

248
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,723
Yeah, well, cade thinks
they're beautiful.

249
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,192
Boom!

250
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,130
Yeah, well, ariel is
a super hot supermodel.

251
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:11,333
Super boom!
- We're out.

252
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:14,169
Worked pretty good.

253
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,004
"super boom" just
came into my head.

254
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,140
You did really good.

255
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:22,577
Hey.

256
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:23,745
Ah.

257
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:25,213
I'm so glad you could make it.

258
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:27,315
You are gonna love this class.

259
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:30,786
It's the perfect balance
between ashtanga and hatha.

260
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:32,753
Oh, good.

261
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:33,922
'cause if it wasn't,

262
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:36,425
I'd be like, "grr,
get me out of here."

263
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:41,263
It's a shame to put all
this limberness to waste.

264
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,532
I'm very flexible.

265
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:46,368
I'm very gay.

266
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:50,038
Cool.

267
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:51,740
Okay, everyone.

268
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:54,609
Let's start with
an easy trikonasana.

269
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:04,619
Ooh, trikonasana.

270
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,359
I think I broke my ass-ena.

271
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:18,905
What should I do
with my powers?

272
00:11:18,906 --> 00:11:20,339
Should I feed hungry people?

273
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,641
Should I stop wars?

274
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:24,577
Should I break up brangelina?

275
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:26,312
You are not a witch.

276
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,347
Yet, you're also
not a masseuse.

277
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,883
My neck is worse.

278
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:33,586
Well, hey, guys.

279
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,988
Just popping in, checking
to see how everyone's doing.

280
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:41,761
I heard there was a terrible
accident in yoga class.

281
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,829
I'm fine.

282
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:46,565
Well, that is it. It is over.

283
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,000
You slept with her.

284
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:49,936
No, but it's just a
formality at this point.

285
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,137
I got a plan.

286
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:52,271
What are you gonna do?

287
00:11:52,272 --> 00:11:55,775
I'm gonna woo her brains out.

288
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,376
Well, you better woo her soon.

289
00:11:57,377 --> 00:11:59,445
'cause I'll have you know
cade is on his way over here.

290
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:01,413
You can't even move your neck.

291
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:05,017
The way I have sex, I
don't have to move anything.

292
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:10,790
I'm not sure cade's
gonna enjoy that.

293
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:12,757
See you later.

294
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,562
I've got to win this bet.

295
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:18,164
And I've got to win it now.

296
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:19,598
When cade gets here,

297
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,499
We're giving new
meaning to the phrase

298
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:23,469
"the british are coming."

299
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,873
So are you ready to be wooed?

300
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:29,774
Yes, I am.

301
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:33,879
What are those?

302
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,315
Two round trip
tickets to romance.

303
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:38,584
I wouldn't normally say
something that stupid,

304
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:41,087
I just thought it was
something a wooer would do.

305
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:44,790
You still think money is
the way to a woman's heart.

306
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:48,160
You think taking me to
paris is going to woo me?

307
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:51,597
No, it's not paris.
- Where is it?

308
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:55,735
It's anywhere in the
continental United States.

309
00:12:55,802 --> 00:12:58,304
To be used anytime we want.

310
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:01,607
Except weekends, holidays,

311
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:04,510
And any other blackout
date shown on this calendar.

312
00:13:05,846 --> 00:13:07,646
Oh, yeah, and when
we get to the airport,

313
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:10,950
My name is michael poole.

314
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:15,121
Wayne, I wanted
something from your heart.

315
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:17,423
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

316
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:22,161
Well, figure it out because
you've got one more shot.

317
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:29,168
They say wisconsin is
beautiful in the fall.

318
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:32,004
I know it's not,
who am I kidding?

319
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,321
Oh, cade, I forgot you
were going to drop by.

320
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:50,723
How nice to see you.

321
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:52,558
Mm, that was tasty.

322
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,527
Have you been eating carrots?

323
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:56,862
Yep. Nature's candy.

324
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:01,300
Would you like one?
- Never turn down a carrot.

325
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:15,514
Cade...

326
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:18,684
Would you like to see
the tv in my bedroom?

327
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:19,819
Do you wanna go have sex?

328
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,720
Yes, please.
- Cool.

329
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,692
Ew!

330
00:14:31,064 --> 00:14:33,866
So gross!

331
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:36,769
I am so sorry.
Did you touch it?

332
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:39,071
You saw me touch it.

333
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,207
Why would you have
a leather headboard?

334
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,042
Sh, let's just forget it.

335
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:44,743
It's the only thing
in the entire apartment

336
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:46,078
That's made from
animal product.

337
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,047
Then what about those boots?
- Um...

338
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:49,415
And that purse?

339
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,717
There's down in these pillows.
- Mm.

340
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:55,121
Charlotte, this place
is a killing field!

341
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,290
I had no idea.

342
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,092
You said you were a vegan.

343
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:01,927
Well, vegans don't lie.

344
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:03,529
I'm outta here.

345
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,264
W- w-wait,
let's stay!

346
00:15:05,265 --> 00:15:07,366
Let's have some more carrots!

347
00:15:07,434 --> 00:15:09,435
Broccoli?

348
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:12,905
sex?

349
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:16,876
From my heart. From my heart.

350
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,878
What can I give her
that's from my heart?

351
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:20,779
You could write her something.

352
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,381
A book?

353
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:24,282
We don't have time
to write a book.

354
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:25,718
Be practical, mike.

355
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:28,053
No, I was thinking you
could write her a poem.

356
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:29,655
You know, in her
native tongue.

357
00:15:29,656 --> 00:15:31,123
Huh.

358
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:34,393
She's french-israeli, so
what's her native tongue?

359
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:35,661
Hm.

360
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:38,397
I once heard her talk
in a wacky language.

361
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:40,032
Okay, was it pretty?

362
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,967
No.
- That is hebrew.

363
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:43,369
Okay.

364
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,471
All right, a poem.

365
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:47,406
Okay, here it goes.

366
00:15:47,407 --> 00:15:49,307
Get this down.
- Got it.

367
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:55,014
Arielle...

368
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:59,318
I wanna have sex with you.

369
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,787
Yeah, how's that?

370
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:03,289
Inspired.

371
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,758
Um, I was thinking something
more along the lines

372
00:16:05,825 --> 00:16:10,162
Of "arielle, my desire
for you has never waned.

373
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,166
My heart has never forgotten."

374
00:16:15,302 --> 00:16:16,635
So what's that in hebrew?

375
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,536
Um...

376
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:20,472
Hebrew...

377
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,748
That's really beautiful, yeah.

378
00:16:29,816 --> 00:16:32,818
I was just trying to have a
one night stand before I die.

379
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:36,889
I hope you don't mind me
talking to you like this.

380
00:16:36,957 --> 00:16:38,490
I'm waiting for my
friends to get here.

381
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:40,459
I'm not even listening to you.

382
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:44,330
Did you know vegans don't lie?

383
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:46,599
They lie every time they put

384
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,334
A piece of tofurkey
in their mouths

385
00:16:48,335 --> 00:16:50,235
And say, "yum."

386
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:54,573
And if leslie could
break up brangelina,

387
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:56,541
I would encourage
her to do it.

388
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:59,612
Because they are
very annoying.

389
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:03,282
So what do you got?

390
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,017
And I hope it's
from your heart.

391
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,019
I can't believe you're
making me go through all this

392
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,354
'cause I don't have any money.

393
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:10,055
That's not why.

394
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:12,558
I'm doing this to get back
at you because you hurt me.

395
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,561
Oh, good, I thought it was
'cause I didn't have any money.

396
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,297
So what did I do?

397
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,399
You really don't remember?

398
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,900
Monte carlo?

399
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:23,535
We had plans to
meet at the casino,

400
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:24,970
And you never showed up.

401
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:28,974
I waited nearly ten minutes.

402
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:32,077
Sorry.

403
00:17:32,145 --> 00:17:33,379
Well, anyway...

404
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,382
I wrote you a poem
in your native tongue.

405
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,185
You wrote me a poem?

406
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:43,088
Oh, wayne, that's exactly
what I wanted to hear.

407
00:17:43,156 --> 00:17:44,490
Really?

408
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:48,627
Let's go get in the
tub at my hotel room,

409
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:51,130
And maybe you can,
uh, read it to me.

410
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,732
That sounds good.

411
00:17:59,739 --> 00:18:02,574
Charlotte?

412
00:18:02,642 --> 00:18:06,078
Oh, there he is.

413
00:18:06,146 --> 00:18:09,515
Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

414
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:13,519
Wayne...Let's go.

415
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:39,545
My apartment.

416
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:40,779
How'd I get here?

417
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,949
Awkwardly. I had to carry you.

418
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,221
What happened to your french
- israeli super duper model?

419
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:50,823
Well, maybe some things

420
00:18:50,824 --> 00:18:54,360
Are more important
than supermodels.

421
00:18:54,427 --> 00:18:58,063
Really?
- No, not really.

422
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:00,933
No, I don't know.

423
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,302
Don't make me think about it.

424
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,372
I can't do it, wayne.

425
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:09,241
I can't have a
one night stand.

426
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:12,044
Well, you're too good for
one night stands, anyway.

427
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:36,635
Wayne?

428
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:38,536
Yeah?

429
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:41,940
So are you.

430
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:46,711
Good night, char.

431
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,397
Where is charlotte?
She's supposed to be here.

432
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:09,365
I think that's arielle.

433
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,706
Excuse me?

434
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:19,743
Where's wayne?

435
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:21,078
Hmm, he rejected me
for the second time.

436
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,546
Can you believe it?

437
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,681
He told me he'd have
to take a rain check.

438
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:26,717
And just left with
this drunk girl

439
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:29,186
With a fake accent.

440
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:32,055
Oh...I'm sorry.

441
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:34,892
I know how much
he was into you.

442
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,794
The guy's gotta be
a pretty big fool

443
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,262
To leave a girl like you.

444
00:20:38,263 --> 00:20:41,098
Really?

445
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,634
That's nice of you to say.

446
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:03,086
I should probably tell you

447
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:06,557
I don't normally date models.

448
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:10,294
See that? That's all me.

449
