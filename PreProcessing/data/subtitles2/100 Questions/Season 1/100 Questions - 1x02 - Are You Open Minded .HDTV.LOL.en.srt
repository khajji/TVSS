1
00:00:02,274 --> 00:00:03,374
Don't touch.

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,209
You already broke my zen rake.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,944
I am so sorry.

4
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:09,380
I just needed to
see if it came apart.

5
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:11,616
I don't know why.

6
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:15,486
Aw, is that your husband?

7
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:18,789
You're assuming
a lot there, girl.

8
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:21,258
I'm sorry, boy.

9
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:22,560
Uh-uh. - I
won't do that.

10
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,828
I'm not gonna do that.

11
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,231
So you think a gay man
can't have male friends?

12
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,466
No, I didn't mean that.

13
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,301
That's my best friend...

14
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:32,236
With benefits.

15
00:00:32,304 --> 00:00:35,239
Oh. Sounds like an
interesting friendship.

16
00:00:35,307 --> 00:00:39,076
Sounds like I need to
ask you the next question.

17
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:40,611
Are you open-minded?

18
00:00:40,612 --> 00:00:43,614
Well, to answer that I'm
gonna have to tell a story

19
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:46,217
About my friends,
without benefits.

20
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:49,654
Ain't nothing to
it but to do it.

21
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:51,621
Sorry. Does that mean "begin"?

22
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:53,557
Begin.
- Okay.

23
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,160
Well, it's been
a heck of a day.

24
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:57,561
Let's pack it in.

25
00:00:57,562 --> 00:00:58,796
I get the feeling
you want me to leave.

26
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:02,833
No, not at all.
Nighty-night. Home safe.

27
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:05,102
Hello.
- Oh, boy.

28
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,438
Charlotte, you should
be happy to see me.

29
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:10,274
Why?
- Because I'm fun.

30
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,011
Ladies.
- wayne now.

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,746
I need milk for cereal.

32
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:17,715
Do you have any cereal?

33
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:19,950
Guys, really,
you need to leave.

34
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:21,485
I'm going out.
- I knew it.

35
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:23,386
Those are your
going-out lips.

36
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:26,323
Those lips do say,
"where's the party?"

37
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:30,361
Oh, do you have a date?

38
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,762
Hey, charlotte, are you ready?

39
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:35,766
Ew. Are you going
on a date with mike?

40
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:39,770
<i>I mean, are you going
on a date with mike?</i>

41
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:42,406
No, she's coming to
meet a girl I'm seeing.

42
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:44,942
Are you hiding another
girlfriend from us?

43
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,212
Yes, I am.
- Charlotte.

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,747
Well, you guys
weren't invited,

45
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:51,182
And I didn't want to
hurt your feelings.

46
00:01:51,183 --> 00:01:52,316
oh, I, on the other hand,

47
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:54,285
Don't care about
your feelings.

48
00:01:54,352 --> 00:01:55,686
charlotte, let's go.

49
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:56,954
Hey, that's not fair.

50
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,689
Even my kindergarteners
know when they have a party,

51
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,890
They have to invite everyone.

52
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,392
You want to know
what's not fair?

53
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,960
You and leslie pecking away

54
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,861
Until you find a
flaw with every girl

55
00:02:04,896 --> 00:02:05,996
I've ever introduced you to.

56
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:07,798
Name one time we did that.

57
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,633
Kristy silva.
- Sarah taylor.

58
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:12,903
Jessica rosen.
- Okay.

59
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:14,171
Why can't I come?

60
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,773
Because I say to them,

61
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,608
"this is my friend
wayne," and then they say,

62
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:20,478
"mike, would you give
wayne and I some privacy?"

63
00:02:20,545 --> 00:02:22,580
Name one time that happened.

64
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:24,547
Kristy silva.
- Sarah taylor.

65
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,617
Jessica rosen.

66
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:29,620
Look, guys, I
really like kate.

67
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:30,721
Kate?

68
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:32,523
See, that's why charlotte's

69
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:33,724
The only person who
gets to meet her.

70
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:35,625
Because she doesn't judge.

71
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:37,027
The way I don't
judge her trampy lips

72
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:38,928
And her weird vest.

73
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,670
Shall we?

74
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:55,699
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

75
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:20,628
Is that her?
- No. No.

76
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:24,632
Is that her?
- No!

77
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,101
Is that... Wayne,
jill, and leslie?

78
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,605
Please, god, no.

79
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:32,573
Hey, buddy.

80
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,776
Did you follow us?

81
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,546
No.
- Yes.

82
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:40,815
Okay, listen, you
guys have to leave.

83
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:42,383
You have to leave right now.

84
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:43,451
is that her?

85
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:44,452
No, charlotte.
Yeah, that's her!

86
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:45,853
That's her. Okay. Um...

87
00:03:45,854 --> 00:03:49,023
Um, you two can stay
long enough to say hi.

88
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:51,059
That's it. And you...

89
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:53,528
You have to turn
off the charm.

90
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:55,730
Like a computer. You got
to put it in sleep mode.

91
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:56,998
I can do that.

92
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:00,468
Activate sleep mode.

93
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:05,039
God, that is amazing.

94
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,910
Mike.
- Kate. Hey.

95
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:12,346
Um, kate, this is
jill and leslie.

96
00:04:12,414 --> 00:04:13,981
Nice to meet you.
Thanks for coming.

97
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,049
So your name is kate?

98
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,584
They have to leave

99
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:19,654
Because they're paramedics,
and they just got a call.

100
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:22,690
But it was really
nice to meet you.

101
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:24,826
A pleasure.

102
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,261
What was her problem?

103
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:29,197
This is wayne.

104
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:31,098
Hello.

105
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,702
And I'm charlotte. It's
wonderful to meet you.

106
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,404
Finally, the charlotte payne.

107
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,772
Mike goes on and on about you.

108
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:39,774
He goes on and
on about you too.

109
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,110
I'm an "on and on"
- er.

110
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:43,444
I go on and on. I tend to-

111
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:45,179
I'm doing it right
now. I just...

112
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,347
I don't know
when to- - stop.

113
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:47,515
Okay.

114
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:50,084
So what is this? Art?

115
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:54,155
Um, yes, I'm an artist.

116
00:04:54,223 --> 00:04:56,491
I'll be the judge of that.

117
00:04:56,558 --> 00:04:59,894
Um, kate, should we go
and get some champagne?

118
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:01,696
All right.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:01,697 --> 00:05:04,298
Wayne.
- Yeah?

120
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,567
Do you think maybe you
could find a nice balance

121
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:08,836
Between turning off the
charm and just being rude?

122
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,605
Okay, if that's a
gamble you want to take,

123
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:13,508
But the charm is pretty
strong in me, buddy.

124
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:16,611
Damn it, it is.

125
00:05:20,115 --> 00:05:21,949
Why would anyone look at art

126
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,252
When they could look at shoes?

127
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,354
Leslie, mike did look happy.

128
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:27,922
Maybe we should
give kate a chance.

129
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:28,956
No, we shouldn't.

130
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,857
Okay.

131
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,295
Look at these boots.

132
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,898
They're so beautiful.

133
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,033
They would look
really cute with jeans.

134
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,569
Or a dress. Or a skirt.

135
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:42,837
Or shorts.

136
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:44,105
I want them.

137
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:45,306
You need to have them.
You should buy them.

138
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:46,674
Buy them right now.

139
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:49,177
is that the price?

140
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:51,879
Or the number you have
to call to get the price?

141
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:54,382
That's the price. I
can't afford those.

142
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:56,584
Leslie, those boots would
make you a better person.

143
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:58,252
They'd fill that
hole in your soul

144
00:05:58,253 --> 00:05:59,720
That jeffrey tore
open when he dumped you

145
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:01,522
And married that other woman.

146
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,424
You're hurting my feelings.

147
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:05,259
Because I want you
to have the boots.

148
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,527
I'm getting them.

149
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:08,362
You're not seriously
getting them, are you?

150
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:09,764
Okay.

151
00:06:09,765 --> 00:06:11,899
I mean, I guess I initially
moved here to get away

152
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,535
From my family, who
can be a bit crazy.

153
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:15,837
Me too.

154
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:19,240
cheese puffs!

155
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:21,809
I love things with cheese.
- Me too.

156
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:24,312
I knew kate and charlotte
would like each other.

157
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,847
They're both so sophisticated.

158
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:28,883
I think I could kill
someone for cheese fries.

159
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:31,485
Well, that's the real reason
I had to leave England.

160
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,323
I can see why mike likes you.

161
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,991
I'm so happy you two met.

162
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:38,659
Yeah. Me too.

163
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,163
God, sleep mode
is so relaxing.

164
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,731
Guys don't want
to be my friend.

165
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:45,166
Girls aren't hovering.

166
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,836
Mike, your life
must be so easy.

167
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,407
And then kate said that
you said she was funny.

168
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:54,508
Well, she is.

169
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:56,077
and then kate said

170
00:06:56,078 --> 00:06:57,879
That you both like
cheese and candy.

171
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,780
What are the odds of that?

172
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:01,949
Everyone loves
cheese and candy.

173
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:05,052
Oh, and wayne, you know
what kate said about you?

174
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,121
Nothing.

175
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,257
Sleep mode is a powerful tool.

176
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:10,992
Whoa, that's my sandwich.

177
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:12,393
I can't afford my own.

178
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:15,029
I'm saving for boots.

179
00:07:15,097 --> 00:07:17,064
Good for you. I
mean, they're nice,

180
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,166
But they could
definitely be bigger.

181
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:23,871
Boots.

182
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,040
Boots with a "t."

183
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,476
Shoes.

184
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,279
Hello.

185
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:33,381
kate.

186
00:07:33,382 --> 00:07:36,651
Kate!
- Oh, that sounds great.

187
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:38,819
That sounds great.
- What sounds great?

188
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:40,321
I'd love to.
- You'd love to what?

189
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:41,756
Okay. I'll see you there.

190
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:43,891
Bye.
- What?

191
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,827
Kate's invited me to
see a show with her.

192
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:48,229
This is so great.

193
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,730
You guys are gonna
be total buddies.

194
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,732
I love it! I love
it! I love it!

195
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,335
Jesus christ,
mike, get a grip.

196
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:56,303
Don't let them
ruin it for you.

197
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,572
He's a man in love.

198
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,642
Well, he sounds like a
seventh-grade girl in love.

199
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,284
You know, I don't really
miss london that much.

200
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:11,452
I've such great friends here.

201
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:14,055
And now I have a
new great friend.

202
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:15,823
You know, this was really fun.

203
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:16,991
Well, you're really fun.

204
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:18,225
No, you're really fun.

205
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:20,061
Okay. I'm really fun.

206
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:21,329
Night.
- Night.

207
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,098
Oh, charlotte, it looks
like you sat in something.

208
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,733
Oh.
- Let me.

209
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:27,735
Just...

210
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:36,243
Did you get it?
- Oh, I got it.

211
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:38,312
Night.

212
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:47,321
Charlotte, the only way
I can get these boots

213
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,523
Is if I spread them
over seven credit cards.

214
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:51,425
And two of them are yours.

215
00:08:51,426 --> 00:08:53,527
Leslie, I have to
tell you something.

216
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,863
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

217
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,265
I love calls like this.

218
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,768
I think kate
could be a lesbian.

219
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:03,070
Why, because mike
looks like k.D. Lang

220
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,206
When he wears his jean jacket?

221
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:09,243
No, because tonight,
when I was with kate...

222
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:12,246
Kate said charlotte must
have sat in something...

223
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:15,416
And then kate brushed
off charlotte's butt...

224
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:18,285
And her hand lingered.

225
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:20,788
So my girlfriend's a lesbian?

226
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,695
Mike, I'm sorry, you
know I always support you,

227
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,631
But this time your
girlfriend could be a...

228
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:34,934
Lesbian.

229
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,670
Have you been wearing
your jean jacket again?

230
00:09:37,738 --> 00:09:39,505
What? No. Charlotte.

231
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:42,075
Don't let yourself be
poisoned by these sirens.

232
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:44,077
They live to find flaws
with my girlfriends.

233
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:47,380
Whoa, being a lesbian
isn't a flaw, mike.

234
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:50,583
I think you're
being a homophobic.

235
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:53,019
Listen, kate is an artist.

236
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:54,754
Okay, artists are more open.

237
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:56,789
Their hands are
like their eyes.

238
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:59,826
Well, then it sounds
like kate has been staring

239
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:03,196
At charlotte's butt
for quite a while.

240
00:10:03,263 --> 00:10:06,099
I guess it's possible
I misunderstood.

241
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,201
Let's see. Show
me what she did.

242
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:12,138
Oh, for heaven's sake.

243
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,106
Okay.

244
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:21,547
Huh.

245
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,616
Do me.

246
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:33,626
I'm getting some of this.

247
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:44,237
Huh.

248
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:45,705
Was there any squeezing?

249
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:49,375
I'd say it was
more of a caress.

250
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,547
All: Oh.

251
00:10:58,552 --> 00:10:59,552
That's-stop it!

252
00:10:59,553 --> 00:11:01,821
Stop it. Stop it!

253
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,024
You see, this is because you
people have nothing to do.

254
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:06,259
Nothing?

255
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,462
Did you not just
see this ass train?

256
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,298
I know how we can tell
if kate's a lesbian.

257
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:15,334
Throw a softball at her
and see if she catches it.

258
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:16,435
That would work.

259
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:17,570
No.

260
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:20,139
Don't. God.

261
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:21,874
If anybody's gonna be throwing
balls at my girlfriend,

262
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,775
It's gonna be me.

263
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:27,813
You know what I mean.

264
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:30,783
Oh, I feel so bad.

265
00:11:30,784 --> 00:11:32,151
I should never
have said anything.

266
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:33,753
I really want this
to work out for mike.

267
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,654
Let's just leave
them alone. All right?

268
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:36,989
Yeah, definitely.
- Of course.

269
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,926
Of course.

270
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:41,893
Are we seriously
gonna leave this alone?

271
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:43,462
Of course not.

272
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:44,730
Whatever we do,
it should involve

273
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:48,634
Another ass train, though.

274
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:54,140
I'm so glad you're here.

275
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,742
Sorry that mike had to work
and charlotte couldn't make it.

276
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,844
I just texted charlotte.
She's on her way.

277
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:02,448
Uh-oh.

278
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:03,749
What's going on?

279
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,418
Jill is putting
bait on the hook,

280
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,753
Trying to catch a lesbian.

281
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:12,925
Uh, I love this song.

282
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:15,361
There's no music playing.

283
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:17,897
You don't feel that beat?

284
00:12:17,965 --> 00:12:19,932
No.

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,034
Can you excuse me?

286
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:28,507
What are you doing?

287
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:30,042
She's straight.
- Really?

288
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,177
Total hetero.

289
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:32,311
I don't buy it.

290
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:34,747
Ah, I should have
brought my softball.

291
00:12:34,815 --> 00:12:36,515
All right, there's
only one way to find out

292
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:38,117
Which way kate swings,
but we're gonna have

293
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:39,619
To bring out the big guns.

294
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,022
Deactivate sleep mode.

295
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:51,664
What's up, kate?

296
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:53,499
Uh, hi, wayne.

297
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,972
So...

298
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:03,709
So...

299
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,610
Excuse me.

300
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:11,050
Yeah, full-on lesbian.

301
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,551
Shame on all of us.

302
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:14,186
This is ridiculous.

303
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:16,122
If she's going out with
mike, then she's straight.

304
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:17,356
I'm gonna go over there

305
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:20,426
And smooth
everything over, okay?

306
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:21,594
Oh, hey, charlotte.

307
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:23,095
Hey, kate. Sorry
if those guys-

308
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:24,996
Oh, you have some
chips on your shirt.

309
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:32,505
Oh.

310
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,107
Charlotte, has it
ever occurred to you

311
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:36,909
That perhaps you're
just a messy person

312
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,711
Who needs a lot of wiping off?

313
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:41,180
Oh, mike, I'm sorry,

314
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:42,915
But this time I'm sure.

315
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,617
She likes girls.

316
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,886
doesn't the fact

317
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,087
That kate is dating me

318
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,289
Make anybody sure
about her sexuality?

319
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:52,491
Not 100%, no.

320
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,459
You people are crazy.

321
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:55,895
Hey, if the shoe fits...

322
00:13:55,896 --> 00:13:58,030
That's it. I'm
getting the boots.

323
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:01,834
You know, charlotte,

324
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:03,302
I used to be able
to count on you

325
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,237
When it came to my
girlfriends, but not anymore.

326
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,706
Hang on a sec.

327
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:08,374
So you're saying I made up

328
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,942
The whole
boob-butt-touching thing

329
00:14:09,943 --> 00:14:11,377
Just to ruin
your relationship?

330
00:14:11,378 --> 00:14:13,012
Maybe.

331
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,313
So you're calling me a liar?

332
00:14:14,314 --> 00:14:16,115
Maybe.

333
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:19,085
He's saying maybe, but
I think he means yes.

334
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:20,720
Oh, really?

335
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,122
Well, maybe I might
just call kate,

336
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,323
Invite her over here,

337
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:25,991
And get everything
cleared up right now.

338
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,293
She's saying maybe,

339
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:30,963
But I think she's
gonna call her.

340
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:33,199
Whoa, has my hair
been in sleep mode

341
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,035
This entire time?

342
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:38,137
Was anybody gonna tell me?

343
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:46,445
Excuse me.

344
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:48,180
There was a pair of boots
over there, deep gray,

345
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:49,382
Hand-stitched, made for me.

346
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:50,483
I need them in a seven.

347
00:14:50,484 --> 00:14:52,485
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:54,620
I just sold our last pair.

349
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,588
And they were a size seven.

350
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:10,770
How about this shirt?

351
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:12,938
Are you even wearing a bra?

352
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,274
Yes. What is it to you?

353
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:17,009
Well, I don't want
you jiggling around,

354
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,544
Leading the witness.
- Oh.

355
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:20,445
Come on.

356
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:21,781
Now you've all got to leave.

357
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:23,182
Kate will be here any minute.

358
00:15:23,183 --> 00:15:24,483
They're gone.

359
00:15:24,484 --> 00:15:26,051
Somebody bought the last pair!

360
00:15:26,052 --> 00:15:29,221
oh, I'm so sorry.

361
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,790
But you all have to
go right now, okay?

362
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:31,857
Come on.

363
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,259
This is ridiculous.

364
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,427
We should be able to stay.

365
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:35,694
No. You have to leave.

366
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:39,331
No, no, no, no, jiggles.

367
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:41,299
We got to make sure that
you don't accidentally sit

368
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:42,968
In something or spill
something on yourself

369
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:44,869
Before kate gets here.

370
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,605
She's here. Hide.

371
00:15:46,606 --> 00:15:49,108
Hide! Hide!

372
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:54,947
Hey, charlotte.

373
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:56,482
Oh, kate, mwah.

374
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,017
I'm glad you called. I
really need to talk to you.

375
00:15:58,018 --> 00:15:59,919
Yes, why don't we
go somewhere else?

376
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:01,886
Somewhere quieter.

377
00:16:06,793 --> 00:16:09,728
Here's fine.

378
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,597
Mm, cute boots.

379
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:13,399
Oh, thanks, I just got them

380
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,100
At this great store
next to the art gallery.

381
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,001
They're hand-stitched.

382
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:20,940
Can I ask you something?
- Mm.

383
00:16:20,941 --> 00:16:23,542
Do you think wayne and jill
were hitting on me tonight?

384
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,811
Well, first let
me ask you this-

385
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,580
If you weren't with mike,

386
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:30,049
Who would you more
likely go out with,

387
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:31,750
Wayne or jill?

388
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:35,855
Keeping in mind wayne is
a boy and jill is a girl.

389
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,990
Wayne's not my type.

390
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:39,391
First, he's rude.

391
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:40,659
Then he's all over me.

392
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,496
Real chicks like that.

393
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,664
And with jill, I
mean, she's cute,

394
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:46,999
But where's the challenge?

395
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,601
What challenge?

396
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:51,370
Why would anybody
want a challenge?

397
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,073
Kate, I have to
be honest with you.

398
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,040
They were hitting on you.

399
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:59,778
But only because I thought
you've been hitting on me.

400
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:04,183
I thought you'd never notice.

401
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,755
You're a lesbian.

402
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:11,590
Mike.
- Oh, kate.

403
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:13,491
Didn't I tell
you? Mike's here.

404
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:14,994
What are you doing?

405
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,395
Finding out for myself

406
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:18,296
That you and I
both like girls.

407
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:21,133
Mike, I'm not a lesbian.

408
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:24,336
How can you say that?
- I'm open-minded.

409
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:26,672
I like you, and
I like charlotte.

410
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:31,143
Open-minded?

411
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:32,711
So you're saying
you want to like me

412
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:34,880
And you want to like
charlotte at the same time?

413
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:37,349
Maybe in the same bed.
- Mike!

414
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,951
Sorry. I'm sorry.

415
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:42,888
Um, kate, I am not
open-minded at all.

416
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,391
I'm open-minded.

417
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,793
Oh, yes, wayne is here.

418
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:52,064
But I'm not open-minded
if mike's involved.

419
00:17:52,132 --> 00:17:54,300
Who else is back there?

420
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,701
No one.

421
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:58,170
Other than jill and leslie.

422
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:01,040
Just so you know,
you wouldn't be

423
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,775
My first lesbian
choice either.

424
00:18:02,776 --> 00:18:04,877
It would be ellen
because she makes me laugh

425
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:08,280
And she likes to dance.

426
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,250
I can't believe you were
all in there spying on us.

427
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:12,585
Mike, your friends are crazy.

428
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:14,486
We're not crazy.
We care about him.

429
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,988
We're caring people.

430
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:19,491
If you give me those boots,
I'll give you charlotte.

431
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:23,562
Crazy it is.

432
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:31,604
Well, kate and I are over.

433
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:33,939
Oh, no, what happened?

434
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:39,845
Oh, mike, I'm sorry.

435
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:40,980
I really am.

436
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:44,883
Why do you guys
only mess with me?

437
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:46,919
Jeffrey was
terrible for leslie,

438
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,454
And we did nothing.

439
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:51,357
Wayne dates idiots,
charlotte dates maniacs,

440
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,259
Jill dates everybody...

441
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:56,962
And still we do nothing.

442
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,364
Hey, belinda wasn't an idiot.

443
00:18:58,365 --> 00:18:59,531
You can't be an idiot and be

444
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:01,867
An arena football cheerleader.

445
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,706
Mike, you're the guy who
protects everyone else.

446
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,674
You were like a big
brother to leslie and jill

447
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:10,843
When they were growing up.

448
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,244
You take care of wayne now,

449
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:14,647
You even work as
a public defender.

450
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:16,315
And you're the only
man I've ever been able

451
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:17,650
To count on my whole life.

452
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,852
So that's how you
show your support?

453
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,953
By meddling?

454
00:19:20,954 --> 00:19:22,755
No, it's just
sometimes we worry

455
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:25,591
That you're not gonna take
the time to protect yourself.

456
00:19:28,194 --> 00:19:29,762
Really?

457
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:31,897
I'm so sorry.

458
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:35,434
Well, there is one thing

459
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,602
You could do to
make it up to me.

460
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:38,503
Anything.

461
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,574
Kate seemed really open to
the idea of the three of us-

462
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:45,511
Mike!
- Sorry.

463
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:50,783
A threesome.

464
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,117
I could have had a threesome

465
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:55,788
If charlotte
wasn't so selfish.

466
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:57,656
That's number two
on my bucket list.

467
00:19:57,657 --> 00:19:58,924
Oh, what was number one?

468
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:01,460
Killing a shark
with a shotgun.

469
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:05,531
You know what wouldn't
be on my bucket list?

470
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,101
<i>What?
- Watching the bucket list.</i>

471
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,903
What would be on your list?

472
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:14,039
Eh, I knocked out my bucket
list by the time I was 21.

473
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:15,407
Oh, come on,

474
00:20:15,408 --> 00:20:17,009
There's got to be
something that you would do.

475
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,546
Mm, all right, a fivesome.

476
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,581
Why not just a threesome?

477
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:23,883
Because a bucket list

478
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:27,353
Is about doing things
you haven't done.

479
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,954
A foursome?

480
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:31,490
I repeat, a bucket list
is about doing things

481
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:34,593
You haven't done.

482
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,662
All right.

483
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,899
You really got to
teach me some stuff.

484
