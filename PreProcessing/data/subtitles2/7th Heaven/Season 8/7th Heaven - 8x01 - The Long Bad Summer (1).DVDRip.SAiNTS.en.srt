TWINS:
Daddy!

00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:23,200
Daddy! Daddy!

3
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:26,734
Daddy!
Hi, guys.

4
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,400
(dog whines)

5
00:00:29,868 --> 00:00:31,801
How you doing?

6
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm okay. How are you?

7
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,534
Okay.
As okay as any of us.

8
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:44,701
Looks like it's going
to be a nice day today.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,901
Where's Simon?

10
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,767
Please, it's the last day
of vacation.

11
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:15,000
Simon...

12
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,601
I don't want
to be on vacation.

13
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,634
I don't want to have
a picnic on the beach.

14
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,634
I'm gonna keep saying
this to you

15
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:33,934
until I get through to you:

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
it was an accident.

I love you, too.

36
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:45,534
It's been a tough summer.

37
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,167
You know, ever
since you told me

38
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,067
you thought that you
might be pregnant,

39
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:52,133
I felt really happy,

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,334
not that you
weren't pregnant,

41
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,434
but because you
will be someday.

42
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,467
Someday, you and I will
have children together,

43
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:59,934
and I can't wait.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,901
Well I'm afraid
you're gonna have to.

45
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:06,267
We're due downstairs
for some more family fun.

46
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,267
What do you think?

47
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,234
About?

48
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,934
About having children?

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,501
I still have two years
of school left.

50
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,868
I think we'd better wait
until I get out of school.

51
00:04:16,934 --> 00:04:19,033
If that's what you want.

52
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,200
It's not what I want.
What I want is to have a baby.

53
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:25,801
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about it

54
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,067
ever since the scare either.

55
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,300
No, we can't.
We really can't.

56
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,601
I could baby-sit
while you go to class.

57
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,167
(chuckles)

58
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,801
No, I could.

59
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,868
Are you serious?

60
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,100
You want to have a baby?

61
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,701
I need something life-affirming.

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,334
We all do.

63
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:57,868
Do you have any kings?

64
00:04:57,934 --> 00:05:00,434
N... no.

65
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:01,968
Yes, he does.

66
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,534
No, I don't.

67
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:04,834
Are you sure?

68
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:06,400
If you have a card
with a king on it,

69
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:07,501
you have to give it to Ruthie.

70
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,467
I'm sure.

71
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,734
Sorry this is the last day
of vacation.

72
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,434
It's been really fun.

73
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,734
This is the best

74
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,801
vacation I've ever had.
I'm really glad you came.

75
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,934
I'm really glad you invited me.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,767
(boys making kissing sounds)

77
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,367
Why you guys want
to give me a hard time huh?

78
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:27,100
Because we love you.

79
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,234
We love you.

80
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,868
And you love Ruthie.

81
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,667
You love Ruthie.

82
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:43,133
(making kissing sounds)

83
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,534
(boys laughing)

84
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:51,200
I just wish I didn't feel so
guilty about having a good time.

85
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,200
I feel badly for Simon, too,

86
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,033
but I'm still having
a good time.

87
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,400
What are you doing here?

88
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,834
Uh, I was wondering

89
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,067
what you were
doing here.

90
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,734
We have the house until Sunday.

91
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:24,734
Uh, you had the house
till Saturday,

92
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,534
and it's, uh, late Saturday.

93
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:31,400
And we're here
because it's our turn.

94
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,501
We're not going home
until tomorrow.

95
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,167
What about church?

96
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:41,067
We'll be home in time
for church.

97
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,801
You said you wanted
to be home for the weekend.

98
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:48,434
Did I? Uh, I meant I wanted
to be home for Sunday.

99
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,400
Well, it's a very long drive.

100
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,434
We just can't turn around
and go back.

101
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:53,467
No, no, of course not.

102
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:54,501
Uh, come on in.

103
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,067
Oh, no, no,
I don't want

104
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,167
to spoil your last night here,

105
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:01,434
which was supposed
to be last night.

106
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,367
I wouldn't want to spoil
your first night here,

107
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:04,801
which is supposed
to be tomorrow night.

108
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:07,968
ROXANNE:
How are you doing?

109
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,701
How do you think I'm doing?

110
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,734
I was just making
polite conversation.

111
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,434
But if you want to, we can talk.

112
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,133
I've been worried
about you.

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,267
I wish everyone would stop
worrying about me.

114
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:23,601
It just makes it worse.

115
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,501
To have people care about you?

116
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,801
I don't want
anybody to care about me.

117
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:29,300
Not even Cecilia?

118
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,868
No, not even Cecilia.

119
00:07:32,934 --> 00:07:35,634
Simon, don't do this
to yourself.

120
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:37,767
I killed someone.

121
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,901
And don't say it
was an accident...

122
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:42,601
Because it was an accident
that happened

123
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:43,868
when I was driving.

124
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:47,300
I'm responsible
for killing someone.

125
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,200
How's he doing?

126
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,634
Not so well.

127
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,701
When do you go to court?

128
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,834
Next week.

129
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:04,400
Unless our insurance company
settles,

130
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:06,334
and they don't want to settle.

131
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,501
Does Simon have to go?

132
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,667
He doesn't have to go.

133
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:12,834
but I think he should.
It was an accident.

134
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:18,400
Look, I almost forgot why
you were on this vacation.

135
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:21,701
Roxanne and I will get a hotel
and we'll come back tomorrow.

136
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,234
No, you should just stay here.

137
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,701
No, you spend your last night
with your family, all right?

138
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm sorry about the mix-up.

139
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:30,534
No, there are plenty of rooms
here for everyone.

140
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:33,734
There's a room for you...
and a room for Roxanne.

141
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,501
Unless, of course,
you decide

142
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:36,734
to get married tonight.

143
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:40,300
Ah, we'll just leave
and come back.

144
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,767
Come back married?

145
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:47,200
I don't want to get
into this right now... again.

146
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,067
Okay. No judgment.

147
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,200
You don't know
that we're doing anything.

148
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,434
She's not sure if she wants
to get married right now.

149
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:59,734
Depends on whether or not
the fun lasts?

150
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:01,534
What time are you leaving
tomorrow?

151
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:03,000
No matter when we leave,

152
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:07,634
whether we're here or not,
God knows what you're doing.

153
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:12,234
God does, but none of you do.

154
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,934
We're hungry.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
Yeah, we're hungry.

156
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:33,934
You just ate.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,968
The beach makes me
hungry all the time.

158
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,434
When are we eating dinner?
In an hour

159
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,467
or so. How about a snack?

160
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:43,234
What's for dinner?

161
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,267
Whatever your mom wants to cook.

162
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,334
She's sleeping.

163
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,300
If she sleeps until tomorrow
morning, we won't have dinner.

164
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:53,200
Well, she won't do that.

165
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:58,634
She only did that once,
and we still ate, didn't we?

166
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:03,934
There's nothing wrong with
banana sandwiches for dinner.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,734
We're at the beach.
We're on vacation.

168
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,300
Oh, I get it, you want me
to drive you somewhere

169
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,300
and get you something to eat.

170
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,934
Something good.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,634
In case there's no dinner.

172
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay, come on.

173
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm taking

174
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,334
Sam and David to
Captain Crabby's
Crab House

175
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,067
for a snack. You want to go?

176
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,100
You hungry already?

177
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,901
No, but they're hungry.

178
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,634
I'll take 'em.

179
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,167
Forget it.

180
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,334
What?

181
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,534
Because I saw the look
on your face, Dad, that's why.

182
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,434
If it was just an accident,

183
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,801
then why are you so scared to
let Sam and David drive with me?

184
00:10:57,868 --> 00:11:00,100
Why is everyone frightened every
time I get behind the wheel?

185
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:01,567
That's not true.

186
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:03,601
I wasn't going that fast, Dad.

187
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,734
I wasn't going any faster
than anyone else.

188
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:09,133
I didn't see him okay?
I didn't see him.

189
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,701
He came out of nowhere.

190
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,934
We heard Simon.
I'll go talk to him.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,968
No, let me go this time.

192
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:27,400
I think
it's my turn.

193
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:28,801
No. it's not your turn.

194
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,033
You've had
too many turns.

195
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,534
This hasn't even been
a vacation for you.

196
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:34,767
BOTH:
I thought we were going

197
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,601
to Captain Crabby's.

198
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:38,534
I'll take 'em.
Kevin can talk to Simon,

199
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:39,834
and you should get a nap.

200
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,701
This is your last afternoon
to get a nap.

201
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,467
Come on, guys.

202
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:52,767
I hear they're giving away
free pirate hats.

203
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:55,834
Want to go?
All right, let's go!

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,801
I don't know how we're
gonna get him through this.

205
00:12:20,868 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't know how
we're gonna get us

206
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,267
and the rest of our
family through this.

207
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:30,267
(sleepy murmuring)

208
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:32,300
It's okay. I-I, I
wasn't talking to her.

209
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:37,167
I was talking to You.

210
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:38,968
I'll be right here.

211
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,033
♪ ♪

212
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:33,501
My gosh. I'll get dinner.

213
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,667
We already had dinner.

214
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:35,901
Would you like something?

215
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,067
Uh... 

216
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,901
Mom and I made vegetable
soup and cornbread,

217
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,767
and we saved
you a brownie.

218
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,000
Annie came down?

219
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:43,534
Then she went back up.

220
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:44,968
Well, that, that's good.

221
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,334
Then she hasn't been asleep for
the 12 hours I thought she had.

222
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,968
I'll get you some soup.

223
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:51,834
I got it.

224
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:52,934
What time 

225
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,267
did the twins pass out?

226
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,267
PETER:
11:30.

227
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,200
More like 8:30.

228
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,534
Well, you know,
I'll take them upstairs.

229
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,234
I'll take them up.

230
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,434
Oh. Okay.

231
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,100
By the way,
Cecilia's here.

232
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,267
She just got here.

233
00:14:12,334 --> 00:14:13,734
How's that going?

234
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:14,934
Not that well.

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,868
They took it down to
the beach, though.

236
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:23,601
If I wanted to talk to you,
I would have called you.

237
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,801
You shouldn't have driven
all the way down here.

238
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:28,934
I had to. I can't stand
knowing you're in so much pain

239
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,934
and not being able to be
with you and talk to you.

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,934
It's been three months.

241
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,934
How many times do
I have to say it?

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,434
I don't want
to talk to you.

243
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,133
I don't want to
talk to anyone.

244
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,501
Then fine, we won't talk,

245
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,300
but can't I just be with you?

246
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,801
No.

247
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:49,300
Look, just... just stay away.

248
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,934
Okay? Find a new boyfriend,
someone people don't hate.

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,167
People don't hate you.

250
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:55,634
It was an accident.

251
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,634
Everyone knows
it was an accident.

252
00:14:57,701 --> 00:14:58,901
Doesn't matter.

253
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:00,634
School starts on Monday

254
00:15:00,701 --> 00:15:02,567
and it's gonna be
a living hell for me.

255
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,234
Why make it
the same way for yourself?

256
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,033
You're better
off without me.

257
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,234
What?

258
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,801
You think I'm feeling
sorry for myself?

259
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:09,801
'Cause I'm not!

260
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,300
I'm feeling sorry

261
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:12,667
for the kid I ran over

262
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:13,901
and his brother and his parents.

263
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,100
I'm sure

264
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,234
Justin is grieving
for his brother, Simon,

265
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,601
but he's been in school
with you for four years.

266
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,801
He knows you're not a bad guy.

267
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,734
He knows you didn't
mean to do it.

268
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:24,934
Really?

269
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,334
Do you think he's
 that understanding?

270
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,968
Do you think anyone's
that understanding?

271
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:29,667
Because if it
had been me

272
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,534
and some guy and his car had
come along and hit Ruthie,

273
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,400
you think I just would
have went up to him at school

274
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,267
and said, "It's okay, I know
you didn't mean to do it"?

275
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:45,467
(telephone ringing)

276
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:46,934
Hello?

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,400
Yes, this is Officer Kinkirk.

278
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,434
Is that you, Detective Michaels?

279
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,501
I'll let Eric know.

280
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,634
He can decide how he
wants to handle it.

281
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:00,501
Thanks for finding me.

282
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:01,767
Good night.

283
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,000
(sighs)

284
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,901
Okay, make it snappy.

285
00:16:23,968 --> 00:16:26,100
Church starts
in one hour.

286
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:27,601
Come on, babes.

287
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,267
(clearing throat)

288
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:36,267
I'm just gonna help
Ruthie take her stuff up.

289
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,934
(telephone ringing)

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,934
Hello.

291
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,267
How'd it go?

292
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,701
We had it cleaned up by sunrise.

293
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,334
I don't think too
many people saw it.

294
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,601
Really?

295
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:59,634
Even if people did see it,

296
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:02,968
they wouldn't just, er... call
and tell Simon, do you think?

297
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,234
(sighs)

298
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,634
Well, I'll talk
to him after church.

299
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:09,767
I probably won't make it.

300
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:11,200
I'm gonna come home
and get some sleep.

301
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,434
I understand.

302
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,901
Thanks.

303
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,868
What?

304
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,801
We found out who painted
the church sign,

305
00:17:28,868 --> 00:17:30,601
not that it was too
hard to figure out.

306
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:33,133
The kid's brother, Justin?
Yeah.

307
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,801
Have the Camdens considered

308
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:37,033
having Simon transfer
to another school?

309
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,267
Eric's been
working on it,

310
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,534
but Simon doesn't
want a transfer.

311
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,167
He doesn't want to
go to school, period.

312
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,667
When's the trial start?

313
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:44,801
Jury selection begins tomorrow.

314
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:46,834
Trial will probably start
Tuesday or Wednesday.

315
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:48,934
I can't understand why
the insurance company

316
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,133
doesn't just pay.

317
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,501
The family wants more
than they want to pay.

318
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,534
No matter how much they get,
it won't bring their son back.

319
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:58,734
I just wish it hadn't
have been Simon.

320
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:02,133
But it was, and nothing we
can do can change that.

321
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:05,667
How are we
gonna do that?

322
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,234
Why are you asking me?

323
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:10,901
Then I'm gonna take
the shower first?

324
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,434
Yes, and then
I'll shower.

325
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,501
What's going on?

326
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,901
Nothing.
Nothing.

327
00:18:16,968 --> 00:18:19,901
I mean, we were just
discussing some things.

328
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,501
Showering and things.

329
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,234
I don't want to go
to church today.

330
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,033
I've gone
every Sunday

331
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,901
all summer.
I don't want to go today.

332
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:31,100
I want to stay home and I want
some time to myself.

333
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,501
I need some time to myself.

334
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,434
Okay.
Okay.

335
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,033
Okay?

336
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,567
Its okay I don't go to church?

337
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:43,467
Is there a reason its okay
I don't go to church?

338
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,100
You just said you needed
some time to yourself.

339
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,868
But do you have a reason?

340
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,133
You know, fine.

341
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,267
I don't need a reason.

342
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:54,467
See ya.

343
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,400
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for church?

344
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:09,067
Yeah, I am as soon as
Annie's out of the shower.

345
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,400
Did you tell Simon?

346
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,901
No, I didn't
tell Simon.

347
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:17,567
Maybe you should
before someone else does.

348
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,701
After church.
I'll tell him after church.

349
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:21,834
What happens if

350
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:24,334
someone else tells
him at church?

351
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,367
Simon's not going to church.

352
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,734
Neither am I.

353
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,100
Kevin's been up all night

354
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,801
and I just want to be there
for him when he gets home.

355
00:19:34,868 --> 00:19:38,067
You can't be there
for him after church?

356
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,000
What does that mean?

357
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,901
It means you got
the rest of your lives

358
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,234
and today is Sunday...

359
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,367
What if Simon needs
someone and no one's home?

360
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,934
It's been a tough summer

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,934
and Kevin and I need some
time to do something...

362
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,534
live-affirming.

363
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:56,801
Like?

364
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,801
You're not thinking of doing
something life-affirming

365
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,534
like, uh... having
a baby, are you?

366
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,267
What would make
you think that?

367
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,934
I just think that.

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,200
You have plenty

369
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:12,934
 of time to have a baby
 after you finish school.

370
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,133
It's been a hard summer
for all of us.

371
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,167
We all need something
life-affirming,

372
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,200
and I'm sure God
will provide in ways

373
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,334
other than... children
being born to mothers

374
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,367
who are still in college

375
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:23,300
and who want
to finish their degree

376
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:24,501
before starting a family.

377
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,968
All right, already.

378
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,300
I'll go.

379
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:33,968
We really could use a little...

380
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,834
uplifting distraction, You know.

381
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,701
Uh... Look, dealer's choice.

382
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,067
I'm going home now!

383
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,167
I'll see you
in church!

384
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,367
I'm surprised he doesn't keep

385
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:46,167
a change of clothes
in the house.

386
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:47,400
Call if you need a ride!

387
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,868
I need more of a
life-affirming distraction

388
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,200
than dealing with teen love.
Just...

389
00:20:55,267 --> 00:20:58,234
Peter! You forgot your bag!

390
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,033
Uh! 

391
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,868
Sorry.

392
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:04,968
I was just

393
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,334
trying to get up the nerve

394
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,567
to knock on the front door.

395
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,400
Don't I know you from somewhere?

396
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:13,601
Do you remember that Christmas
when your sister, Mary,

397
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,467
brought me home
from the shelter?

398
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,801
And then your family

399
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,901
helped me return to New York
to my own family?

400
00:21:18,968 --> 00:21:22,300
Barely. So you're just
here to thank us?

401
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,734
Well, not exactly.

402
00:21:24,801 --> 00:21:27,567
It's Carlos, isn't it?

403
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,634
Yes. Yes, and if I remember
correctly, you're Ruthie.

404
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:31,968
Only...

405
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,300
when I knew you then,
you were just a little girl

406
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,801
and now you're a young woman.

407
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:40,167
A young woman chasing
after a young man.

408
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:41,634
Sorry. Don't let me stop you.

409
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:42,968
This can wait.

410
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,400
It's waited all summer.

411
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,634
No. This bag can wait.

412
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:47,834
Please.

413
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,167
Sit down. Let's talk.

414
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:50,734
Oh.

415
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,701
And not necessarily
a distraction.

416
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:56,000
Maybe something real.

417
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:59,767
Something wonderful
that would lift us all.

418
00:21:59,834 --> 00:22:02,534
Heal us all.

419
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:08,334
Maybe if I could rise above the
darkness that's fallen over us

420
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,601
for an entire season...

421
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,968
maybe I could do something
to help Simon.

422
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:16,801
Maybe I could help
that family in their grief.

423
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,334
Anything, I'll take anything.

424
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:25,501
Shower's free.

425
00:22:25,567 --> 00:22:26,834
That's a start.

426
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:34,467
I love you and I want
to marry you.

427
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:39,200
And it's just not enough
just to be with you.

428
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,868
I want us to be
husband and wife.

429
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,868
I'm sorry about your dad.

430
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:51,133
Come on, Roxanne,
this has nothing to do

431
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,801
with my father dying.

432
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:55,701
It's about me and you.

433
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:59,801
I just can't help but
feel you want a family

434
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:00,968
because of what happened.

435
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:03,100
And I just can't help but feel

436
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,734
that you keep using
this as an excuse.

437
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,334
Knowing that I wanted
to marry you

438
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,267
before I even knew
my father was sick.

439
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:14,167
This is not about what anyone
thinks of me or thinks of you

440
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:19,767
or anything other
than that I love you,

441
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:22,501
and I want to marry you,

442
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,601
and I want to have babies
with you.

443
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,300
And-and-and...

444
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,601
And I want to keep doing this

445
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,834
for the rest of our lives.

446
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:45,434
I'll be here when
you get home.

447
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,801
Wake me up.

448
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:47,968
Definitely.

449
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,033
By the way,
who is that guy

450
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,968
I saw on the front porch
talking to Ruthie?

451
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,234
Ruthie's talking to a guy
on the front porch?

452
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,434
Tall guy, my age,
maybe younger--

453
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:00,934
I didn't get a good look.

454
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,234
Oh, you know,

455
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,901
it might have been
what's his name, Carlos.

456
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,901
So you've been keeping a
little secret from me, huh?

457
00:24:41,634 --> 00:24:44,734
(clearing throat)

458
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:45,968
Oh yeah, nice sermon.

459
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:49,634
I'm just going to say
good-bye to Ruthie.

460
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,133
She was kind of quiet
in church.

461
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,534
That's the way
it's supposed to be.

462
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:55,167
It's a place of worship.

463
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:57,567
A lot of talk going
around just the same,

464
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,367
even though
it's a place of worship.

465
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,467
Someone painted
the church sign last night.

466
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,734
Simon know?

467
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,033
No, but I plan to tell him

468
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,067
so I hope no one else
will tell him first.

469
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,167
Not to worry.
I won't say anything.

470
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,334
Not even to Ruthie?

471
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,334
She already knows.

472
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,634
It wasn't me.

473
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,133
She overheard what I overheard.

474
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,334
What else are people saying?

475
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,267
They feel really badly
for that kid's family.

476
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:29,968
But they also feel badly
for Simon and your family.

477
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,834
What else?

478
00:25:31,901 --> 00:25:34,334
Everyone thinks Chandler and
Roxanne should get married.

479
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
Or he should break up
with that hussy.

480
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,734
I'm quoting.

481
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:40,534
It was some older women talking.

482
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,133
They use words
like that-- hussy.

483
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,334
Are they calling Chandler
any names?

484
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,634
No, they seem to like him.

485
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:50,367
Anything else?

486
00:25:50,434 --> 00:25:52,467
Well, they were talking
about Mary,

487
00:25:52,534 --> 00:25:54,534
but they're always talking
about Mary.

488
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:56,667
I think she may be
the most popular person

489
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:57,834
on the church gossip circuit.

490
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:01,234
Yeah, so what's the gossip now?

491
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,567
They're just
wondering why

492
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:04,133
she hasn't been around
all summer.

493
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,234
You know with everything
happening to Simon and all.

494
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,400
Why do they think
she hasn't been around?

495
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,801
There are lots of theories.

496
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,234
My favorite is that she's a spy.

497
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,567
For?

498
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:13,567
France.

499
00:26:13,634 --> 00:26:15,400
Yeah.

500
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:19,000
Makes as much sense
as anything else.

501
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:22,701
How is it that you hear all
this stuff and I don't?

502
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:25,734
Just always at the right place
at the right time I guess.

503
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:35,367
You know you can't
keep a secret.

504
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:36,367
Yes, I can.

505
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:39,567
I know stuff, okay?

506
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,868
What stuff?

507
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,667
If I told you I would be
proving your point,

508
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,968
and if I don't tell you,
I'll be proving my point.

509
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:49,167
How did you get him to tell you?

510
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:53,434
One, I'm me and two, he's
ready to tell the world.

511
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:55,467
Mary doesn't want
to be married.

512
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:56,567
She wants an annulment.

513
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:58,834
An annulment?

514
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,567
When's the last time
you talked to her?

515
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:02,200
Why?

516
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,534
Because maybe she
changed her mind.

517
00:27:04,601 --> 00:27:06,834
Why would she change her mind?

518
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:08,501
Isn't it obvious?

519
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,567
(knocking)

520
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,000
Hey, we missed you
in church today.

521
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,934
You can come even
when Simon doesn't.

522
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,901
We're always happy
to have you there.

523
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:30,200
You okay?

524
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,667
I'm not sure.

525
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,033
I might have done something
really, really bad.

526
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,868
You want to tell
me about it?

527
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:39,734
Yes, that's why I'm here--

528
00:27:39,801 --> 00:27:41,334
to tell you about it.

529
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,000
Is Simon upstairs?

530
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,434
Do you know where Simon is?

531
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,567
You know neither Annie nor I

532
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,100
are in a good place
right now emotionally.

533
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,534
We're both
rather exhausted.

534
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:01,567
But I'm in a better place
than she is

535
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,767
and I'd say she'll be down here
momentarily

536
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,267
to make lunch for everyone.

537
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:07,234
I took him to the airport.

538
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,501
The airport?

539
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:10,300
Why?

540
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:14,033
Because he asked me to
and I love him,

541
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,834
and I would do anything for him.

542
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,000
Do you happen to know

543
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:19,000
if he'll be back in time
for school tomorrow?

544
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,367
I don't think so.

545
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:22,567
He's going to New York
to see Matt.

546
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,100
Who is going to New York
to see Matt?

547
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,334
Simon.

548
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,133
I left my Bible.

549
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,968
Always in the right place
at the right time again?

550
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:38,634
It's a curse.

551
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:45,934
So what's the plan?

552
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,067
I'll let you know.

553
00:28:47,133 --> 00:28:48,133
You'll let me know?

554
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,267
I don't think so.

555
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:51,133
I'll let you know
after I talk to Mary.

556
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,234
After I talk to Carlos.

557
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,567
He can't go to New York.
He's got school tomorrow.

558
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:02,934
Wait! Wait!

559
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
I want to talk to you!

560
00:29:09,734 --> 00:29:11,200
What else do you know?

561
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:12,334
What else?

562
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,300
You overheard the conversation

563
00:29:14,367 --> 00:29:15,734
about Simon going to New York.

564
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,734
Honest, I didn't mean to.

565
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:20,133
What else didn't
you mean to hear?

566
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,367
What do you mean?

567
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:23,033
I mean you found out something

568
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,634
when you were up
in the attic, didn't you?

569
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:28,200
Whoa, what do you have
like super powers?

570
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,467
Some days, yes.

571
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:30,767
Now what was it?

572
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:34,200
I can't, Reverend Camden.

573
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,467
Trust me, I can't.

574
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:37,667
It would mean the end of my
relationship with Ruthie

575
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,400
and that would mean the end
of my world as I know it.

576
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:42,467
Meeting Ruthie,

577
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:43,667
being with this family,

578
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:45,467
is the best thing
that's happened to me

579
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,734
since my dad left.

580
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:52,601
Please, please don't
ask me to tell you.

581
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,567
No, no, I won't ask you, Peter.

582
00:29:55,634 --> 00:29:56,601
I'm sorry.

583
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:58,367
I didn't mean to upset you.

584
00:29:58,434 --> 00:29:59,801
It's okay.
You can go home now.

585
00:29:59,868 --> 00:30:01,067
I didn't mean
to frighten you.

586
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,467
I apologize for even asking
you to tell me something

587
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,601
that obviously my daughter
or daughters--

588
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:06,901
don't want me to know.

589
00:30:06,968 --> 00:30:09,901
Thanks, Reverend.

590
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,167
Oh.

591
00:30:15,234 --> 00:30:17,200
and just so you know,

592
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:18,801
it's daughters.

593
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:23,234
You said daughter or daughters
don't want you to know.

594
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,834
Oh, so it's both of them.

595
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:27,534
It's all three of them?

596
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,300
You were saying Simon's
on his way to New York?

597
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,167
I just wanted to say good-bye
to Peter.

598
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:40,200
I'll call Matt.

599
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:41,400
What good is that going to do?

600
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,367
Well, Matt will make
him come home.

601
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:45,567
Who is he the Wizard of Oz?

602
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:46,567
Well, what do you
want me to do?

603
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,534
Well, I want you
to go and get him.

604
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:50,801
You want me to go
all the way to New York

605
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:52,901
when Matt can just
put Simon back on the plane?

606
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:54,267
One of us is going!

607
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,534
It's not going to be me!

608
00:30:57,601 --> 00:30:58,934
Well, it's not going
to be me either.

609
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,968
We've been waiting all
summer long to have a fight

610
00:31:02,033 --> 00:31:03,601
so why don't we
just have it now,

611
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,801
while Simon is
out of the house?

612
00:31:05,868 --> 00:31:08,634
Oh, so that's what
you've been waiting for--

613
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,167
Simon to get out of the house.

614
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:12,667
Couldn't you have just asked
him to get out of the house

615
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:14,234
so you could say to me
whatever it is

616
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,901
you wanted to say
to me since May?

617
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,067
I know what you
want to say to me!

618
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,934
You want to say
it's my fault.

619
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,534
That if I had left with
the rest of the family

620
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,501
that I would have
been driving

621
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:29,334
and Paul Smith would
still be alive.

622
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,033
Isn't that what you want to say?
That you blame me for this?

623
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,501
What if I had left
with the family?

624
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:35,901
What if I had been driving?

625
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:37,400
What if I had
killed Paul Smith?

626
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,834
What if it were me
instead of Simon?

627
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:41,300
What if it never happened--

628
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,567
if I'd been driving

629
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,634
this never would
have happened, right?

630
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:47,567
Annie, we can't
afford to play what if.

631
00:31:47,634 --> 00:31:49,133
We have to stay
with what is,

632
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,868
and what is, is our
son was driving

633
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:52,267
when he came around a curve

634
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:54,200
and Paul Smith wasn't
looking where he was going.

635
00:31:54,267 --> 00:32:00,634
And now-- one life is changed
forever and one life is over.

636
00:32:02,868 --> 00:32:07,701
We're the lucky ones, Annie.

637
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:10,667
We're the lucky ones.

638
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:15,000
Simon's life may be changed
forever, but he's still alive.

639
00:32:20,534 --> 00:32:22,434
All I wanted to say was

640
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:24,767
why couldn't those
parents make sure

641
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:27,467
that their son was
wearing a helmet?

642
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,534
We have a problem.

643
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,667
Okay.

644
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,467
She knows.

645
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:54,467
Okay.
RUTHIE:
Carlos is waiting

646
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:56,033
for me to call him
and tell him

647
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,934
when he can come over
and talk to Mom and Dad.

648
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,901
Okay.

649
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:02,501
Okay?

650
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:03,901
Don't you think it's
about time they knew?

651
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:06,634
Don't you think it should
be Mary who tells them?

652
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,434
I think she's not
going to tell them

653
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:09,601
and somebody is going
to have to tell them

654
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:10,934
before everyone knows but them.

655
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,834
Let Carlos tell them.

656
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:14,033
Then I should
at least warn them.

657
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,434
And how are you
going to do that?

658
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,167
KEVIN:
This is between

659
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:18,934
Carlos and Mary
and your mom and dad

660
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,067
and if Carlos wants to
tell them, let him tell them.

661
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,601
Then I think you
should be there

662
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,200
because they don't
need any more bad news.

663
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:25,300
KEVIN:
I don't think this is

664
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:27,300
necessarily bad news, is it?

665
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,033
Why do you think he's in
such a rush to tell them?

666
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,567
Yeah. Why now?

667
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,501
Why? Because it's been months
since they got married.

668
00:33:33,567 --> 00:33:35,901
Don't you think you're
being a little naïve?

669
00:33:35,968 --> 00:33:39,033
We think that
maybe they're--

670
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,400
Don't even say it.
That's ridiculous.

671
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,767
They're not pregnant.

672
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,234
Marry me.

673
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,901
You know I'm going
to marry you.

674
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:11,200
You've been saying that
you're going to marry me,

675
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:15,133
but I want to know for certain
that you're going to marry me.

676
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,467
I want to buy you a ring.

677
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:20,601
I want to set a date.

678
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,667
All right.

679
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:25,767
How's next May or June

680
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:28,067
or August or a
year from now?

681
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,868
How's next week
or next month

682
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:33,934
or the end of the year?

683
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,868
I'm just not in a hurry.

684
00:34:35,934 --> 00:34:37,400
I mean, I like things
the way they are.

685
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:40,701
Things will be
the way they are

686
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:42,701
only we'll be married.

687
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:45,868
Nothing's going to change.

688
00:34:45,934 --> 00:34:47,267
Is that what
you're afraid of?

689
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:55,367
Or is it, uh, that you
like that you can just

690
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:58,234
walk away from this, uh,
with things like they are?

691
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,601
I can't keep doing
this, Roxanne.

692
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:08,667
I love you, but I can't.

693
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:12,868
Let's get married, or...

694
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:17,400
Or?

695
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,033
(laughing):
Planning on moving in?

696
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:46,701
I'm looking for Matt Camden.

697
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,434
He's a medical student;
he works here, I think.

698
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:50,567
He's not here.

699
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:53,334
He and his wife went up to the
Berkshire's for a little R&R.

700
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,934
Oh.

701
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,467
That's an uh-oh?

702
00:35:56,534 --> 00:35:58,634
Maybe I should have called.

703
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:00,601
Are you a friend or a Camden?

704
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,834
I'm a Camden.
I'm Matt's brother, Simon.

705
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:06,534
As in the Bank of Simon?

706
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:07,868
Oh, hon,

707
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,901
I know all about the Camdens.

708
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:14,100
There's Matt, Mary, Lucy,
you, Ruthie, Sam and David.

709
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,334
Matt and I are very close.

710
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,100
I'm the one who told your dad
he was going to be a grandpa.

711
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,501
When he wasn't.

712
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:23,334
Oh.

713
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,167
So, run away from home?

714
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:26,968
Not exactly.

715
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:29,701
Do your parents
know where you are?

716
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,033
Probably.

717
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,467
I don't know.

718
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:35,033
My ex-girlfriend Cecilia
was supposed to tell them.

719
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,834
You want to call them?

720
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:38,000
Not really, no.

721
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:40,701
Why don't you call
Mary and Carlos?

722
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:42,200
Maybe you can stay with them.

723
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,534
I'm sorry, Mary a-and who?

724
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,467
I never said anything.

725
00:36:47,534 --> 00:36:48,667
She's living with a guy?

726
00:36:48,734 --> 00:36:50,734
I know nothing.
Well, are they married?

727
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:53,234
I hope so.
Oh, got to go!

728
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,300
The phone's on the desk.
Help yourself, bye!

729
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:05,367
(doorbell ringing)

730
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:13,767
I'm-I'm-I'm very
surprised to see you.

731
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:18,167
Uh, please
come in.

732
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:27,501
Would you like
to sit down?

733
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:43,267
Well, I suppose you
came here for some reason.

734
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:45,667
Is there anything I can do?

735
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:47,601
Anything we can do for you?

736
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,200
We're going to accept the offer
from your insurance company.

737
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:58,901
We don't think that any amount
of money can replace our son.

738
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:02,100
And while we hoped to get
more because, in our anger,

739
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:04,701
we wanted to punish
your family and Simon,

740
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:06,400
we don't want to go to court.

741
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:11,868
Paul should've been
wearing a helmet.

742
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:15,567
We reminded him
always to wear a helmet,

743
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:18,033
but he didn't wear a helmet.

744
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,901
He never wore a helmet

745
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:23,133
when he rode his bike.

746
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,234
But wearing or not wearing
a helmet didn't seem important.

747
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,834
Not when we were dealing with
much bigger problems with Paul.

748
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:32,767
Y-You don't, you don't
have to tell me.

749
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:34,801
 No, we want to tell the truth.

750
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:37,367
It's the right thing to do.

751
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:39,300
We hope that we can
do the right thing

752
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:41,334
so our other son
will do the right thing.

753
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,501
Justin.

754
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:47,701
Justin painted your church sign.

755
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:49,701
We'll pay to have
it repainted.

756
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,534
That's, uh, that's
not necessary.

757
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,200
I-It's been taken care of.

758
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:56,567
He had a problem with drugs.

759
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:57,801
Paul.

760
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,601
The autopsy shows that, um,

761
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:05,434
he was under the
influence of drugs.

762
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:07,300
So, while your son, Simon,
may have been guilty

763
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:10,267
of not paying attention,
our son, Paul, was guilty, too.

764
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:12,667
I had no idea.

765
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:15,267
It would have come out
in the trial,

766
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:18,501
but we'd rather
just let you know.

767
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,501
ERIC:
Still, you
didn't have to.

768
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,000
I didn't have to know the reason

769
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:24,033
why you decided
not to go to court.

770
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,701
ANNE:
I-It probably
won't help

771
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:30,033
Simon to know this, you know,

772
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,667
we want you to tell him, but...

773
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:34,634
No, he's still going
to be dealing with a lot.

774
00:39:34,701 --> 00:39:37,767
And for more
than just a few years.

775
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,167
Maybe even for a lifetime.

776
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:44,167
But... that's just the thing,

777
00:39:44,234 --> 00:39:46,701
he still has a lifetime.

778
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:50,567
DON:
Our other
son, Justin,

779
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:54,067
he's a good boy, a good
student, a good person.

780
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:57,501
But he had this thing about
trying to help his brother

781
00:39:57,567 --> 00:40:00,367
with his drug problems and he
thought he was making progress

782
00:40:00,434 --> 00:40:04,400
before the accident and, well,
now he's got a lot of anger

783
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:06,667
directed towards Simon
and he's out of control.

784
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:08,834
We have him in
grief counseling

785
00:40:08,901 --> 00:40:12,100
with us as a family and private
sessions just for him as well,

786
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,734
but it's not going that well.

787
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:17,868
And we don't want
another tragedy on our hands.

788
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:20,534
We tried to talk him out
of going back to school,

789
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:22,200
but he won't
hear of it.

790
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:26,934
He could transfer,
but it's not going to happen.

791
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,234
So, what we're hoping is maybe,

792
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,968
if you and your wife and
your son would consider it,

793
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:38,067
maybe Simon could go
somewhere else this year.

794
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,234
Because frankly,
Reverend Camden,

795
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,601
we're afraid that Justin
will do something stupid.

796
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:47,033
I don't think that he would
physically hurt Simon,

797
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,067
but we really
can't be sure.

798
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:50,901
We'd just like to
remove the temptation,

799
00:40:50,968 --> 00:40:53,100
hope that in time
the therapy works

800
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,834
and he can get through this.

801
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:58,133
We hope we can all get through
this, without any more trouble.

802
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:04,901
We can't take another
event in our lives.

803
00:41:04,968 --> 00:41:08,667
We're exhausted.

804
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,868
Simon decided
to take off for New York

805
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:17,367
to see his brother,
our oldest son, Matt.

806
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:22,200
Simon doesn't want
to go to school.

807
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:25,200
My wife and I have been
trying to make him. So...

808
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:29,167
well, we'll stop
doing that right now.

809
00:41:29,234 --> 00:41:33,501
And we'll figure out
some alternative.

810
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:37,167
It seems that's
the very least we can do.

811
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:46,567
(sighs) That's all
we really wanted.

812
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:47,901
Thanks.

813
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:50,901
Thank you for coming over here.

814
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:54,200
And thank you
for dropping

815
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:56,667
the court battle.

816
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:59,033
And thank you...

817
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,834
for trying to protect Simon.
God bless you.

818
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:17,767
And again, my
deepest sympathies.

819
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:21,334
I'm very sorry about your son.

820
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:36,200
Thank You.

821
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:42,067
Now, if you could just
help me find Simon?
