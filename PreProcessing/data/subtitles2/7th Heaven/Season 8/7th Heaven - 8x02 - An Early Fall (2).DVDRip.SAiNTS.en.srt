1
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:17,400
I have been looking

2
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:19,133
all over this
hospital for you.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,701
All night? Because I've been
calling you all night.

4
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:25,367
I didn't get in
till 2:00 in the morning.

5
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,367
And I didn't
check my messages.

6
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,334
I... I was exhausted.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,200
And now I have to get
you back to the airport.

8
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:34,000
I told you this
was a stupid idea.

9
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,601
Yeah. But you
didn't tell me

10
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:36,801
that Matt and Sarah were away.

11
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:39,300
I didn't know.

12
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,000
I assumed that you called them

13
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,400
before you called me
for a ticket.

14
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:44,801
Who's Carlos?

15
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,234
Who?

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,100
Carlos.

17
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,701
Who?

18
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,033
They guy you live with.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,133
Oh.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,300
Oh.

21
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:55,434
Oh, all right. Okay.
Everyone else knows.

22
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,968
You might as well know, too.

23
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,267
Everyone knows?

24
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:00,467
I got married.

25
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:01,300
What?

26
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,267
I'll tell you about it

27
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:03,767
on the plane.

28
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:12,834
What are you looking at?

29
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,400
Nothing.

30
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,100
What?

31
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:19,834
You're not...

32
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,434
I'm not what?

33
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:24,334
Nothing.

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,167
I'm ready to go.

35
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,901
Well, not ready.

36
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,534
But, considering
I have no choice,

37
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,033
I'm as ready as I'm going to be.

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,868
You know,
I'm actually

39
00:01:33,934 --> 00:01:36,133
feeling a little better
since your news will actually

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
take the spotlight
off me for two minutes.

41
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:39,834
It's going to be okay, Simon.

42
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,000
No, it's not.

43
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:49,601
What are you looking at?

44
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,200
Nothing.

00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,367
I'd better be going.

60
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:34,901
I'll be okay.

61
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:36,801
I know, I know.

62
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,934
You have to let go of me, Mom.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,467
Next year,
you'll be in high school.

64
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,367
High school.
It's hard to believe.

65
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,300
And the boys will
be in kindergarten.

66
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,701
I bet they could use a hug.

67
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,934
And, next year,
Simon will be in college.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,868
Unless, of course, allowing him
to transfer to another school

69
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:53,367
doesn't work out like
your father thinks it will.

70
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,868
He'll go to college.
He's Simon.

71
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,767
Maybe he'll even go this year.

72
00:03:57,834 --> 00:03:59,968
I hope so.

73
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,467
I really do.

74
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:03,467
Simon is not going
to turn out like Mary,

75
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,968
if that's what
you're thinking.

76
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,100
That's what I was thinking.

77
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:08,334
Have you heard from him?

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,801
No. But Simon will
be on a plane with Mary,

79
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,067
and they'll be home tonight
for dinner.

80
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:14,167
Mary's coming home
tonight for dinner?

81
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,234
We haven't seen much of her
this summer. I miss her.

82
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,801
I wish she'd come back home.

83
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:22,667
I do, too, but I don't think
that's going to happen now.

84
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:27,634
Because she loves flying
so much.

85
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,968
I have to go.

86
00:04:31,033 --> 00:04:33,000
That's not what
you were going to say.

87
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,133
I was just
simplifying it.

88
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,267
It's pretty much
what I was going to say.

89
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,200
And I've got school.

90
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,634
And I'm meeting with Peter
and... good-bye.

91
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,534
Wish me luck.

92
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,501
I have to get to class,

93
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,133
but I appreciate
your meeting me.

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,300
And I appreciate
everything you
said to me, Lucy,

95
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:55,801
but this is it.

96
00:04:55,868 --> 00:04:57,634
Tonight's the night.

97
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,400
With or without Mary,
I'm telling your parents.

98
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,334
'Cause your family should know.

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,667
Mary told them that
she's coming home for dinner.

100
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:07,000
She's coming from the airport
with Simon.

101
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,767
She's my wife. We talk.

102
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:11,601
I know she's coming
from the airport with Simon.

103
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:13,200
But I also know
how many times

104
00:05:13,267 --> 00:05:14,567
she planned
to come home

105
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:15,634
and have dinner at
your parents' house

106
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:17,968
and tell them,
only she never has.

107
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,801
And maybe she never will.

108
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:21,868
But I told her that
I was going to tell them

109
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,367
whether she showed up or not.

110
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:24,868
I want them to know.

111
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:30,467
Is there some reason
why it has to be now?

112
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,234
It should have been months ago.

113
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,367
But why now? Tonight?

114
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:36,901
Because it's now or never.

115
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,567
We need to talk.

116
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:49,968
I thought you
were on vacation.

117
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,934
Well, I decided
to work instead.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,934
Why?

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,801
Because I need
to keep busy.

120
00:05:54,868 --> 00:05:56,567
You've been doing
plenty of that.

121
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
What's wrong?

122
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,734
Did something happen
to your father?

123
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,133
No.

124
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,300
Did someone die?

125
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:05,934
No. No one died.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,167
Chandler broke up with me.

127
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,434
Oh. Well, I'm
not surprised.

128
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,167
Why are you not surprised?

129
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,300
Because he loves you,
and wants to marry you,

130
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:17,100
and, for some reason, you
don't want to marry him,

131
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,434
even though I think
you love him.

132
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:21,801
Is that any reason
to break up with me?

133
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:23,434
Yeah, that's a reason.

134
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:24,901
If you don't want to get
married, and he does,

135
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,367
what'sa guy
supposed to do?

136
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,400
Just wait around until
you change your mind?

137
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,968
Maybe it's best if he
quits wasting his time

138
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,601
and gets over you
and moves on.

139
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,834
It isn't about
what you want

140
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,400
or don't want this time,
Roxanne.

141
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,567
It's about what he wants
and doesn't want.

142
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,267
Respect that.

143
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,167
(phone ringing)

144
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:57,434
Hello.

145
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,033
It's me.
I need to talk to you.

146
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,968
I need some time.

147
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:04,834
I don't.

148
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:08,868
Look, Roxanne, I love you,

149
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:11,834
but I don't think this
is going to work out.

150
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,133
Especially now that I know
that you don't want to marry me.

151
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
At any time in the near future.

152
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:19,601
Look, we agreed to spend some
time apart and think about this.

153
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:23,133
So that's what I want to do--
think.

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,868
I don't want to talk about it.

155
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,901
Sorry. I... I couldn't
help but overhear.

156
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:37,167
Did... What? Did
you and Roxanne...?

157
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:40,067
I don't want to talk to you
about it either, all right?

158
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,067
Please.

159
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:45,200
I can't stand to hear
"I told you so"

160
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:47,200
when my heart is breaking
into a million pieces.

161
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,534
I'm... I'm sorry, Chandler.

162
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,901
Look, I got
a really busy day.

163
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:58,868
I got to come up with another
high school for Simon to go to.

164
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,100
The family decided not
to go to trial,

165
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,067
but they're asking me
to get Simon out

166
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,701
of the same high school
their other son goes to.

167
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,868
For Simon's sake, and for his.

168
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:15,400
Since Simon desperately
wanted out,

169
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:21,334
well, I'm going
to do whatever I can,

170
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,534
as long as it's
to everyone's advantage.

171
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:26,701
Well, he could
test out of high school

172
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,767
if his SATs were
high enough last year.

173
00:08:28,834 --> 00:08:30,467
If his grades are good enough.

174
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:32,367
He could work through the fall,

175
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:35,133
and go to college
in January or next fall.

176
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,534
And until then?

177
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:39,067
He can get some kind of job
until then.

178
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,767
Paid work to help with tuition,
or volunteer work.

179
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,267
The Youth Corps or something.

180
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:47,300
Hmm. No senior year?

181
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,901
I didn't have a senior year.

182
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:51,868
I got out the summer before,
and went to college.

183
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,734
I never regretted it.

184
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:59,367
I don't suppose I could get you
to come to my house for dinner.

185
00:08:59,434 --> 00:09:02,300
Simon is supposed to be home
from New York by then,

186
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:06,000
and maybe you could talk to him,
you know, after I talk to Annie?

187
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,100
Sure, I'd love to.

188
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,734
It's not like I have any plans.

189
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,067
I hope Lucy's on
for our pizza night.

190
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,167
I can't wait to talk to someone
who's a little more sympathetic.

191
00:09:19,234 --> 00:09:20,601
Is that tonight?

192
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,334
Yep. That's tonight.

193
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I don't think she's
planning to go,

194
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,434
since you're supposed
to be at the beach.

195
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:29,033
Well, I 'm not at the beach,

196
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,300
so I want pizza night with Lucy.

197
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,834
We have a family dinner tonight.

198
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:34,701
Then I'll just have dinner
with her there,

199
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:35,968
and we'll talk afterward.

200
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:39,701
Tonight might not
be the best night.

201
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:41,601
I'll be right back.

202
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,000
Where are you going?

203
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,601
I'm going to the men's room,
okay?

204
00:09:49,434 --> 00:09:50,834
Who are you calling?

205
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:00,100
Hello.

206
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,834
Hi. It's Roxanne.

207
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,234
Um...would it be all right if
I came over for dinner tonight?

208
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,968
Chandler and I just broke up,

209
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,601
and I really don't feel
like being alone,

210
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,067
and my dad is still
on his extended vacation,

211
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,968
and I really feel
like being with family,

212
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:15,467
and you're practically family,

213
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,334
and I need to speak with Lucy.

214
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,534
Of course you can come.

215
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:21,033
Thanks.
Um... can I bring anything?

216
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
No, just yourself.
See you around 7:00.

217
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,400
Is it my cooking?

218
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:25,367
Do you cook?

219
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:29,033
No. I'll see you at 7:00.

220
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,067
(ringing)

221
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,067
Hello.

222
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,133
Hi. It's me, Cecilia.

223
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,067
Is Simon still in New York?

224
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,634
Uh... well, he's...
he's on his way home.

225
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,000
He should be here
in time for dinner,

226
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:42,100
and Mary's coming with him.

227
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:44,000
Mrs. Camden, I've been trying

228
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,934
to talk Simon into coming back
to school.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
Well, we all have.

230
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:50,033
But I think maybe
I was just being selfish.

231
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,534
Maybe he shouldn't
be here after all.

232
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,634
There's... a lot of talk.

233
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:57,567
Well, if you're talking
about the older brother,

234
00:10:57,634 --> 00:11:00,801
and how upset he is, we heard
from the parents last night.

235
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,901
I didn't think
it would get this bad.

236
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:06,267
Well, we didn't either,
but Eric talked to Simon,

237
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,234
and they'll talk more
when he gets home.

238
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,934
Can I come over
and talk to him, too?

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,400
If you want, of course.

240
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:14,133
Are you angry with me for
driving Simon to the airport?

241
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
No, no.
It wasn't your decision.

242
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:17,667
We understand that.

243
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,467
But I know that Simon's
hurt your feelings,

244
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:22,467
and, you know,
I hope he didn't just use you

245
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:23,968
to get to the airport.

246
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,334
And I'd hate to have you come
over tonight

247
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,601
and have him be rude
to you again.

248
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,601
He has hurt my feelings.

249
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,334
But maybe because I've just
been pushing too hard.

250
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,334
Maybe I should just let go

251
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,067
and let him know that
I'm there if he needs me.

252
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:38,634
I think that's a good idea.

253
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,534
So, I'll see you for dinner.

254
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:43,667
And maybe Simon and I can
talk afterward. Bye.

255
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,434
Okay, bye.

256
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,467
What's for dinner?
What's for dinner?

257
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,767
Same thing we've been
eating all summer.

258
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,100
Trouble.

259
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,200
A big heaping bowl of trouble.

260
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,934
With a Mary on top.

261
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,901
Oh, I was hoping to
catch you in the shower.

262
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,901
Hmm, I could always
go back in.

263
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,100
Maybe later.

264
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,033
How was your day?

265
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,300
I got my schedule today.

266
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:25,701
It's not bad. No early

267
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,901
morning classes.
That's good news.

268
00:12:27,968 --> 00:12:32,567
Oh, uh, I had coffee
with Carlos.

269
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:34,767
He's dropping by the
house tonight for dinner.

270
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,868
Hoping Mary will be there,
but even if she isn't--

271
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,667
Good. I hate keeping secrets.

272
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:41,234
You didn't ask Carlos if he
and Mary are pregnant did you?

273
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,067
No, but he didn't
say they aren't.

274
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:44,534
 He didn't say Mary's
 not pregnant.

275
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:46,300
I think you're wrong.

276
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,934
Not to change the subject, but
did you hear there's no trial

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,868
with the insurance companies?

278
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:54,601
When did that happen?

279
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,501
The kid's parents
decided against it.

280
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,968
But they want Simon
to stay out of school

281
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,734
so their older son doesn't
have to deal with him.

282
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,634
That's a shame,
because, sooner or later,

283
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,901
Simon and this guy will have
to deal with each other.

284
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:07,300
Mom and Dad just want
to give him some time.

285
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,367
Especially since
the parents asked

286
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,133
and Simon doesn't want to
face him right now anyway.

287
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,767
It might be good
for him to get away.

288
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,400
Give him a chance
to grow up a little.

289
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,501
I don't think he's going away.

290
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,234
He's just going
to another school.

291
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,901
Not to change the subject

292
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,901
because I do think
he'll end up going away,

293
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,801
But I have some
news for you, too.

294
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:27,434
Roxanne and Chandler broke up.

295
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,267
So that's why she's been
so anxious to see me.

296
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,334
(groans) And I haven't
even called her back.

297
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,133
I feel terrible.

298
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,033
(knocking on door)
ROXANNE:
Lucy?

299
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,567
Annie invited
me to dinner.

300
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:49,667
I'm so sorry.
I just heard.

301
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,267
What happened?

302
00:13:51,334 --> 00:13:52,701
You really don't want
to get married?

303
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,234
I want to get married.

304
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,634
I just don't want to get married
right now.

305
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:59,734
And now that I've had
some time to think about it,

306
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,434
I don't think that I want
to be married to him.

307
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,968
That's the first time
I've said that out loud.

308
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,200
I just don't think
I'm cut out to be

309
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,834
a preacher's wife.

310
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,434
I mean, I'm not even good at
being a preacher's girlfriend.

311
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:18,868
The whole thing is
just so unnatural.

312
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:20,534
I don't know, I mean, I mean,

313
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:24,067
he's like this
holy man and I'm like...

314
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,734
I don't know, so unholy.

315
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:29,567
Um, are you staying for dinner?

316
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,300
Well, your mom invited me.

317
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:33,367
I thought maybe we could get
coffee and talk afterwards?

318
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,868
Do you think I'm unholy?

319
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,534
No, not exactly.

320
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,167
Not exactly?
What does that mean?

321
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:39,934
I-I don't know.

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,534
I don't know what unholy means.

323
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:44,100
Look, I really do
want to talk to you.

324
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,267
It's just that well,
tonight's dinner,

325
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,033
it might get
a little complicated.

326
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,534
Mary's coming home.

327
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,000
I know. She's bringing Simon
back from New York, right?

328
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:54,801
Is something going on with Mary?

329
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,167
Well...

330
00:14:57,234 --> 00:15:01,534
Hi. I was wondering
the same thing.

331
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,534
Is something going on with Mary?

332
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,467
Annie invited me to dinner.

333
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,534
What's going on with Mary?

334
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:12,968
Without Simon,
I'm out of the loop.

335
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,167
Hi.

336
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,067
I guess you've heard.

337
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,400
I don't want to
talk about it.

338
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,934
Okay, but Roxanne is...

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
I don't want to talk about it.

340
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,133
...in our apartment
talking to Lucy.

341
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,968
(sighing)

342
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:40,400
You're staying?

343
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:43,701
I was invited so,
yes, I'm staying.

344
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,200
You know, Mary is
going to be here.

345
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,534
And?

346
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,534
And I know Eric wants
to discuss some things.

347
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,400
Family things, with Simon.

348
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,667
Oh, I know that.

349
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:53,834
That's how I got invited.

350
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,434
I'm supposed to talk to Simon

351
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:56,934
after Eric is finished
talking to Annie.

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,734
Well, there are some things
going on in Mary's life that...

353
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:04,234
may actually overshadow the
things going on in Simon's life.

354
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,834
At least just tonight.

355
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:09,234
What could possibly overshadow
what's going on in Simon's life?

356
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,501
You're here on a
historic night, you know.

357
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,434
I know. I'm a little nervous.

358
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:17,667
I am, too, but you know,

359
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:19,434
the flip side
of nervousness is excitement.

360
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,734
Believe me, I feel guilty
feeling anything but horrible

361
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:27,801
after that accident.

362
00:16:27,868 --> 00:16:29,534
But, as of today,

363
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,767
life is starting
to move on for all of us.

364
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:32,968
And we need that.

365
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,934
So, we may as well
get excited about it.

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,667
What happens if your parents
don't take Mary's big news well?

367
00:16:38,734 --> 00:16:41,300
What if they're not
at all excited about it?

368
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,167
And what if it's the straw
that breaks the Camden's back?

369
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,334
There is no such straw.

370
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,601
We're a family.
Everything will be fine.

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,434
Okay, everything may
not be fine tonight,

372
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,133
but eventually--

373
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,767
Are you sure she's
going to have a baby?

374
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,868
I'm not sure,
but Lucy and I think so.

375
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,901
What does Kevin think?

376
00:16:58,968 --> 00:17:00,033
Kevin's a guy.

377
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,200
I'm a guy, too.

378
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,033
And I think you're
jumping to conclusions.

379
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Want to bet?

380
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,767
I can't take
your money, sweetheart.

381
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,167
No.
What?

382
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:22,033
(doorbell ringing)
Can I do anything else?

383
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,567
Well, you can
get the door

384
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,033
and if it's anyone
else for dinner,

385
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,868
the inn is full.

386
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,968
(knocking on door)

387
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:36,601
Hi.

388
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:37,667
Hi.

389
00:17:37,734 --> 00:17:40,534
Um, I don't know
if you remember me.

390
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:44,701
At Christmas
a couple years back?

391
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:47,367
Mary met you at the shelter.

392
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,567
We sent you home
to your family.

393
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,100
Yeah, that's right.

394
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,567
Well, come in.
Come in.

395
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:55,200
Thank you.

396
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:57,133
How are you?

397
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,133
I'm fine.

398
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,234
It's Carlos.

399
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,133
Kevin, Chandler,
this is Carlos.

400
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,300
Nice to meet you.

401
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,300
Hi.

402
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,167
Excuse us.

403
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,567
So, it's been a long time.
How's your family?

404
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:28,567
Good, good, the family's good.

405
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,734
Getting bigger every day.

406
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:32,467
Our family, too, yeah.

407
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:34,200
Lucy got married last April.

408
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:35,367
You remember Lucy?

409
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,033
Yeah.

410
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,734
Carlos is in the living room.

411
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:49,934
I think Dad wants you
in the living room.

412
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,234
Why, who was at the door?

413
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
All:
Carlos!

414
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,067
ALL:
The homeless guy that Mary
brought home one Christmas?

415
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:02,567
ALL:
Carlos is in the living room.

416
00:19:02,634 --> 00:19:03,801
LUCY, ROXANNE, CECILIA:
Now?

417
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:04,834
What's going on?

418
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:06,334
ALL:
Nothing.

419
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
What do you know
that I don't know?

420
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,067
So, are you working?

421
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,767
Yeah, yeah,
I'm working.

422
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,701
I've been very fortunate
that my father

423
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,133
brought me back
into the family business.

424
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,367
Oh, that's good.

425
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:23,767
Yeah. I can't tell you
how much it means to me

426
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:26,367
to be part of the family
and the family business.

427
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:27,868
And the family.

428
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:29,200
Yeah, yeah.

429
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,467
'Cause family is so important.

430
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:33,934
Maybe the most important
thing in life.

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,934
You're right.

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,033
And if you don't have a family,
th-then you can make a family.

433
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,567
But hopefully you have a family.

434
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,133
And sometimes
one person's family

435
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,467
and another person's family,
they come together

436
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:51,634
and they make
a very big, happy family.

437
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:58,167
Hey, Happy.

438
00:19:58,234 --> 00:19:59,934
Hey, girl!

439
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,501
Excuse me.

440
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,501
Mary! Simon!

441
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:10,801
Oh, it's so good to see you!

442
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,434
We should talk.

443
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:20,000
But after I talk
to your mom.

444
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:23,667
Hi!

445
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,701
We've missed you.

446
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:33,734
Oh! Do you remember
Simon and Mary?

447
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:35,033
Oh, yeah.

448
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,067
Oh this is wonderful.

449
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,868
Hey, Mom.
Oh, Mary!

450
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,601
Simon, no more running away.

451
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,667
We want you home with us.

452
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,801
You scared me.

453
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,534
You remember Carlos,
don't you, honey?

454
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,601
Of course, Christmas.

455
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,834
A few years ago. Mary
brought him home. Hi.

456
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:12,067
Nice to see you.

457
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,868
MARY:
Hey, you guys, hi!

458
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:30,167
Well, actually, um,

459
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,067
Carlos and I...

460
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:36,267
We ran into each
other in New York.

461
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:38,200
When he was at the airport
picking up his brother.

462
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:41,200
Carlos:
Right. And, uh, we
remembered each other

463
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:45,033
from that very wonderful
Christmas I spent here.

464
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,467
MARY:
And so I went out
with him and his brother.

465
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,601
And then she went
out with just me.

466
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,567
And we went out
several times.

467
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,634
Oh! S-So
you're dating?!

468
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:03,934
Well, that's great,
you know? Good for you.

469
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,834
You can tell us all
about it over dinner.

470
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:07,200
Let's go.

471
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,667
Carlos:
Uh, we

472
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,167
were dating.

473
00:22:10,234 --> 00:22:12,334
A lot.

474
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,934
And, well...

475
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,767
And... now you're not dating.

476
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,167
It's okay.

477
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,267
It happens.

478
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:28,033
Well, not exactly,
Reverend Camden.

479
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,701
Mrs. Camden,
I've been trying

480
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,634
to tell you this for
several months now, but--

481
00:22:36,701 --> 00:22:40,634
But I wouldn't let him
because-because I got scared.

482
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:42,968
And I wanted to
change my mind.

483
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:45,667
But then all this
happened with the accident

484
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:48,734
and then this whole
crazy summer

485
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:52,734
and I changed my mind
about changing my mind.

486
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:56,801
And, uh... we're...

487
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:04,067
You're not...
you're not dating?

488
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,200
Are you two engaged?

489
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,734
You're engaged?

490
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,934
They're engaged.

491
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,767
Ah...

492
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,334
Please don't hate me.

493
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,734
We could never
hate you, ever.

494
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:52,601
No matter what,
we-we love you.

495
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,000
So let's eat.

496
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,100
Carlos and I got married

497
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:07,567
last April a week
after Lucy and Kevin.

498
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,934
I was going to have
the marriage annulled,

499
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,834
but-- not because
I don't love him,

500
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:23,501
because I was so
afraid to tell you.

501
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:24,834
And I thought
that, you know,

502
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:27,033
if I could undo what
we'd-- what we'd done,

503
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,434
then we could redo it.

504
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:31,200
And-and you guys could get used
to the idea for a little bit

505
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:33,534
and I could have time
to get used to the idea.

506
00:24:33,601 --> 00:24:34,634
Annulled?

507
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,434
Well, I just
thought about it.

508
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:41,067
Well, you didn't
tell me about it.

509
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:44,000
Well, I couldn't because
I didn't really want to.

510
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,567
No, but you
thought about it?

511
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:46,567
I panicked!

512
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:47,701
Why?

513
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:48,901
Just because.

514
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,834
Can I have a few minutes
alone with, uh,

515
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:58,300
with my wife?

516
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,667
Please?

517
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:06,501
Don't leave.

518
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:09,000
No. There are things
I need to say to you

519
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:11,300
that I don't care to say
in front of your parents.

520
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,901
I know.

521
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,267
That's why I want them here.

522
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:16,501
Well, this is not about them.

523
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:17,501
It's about you and I.

524
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:29,868
So, you were saying?

525
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:31,000
An annulment?

526
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,367
(speaking Spanish)

527
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,367
Loca, loca...

528
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:06,734
I know what you're saying.

529
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,834
Not unless your Spanish
has improved greatly.

530
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,901
Something about a chicken?

531
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,167
I wasn't chicken.

532
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:15,634
I just didn't want to hurt them.

533
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,400
I didn't say anything
about a chicken.

534
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:20,067
Loco?

535
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,634
El Pollo Loco--
it's a chicken place.

536
00:26:26,434 --> 00:26:29,467
El Pollo Loco means
"the crazy chicken."

537
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,801
And I said you were
crazy not chicken.

538
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:34,100
Why would people
eat crazy chickens?

539
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:37,501
So you think I'm crazy?

540
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:38,767
Yeah.

541
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,901
Oh, that's nice.

542
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:42,200
You're calling your wife

543
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,133
and the mother
of your future children crazy?

544
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,901
Yes.

545
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:53,868
(speaking Spanish)

546
00:26:56,868 --> 00:27:00,000
I love you, too.

547
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:03,067
Hey, your Spanish
is getting better.

548
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:39,133
♪ ♪

549
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:46,801
So if Mary was, you know...
she would have told them.

550
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:48,300
No, she wouldn't have.

551
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,701
She would let them
get used to one idea

552
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:52,334
then spring it on them.

553
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Where is everyone anyway?

554
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:55,400
No one's hungry.

555
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:56,534
Except for us.

556
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,200
We're very hungry.

557
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:00,667
Is Mary really married?

558
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,033
Yes, she is.

559
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,968
Why didn't they
have a wedding?

560
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:06,100
They had one,
but no one was there.

561
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,934
Not even them?

562
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,367
Mary and Carlos were there.

563
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:12,300
Just none of the Camdens
were there.

564
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,801
Why not?

565
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:16,968
Sometimes people don't want
their families at the wedding.

566
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:18,200
Why not?

567
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:21,801
Because sometimes families
can make it complicated.

568
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,200
And Mary and Carlos are
already pretty complicated.

569
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,400
What do you mean by that?

570
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:28,901
Yeah. What do you mean?

571
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:31,868
Well... they're from
different backgrounds,

572
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,834
different religions and--

573
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:35,567
And they might be...

574
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:37,167
No, they're not.

575
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:04,234
Are we doing
the right thing?

576
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,534
Taking a break?

577
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,634
I think maybe we are.

578
00:29:10,067 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm sorry if I misled you.

579
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,968
What does that mean?

580
00:29:15,033 --> 00:29:17,334
I can't marry you.

581
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,200
I can't be a preacher's wife.

582
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:22,267
I'm not a
preacher's wife type.

583
00:29:24,834 --> 00:29:27,033
That's it?

584
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,167
That's all that's keeping
you from marrying me?

585
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:31,901
Honestly?

586
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:35,167
No.

587
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,734
I knew I didn't want to get
married from the beginning.

588
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:41,534
It was just really fun
to think of all this stuff.

589
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:45,968
The wedding, moving in together,
having babies.

590
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,701
Why do we have to get married?

591
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:53,033
Why do we ever have
to get married?

592
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,300
Believe me-- we don't.

593
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:03,667
Does this mean we
can still be friends?

594
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:06,167
Can I still come over here
and see your family

595
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:07,601
and call you on
the phone, and...

596
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:13,501
We were friends before we got
into this relationship Simon.

597
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,634
We can be friends.

598
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:16,634
Can't we?

599
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,434
Some day.

600
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:23,968
But not right now.

601
00:30:24,033 --> 00:30:26,701
I can't be a friend
to anyone right now.

602
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:27,834
I'm sorry.

603
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:29,534
I just have
to focus on me

604
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:31,701
right now and I have
to get out of here.

605
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:34,300
I'm going to miss you
at school, Simon.

606
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm going to miss
you everywhere.

607
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,734
Shouldn't you be inside
with Mom?

608
00:30:56,801 --> 00:30:57,868
She wanted to lie down.

609
00:30:57,934 --> 00:30:59,501
She needs some
time to think.

610
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,133
And you don't?

611
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,267
What's to think about?

612
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:10,234
Our little Mary is
married evidently.

613
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,434
And hopefully, it's not
just her first marriage.

614
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:16,400
Hopefully, she'll be
very happy and so will he

615
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:20,767
for the rest of
their stupid lives.

616
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:23,901
I knew you weren't happy.

617
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:26,567
I just didn't know
if it was them or me.

618
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:31,334
I haven't had a chance
to talk to your mom yet.

619
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,234
Well, actually I haven't had the
nerve to talk to your mom yet.

620
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,601
Here's the thing.

621
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,467
Instead of going
through the torture

622
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:43,501
of transferring--
as you put it--

623
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:48,033
it might be possible
to test out.

624
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,501
And instead go
to a community college.

625
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:54,868
I think the testing
part sounds great.

626
00:31:54,934 --> 00:31:58,000
I think I could do a little more
than community college though.

627
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,934
I want to go to...
to a real college.

628
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,334
What do you mean
by a real college?

629
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
I mean I want to
go to a college,

630
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,501
far, far away from here.

631
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:15,501
I thought maybe you
would want to be

632
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,567
home with your family,

633
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,667
around people who
love and care about you.

634
00:32:18,734 --> 00:32:23,934
I've been around people who love
and care about me all summer.

635
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,367
Look, I know everyone feels
badly about the accident.

636
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:31,834
The fact that anyone
feels bad for me

637
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:34,901
after what I did, it's--
Dad, it's making me crazy.

638
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:36,167
Simon...

639
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:38,067
It was an accident,

640
00:32:38,133 --> 00:32:40,968
I don't care.

641
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,634
You know, I
couldn't feel worse

642
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:49,901
if I had done it--
if it had been intentional.

643
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,667
Dad, I've heard everything
you've said to me.

644
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:54,267
I know it's a process.

645
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:56,567
I... know it might be
a life-long process, Dad,

646
00:32:56,634 --> 00:32:59,367
but this is a process that I
have to go through on my own.

647
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:03,434
Might be a little easier
with your friends and family,

648
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:04,868
maybe even your girlfriend?

649
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,434
I don't want dealing
with this to be easy.

650
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:10,467
I want it to be hard.

651
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,667
Besides, Cecilia... (sighs)

652
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:19,567
she's finally letting go...
for now.

653
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:22,601
Simon, don't keep
punishing yourself.

654
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,167
I-I swear I'm not
punishing myself, Dad.

655
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:28,367
I'm just, I'm trying
to find some meaning

656
00:33:28,434 --> 00:33:29,968
in what happened, you know?

657
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:32,667
If there's no meaning,
then maybe there's something,

658
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:35,934
something that comes
from it, you know,

659
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,133
like a, a greater
understanding of life?

660
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,734
Dad, I don't know.

661
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:41,868
Something.

662
00:33:41,934 --> 00:33:44,334
Maybe I could help you
if you'd let me.

663
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,701
Cecilia told me about the church
sign on the way to the airport.

664
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:53,200
(groans)
I was gonna tell you.

665
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:54,968
But you didn't.

666
00:33:56,767 --> 00:34:02,367
Surgeons... shouldn't operate
on their own families, Dad.

667
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,701
And I'm in somewhat dire need
for a surgery

668
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:11,767
that, that you can't do for me.

669
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,300
So let me go away and get
my help somewhere else.

670
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:19,634
We were just talking about
letting you get out

671
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:21,934
of high school a year early.

672
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,067
And that was it.

673
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:29,534
I'm not ready
to let you go away, Simon,

674
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,400
and I know your mom's
not ready.

675
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:35,634
You're 17.

676
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,801
You're only 17.

677
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:43,901
I know... but I'm ready.

678
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:48,100
Oh, please, Dad?

679
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,834
Sooner or later, I'm gonna
have to talk to Justin.

680
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:53,701
Maybe not this week.

681
00:34:53,767 --> 00:34:56,634
Maybe not this month,
and maybe not even this year.

682
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:05,200
But when we eventually find
ourselves face-to-face...

683
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm gonna need to be ready
to hear how much he hates me.

684
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:14,767
And I'm gonna  need to be ready
to say something back to him.

685
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:17,133
Something more than
"I'm sorry" and "I understand."

686
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,167
And I don't think I can get
ready for that

687
00:35:22,234 --> 00:35:24,567
just by hanging around
with my family,

688
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:27,300
waiting for that eventual
confrontation.

689
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:29,067
I have to
get away, Dad.

690
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:34,167
I have to confront myself.

691
00:35:34,234 --> 00:35:36,133
I'm not even sure who I am.

692
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:44,033
But I am sure...

693
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,934
I'm sorry about that kid.

694
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,868
You know, Dad, I'm so,
I'm so horribly sorry.

695
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,868
(sighs)

696
00:36:05,834 --> 00:36:07,167
Now I'm starving.

697
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:08,901
Me, too.

698
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:11,267
You want to go and see
if we can steal some dinner,

699
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:13,234
or do you want me
to go get us something?

700
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,234
Anything you want.

701
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:19,367
Kevin?

702
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:21,033
Lucy?

703
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,901
I don't want
to have a baby.

704
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:27,901
I know we've been talking
about it a lot.

705
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,634
and talking about
it's really fun,

706
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:35,133
but the reality of it,
well, that's something else.

707
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,601
Yeah, I know, but...

708
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,000
 But when I graduate college

709
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:42,000
and when I've had time
to start my career

710
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,534
and when we're settled
into a place of our own

711
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,834
and when we've spent time
together, just the two of us,

712
00:36:46,901 --> 00:36:49,634
and when we feel
that we can be responsible

713
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,767
for the life
of a new human being,

714
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:55,133
then I would love
to have a baby with you.

715
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,534
Whenever you're ready.

716
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:02,067
What changed your mind?

717
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,767
Was it something Roxanne said?

718
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:07,067
No, actually,
it was seeing Mary.

719
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:09,000
I still think
they've got a reason

720
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,634
for telling Mom and Dad
they're married.

721
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:13,601
I think they're pregnant
even if you don't.

722
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,501
And I was thinking
about how I want

723
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:20,901
to tell you when we're pregnant
and how we'd tell our families.

724
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:25,300
I want it to be a wonderful
moment, not a scary one.

725
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,334
Do you really think
they're pregnant?

726
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,267
Yes, and I bet she
hasn't told Carlos.

727
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:35,934
But I bet he already knows.

728
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:48,100
Oh, what happened to her?

729
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,968
Straight-A student
headed for college

730
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:53,501
with a basketball scholarship,

731
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:57,767
and then out of nowhere breaks
into the high school gymnasium.

732
00:37:57,834 --> 00:38:01,367
The next thing you know,
she's an airline attendant

733
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:03,100
married to some guy
that we don't know.

734
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,234
What happened?

735
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,300
I don't know.

736
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,834
But maybe marriage
will be good for her.

737
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:13,100
It was
a rhetorical question.

738
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,901
Just the same,
you know,

739
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,300
it might be
good for her.

740
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:18,767
No, it won't.

741
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,033
Did the twins eat?

742
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,667
Yeah, they ate
with Ruthie and Peter.

743
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:23,701
What about Simon?

744
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:25,033
Not yet, but he will.

745
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,434
He's too thin.

746
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:28,100
I'll make sure
he eats something.

747
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:31,167
Just make sure
he doesn't leave home

748
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:33,334
and end up married
to someone we don't know.

749
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,601
And especially make sure
he doesn't leave home.

750
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,701
He's going nowhere
until he finishes college.

751
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:49,234
It-It's-It's gonna be
fine, Annie, I promise.

752
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,100
I know,
I... I know.

753
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,067
Just pray that Mary
isn't pregnant.

754
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:03,934
Pray that that's not the reason
she didn't get an annulment.

755
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,767
Pray that's not why she's
telling us she's married.

756
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,634
She's not ready to have a baby.

757
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:10,434
Who said anything
about having a baby?

758
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:23,634
Maybe they're waiting for us
to come to them.

759
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:27,067
No, they'll come
to us, believe me.

760
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:28,334
When they're ready,

761
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,234
they will find us and
they will talk to us.

762
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,300
We'll cry,
we'll laugh.

763
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:35,901
(both chuckle)

764
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:38,467
I hope so.

765
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,434
Okay, speaking
of laughs,

766
00:39:40,501 --> 00:39:42,868
I have something
funny to tell you.

767
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:47,067
Go ahead.
I can't wait to hear it.

768
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:50,801
Okay, remember when I
was out here last May?

769
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:52,534
Right.

770
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,100
When you were out here
last May for...

771
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,601
for the annulment?

772
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:58,667
Okay, I told you.

773
00:39:58,734 --> 00:40:00,501
I just thought it
would just be easier

774
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,334
if we backed up and
then got married.

775
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,834
Yes.

776
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,067
So you were out here
last May to get us backed up,

777
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,567
so that we can
get married again...

778
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:11,968
I scared myself, okay?

779
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:16,767
Okay, okay,
so you were out here last May.

780
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,934
This is not working out
like I planned.

781
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:23,701
First of all, you don't plan.

782
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:26,534
And secondly, what?

783
00:40:26,601 --> 00:40:28,334
What's not working out?

784
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,701
Our marriage?

785
00:40:30,767 --> 00:40:33,300
Because I love you.

786
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,534
I love being married to you.

787
00:40:39,434 --> 00:40:41,968
I love being married
to you, too.

788
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,534
I-I meant that I had planned
to tell you something.

789
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:45,667
I rehearsed it.

790
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,734
And now I can't,
I can't seem to say it.

791
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:53,167
What, you rehearse
your conversations now?

792
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:54,534
How do you do it?

793
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:57,167
How do you know what the other
person's gonna say?

794
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:59,601
I make it up!

795
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:05,234
Mm-hmm, so you rehearsed
the conversation

796
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,701
about the annulment?

797
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:10,734
'Cause I'm dying to know
what I had to say about that.

798
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,067
I knew you weren't over it.

799
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,701
No, I, I am, I am.
I'm over it.

800
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,701
It's just, you know,
how does it work?

801
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,534
I mean, it must be really
difficult not knowing

802
00:41:20,601 --> 00:41:22,067
what the other person's
gonna say, no?

803
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:25,033
I'm trying
to tell you something.

804
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,334
Okay, okay, fine, fine.

805
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,534
I am sorry.

806
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:32,601
Please, go ahead and tell me
whatever it is

807
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:33,834
you have to tell me.

808
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:37,601
Oh, no, just forget it.

809
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,334
I'll tell you later.

810
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,868
Are you sure?

811
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:49,534
Maybe you want to say it now
so you don't surprise me

812
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,634
in front
of your whole family again.

813
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:53,200
Do you know something?

814
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:57,000
Tell me.

815
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,868
Please tell me.

816
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,400
You know, don't you?!

817
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:03,133
All I know is that I love you.

818
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,901
How do you know?

819
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:06,167
Just say it!

820
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:07,634
I can't.

821
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:08,801
Why?

822
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:12,834
Because once I say it,
it'll be true.

823
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:14,834
And I want it to be true.

824
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,767
We're gonna have a baby.

825
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:28,968
Yes!

826
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,534
Oh, yes.

827
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:34,200
Oh...

828
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:39,734
 Soy una gallina loca
 embarazada.

829
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,167
(both laugh)
