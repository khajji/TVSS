1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:03,625
Aliens are all around us.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,074
This is the story of a band
of four such explorers.

3
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:10,083
In order to blend in they
have assumed human form.

4
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:12,308
This is the high commander.

5
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,779
He has assembled an elite team of experts.

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,904
A decorated military officer.

7
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,247
A seasoned intelligent specialist.

8
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,354
And...well, they had an extra seat.

9
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:25,335
They say Earth started
with just two humans.

10
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:26,979
Now there
are five billion.

11
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:29,139
Somebody needs to
turn a hose on them.

12
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,171
And the
winning lottery numbers are:

13
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:10,548
2, 21... - Uh-huh.
51...- Yes. 9, 27... and 48.

14
00:01:10,549 --> 00:01:12,737
We won again!

15
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:16,523
Ah! That was fun.

16
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,136
A dollar well spent.

17
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:22,293
If luck were money, we'd be rich.
- Yes.

18
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,700
Hey, look at them.

19
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,832
They're not kissing.
They're not groping. They're...

20
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:31,942
ooh, I know this.

21
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:34,586
Cuddling, cuddling
is interesting.

22
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,886
It's both romantic
and sexual.

23
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:39,185
Yes, but it's
more than that.

24
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,341
It implies an intimate
relationship.

25
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,545
How do you establish
that with a woman?

26
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:45,276
Why are you
looking at me?

27
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,498
Because you're the woman.
- Yeah, for two whole months,

28
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:50,850
but I haven't even figured
out how to take off my bra yet.

29
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,355
I want a hug.

30
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:55,939
I want to hug Dr. Albright.
I want to hug her right now.

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,190
She's not here.
- I'm going to have to hug somebody.

32
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:07,033
It's just not
the same with you.

33
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,014
Well my heart wasn't
in it, either.

34
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,268
I just let you do it
'cause you're high commander.

35
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,452
I feel... so cheap.

36
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,666
Dick, I can't take
this housework anymore.

37
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:33,281
I was put on this mission
because of my military skills.

38
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:34,903
These hands are
lethal weapons,

39
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,959
but now they're all red and
dry from harsh detergents.

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,213
Stop complaining. Your
assignment is to be the woman,

41
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:43,805
just like Tommy's assignment
is to study earth culture.

42
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:45,626
Right, and I'm on it.
That's why I'm reading

43
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:47,519
"Betty and veronica's
summer fun."

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,650
My god! These are
high school girls?

45
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:55,521
Okay, you guys,
I was out walking

46
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:57,507
and someone started
following me.

47
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:59,426
Oh, my god.
- He's in the living room.

48
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:02,624
You let him in our home?
- Well, yeah.

49
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,591
He might be worth studying.
Come on in!

50
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:08,734
Aw!
- Oh!

51
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,059
What a good little man.

52
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,512
Harry, that's a dog.

53
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,922
You know, you are just
so quick to label.

54
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,443
He's so huggable.
"oh mama".

55
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:30,019
I've got to get to the
office and Dr. Albright.

56
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,089
What are you going
to do?

57
00:03:33,198 --> 00:03:36,781
Well, I'm going to start,
by establishing communication.

58
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:40,101
Oh, have a seat, my friend.
There.

59
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:49,082
What's he trying to say?
- He said that lassie's a guy.

60
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:55,841
Good morning, Dr. Albright.

61
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,089
Good morning, Dr. Solomon.
I have your physics book.

62
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,406
Oh, thank you.

63
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:03,745
Oh! Please don't do that.
I'm not much of a hugger.

64
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:04,433
Oh.

65
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:08,555
Look who I found
wandering down the halls.

66
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,398
Mary.
- Oh, my god! Oh!

67
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:18,318
Oh..er...Dr Richard Solomon.

68
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,639
this is Dr. Jeff Willis,
my old dear friend.

69
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,729
Hi. Actually, Mary and I
used to share this office.

70
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,582
Among other things.
- Nina.

71
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,123
So, what brings
you to town?

72
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:31,550
A book signing.
My novel's been published.

73
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:33,553
"Echoes of my stepfather."

74
00:04:33,554 --> 00:04:34,461
Yes.

75
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:38,640
You've finally finished.
Oh, it's wonderful!

76
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,165
Oh!
- Mmm!

77
00:04:40,722 --> 00:04:42,168
Oh! I've got
to get to class.

78
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:44,665
Listen, We have got to get
together and catch up.

79
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,576
You got it.
- Call me.

80
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:48,725
Oh!
- Oh!

81
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:52,546
Oh!

82
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,204
She is something else.

83
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:01,082
Hmm, I can't believe
how good you look.

84
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,018
You still playing racquetball?
- Every day.

85
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,434
Ooh! I love it!

86
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:05,758
I love it more!

87
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,492
You don't play
racquetball.

88
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:15,949
Poor, sweet, misguided, amnesiac Nina,
of course I do.

89
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,126
I've got some time to kill.
I'd love to play.

90
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:22,064
I've got some time to play
I'd love to kill.

91
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:39,119
Can I help you?
- No, thanks. Just looking.

92
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:44,844
Hey! It says "men"
on the door.

93
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,114
And you made the cut?

94
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:47,801
Ooh, Sally.
Dick.

95
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,907
Okay, here's everything you need
to know about racquetball.

96
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,351
Oh thanks for bringing
this, lieutenant.

97
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,677
Well, I found myself starting to
talk to the scrubbing bubbles,

98
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:56,352
so I figured
I better take a walk.

99
00:05:56,353 --> 00:06:00,093
This is Newtonian physics...
trajectory and velocity.

100
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,760
An imbecilic baby
could do it.

101
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:03,880
Well, I'm off
to the games.

102
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:05,700
Play fiercely and annihilate your opponent.

103
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:07,313
As it always was
and always will be.

104
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,305
Hey...

105
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,639
it's dry already.
Put your shorts on.

106
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:22,516
I won! ..I won!

107
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,910
I won!

108
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:31,347
Did you hear the news?
I won.

109
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:35,214
Congratulations, Dick.
 - That was so easy.

110
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:37,129
You offered me
no challenge at all.

111
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:39,901
Yeah, I was kind of
off my game.

112
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,977
Off your game? You played like a little girl.

113
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:46,145
Too bad Mary wasn't
here to see it.

114
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,351
That reminds me, I gotta run.
I'm meeting her for lunch.

115
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:54,737
Well, I hope you
two girls have fun.

116
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:01,743
Why am I so hostile
to this Jeff person?

117
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:03,220
He's never done
anything to me.

118
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,515
In fact, he seems like a
perfectly tolerable... twit.

119
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:08,946
But for some reason,

120
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:12,310
I hate him just because Dr. Albright
likes him. Why?

121
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:13,809
It's called jealousy Dick.

122
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,151
It's what happens to moose
when Reggie flirts with midge.

123
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:20,860
If you'd read a little,
you'd know something about this.

124
00:07:20,861 --> 00:07:23,332
I don't have time to read.
Lieutenant, get out here.

125
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,813
I have a new assignment for you.
- Yes? Finally.

126
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,899
I want you to find out what
makes a man so irresistible,

127
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,849
that a woman has no
interest in any other man.

128
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,336
That's still a chick job.

129
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:39,746
Yes...but it's also a chick job to
help the high commander score.

130
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:44,679
You want to know about love?
I'll show you love.

131
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,602
Scruffy, come here.
Come here.

132
00:07:46,603 --> 00:07:50,387
Oh, see? He loves me for no reason.

133
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:54,594
He lives just to bask in the light
of my smile.

134
00:07:56,656 --> 00:08:00,046
And the best thing is,
we both scare the mailman.

135
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:08,912
Why can't Dr. Albright leap into my lap
and lick my face?

136
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,099
Well, some breeds are
more skittish than others.

137
00:08:20,884 --> 00:08:22,112
You two were
here last night.

138
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:27,540
Miss?

139
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:31,013
Miss!

140
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:36,459
You're obviously in some sort of
relationship. Why'd you pick this guy?

141
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,992
What's that supposed to mean?
- Hey, I'm talking to the lady.

142
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:43,121
He's not terribly attractive.
He's got bad taste in clothes.

143
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,603
Even I can tell he doesn't know what he's doing.
- I wouldn't say--

144
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:49,852
ah! It's the car,
isn't it?

145
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:51,089
No!

146
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:55,211
Yes, it's the car.

147
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,167
Thank you.

148
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,593
What are you doing?
- Tempting you with the great taste of bacon.

149
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:28,959
I'm going to take
these folders in to Nina,

150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,534
and when I come back,
you'll be gone.

151
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:36,475
Hi. Mary here?

152
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,626
Uh, no, she just
left for Cleveland.

153
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:41,145
Oh look, she's back.

154
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,631
What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to a meeting, but

155
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:46,552
I wanted to stop off
and give you a present.

156
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:48,439
Ohhhh

157
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,427
"Thanks for bugging me
to write my book."....Oh Jeff.

158
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:58,311
It's a thimble.
I collect them.

159
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,188
It's an ancient Ukrainian
quilting thimble,

160
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,781
there's some writing. I didn't
have time to get it translated.

161
00:10:03,782 --> 00:10:05,458
Well, you've been
so busy with the book.

162
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,871
Speaking of time,
don't you have a meeting?

163
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:09,367
Right.
I gotta go. Bye.

164
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:12,886
Oh!
- Ohhhhhh!

165
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:14,557
Damn,
they did it again!

166
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:15,987
Oh!

167
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,435
I'm going to have to find
someone who can translate Ukrainian.

168
00:10:20,436 --> 00:10:22,405
Ah, that's not Ukrainian.
It's Turkish.

169
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:25,127
Look, there's a
diacritical mark over the "O."

170
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,437
Well, what does it mean?

171
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:36,023
"May these always point me
toward the spoils of war".

172
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:40,851
This isn't a thimble.
It's Turkish nipple armour.

173
00:10:51,981 --> 00:10:53,598
Well, it's...very valuable

174
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:55,888
Well, especially
if you have a pair.

175
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:01,287
Ohhhh...... Don't tell Jeff.

176
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:04,495
This will be our secret.
- Yes, our secret.

177
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:07,353
It will be something
Jeff will never have.

178
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:10,641
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

179
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:13,091
This must have been
very expensive.

180
00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:14,697
Oh, so you like
expensive things?

181
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:19,716
No.......Some of my favorite things
in life cost nothing..

182
00:11:20,506 --> 00:11:21,859
a picnic on a sunny day,

183
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:24,507
a lovely poem
read aloud,

184
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:26,449
watching my friends fail.

185
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,690
Well, I have
a marvelous idea.

186
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:30,622
I'll write a poem about
your friends failing,

187
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,695
and read it to you aloud on a sunny picnic.

188
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,451
That sounds wonderful.
- How about Saturday afternoon?

189
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,948
Why not?

190
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,134
I have a date.

191
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,722
Jeff doesn't
have a date...

192
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,557
but I have a date.

193
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,115
Yes!

194
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,083
"Women who run
with the wolves,"

195
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,819
"women who love too much,"
"women who love too fast,"

196
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,619
"women who love to read about
women who love too much and too fast."

197
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:05,886
Oh, my god.

198
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:13,206
Excuse me.

199
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:17,621
You two have been
together, what, 100, 150 years?

200
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:20,492
42 this April.

201
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:22,926
42 years.
Impressive.

202
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,794
You must have known he was
something really special, huh?

203
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,579
Tell me, why'd you pick him?

204
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:33,902
Well, he was very sweet,....
and affectionate.

205
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:37,609
He had a real flair
for romance.

206
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,223
It was the car,
wasn't it?

207
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,218
That was the clincher.

208
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:50,377
Oh finally. Did you get 'em?
- Yes.

209
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,860
Permission to speak freely, sir?
- Yeah, sure.

210
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:54,785
You and I have flown
a lot of missions together.

211
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,618
If you asked me to put out
the sun with my bare hands,

212
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,199
I would,
no questions asked.

213
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,855
But if you ever send me out
in broad daylight

214
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,549
to pick up a bunch of
women's magazines again,

215
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,822
I will kill you.

216
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:06,711
This may sound
silly to you,

217
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:08,399
but I have a date
with Dr. Albright,

218
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,987
and I want to be sure to say the
right thing. Now help me out here.

219
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:13,514
Dick, they're pointless.
They're mind-altering.

220
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:15,533
They impose arbitrary
standards on women.

221
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:18,309
It's like propaganda for
some sort of estrogen cult.

222
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:20,838
Just read.

223
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:22,230
Okay.

224
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:27,963
Okay, here's a topic.
You could discuss biology.

225
00:13:27,964 --> 00:13:29,903
Why?
- According to a recent survey,

226
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,878
7 out of 10 women
have multiple organisms.

227
00:13:36,322 --> 00:13:39,720
You have to.
- Harry: no, you're not the boss of me.

228
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:42,269
You have to.
Check to the lease.

229
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,482
What's the problem?
- Mrs. Dubcek doesn't like scruffy.

230
00:13:45,483 --> 00:13:47,175
The lease says no pets.

231
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:51,461
But he's so cute. - No! I'm allergic
to dogs.

232
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,930
My throat closes off
and I can't breathe.

233
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,742
But he's so cute.
- No! I can't breathe.

234
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:59,448
No, no. Sorry. 
No, the pooch cannot stay.

235
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,177
But he's so cute!
- Noooo !

236
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:05,905
That's too bad, Harry.

237
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:07,986
I guess you know
what you have to do.

238
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,861
Yes, scruffy and I
must kill Mrs. Dubcek...

239
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:17,879
and hide her body
under the floorboards.

240
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:33,907
Wh...what are you doing here?
- We're going on our picnic.

241
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,920
Didn't you get my message?
- No. Why?

242
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:39,349
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I had to cancel.

243
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,187
Cancel?
- Well, it's Jeff's book signing party.

244
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:46,146
But you don't understand.
I beat him in racquetball.

245
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:50,403
I can't miss it. He
dedicated his novel to me.

246
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,580
Oh, no, you
can't miss that.

247
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,571
Why don't you come?

248
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:58,013
Come?  oh no, I've got
things to do.

249
00:14:58,014 --> 00:15:00,737
I have to take my black
forest ham, my wheel of Brie,

250
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:03,335
my Cabernet sauvignon,
my Limoges trivet,

251
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,178
throw them in the front
yard and set them ablaze

252
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,143
in a big bonfire
as a tribute

253
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:09,738
to Jeff's book signing!

254
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,084
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Jeff Willis.

255
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,287
He's with his publicist.
He'll be out shortly.

256
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:26,886
Are you a friend?

257
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:29,740
Ah Yes. I'm very close
to the steaming pustule.

258
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:34,987
Harry, I've solved
your problem.

259
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:37,508
This young lady needs
a dog for her little girl.

260
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:40,501
Oh, he's perfect.

261
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:43,961
hmm, no.  Scruffy's not about
to ruin his life,

262
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:46,686
by running off with some
blonde he met at a cocktail party.

263
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:57,032
The man of the hour.

264
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,958
Oh, god.
- You think you're pretty clever, don't you?

265
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,262
I happen to know that
every word in your book

266
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,421
was published years ago!

267
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,691
Perhaps you've read
the dictionary.

268
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,138
You invited me.
This is your fault.

269
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:18,594
Jeff Willis,

270
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:22,035
I challenge you for the
hand of the woman we both love!

271
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:24,704
Emily, I knew you
were cheating on me.

272
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:26,632
No. He's lying,
I swear.

273
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:28,435
You love her?
- My own wife?

274
00:16:28,436 --> 00:16:31,549
So you love her?
- I've never seen this man before in my life.

275
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,967
Lay off her, Jeff. I'm the one that's
been sleeping with your wife, Okay?

276
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:37,050
My own brother?

277
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:39,393
One answer, and I'll get
out of your way. You love her?

278
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:42,507
And you know what?
The sex is great.

279
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,531
You satanic bastard.

280
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,234
You fraud!

281
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:53,715
 What an interesting family.
- Look what you've done.

282
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,419
This is very hard
for you, isn't it?

283
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:11,869
It's the hardest thing
I've had to do

284
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,197
in my entire time
on this planet.

285
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,458
Scruffy, come here.

286
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:23,404
You're getting
on my nerves, mutt.

287
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:25,308
So take a hike.

288
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,014
Go with the kid.

289
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:33,248
I'm bad news, junior.
I'm trouble, I tell ya.

290
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:35,524
Just go!

291
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:38,997
Oh.
Who am I kidding?

292
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:42,467
Well, would you like to walk
him over to our place?

293
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,579
Oh, sure.

294
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,505
Harry, you can come over

295
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,514
and play with scruffy
anytime you want to.

296
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:50,809
Really?
- Yeah, we'd love it.

297
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:53,031
After my ex-husband,

298
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:55,948
it's a pleasure to meet a man
who's so caring.

299
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:58,238
Oh.

300
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:11,463
Jeff's brother needs his jaw wired,
I hope you're proud of yourself.

301
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:14,804
You're mad at me.
That's fine, I'm mad at you.

302
00:18:16,286 --> 00:18:17,720
Why are you mad at me?

303
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,351
You're the expert.
You tell me.

304
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,374
Dr. Solomon, what do
you want from me?

305
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,879
I want...

306
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:27,733
I want to be
your boyfriend.

307
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:32,525
Oh.
- Are you surprised?

308
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:36,322
To be honest....not really.

309
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,876
Well, then what's
the problem?

310
00:18:41,699 --> 00:18:45,928
Well...honestly, there's
something about you..

311
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:48,276
that... seems odd.

312
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:51,807
It's as if you were out of sync
with every other person on the planet.

313
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:54,131
How can that be? Every day
I go out of my way to do things

314
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,288
that appear normal.

315
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:59,150
What you just said,
that's not normal.

316
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:01,760
What else?
- Well, you...

317
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:04,739
you act as if you're feeling
everything for the first time.

318
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,317
You have no control
over your emotions.

319
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:10,081
You tried to feed me
doggy treats.

320
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:13,012
And?

321
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,537
You're moving
way too fast.

322
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:19,238
Whatever is going
to happen between us,

323
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,013
let's let it
evolve naturally.

324
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:23,559
All right, I can
go along with that.

325
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,525
Good.
- Why don't we shake on it?

326
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:30,115
Why don't we hug on it?
- No, that's too..

327
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,830
Dr. Albright, please?

328
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,069
You don't know how
important this hug is to me.

329
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,518
It would give my life a degree of
meaning that I've only dreamed of.

330
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:42,707
All right.

331
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,803
No, I can't hug
under this pressure.

332
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:49,871
Try.

333
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:01,502
There.

334
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,288
That's all
I was asking for.

335
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,086
I want to have
your baby.

336
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,290
You know, jealousy
defies all logic.

337
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,799
Jeff's a nice person.

338
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,122
Dr. Albright's
a nice person.

339
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:22,382
But... the thought
of them being

340
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:24,518
happy together
just made me crazy.

341
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,796
You think that's bad?

342
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:29,394
Clark Kent gets jealous
because Lois lane likes superman.

343
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,936
Now, that is crazy.

344
00:20:32,707 --> 00:20:35,414
Dick, you know,
I finally figured out

345
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,229
what women really
want in a man.

346
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,774
They want him to drive
a big, powerful vehicle.

347
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,379
You're saying I should
be a bus driver?

348
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:46,798
Hey, you'll be beating
them off with a stick.

349
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,605
Dick, if you want to know how to
get what you want from the ladies,

350
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:52,867
the answer is simple.
- What?

351
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:54,675
Get a dog.

352
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:58,028
Wait--
- Harry, you didn't--?

353
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,498
No.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
