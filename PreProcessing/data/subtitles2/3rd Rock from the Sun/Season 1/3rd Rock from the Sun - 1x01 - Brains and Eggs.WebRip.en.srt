1
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:28,141
Alright!, We're still
taking calls on those Ufo sightings.

2
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:29,397
I'm on the line
with Jennifer

3
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:31,640
who claims to have
actually met aliens.

4
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:35,565
Gary, I have been sucked
up by alien spacecraft many times,

5
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:37,866
Uh-oh.
- and I can tell you they are among us.

6
00:00:38,117 --> 00:00:40,175
Really? Now, what
do you suppose they want?

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,006
Well, they want my eggs...
- Uh-huh.

8
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:44,414
...to start their own
alien race.

9
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:46,615
Whoa, thanks for
calling. Hello. You're on the air.

10
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:48,835
er.. yea.. I saw four aliens in a car.

11
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:51,436
err.. I think it was a Rambler.
- Whoa, stylish.

12
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,830
Everyone fully formed?
- uh-huh.

13
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,831
Everyone got 10 fingers and 11 toes?

14
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:00,069
Yeah

15
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:03,208
Good. I guess we're in.
Everyone comfortable?

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,618
Ermm.. I have three holes
in my face.

17
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,585
Can anyone get your head
to swivel to the rear?

18
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:15,731
"no" Then how are you
supposed to lick your back?

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,028
Maybe you do what
they're doing?

20
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:23,390
Look. Life-forms, and
they're cleaning each other.

21
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:25,994
awww

22
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:28,395
Look at us.

23
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:30,551
I can't believe
we look like them.

24
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:34,895
ah ha ha ha... ha ha ha ha ha ha
he he he heee eeeee

25
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:37,771
Is anybody else sweating
under their breasts?

26
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:42,818
No... In fact,
I don't have any.

27
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:44,301
I have tiny ones.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,272
Quick, look.

29
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:52,645
That woman is going
to drive with her feet.

30
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:55,756
Don't you people
have a home?

31
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:58,881
aah, no, we don't,
but thank you for the idea.

32
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:03,719
See? She called
us people.

33
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,019
Listen.

34
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:13,684
It's that signal they
keep sending into space.

35
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:26,923
Our home for this mission
is Earth, a third-rate planet.

36
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:29,420
I got a teaching job
at a third-rate university.

37
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:31,274
Now we're looking
at a third-floor apartment.

38
00:02:31,738 --> 00:02:32,876
Yeah.. Come on in.

39
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:37,154
It's the attic, so it's kind
of small, but it's furnished.

40
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:39,874
We love it.
- Yeah, it's so much bigger than a car.

41
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:41,428
Yeah.
We'll take it.

42
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:45,206
You know... this used to be the rumpus
room back in the '60s.

43
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:48,738
This carpet has seen more
butts than Santa Claus's lap.

44
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:54,057
Ooh! What is
this stuff?

45
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:56,129
This sweater?
It's angora.

46
00:02:56,632 --> 00:03:01,362
Well, it's wonderful. I've
never seen anything like it... oooohh

47
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:02,574
I like the color.

48
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,752
Well, it's very nice.

49
00:03:04,712 --> 00:03:06,439
You're not from
around here, are you?

50
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:10,554
Well, Mrs. Dubcek, I can stand
here and chew your fat day all day,...

51
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:12,778
...but time has no manners.
Bye, now.

52
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,266
Sally, I want you
to observe her.

53
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,505
Find out what women
on this planet do.

54
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:21,259
Well.. why can't Harry do it?
- Because you're the woman.

55
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:24,063
That brings up a very good
question: why am I the woman?

56
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,077
Because you lost.

57
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:30,317
Dick?

58
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,225
I can't see
through my eyelids.

59
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:36,864
Open them!

60
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,765
Ooooh... they're manual.

61
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:49,465
Oh, good.
You're here.

62
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,427
Did you copy the mainframe
in the library?

63
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,668
ahmm.. I got a little
distracted.

64
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,263
Again? What happened?Well.. I was
watching these women play volleyball,

65
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:01,502
...and they were all jumping up and down,..

66
00:04:01,582 --> 00:04:04,006
...up... and down.. in these little shorts.

67
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,549
And some can't jump as high
as the others, but it's okay.

68
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:09,575
It's more than okay.
It's really okay. I mean-

69
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,990
what is wrong with you?
- I don't know.

70
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:15,642
We can't leave
without that information.

71
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:17,717
.. so access the mainframe,
enter the net, download,

72
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:19,758
and then go straight home
as soon as you're finished.

73
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:22,990
<i>Why are you talking to me like I'm a child?
- You are a child.</i>

74
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:25,853
I'm older than you.
- Well, now I'm bigger,

75
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,418
and on this planet
size matters.

76
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,308
Good morning, Dr. Solomon.
- Ah, Nina.

77
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:35,160
Here's your mail. This is nothing. Nothing.

78
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,903
This is something, but
there's nothing you can do about it.

79
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:41,076
This is an invitation to a party at
the Dean's house. This is nothing.

80
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,598
And if you don't stop staring at
whatever it is you're watching,

81
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:44,558
you're gonna lose
something.

82
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,839
Tommy's just on his way to
the library. Aren't you, Tommy?

83
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,439
Uh, yeah, I am now.

84
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,429
I have to go look up
the word "throb. "

85
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,241
He's older
than he looks.

86
00:04:57,992 --> 00:04:59,789
Well... I have to file
some things for you.

87
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,093
What is that?

88
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,578
It's you!
You smell so nice.

89
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,082
Thanks I try.

90
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,700
That had better be
your nose.

91
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,515
Is your wife
out of town?

92
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,765
err.. Mrs. Solomon is
no longer with us.

93
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:23,581
She, uh... burned up
on re-entry.

94
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,540
I had a boyfriend who
used to burn up on re-entry.

95
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,446
He walks with a limp now.

96
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:34,110
Good morning, Dr. Albright.
Good morning Nina.

97
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,856
Good morning, Dr. Albright.
- Nina, would you tell Dr. Solomon

98
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,790
He parked in my space again.

99
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:41,865
You parked in her space-
- I know. It was empty.

100
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,968
Would you tell him I'm
going to have him towed?

101
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,501
Tell her I already have all the
toes I need. I am fully formed.

102
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:49,857
<i>That's my parking space.</i>

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,783
I had to park a mile away.

104
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,835
Oh, so you have a car.

105
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:58,014
Ah!.. Nina, go to the chem lab.
Tell them I sent you.

106
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:00,736
Get a pipe bomb, put it in Dr.
Solomon's car and blow it up.

107
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,378
For future reference,
I have a red Volvo.

108
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,198
Please, Dr. Albright!

109
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,117
We barely know
each other.

110
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:18,456
Dr. Solomon,
we should get along.

111
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,802
I'm very intelligent. You
have an impressive résumé.

112
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,350
I am the high commander.

113
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:26,021
I must admit,
when I first met you

114
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:29,087
I was attracted to your
flamboyant nature and big head.

115
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,705
Thanks, because I almost
went with a smaller one.

116
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,170
Even though I am
drawn to genius,

117
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:36,779
this is a small office

118
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:39,298
and you are behaving
like a big hose monkey.

119
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:40,908
You're not so bad
yourself, woman.

120
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:42,939
Knock it off.

121
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,516
What is my thesis
doing out of my desk?

122
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,422
Ooh.. I took it out.
- My desk was locked.

123
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,279
Which made it
very difficult to open.

124
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,382
You might want to make
a note of that.

125
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,606
You read it?
- Read it?, I memorized it.

126
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:00,181
Well, it's just
a few thoughts.

127
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,912
A few brilliant thoughts.
- Really?

128
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:06,053
That's quite a compliment coming
from someone with your credentials.

129
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,084
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Enjoyed it?

130
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,029
It's the funniest thing
I've ever read.

131
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:13,712
Your theory on "man
and the animal within,"

132
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:15,032
.. it's hilarious!

133
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:17,522
Nina said you had
no sense of humor.

134
00:07:17,557 --> 00:07:19,150
She is so wrong.

135
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:20,964
The conclusions
that you draw

136
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,455
are laugh-out-loud funny.

137
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:24,865
I see.

138
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,844
Dr. Solomon, you
have crossed a line.

139
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,443
You have belittled
my work,

140
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:31,652
and you hurt my feelings.

141
00:07:32,648 --> 00:07:33,932
I don't like you.

142
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,902
I don't understand.
- Of course you don't. You're a man.

143
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:41,802
Ha!... That's where you're wrong!

144
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,618
Okay, so meatloaf
is bread crumbs,

145
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:51,854
- spices and ground beef?
- That's it.

146
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,543
and ground beef is essentially
nothing more than a cow?- Yeah.

147
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,328
Well, doesn't it scream when
they stuff it in the grinder?

148
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,852
Oh, no. That sucker's
been dead for hours.

149
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,891
I have dead cow
on my hands?

150
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,223
AAAAaaaaahhhhhh!

151
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:14,793
Women?

152
00:08:16,368 --> 00:08:19,366
You can't live with them,
and yet, they're everywhere.

153
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:23,551
So "p" itself
is always even.

154
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,696
And we can write
"p" equals 2s,

155
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,771
where "s" is
some other integer.

156
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,974
Substituting "p," we find
"p" to the second power

157
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,694
equals 2s to the second power,
equals 4s to the second power,

158
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,822
equals 2 Q to the second power,

159
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,590
And we find? Who can tell me? Anyone?

160
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,622
Okay, I'm getting
ahead of everyone.

161
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:46,317
Let's simplify. How far away is Cleveland?
- 52 miles.

162
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:48,456
Someone give me another answer.
- An hour away.

163
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:51,344
Cleveland is an hour away.
Someone give me another answer.

164
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:54,069
A $9 bus ticket.
- Cleveland is $9 away.

165
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,270
Oh! a felony charge. The
federal courthouse is there.

166
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:59,760
Yes! Cleveland is
a felonious assault away.

167
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:00,879
Someone else.
Yes, Leon.

168
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,052
<i>Well, come on, Leon.
Speak up.</i>

169
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:06,046
No, never mind. I had
this idea, but it's wrong.

170
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,419
oh Leon, of course
it's wrong.

171
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:12,885
I mean, the odds against
your being right are...

172
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,128
staggering!

173
00:09:15,283 --> 00:09:17,364
You have a great advantage.
You know the outcome.

174
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,398
You will be wrong.
Don't fear it.

175
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,996
Embrace your wrongness.

176
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:23,550
Leon, how far away
is Cleveland?

177
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:26,047
Cleveland is
an eternity away

178
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,032
if your heart
is there.

179
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,291
Leon, that is
so provocative.

180
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:34,232
Where Cleveland
equals "p"

181
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,787
and eternity equals "q,"

182
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:37,753
transposing the logarithm
of the heart,

183
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,640
where the heart
is an unknown,

184
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:41,492
we find that
we are forever

185
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:43,376
<i>in Cleveland.</i>

186
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,811
No, I'm sorry, Leon.
You're wrong.

187
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:50,458
Yes, Caryn.

188
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:51,680
Dr Solomon I think that Leon meant

189
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:55,252
that Cleveland can "feel"
like an eternity away.

190
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,665
Oh, it's a "feeling".

191
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,055
Yes, I know all
about "feelings".

192
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,356
Everything's
just going fine,

193
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:09,947
and somebody has
a "feeling",

194
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,569
and "kaboom"!

195
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:13,219
Suddenly they
don't like you.

196
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,430
I think we can all do
without feelings. Who's with me?

197
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:18,616
Your grade depends on it.

198
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:21,678
Dr Solomon?

199
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:24,692
I hope this doesn't affect my
grade, but I have a thought.

200
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,048
Yes?
- You have to have feelings.

201
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,513
Feelings are like the core
of the human experience.

202
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:31,954
The core of
the human experience?

203
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,249
Of course. I never
thought of that.

204
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,218
ohh.. er.. tomorrow, I want you all

205
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:40,669
to write a paper for me
about "feelings".

206
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:42,487
Tell me how it
"feels" to use

207
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,064
only 10% of your brain.

208
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:47,816
Ooooh, everyone was awake.

209
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:51,482
Nina, where is Dr. Albright?
I have to talk to her.

210
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,403
She's gone for the day, but she'll be
at the Dean's faculty party tonight.

211
00:10:54,438 --> 00:10:56,550
Right, Dean Sumner's party.
Tell him I'll be there.

212
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,662
Ooo, I'll drop everything
and do that right now.

213
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,591
I'm not sure how to get there.
- I can pick you up.

214
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:03,935
That won't hurt
your back?

215
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,521
I'll be in a car.

216
00:11:08,677 --> 00:11:10,495
Oh good. Come by
and blow the horn.

217
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:11,918
I love to hear
people honk.

218
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:14,760
What, are you
from mars?

219
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:16,187
Mars?

220
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:18,535
Oh no.

221
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:22,422
A hahahaha

222
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:39,567
Hi!

223
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:41,789
Hi

224
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:45,181
You're on the volleyball team, aren't you?
- Yeah, I am.

225
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,556
I watched you jump up
and down this afternoon.

226
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:52,181
You're really good.
- Thanks. We won.

227
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,806
arrr... it's a game.

228
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:56,708
Um, anyway, my name's-

229
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,307
can I talk to you?
- Come on, man.

230
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:01,790
May I remind you that
we are not to alter

231
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:04,330
the lives of the inhabitants
of this planet in any way?

232
00:12:04,507 --> 00:12:06,738
Yeah, but some of them
are just asking for it.

233
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,388
Pull it together. I'm extending
our mission for one more night.

234
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:11,761
Why?

235
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,875
I have faculty obligations.

236
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:18,485
Don't do this to me. I
never sleep. I'm exhausted.

237
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:21,605
Besides, you don't have the
authority to alter the schedule.

238
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,396
Of course I do I'm in command.
- Yeah? Well, I'm in puberty, pal.

239
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,928
I don't care what you say.
It can't be that bad.

240
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,517
I could pop
at any minute.

241
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:37,573
Aren't you exaggerating
just a little?

242
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:40,069
Give me your mind for just a second.
- oh Please.

243
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:41,558
Come on.
Just give me your mind.

244
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:48,917
Oh! That's disgusting!
- I know.

245
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:50,838
You think like that?
- All the time.

246
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:52,980
We've gotta get you
out of here.

247
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,237
Dick, what are you doing?
- I'm unpacking.

248
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:00,434
I've changed my mind. We're
going to stay a little longer.

249
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,249
I'm a dead man.

250
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:05,495
O.. whoa wo wo wo that's mine!

251
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,148
Be careful.
It's, uh...

252
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:08,680
.. very valuable.

253
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,837
You know, I have
an urge to hold that.

254
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:16,134
That's exactly what it's for.
- May I?

255
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:17,135
Please

256
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,184
I find this very satisfying.
- I know.

257
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,380
I like this.
- I know.

258
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:27,158
I wonder what Dr. Albright
is doing right now.

259
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:30,053
come on... let's break it up here.

260
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:32,722
ohh.. I will be so glad
to get out of this body.

261
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,054
What are you doing?
- I'm unpacking.

262
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:38,383
The commander wants to stay a little
while longer. What for?

263
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:40,497
Because we
can't leave yet.

264
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,812
Did you know that our bodies
can produce feelings?

265
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,882
I got a whole lot of them
from Dr. Albright this afternoon.

266
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:48,918
Really?
- Yes. And I'm going to a party

267
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,614
to see if I can get
a little tonight.

268
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,473
oh, Dick, no.

269
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,241
I'm telling you, it's
a crime against science...

270
00:13:56,242 --> 00:13:58,381
.. not to experiment
with ourselves.

271
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,381
Well wh... Couldn't we just conduct
these experiments

272
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,895
in the privacy
of our own home?

273
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:04,739
I mean... what can she do that I can't?
- Lieutenant.

274
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,816
What?
- permission to speak freely?

275
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,175
Permission granted.
- Sir,

276
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,254
would you jump up
and down for us?

277
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,882
Oh, yeah, and put
your hands

278
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,701
back behind
your head like this.

279
00:14:15,991 --> 00:14:18,691
I will not.
- Please, for science, truly.

280
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,154
No. It's not that
I don't want to help.

281
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,718
It's just that I don't know
how comfortable we would feel

282
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:27,797
working together after
an experiment like that.

283
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,504
It'll be fine.
- Go ahead. Do it.

284
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:32,592
In your dreams!
- Every night.

285
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:35,876
Absolutely not.
- Okay, fine.

286
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,597
You leave me no other choice. Now
we have to experiment at a party.

287
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,460
Dick, Listen to me. Women are
trouble. I should know.

288
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:45,890
I've been one for two weeks.
- I know.

289
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,349
Which brings up
another point.

290
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,273
I command you to shave
under your arms.

291
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:52,866
Doable.

292
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm sorry you find me
so offensive.

293
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,220
Damn it, pull yourself together, man!

294
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,117
We're going out.
- Okay.

295
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:04,661
Okay. Give me an hour.
- An hour?

296
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:06,972
Yeah. I gotta
rotate these.

297
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,234
It's a party.

298
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:18,151
Dr. Solomon,
how nice to see you.

299
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:20,758
Good evening, Mrs. Sumner.
- Won't you come in?

300
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:21,975
If you'll back up.

301
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:27,068
Please forgive Sally.
She's not from Ohio.

302
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:29,272
Ooh, I love where
you've put these walls.

303
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,188
err

304
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:31,832
May I take your coat?

305
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,460
If I can keep my pants.

306
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:40,288
Harry, listen, I want you to keep an
eye on this Albright experiment.

307
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,796
Yeah, sure.
What are these?

308
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:45,315
Crustaceans. I mean, Dick is
endangering this entire mission.

309
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:48,140
Mm-hmm, alright. And these?
- err.. Unborn fowl.

310
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,854
I'm beginning to question
his ability to command.

311
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:52,901
Yeah, too bad.
And these are?

312
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,646
Cocktail weenies.
- Cocktail weenies.

313
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,801
So okay... I've seen these before.
They should be bigger.

314
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:00,420
Nina, right?

315
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,986
Oh, hi, Sally.
Nice dress.

316
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,933
Mm thanks... It's just something I threw on.

317
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,271
Yeah, boy, you
almost missed.

318
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:14,171
Uh, hello. Here I am.
- Yes, there you are.

319
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,302
Dr. Albright, I've been thinking
about us all day. I haven't.

320
00:16:17,724 --> 00:16:19,141
I want to try again.

321
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:24,755
I.. want very much to feel,
and I want even more,to be felt,

322
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:27,439
and I mean that from
the heart of my bottom.

323
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:30,162
Well, yours up.

324
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:32,880
No, I wouldn't do that.

325
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,224
I mean-
I.. I'm new at this.

326
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:40,022
You see, I've been
getting a feeling,

327
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:41,637
and I'm trying
to identify it.

328
00:16:41,926 --> 00:16:43,533
Rub it.
Maybe it'll go away.

329
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:47,162
I just want to make it
feel better.

330
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:50,255
Well, you could start
by saying "I'm sorry. "

331
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,600
Okay, I'm sorry.
- You could say it as if you meant it.

332
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,325
Oh, of course.

333
00:16:57,372 --> 00:17:00,103
Dr. Albright,
I'm very sorry.

334
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:01,846
Thank you.

335
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:04,117
oh.. that felt great.

336
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:06,185
eh er.. let's do it again.

337
00:17:07,674 --> 00:17:10,506
Dr. Albright,
I'm very sorry.

338
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:12,937
Ohh!

339
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:16,073
Ooh! Ohhhh!

340
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,428
Get away from me!
- What did I not do right?

341
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:20,921
Go away!
- I don't understand!

342
00:17:25,506 --> 00:17:27,997
Hey!, what do you think? They
seem to have greater power

343
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:30,222
when they collide.
I'm not wrong, am I?

344
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,093
Sally, will you excuse us
for a moment?

345
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:36,380
Come on, girls. let's go.

346
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,229
What do you want?

347
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:44,025
Dr Albright, I have a
scientific proposition.

348
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,370
I have hidden a hundred dollar
bill somewhere on my body...

349
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,371
.. find it and it's yours.

350
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:50,945
You're unbelievable.

351
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:51,904
I'll give you a hint.

352
00:17:51,997 --> 00:17:53,281
It's not in a pocket.

353
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,036
Aren't you even going to try?

354
00:17:57,644 --> 00:18:01,693
You're coming on to me.
- I have no idea what that means.

355
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,864
It's all right.
It's in my thesis.

356
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:06,001
It's a basic
animal attraction.

357
00:18:06,307 --> 00:18:07,943
We all have
the animal within.

358
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,190
Some are one swing
closer to the tree.

359
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,872
I've see you preen and
strut around the office.

360
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:20,216
I admit...

361
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,066
I like it.

362
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:27,210
Are you planning to do
something important

363
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,699
with your mouth tonight?

364
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:30,957
Because you've
painted it bright red.

365
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:32,747
This always happens.

366
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,176
Dr. Erdman had
a thing for me.

367
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:37,665
Dr. Wallach, Dr. Zucker,
Dr. Thomas,

368
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:41,236
oh.. the guy from Cornell who was
here for a week. oh, that was insane.

369
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:42,486
E- excuse me.

370
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,784
I have a sudden urge
to clean you.

371
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,314
Oh!

372
00:18:58,162 --> 00:18:58,890
Ooh!

373
00:18:58,891 --> 00:18:59,791
Ahhh!

374
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,704
Oh, Dr. Albright.

375
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,652
I was just
thinking of you.

376
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,985
Thanks for
the weenies.

377
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:28,036
oh.. good night, Dr. Solomon.
Thank you so much for coming.

378
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:28,981
Good night.

379
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:50,430
what a terrific evening.

380
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:53,042
I just had a great time.
Didn't you?

381
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:54,843
Whatever.

382
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:58,223
I think this is the most
incredible place we've ever been.

383
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:01,114
The people are
so... complex.

384
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:04,357
I love them. I just think they're wonderful.

385
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,483
You probed her,
didn't you?

386
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,521
I might have scanned
for a little.

387
00:20:11,681 --> 00:20:14,741
I think we've
underestimated the life on this planet.

388
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,501
The people have
so much courage.

389
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:20,372
Here they are, hurling
through space on a molten rock

390
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:22,577
at 67,000 miles
an hour,

391
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,918
and the only thing that keeps them
from flying out of their shoes is...

392
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:27,424
their misplaced faith
in gravity.

393
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:30,172
I'm so glad we're staying.

394
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,992
I want to find out
what else they know,

395
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,596
what makes them happy,
how they raise their young,

396
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,443
what happens
when they die,

397
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,280
why they call themselves
the human race.

398
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:42,439
Do they think
someone's going to win?

399
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:47,055
Ooh, look,
a shooting star.

400
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,869
I think this is going to
be our greatest mission.

401
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,234
Yeah, he probed her,
all right.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
