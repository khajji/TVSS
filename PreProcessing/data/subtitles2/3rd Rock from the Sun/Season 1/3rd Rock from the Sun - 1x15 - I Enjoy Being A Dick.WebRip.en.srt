1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:03,666
Sally, where's
my breakfast?

2
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:06,534
I haven't had anything to eat since
that bottle of ketchup you fixed me,

3
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:08,351
Not that it
wasn't delicious.

4
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:10,527
Yeah, yeah,
keep your pants on.

5
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:13,826
Now, I just can't get
ready as fast as you guys.

6
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:17,605
Every morning I have
to wash, dry, pluck,

7
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:20,556
powder, dab, cleanse,
deep cleanse,

8
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:22,484
exfoliate, pop,

9
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:24,651
curl, blow, and buff.

10
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:27,064
Well, that's
far too complicated.

11
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:28,945
I usually just
rinse, spit,

12
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,109
unzip the parka,
and voilà.

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,909
Sally, where's
my breakfast?

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,408
I'm working on it.

15
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:37,595
Harry, what are you doing
on the floor?

16
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,330
I have no idea.

17
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,359
But what is noble in a
universe where entropy grips us

18
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:45,070
in a fatal dance
of nihilistic despair?

19
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:48,049
Why is he talking like this?
- I don't know. All I did was this.

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,841
Give me this. If he's broken,
it's going right into the report.

21
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:54,748
I wrote me a little song yesterday
, and it goes something like this:

22
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:57,617
'hi-Dee hi hi-Dee ho, hi
-Dee hi-Dee, hi-Dee, ho'

23
00:00:57,618 --> 00:00:58,707
what's with Harry?
- I don't know.

24
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,418
He seems to be having a
reaction to a crushing skull blow.

25
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:03,929
What, with this?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:06,731
Be careful. We could actually hurt Harry.

27
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:08,593
Now, liberals want
you to believe

28
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:11,035
that more government is
gonna solve your problems..

29
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:13,342
hey.
- I'm sorry.

30
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:14,858
I couldn't live
with that.

31
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:56,971
Hurry, hurry!
- I'm coming, I'm coming

32
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,542
Stop it, already.
- What took you so long?

33
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,276
Her pants are tight.
She can't go too fast.

34
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:04,004
What is the big emergency?
- Look, it's just awful.

35
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,910
I don't see anything.
- It's the dishes.

36
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,071
They're dirty,
and we need a plate.

37
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,992
Don't you boys know
how to wash a dish?

38
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:14,251
Of course not, that's Sally's job.
- That and killing spiders.

39
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:16,587
Please.
- we wouldn't ask you,

40
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:18,342
except Sally's
mysteriously absent,

41
00:02:18,343 --> 00:02:20,720
and without a clean plate
we could starve!

42
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:23,888
Dick! Dick,
come in here!

43
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,230
Here she is.

44
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:29,844
You guys are not going to
believe all the cute stuff I got today.

45
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,752
Everything came together
like a well-oiled pistol.

46
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,198
I've got
the last pair

47
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,821
of size eight ferragamo
slingbacks on layaway.

48
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,379
I need 300 bucks.
- Why?

49
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,117
Because without the shoes,
the belt is a joke.

50
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,929
Lieutenant, we seem to be
having a breakdown in communication

51
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,198
because I have no idea
what you're talking about.

52
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,923
Of course you don't. It's about women.
- Ah, the women's issue.

53
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:56,347
Maybe if you would explain
it to me, I would understand.

54
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:58,599
I've been explaining it
to you since we got here.

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,724
One thing
I do understand:

56
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:03,050
this female obsession of
yours is costing me a fortune.

57
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,026
spider!

58
00:03:09,342 --> 00:03:10,999
All right, fine,
high commander.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,807
Take it all back to the store
and get your money back.

60
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:14,477
I'm going to get a job
and make my own money.

61
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:17,206
I am sick and tired of
having to justify myself to you

62
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:19,019
every time something
pretty goes on sale.

63
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,666
Come on, Harry, you're going to get a job, too.
- I am?

64
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:25,478
Yes, I will not go
unaccessorised.

65
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:29,448
I had that dream again last night.
- Which one?

66
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,977
The one where I'm riding a
tractor and smoking a big cigar.

67
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,968
Oh, you're ovulating.

68
00:03:38,901 --> 00:03:41,111
What?
What are you laughing at?

69
00:03:41,507 --> 00:03:43,750
Girl talk.
- Girl talk?

70
00:03:44,055 --> 00:03:45,792
I'm sorry,
did that sound sexist?

71
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,466
No, sexist would be if you
told me I had a tight butt,

72
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,267
then said if I didn't go to
bed with you, I'd be fired.

73
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,688
Dr Solomon I really don't think
you'd understand

74
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,951
what we were
talking about.

75
00:03:56,952 --> 00:03:58,977
I know what this is..
me man,

76
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:02,525
me too thick
to grasp girl talk.

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,818
Nina, are you going to that
lecture series on Thursday?

78
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,696
Dr. Natalie Blumfeld is speaking.
- Yes.

79
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:09,614
It sounds wonderful.
Can I come, too?

80
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,353
It's really not
for you.

81
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:14,777
It's a place where we can
open up and share our feelings.

82
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,107
I have feelings.

83
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:18,839
It's a women's
study group.

84
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,864
I'll take notes.
Please, let me come.

85
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:23,860
Does everything
have to involve you?

86
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:26,166
In a perfect world, yes.

87
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:28,503
I'll be very quiet.

88
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:30,493
You won't even know
I'm there.

89
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:32,901
I think a man's presence
would be inhibiting.

90
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:35,556
I said you won't
even know I'm there!

91
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:38,492
Don't take this
personally.

92
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:42,102
It's not as if we were
deliberately trying to exclude you.

93
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:43,986
You want to have lunch now?
- Sure.

94
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:45,295
I'd love to.

95
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,929
Fine!

96
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,406
I'll have
my lunch alone

97
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:56,690
like a man.

98
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,479
My apple is so tiny.

99
00:05:02,316 --> 00:05:04,419
These career tests
are so stupid.

100
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,856
I mean,
mine suggests

101
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:09,635
I set my sights on
optometry or horse training.

102
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:11,571
What does yours say?
- Astronaut.

103
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:15,124
Yeah, right, you flying
around in space.

104
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,026
Me? No.

105
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:20,256
Like I know anything about
anti-Matter containment vessels.

106
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,938
Tommy, you know
what we should do?

107
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:27,143
Backpack around Ireland
for a few months.

108
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:29,330
Yeah, yeah. When?
- After we graduate.

109
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,410
Oh.

110
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:34,287
Or, better yet, we could move to new York

111
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:36,862
and rent a loft in the
village with a view of the river.

112
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:38,451
It'll probably
cost about...

113
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,535
300 bucks a month,

114
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,821
but, you know,
that's okay.

115
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:44,231
We'll find jobs
in bookstores.

116
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:48,951
Uh-huh.
- Tommy, give me some feedback.

117
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:51,592
It sounds great.

118
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:53,921
Then why are you being
so noncommittal.

119
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,798
I, I... I don't know.

120
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,177
Is it me?

121
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:02,116
Would you rather do
stuff without me?

122
00:06:02,117 --> 00:06:07,039
I'm not sure if I'm even
going to be here in five years.

123
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:09,948
I know what this is.

124
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,813
You don't want to commit to me
because you're not sure I'm your soulmate.

125
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:17,164
When you're done sorting out
your feelings, give me a call.

126
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,082
No, wait, August.
Wait, wait, wait.

127
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,992
I think that...

128
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:24,524
we've reached a point
in our relationship

129
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:27,368
where I can tell you
the truth about me.

130
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:37,983
I care more about you than anything
, and as long as I'm on this planet,

131
00:06:37,984 --> 00:06:39,367
I want to be with you.

132
00:06:41,582 --> 00:06:44,832
There, now aren't you glad
you sorted out your feelings?

133
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:47,586
Oh, yeah.

134
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:53,514
Oh, boy,
did we luck out.

135
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:55,329
Not everybody can
walk in off the street

136
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,505
and get a job
at a pancake house.

137
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,504
Harry, what
are you doing?

138
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,247
Well, the training
manual said

139
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,187
no hair below
the shoulders.

140
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:08,075
Now, I don't think
anybody's going to look there,

141
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:09,470
but, uh...

142
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:13,552
you know,
a rule's a rule.

143
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:14,230
Hey, um...

144
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,950
listen, I got
a question for you.

145
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:20,695
We've been on this planet
awhile now, and I was just wondering,

146
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:23,023
if we were to tell
someone we cared about

147
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:24,525
where we were
actually from,

148
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,217
do you think it would
be so dangerous?

149
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:29,063
No, not at all, Tommy.

150
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:31,877
In fact, I've already told
Mrs. Dubcek and the mailman..

151
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:33,924
ooh, and that nice guy
down at the minimart

152
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:35,791
because I want us all
to die like lab rats

153
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,691
at the hands of
primitive scientists!

154
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,057
Okay.

155
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,811
Sally, I'm right again.

156
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:45,744
I returned to the store,

157
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:49,070
I sent back your
extravagant purchases,

158
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:52,152
and I met a lovely
saleswoman named Gwen,

159
00:07:52,153 --> 00:07:54,881
and the two of us
effortlessly put together

160
00:07:54,882 --> 00:07:56,835
a thrifty yet stylish

161
00:07:56,836 --> 00:07:58,862
ensemble.

162
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,959
Behold.
- Big deal. It's just a little black dress.

163
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,672
Ah, to the untrained eye,

164
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:07,072
but add a faux
jacquard scarf

165
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:10,545
and a pair of pearl
button earrings, and look.

166
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:12,439
Ooh!

167
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,417
And this skirt.

168
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:17,222
It's an economical
acrylic blend,

169
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:19,196
but look
how it drapes.

170
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,410
And the vertical stripes
are so slimming.

171
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:25,077
ah!

172
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:26,672
You like?
- Nice.

173
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,278
All right,
now, Sally,

174
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,114
since I've opened your eyes to
a whole new world of options,

175
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:33,762
you can return me
the favour.

176
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:36,431
Dr. Albright belongs
to a women's study group,

177
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,635
and I must find out
what she's doing there.

178
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:40,873
God knows you don't want
to respect her boundaries.

179
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:42,277
Exactly.

180
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:47,469
Does August ever belong to a
secret women's organization?

181
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,842
Sure, the girl scouts.

182
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:52,158
But she got out
because she thought

183
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,202
the cookie-selling
verged on racketeering.

184
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:57,833
Lieutenant, you have
your assignment.

185
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:00,153
I can't help you, Dick.
As of today,

186
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:01,493
I've suited up
and joined

187
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:03,684
the proud ranks
of the work force.

188
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:06,278
Come on, Pepe!

189
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:09,179
Lieutenant, please.

190
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,734
I'll show you 50 ways
to tie a scarf.

191
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:15,122
Tommy, could you..
- No, Dick.

192
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,087
I've got to find out
what she's doing.

193
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:22,580
Hmm,

194
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,840
a study group
for women.

195
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,613
Women only.

196
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:34,030
I have to find someone

197
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,238
to infiltrate
this group,

198
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:38,394
but who?

199
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,636
Who?

200
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:51,861
Hey, you got
any real syrup?

201
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:53,766
Why, yes, we do, sir,

202
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,586
but may I suggest...

203
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:58,474
a dash of boysenberry

204
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:00,355
to bring out
the hidden oakiness

205
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:03,965
in your otherwise
common Vermont maple?

206
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,700
Enjoy it,

207
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:09,914
Mr. Grabby.

208
00:10:10,837 --> 00:10:12,637
Uh, whoa.

209
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:16,259
Let me ask you
something.

210
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:19,713
Was your service quick and courteous?
- Yes.

211
00:10:19,714 --> 00:10:22,299
Was your food hot and
exactly what you ordered?

212
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,446
Yes.
- Move over, sweetie.

213
00:10:25,937 --> 00:10:27,601
Then why is it,
my friend,

214
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:30,815
when I subtract your check
from the amount on the tray,

215
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:34,093
I come up with
97 cents for me?

216
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:36,110
I didn't think you'd
count it in front of me.

217
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:39,458
But you're glad I did, now, aren't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,046
Because now you
understand that a tip

219
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,154
is short for gratuity,

220
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:47,143
and gratuity is short
for gratitude.

221
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,315
I never heard that, ma'am.
- Don't interrupt me.

222
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:52,037
Gratitude for
a job well-done.

223
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:55,391
Now, 5% is not
gratitude, mister,

224
00:10:55,392 --> 00:10:58,294
it's an invitation
to an ass-kicking.

225
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:04,665
Got it?
- Got it.

226
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,214
Thank you.
Have a nice day!

227
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:10,759
I'm doing great!

228
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,939
So, split ends..
is that serious?

229
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,986
No, but they're
driving me crazy.

230
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:18,698
Um, August,

231
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:21,944
if I told you a secret, do
you think you could handle it?

232
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:24,204
You've been keeping
secrets from me?

233
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,249
This is not
just any secret.

234
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,969
This is.. this is
a really big secret.

235
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,375
You've been keeping
big secrets from me?

236
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:37,769
Well, not just you.
- I've told you about my impetigo.

237
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,527
I know, I know, it made
me feel very close to you.

238
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:43,698
But, see, my secret's
a lot more serious

239
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:45,536
than just
a contagious skin rash.

240
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,769
You don't trust me.
- No, no, it's not that.

241
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,318
I just don't want to go
blabbing things out

242
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:54,934
when I'm afraid there might be
a fearful, ignorant reaction.

243
00:11:57,728 --> 00:11:59,453
I understand.
Good.

244
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,335
Oh, jeez, if I'd known
you could just cut this off,

245
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,209
I would have done
it months ago.

246
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:31,842
Welcome. My name is Judith.
- Thank you, Judith.

247
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:34,963
We have beverages as well as
hummus and pita, if you'd like.

248
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,876
Why not? I'm wearing control tops.

249
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,376
Oh, pardon me.
- No, it's entirely my..

250
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,355
oh, my..

251
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,523
Nina, it's me,
Dr. Solomon.

252
00:12:48,524 --> 00:12:50,057
Oh.

253
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:53,153
I'm wearing
women's clothes.

254
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:55,437
Ah, that's it.

255
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,165
Wait right here.

256
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,038
Dr. Albright.
Dr. Albright.

257
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,902
Nina, can't this wait?
- I don't think so.

258
00:13:01,903 --> 00:13:05,056
Dr. Blumfeld is in the middle
of a very interesting story.

259
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:07,559
Yeah? Well, mine's better.
- You're hurting my arm.

260
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,061
Okay.
- Where were we?

261
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:13,590
Mary, let's not monopolize
Dr. Blumfeld. Have a seat.

262
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,313
All right, ladies, we're
ready to begin. Everybody settle.

263
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:22,162
I'll just squeeze in
over here.

264
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:30,477
Hello.

265
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:39,063
What are you doing here?
Do you hate me?

266
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:40,648
Don't be ridiculous.

267
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:44,690
Do you ever have this little
voice in your head that says

268
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,813
this might be
a bad idea?

269
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:49,419
shh!

270
00:13:49,647 --> 00:13:51,331
I'd like to start

271
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,334
by having everyone
ask herself

272
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,942
a question:

273
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,709
how am I
censoring myself?

274
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,203
What am I doing
to inhibit

275
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:03,194
my relationship
with those around me

276
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:05,689
by concealing
my true self?

277
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,594
I have a thought on that.
- Don't you dare.

278
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:10,546
Yes.

279
00:14:10,738 --> 00:14:11,809
Thank You.

280
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:13,474
I work in an office,

281
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:16,989
and I find that I have
to censor my feelings

282
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,213
just to fit in.

283
00:14:18,214 --> 00:14:20,459
I'm often excluded,

284
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,611
and whenever I do
summon the courage

285
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,985
to express my desire
to be embraced by the group,

286
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:29,229
I find myself muzzled

287
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,987
and squelched by them.

288
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,652
We're here to support
each other.

289
00:14:41,355 --> 00:14:44,223
Please go on.
And you are?

290
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:45,769
Dicki Jo.

291
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,019
Dicki Jo?
- Don't mock me.

292
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:54,595
I'm being excluded and
sequestered because of my sex.

293
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:57,186
I can feel the air change
in the room when I walk in,

294
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,784
and I just think
it's so unfair.

295
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:01,877
Just stop it.
Stop it.

296
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:05,087
Big girl.
Pretty, but big.

297
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:07,011
I will not.

298
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,722
Why do women have to
close themselves off?

299
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:11,832
They don't.
Let it out.

300
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,638
I wouldn't encourage
Dicki Jo.

301
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,413
Mary, let her speak.

302
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,222
Yeah,
you go, girl!

303
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,209
Mary, why do
you withhold,

304
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,783
pretending there's something
inside you that I can't understand?

305
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:30,253
We're both grown-ups.
What are you afraid of?

306
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:32,908
Not here, not now.
- Dr. Blumfeld is right.

307
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:37,047
We can't hold ourselves
back any longer.

308
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:40,142
Knock, knock.
Who's there? Me!

309
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,028
Go away!

310
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:43,894
It's too late.
I'm here.

311
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,835
I knew it all along.
- Me, too.

312
00:15:58,989 --> 00:15:59,863
Hey.

313
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:04,203
I just wanted to say that I've
invested a lot in this relationship,

314
00:16:04,204 --> 00:16:06,814
and if you think you can
treat me this way, you're wrong.

315
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,084
Your hair looks
really good.

316
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:10,601
Oh, thanks.

317
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,126
August, I can't stand
this anymore.

318
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:14,601
I have to tell you
something.

319
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,605
You're not going to
believe this at first.

320
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:19,792
It might even make you sick.
It's about my family.

321
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,763
Well, that
was a wash.

322
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:36,839
The woman I love won't
let me be a woman.

323
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:45,408
I need some herbal tea
and a fat-free cookie.

324
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:58,824
Listen, August, what I
needed to tell you was that..

325
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:00,111
don't speak, Tommy.

326
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:02,972
Don't speak.

327
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,221
So, Harry, how much
did we make?

328
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:13,370
I'll get our tip jar.
- Whew! You know,

329
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:15,655
I have never been
so fulfilled.

330
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:17,580
For the first time
as a human,

331
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:20,945
I feel a sense of accomplishment
and worth.

332
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,161
Wow!

333
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:26,290
$27.15.

334
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,857
Come on. You must have
missed a couple of hundreds.

335
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,734
Let me see this.

336
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,722
I worked eight
stinkin' hours

337
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,325
for a lousy pile
of pennies?

338
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,400
I could've found this
in a couch.

339
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:46,254
Remember, we're splitting it.
- Shut up!

340
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:52,273
$27.15?

341
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:54,738
Ooh!
and a mento.

342
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,861
Not a mento.

343
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:24,964
These just
came for you.

344
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,268
If you think flowers
can repair the damage,

345
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,812
you are so wrong.

346
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,167
They're not from him.
They're from Judith.

347
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:37,435
You want me to read the card?
- No.

348
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:39,063
Please?
- No!

349
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:44,415
Well, another place

350
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,953
I will never be able
to go to again.

351
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,915
Why not? They were
very supportive.

352
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:52,209
Did you learn nothing
about women? I did.

353
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,288
You are the biggest fool
I have ever known.

354
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,795
Really,
is that what you think?

355
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:01,476
To say that you
behaved childishly

356
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,662
is an insult
to children everywhere.

357
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:05,666
That's it, open up.
Talk to me.

358
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:10,098
I... am
a merry-go-round person.

359
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:13,543
You are
a tilt-a-whirl person.

360
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:16,306
This is good.
Tell me your feelings.

361
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:17,715
Before you came
into this office,

362
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,836
I had a very sane

363
00:19:20,837 --> 00:19:22,709
and ordered life.

364
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,199
I could go for weeks
without explaining myself,

365
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,989
and now the sky's
the limit!

366
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,875
You drive me crazy!

367
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:33,464
I do all this to you?
- Yes!

368
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,193
Well, I must be
a pretty exciting guy.

369
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:40,560
Now, that's good.

370
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,464
Now we're communicating. Now
I know what you're thinking.

371
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,082
What am I thinking?

372
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:47,087
You like me.

373
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:54,141
You really like me.

374
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:01,754
Sally, is there anything
you'd like to tell me as a woman?

375
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,836
I think I'm enlightened
enough now to hear it.

376
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,065
Ah, well,

377
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,251
men are always
bossing you around.

378
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:11,158
No one ever says
"thank you.

379
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:13,954
And you're expected
to clean up after everyone

380
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,327
Are you talking about being
a woman or a waitress

381
00:20:17,722 --> 00:20:20,194
Waitress, woman..
same thing.

382
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,909
I just never realized
how many people here

383
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,840
are in the service
of others.

384
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,897
Well, everybody here
sells his time for money

385
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:30,048
It's like taking a mortgage
against your life.

386
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:32,911
Yeah, well, my life is
worth more than minimum wage

387
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:35,745
and the occasional
slice of free pie.

388
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,144
I've just got to figure out
what it is I really want to do.

389
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,709
I think you should.
Everybody needs a goal.

390
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,493
Yeah, I want to let
my hair grow back.

391
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:47,682
I want to make the world a better place.

392
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:49,460
I want to
bring mankind

393
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:52,102
the gift
of electricity.

394
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:58,051
They have electricity.
- Ah.

395
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,717
Then my work
is done.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
