1
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,157
Aliens are all around us.

2
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:05,969
This is the story of a band
of four such explorers.

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,760
In order to blend in they
have assumed human form.

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,208
This is the high commander.

5
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,779
He has assembled an elite team of experts.

6
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,904
A decorated military officer.

7
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:19,247
A seasoned intelligent specialist.

8
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,354
And...well, they had an extra seat.

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:26,555
The Earth is populated by
millions of beautiful women,

10
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,784
Those that aren't beautiful
have great personalities.

11
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,723
You know, there's something about
the moon and stars thats..

12
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,959
so romantic.
I wish that..

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,854
..Dr Albright was here instead of a group
of ungrateful subordinates.

14
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:15,139
What are you reading?
- "Vogue."

15
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,671
Ha! Look at this.
"Stomachs are in, Breasts are out."

16
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:20,975
Well, that's just
basic anatomy.

17
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,832
Why don't you
look like that?

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,996
Because that woman has
used a line of products

19
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:28,703
that promotes moist-looking
skin and a vacant look in her eyes.

20
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:30,457
Well, get some.

21
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,618
I've also noticed, lieutenant, that
most girls smell better than you do.

22
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:38,428
All right, it's my job
to research women,

23
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,706
so I'll get some soap,
but I want it understood

24
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:42,493
it's not because
I want to smell nice.

25
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:45,392
Sally, you know, fragrance
is an integral part of the

26
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:48,607
human experience.. the
smell of flowers in the springtime,

27
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,734
the aroma of fresh
baked apple pie.

28
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,241
A beautiful sunset

29
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:55,295
with pink and orange
streaking the sky.

30
00:01:56,426 --> 00:01:58,736
Harry, that's a sight,
not a smell.

31
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,935
Oh. Well,
I knew it was one of those

32
00:02:01,936 --> 00:02:03,321
face hole things.

33
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:17,530
Good morning!
- Shh!

34
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,433
Please.
I'm meditating.

35
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:22,354
Oh, meditation.
Interesting.

36
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,090
Sometimes, when I'm
feeling stressed out,

37
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:26,743
I like to visualize myself
in a peaceful place.

38
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:29,205
Don't let me interrupt.
You go on.

39
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,687
How do you do it?

40
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:45,636
Close your eyes.
Breathe.

41
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,923
And picture
a beautiful place.

42
00:02:50,924 --> 00:02:52,198
Okay.

43
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:54,429
Yes, I'm there.

44
00:02:56,184 --> 00:02:57,778
There's
a lovely breeze.

45
00:02:58,504 --> 00:03:00,201
I'm wearing
a gauzy dress.

46
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:02,999
A wave hits me,

47
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:07,789
but it doesn't matter because
I've lost that winter weight.

48
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,463
I take off my shirt.

49
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:14,402
The sun embraces me like
thousands of warm fingers.

50
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:17,390
I am relaxed and free.

51
00:03:17,691 --> 00:03:20,245
Even my horse
senses your calm.

52
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,845
I didn't see your big horse,
handsome stranger.

53
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:29,141
That's because you
were distracted by my..

54
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,921
chiseled pecs.

55
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:34,291
Just then, their secretary
arrives to say

56
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:36,756
"it's all-you-can-eat
fish day in the cafeteria."

57
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:38,505
Ooh, fish. Great.

58
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,040
Ah, yes, fish.

59
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:43,629
My horse likes fish.

60
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,448
Don't wander off.
I'll just be a second.

61
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:04,062
And, you, don't
touch anything.

62
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:08,898
Can I help you
find something from

63
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:11,418
the Firma De tata
skin care line, miss?

64
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,036
I'm looking for soap.

65
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,434
Are you oily or dry?

66
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:16,849
It depends on
where you look.

67
00:04:17,722 --> 00:04:20,035
Combination.
Are you familiar with our

68
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:22,485
foaming face wash,
De bara tata?

69
00:04:22,486 --> 00:04:24,662
Is it soap?
- You'll love it.

70
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:28,516
And today we have special
on Olia De Firma eye cream.

71
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:31,609
No, I just want soap.
- How are you on toning gel?

72
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,565
Mi throata tota
is a must.

73
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,194
If it's soap,
I'll take it.

74
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:38,869
Are you sloughing?

75
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:44,049
What words are you
not understanding?

76
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,759
I need soap, just the soap. Give me soap!

77
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,808
If I can help you
or answer any questions,

78
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,929
just let me know.
I'm onya.

79
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,039
Okay, onya,
I was wondering

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,298
if you could explain to me
this human obsession with youth

81
00:05:02,299 --> 00:05:05,939
and why the cosmetics industry
perpetuates this self-destructive behavior?

82
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,884
Excuse me.

83
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,569
Hey that was great,
what you just said to her.

84
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:15,147
I've seen you at school, right?
- Yeah, I've seen you, too,

85
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,679
hiding under the bleachers
watching the cheerleaders.

86
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,902
You didn't strike me
as much of a thinker.

87
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:26,287
I'm August.
Don't call me Auggie.

88
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:29,657
I'm Tommy. Don't call
me Auggie, either.

89
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:33,310
You know,
it's so depressing how

90
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,678
the baby boomers
have distorted society.

91
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:38,930
They screwed up the job
market, froze music for 30 years,

92
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:40,306
and now this.

93
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:43,177
Yeah, they've created
an entire industry

94
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,995
attempting to recapture
the youth they squandered.

95
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:49,136
Tommy, you are
insanely bright.

96
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,313
Well, it's just
how I feel.

97
00:05:56,513 --> 00:05:59,766
"Very berry lip stain."
What do you think?

98
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,163
Me like.

99
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,400
Ooh! There's my cab.
I'm late.

100
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:13,290
Your cab? Where are you going?
- To the airport.

101
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,722
Oh, the airport. I'd love to see the airport.

102
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:16,879
We could make a night of it.

103
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,148
Well, I'm just going to be there
until my plane leaves.

104
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,730
Going on a little retreat.
- Retreat? You're going away.

105
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,424
Just for a week.
- A week?

106
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:28,429
Uh-huh.
Is there a number I can call you if I need you?

107
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:31,965
Ooh, gotta go. Bye.
But..

108
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,235
Dr. Albright!

109
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,043
Hey! You forgot your..

110
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:44,085
you forgot your..     me!

111
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:52,161
Hi.

112
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:57,971
Care for a complimentary
facial from orca skin care for men?

113
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,063
I don't think I should.

114
00:07:02,364 --> 00:07:05,181
Don't you deserve a little
time-Out for yourself?

115
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:08,574
No.
- Come on.

116
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:11,008
Sit down.
Relax.

117
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:15,120
Oooh  Soft.

118
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:16,752
Thank you.

119
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,318
Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow.

120
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:25,337
You really have
great skin.

121
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:27,742
You probably stay
away from the sun.

122
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,597
Well, after almost
crashing into it,

123
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,307
you learn your lesson.

124
00:07:36,106 --> 00:07:38,747
Most men don't think
they have time for pampering,

125
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,295
but they're wrong.

126
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:46,966
Well, I'm really
not like most men.

127
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:49,265
I could tell.

128
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,569
Is it that obvious? Boy,
is Dick going to be mad.

129
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,355
You know, he keeps telling
me that I need to fit in more.

130
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:58,141
Who's Dick?

131
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,323
He's my high commander.

132
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,497
I was in a relationship
like that once.

133
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:08,209
Now, doesn't that
feel good?

134
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,614
The first time is always
fabulous, isn't it?

135
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:19,809
Dick!

136
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:23,487
Oh it's you.
How's your soap research?

137
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:26,329
It's more than soap, Dick.
It's a whole regime.

138
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,619
Aviana gave me all these vials
of potions to experiment with.

139
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,789
Okay, this one dulls my shine.
This one brings out my glow.

140
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,968
But I'm going to put 'em both on my face
at the same time and let 'em fight it out.

141
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,763
Who's Aviana?
- She gave me this.

142
00:08:39,955 --> 00:08:41,539
And expected nothing
in return?

143
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:56,547
So, does anybody notice anything...

144
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:57,829
different about me?

145
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:00,819
Your teeth look whiter.

146
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,852
I bet you think I've been
mountain biking, but, no.

147
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:07,010
It's orca's sunless
sea bronzer for men.

148
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:10,646
Phillip says that it gives
the illusion of being in the sun

149
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,470
without all
of the elastin damage.

150
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:14,832
Who's Phillip?
- My skin care specialist.

151
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:17,157
He taught me
that my self-esteem

152
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:19,296
does not rely on
what others think of me,

153
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,955
but, instead,
on how I look.

154
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,430
Well, you look
like an idiot.

155
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,371
Oh? Well, the people
at the personnel office

156
00:09:27,372 --> 00:09:29,012
didn't seem to think so.

157
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,186
You're looking

158
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:33,197
at the new orca pour homme
representative.

159
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:36,290
I get to wear
a sailor's suit.

160
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,554
Where's Tommy?
- He's with his new girlfriend, August.

161
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:43,655
August? Phillip? Aviana?
Who are all these people?

162
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:45,559
What
kind of a store did you go to?

163
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,922
They're just friends we
made. You should try it.

164
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:51,328
Excuse me, just because I've
developed a relationship with one woman

165
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,285
at the expense of developing a
relationship with any other human on this planet

166
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:56,966
does not mean I don't have any friends.
- Name one.

167
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:59,455
Well, I've got lots of friends.
- Who?

168
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:03,833
Willie, Steve, and...

169
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:05,098
carpet giant.

170
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:11,648
Good morning, Dr. Solomon.
Isn't it a beautiful day?

171
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,238
You're in a cheerful mood. Do you
forget that Dr. Albright is gone?

172
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,436
Nope.
- Nina...

173
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,452
do you have the number
where Dr. Albright is staying?

174
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,004
Yep.
- Good.

175
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:26,466
Could you get her on the phone for me, please?
- She said no calls.

176
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,573
Nina you work for me, too. When
I ask you to do something,

177
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:31,944
you are to do it
immediately, no questions asked!

178
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:37,167
Whoo!

179
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:45,347
Thank you.

180
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:49,367
Why did you bring me here?
Well, with Dr. Albright gone,

181
00:10:49,368 --> 00:10:52,632
I thought it would be a nice
chance for us friends to catch up.

182
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,622
Mm-hmm.
- So, um...

183
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:57,042
how long have you
been at Pendleton Nina?

184
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,036
Three years.
- My, that's a long time.

185
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,831
You're going to fire me,
aren't you?

186
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,687
Why would you think that?
- Because I won't give you the phone number.

187
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:06,908
That would be..
- If you think that I won't cause a scene

188
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:09,746
just because we're in a fancy
restaurant, you had better think again

189
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:13,343
because I'm going to tell you
exactly what I think of your sorry ass

190
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:17,460
and the loser school that owns it
because I, Nina Campbell, am quitting!

191
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,657
I work damn hard for you!

192
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:21,056
Nina, sit down.

193
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:23,272
I'm not firing you.

194
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:25,729
You're not?
- No.

195
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,274
Oh. Okay.

196
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:31,371
I'd like to change
my order.

197
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:33,202
Bring me the rack of lamb
and a beefeater martini,

198
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:34,429
straight up
with an olive.

199
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:40,505
But about Dr. Albright's number..
- Don't press your luck.

200
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,794
Dick, I made you a sandwich.
Aren't you ever coming home?

201
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:53,361
Not until I find out where
Dr. Albright is staying.

202
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:57,694
Oh, mama!
Walk that around.

203
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:02,560
Why did I say that?
- I've been getting that all day.

204
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,354
Everywhere I go,
men just react like that,

205
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:05,992
even construction workers.

206
00:12:07,662 --> 00:12:09,837
You know, this stuff
changes you somehow.

207
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:14,003
It's like the clogged pores keep your
self-esteem from escaping.

208
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,204
I think I like it.

209
00:12:16,205 --> 00:12:19,082
She must have left her number here
somewhere. She keeps everything..

210
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:20,920
she's so anal.

211
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:25,601
Will you drop it? We'll
just build another Albright.

212
00:12:25,602 --> 00:12:28,205
We have the technology.
We have the leftover flesh.

213
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,335
And I could really use
the extra freezer space.

214
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,783
Are you mad? There's only one Dr. Albright.

215
00:12:32,784 --> 00:12:33,614
Calm down.

216
00:12:33,615 --> 00:12:35,775
You don't understand.
I need to talk to her right now!

217
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:37,777
Pull yourself together, man!

218
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,485
Thank you, lieutenant.

219
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:43,972
You smell great.

220
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:55,248
You know, Tommy,
you really have an old soul.

221
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:00,110
I like it.
- Oh, you do?

222
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:04,200
Well, um...  it is really, really old.

223
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:08,740
So, Dick's not your
real father, is he?

224
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,492
Well, how'd you know?

225
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:13,201
Well, you seem to have
this kind of loyalty to him, but,

226
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:14,817
no real emotional connection.

227
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:18,256
Tommy?
Have I upset you?

228
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,728
No, I was just trying
to look down your blouse.

229
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,279
What? What did I say? What?

230
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,533
I don't know how
I ever could have expected

231
00:13:26,534 --> 00:13:29,613
a 14-year-old boy..
and I emphasize "boy"..

232
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,457
to be able to separate
my body from my mind.

233
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,995
Wait, August, they're attached.
Wait! Hold on.

234
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:38,085
Wait! Come back!
Wait. Stop.

235
00:13:38,086 --> 00:13:41,166
Let's talk about my feelings some
more. They're really screwed up.

236
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,488
You heard me.

237
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,656
...Mary Albright.

238
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:02,429
Well, she's not
at the bangkok Sheraton.

239
00:14:08,197 --> 00:14:09,600
When you can't go to the sea,

240
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:13,322
the sea comes to you
with Orca.

241
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,657
Doesn't "orca"
mean whale?

242
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,314
Yes. All of
our products

243
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,536
are derived from
essential whale oils.

244
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:25,471
All the goodness
of whale.

245
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,693
Isn't that
animal cruelty?

246
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:30,828
Oh, no. No, they
don't kill the whales,

247
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,262
they just corner 'em.

248
00:14:33,213 --> 00:14:35,843
You would be amazed
at how much oil they let go

249
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:37,705
when they are
really scared.

250
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:44,423
Find out what Eskimo men
have known for centuries.

251
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:49,430
Ah, I see you're already familiar
with our bronzer.

252
00:14:52,704 --> 00:14:53,960
All Righty.

253
00:14:56,489 --> 00:14:57,922
Aviana..
Aviana, over here.

254
00:14:58,682 --> 00:14:59,782
Excuse me.

255
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,312
Aviana, I'm flaking bad.
I need some more samples.

256
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:05,624
I'm sorry. Only the first sample is free.

257
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,327
Now you have to pay.
- Just a little scrub.

258
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:11,388
Half an ounce? I'll get the
money. You know I'm good for it.

259
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:15,611
I'm sorry. My suppliers
would never go for that.

260
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,882
Okay, I see how this works.

261
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:21,181
You reel me in with your glossy
ads, get me hooked on freebies.

262
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:23,699
Next thing you know, I'm out
trying to scrape together enough cash

263
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,428
for a lousy
tube of concealer.

264
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:27,841
Fine, don't buy it then.

265
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,975
I have plenty of others
who want it.

266
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,225
Would you like a free sample of Firma De tata?

267
00:15:33,226 --> 00:15:36,910
No! Don't do it.
Just say no.

268
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,636
When you can't go
to the..

269
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:45,803
why did I have
to come here?

270
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,887
I was perfectly happy
sitting in my room,

271
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:50,073
fantasizing that August
doesn't hate my guts.

272
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,915
Because you're
the information officer.

273
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,688
I'm sure you can defeat
a simple door lock.

274
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:57,514
What are you doing?!
This is illegal.

275
00:15:57,515 --> 00:15:59,065
Now we're
breaking and entering.

276
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,389
What did you expect me to do? Beam you in?

277
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:05,577
Smell.

278
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,505
What?
- Mary!

279
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,615
You know, you and I
are pathetic.

280
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:17,704
We're superior beings. We're
supposed to be here studying the human race,

281
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:19,381
not mooning over
a couple of chicks.

282
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:21,698
I'm not mooning, I'm
obsessing. There's a difference.

283
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:25,156
Now, look around for a travel
brochure or itinerary, something.

284
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:26,706
No Dick, I have to get home.

285
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,444
I have to wait by the phone
for August not to call.

286
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,277
All right, you do that.
I'm gonna...

287
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:32,791
hang around here
for a while.

288
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,622
Dick? You're not gonna do
anything creepy, are you?

289
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,175
You know me
better than that.

290
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:41,699
I'm just going to rifle
through her belongings.

291
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,228
August...

292
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:51,079
I just came
for my backpack.

293
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,670
Oh. Well, it's
on the bed.

294
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,067
Listen, I ran out, because I was
disappointed in you.

295
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:59,132
I thought you were
different than other guys.

296
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,602
Oh, I am different.

297
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,057
You have no idea
how different I am.

298
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,162
Well, you're not
totally to blame,

299
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:09,424
because I know I send
some really mature signals.

300
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,325
Okay, I can deal
with that.

301
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:17,054
I can forget
the physical stuff

302
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,801
and just be
completely intellectual

303
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:21,047
all the time.

304
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:24,209
Well, I hope
not...all the time.

305
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,620
Thank god, 'cause, frankly,
I couldn't have done that.

306
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,462
Look, it's not
that complicated.

307
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:33,312
Sometimes you go
with the intellectual,

308
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:35,442
sometimes you go
with the physical,

309
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:38,113
and sometimes
just closeness is nice.

310
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:40,163
Well how will I know
when to do what?

311
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:43,030
I'll decide that
as we go along.

312
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:06,769
Why, Dr. Albright,

313
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,435
you're being so naughty.

314
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,447
Oh.

315
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:18,789
I just came by
to feed the fish.

316
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,060
Me, too.

317
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:29,315
Good morning, Nina.
- Good morning, Dr. Albright. You look great.

318
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,427
I feel like a million bucks.
Did I miss anything?

319
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,099
Mmm, not really.

320
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:42,033
Mary!  You came back!

321
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:50,973
When humans come together, they..

322
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:53,120
they... connect somehow.

323
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:54,658
And when one
of them goes away,

324
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:57,225
they..they..pull out
a part of you.

325
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:00,302
Dr. Albright took a piece
of me with her when she left.

326
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:03,390
And when she came back,
I felt normal again.

327
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,498
Well, as normal
as one can feel in these bodies.

328
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:09,888
While we're on
the subject of bodies,

329
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,696
why is mine so much higher
maintenance than yours?

330
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:14,780
I think the economy
relies on it.

331
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:19,139
Hi, guys.

332
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:25,347
What are you
selling now?

333
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,406
Well, surprisingly,
I got fired,

334
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:29,799
but Phillip
found me a new job.

335
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,107
I am now
a full-time employee

336
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,014
at the Spartacus lounge.

337
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,018
Good for you, Harry.

338
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,948
You know, a man is never
really complete when he's alone.

339
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,237
And a woman's not complete
unless she's making you beg.

340
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:46,948
How do the men here survive
when the women go away?

341
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,761
They go to bars.

342
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:52,356
They get along
without their women?

343
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:55,035
They make do.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
