1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:03,625
Aliens are all around us.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,074
This is the story of a band
of four such explorers.

3
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:10,083
In order to blend in they
have assumed human form.

4
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:12,308
This is the high commander.

5
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,779
He has assembled an elite team of experts.

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,904
A decorated military officer.

7
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,247
A seasoned intelligent specialist.

8
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,354
And...well, they had an extra seat.

9
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:25,099
The world is actually
two thirds water.

10
00:00:25,662 --> 00:00:28,036
About the equivalent of
Scotch at a cheap wedding.

11
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:00,719
Super combo number one.

12
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,247
Super combo number four.

13
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:06,294
And the fun-tastic goofy
meal number two.

14
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:09,825
You heard me.

15
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,859
Earth just doesn't get any
better than this.. dinner and a movie.

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,887
Mmm. Ooh,
let's see this one.

17
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:20,427
Four stars, two thumbs. "A sweeping
drama, one of the years".

18
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:23,711
most intellectually stimulating
cinematic accomplishments."

19
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,201
No.
- Chick flick.

20
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:29,541
How are your chicken
crunchies today?

21
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:30,926
Harry, we don't
have all day.

22
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:33,779
He'll have the super
combo number two.

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,301
Okay, that'Il be $10
.71. Please drive around.

24
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:37,385
Ah, with pleasure.

25
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:40,400
What's that sound?

26
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,837
Please drive around.
- Yeah, we would if we could.

27
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:45,407
I told you to get this
looked at two weeks ago,

28
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:47,177
not to mention
the phone's still out.

29
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:50,852
I keep telling you to get all these things
taken care of, yet nothing ever gets done.

30
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:52,806
And yet you persist.
Good for you.

31
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,186
Now we'll never make it to the movie.

32
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:59,597
Nonsense, All we have to do is get out and push,
Sally. - Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:02,003
Hurry up, I don't want
to miss the previews.

34
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:03,879
Or that "audiences'
listening" thing.

35
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:24,617
This seat sucks. Oh I agree,
the seating is all wrong.

36
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:27,352
Tommy, you should be to my right
so I could actually have an armrest.

37
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:28,571
Harry, you should
sit on the aisle

38
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:30,361
because you go to
the bathroom constantly.

39
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:34,098
Wait a minute, hold it.
Everybody just sit down.

40
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,963
This is supposed to be fun.
Here, Sally, have some popcorn.

41
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:39,844
I didn't want popcorn.
I wanted good and plentys.

42
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:42,368
Well, when you're high commander, you
can be in charge of the movie treats.

43
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:43,615
I will.
- Bully for you.

44
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:46,747
Shh!
- Excuse me, we're talking here!

45
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:51,138
Now, how did he beat those guys?
I mean, come on, it was 12 against one.

46
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:54,815
Well, he has the advantage.
They only have machine guns,

47
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,329
while he has
the broken pool cue.

48
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh! Oh, great
command decision, Dick,

49
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,257
now I have a piece of
popcorn stuck in my teeth.

50
00:03:03,258 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll get it.

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,955
Sally, you are right. I
should have sat near the aisle.

52
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:10,576
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.

53
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,273
Is that it?
- Ow!

54
00:03:14,817 --> 00:03:17,789
I'm getting the manager.
- Thank you. Have him bring floss.

55
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,091
I'm sorry.
Couldn't be sorr...Ow !

56
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:25,721
Dick, I'm stuck
to the floor.

57
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:26,807
Oh my god!

58
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:46,785
Okay, punk,
court is adjourned...YAH !

59
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,811
Stop it.
That's an order.

60
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:55,327
The high commander said
that I could turn myself

61
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:56,994
into a lethal
killing machine.

62
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,204
Did you?
- What?

63
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:01,090
Tommy, what's with the toad?

64
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,316
His name is Jack.

65
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,840
He's my new lab partner.
- No, I meant in the jar.

66
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:09,744
Oh! That's a dead frog.
We're going to reanimate it.

67
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:12,554
Tommy, I thought I told you no
science projects in the kitchen.

68
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:14,049
High commander
said we could.

69
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:19,002
Dick, permission to bitch?
- Permission granted.

70
00:04:19,003 --> 00:04:21,554
Why do you tell them they can do
things when I tell them they can't?

71
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:22,960
Because I'm the high commander.

72
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,650
Well, would it kill you to listen to me
once...aahhhh!

73
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:29,144
ahhhhhh...I'm sorry, I thought we were singing.

74
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:33,742
This popcorn kernel
is agony.

75
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:36,282
I feel like sticking my head
in a microwave to pop it out.

76
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:39,979
Just make sure that you poke holes in
your head with a fork first.

77
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:44,984
Well, I'm off.
- Dick wait, we need to talk about this.

78
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,838
I am second in command here, and I
have no authority over these guys.

79
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,402
You outrank them Sally, just seize
control, take some initiative.

80
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:53,791
All right, permission requested
to schedule initiative-taking.

81
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,822
Just do it. Take the car and fix the phone.

82
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:59,334
What would you do if I wasn't here?
- You're always here.

83
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:00,476
Well, what if I wasn't?

84
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:05,205
I'd do a happy
little dance.

85
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,160
Oh, man,
Solomon's here.

86
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:15,439
Don't look, he might come over.
- Does he see us?

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,100
I'll check.

88
00:05:17,994 --> 00:05:20,896
Leon! What
a happy accident.

89
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:23,448
Now we can spend the evening
getting to know each other better.

90
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,846
Ah please, continue
with your conversation.

91
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:28,124
We can't. We were talking about you.

92
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,115
Shut up.

93
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,551
Can I get you something?
- What are they having?

94
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:35,059
Coffee, for two hours.

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,492
I'll have that.

96
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,084
Pitman...
- What?

97
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:42,990
You look different.
I don't know what it is.

98
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:47,384
Suddenly you look so--
I've never used this word.....cool.

99
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:49,181
Really? I've been... - now it's gone.

100
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:51,462
Now it's back.

101
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,825
Now there's an air
of sophistication.

102
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:59,360
Somehow that fiery tube
has mitigated your oafishness.

103
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,018
May I?
- Oh.

104
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,922
oh you can keep it.

105
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:15,760
Thank you.

106
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:21,986
Oh.....an added bonus.

107
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:28,911
This is creepy.

108
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,512
You have no vision.

109
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:35,025
What is this thing
in my colander?

110
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:37,216
Oh, that would be
its old brain.

111
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:44,054
Well, Dick,my life is hell.
I hope you're happy.

112
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,063
Oh, you betcha.  It's like I'm feeling
my lungs for the first time.

113
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,135
It's so nice to have
a tenant who smokes.

114
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:55,458
So many people are giving it
up. It just breaks my heart.

115
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,675
We need some duct tape
and jumper cables.

116
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:00,810
Tommy, have you smoked
your cigarette yet?

117
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:03,223
Er, no, sir.
- There's no reason to put it off.

118
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:05,133
You know,
I must say,

119
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:09,005
this secondhand smoke,
is smooth and satisfying.

120
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,024
My gift to you.

121
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:14,400
Dick, you've been smoking
those things since you got home.

122
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,505
It's almost like they're addictive.
- Don't be silly.

123
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:19,045
If cigarettes were bad, they
wouldn't sell them everywhere.

124
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:22,515
Besides, I can quit
whenever I want.

125
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:26,182
There, you see, I've stopped.
There's nothing to it.

126
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:29,326
You know, Sally,

127
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:32,279
if you want to advance,

128
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:37,204
you're going to have to open
your mind to new experiences.

129
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,338
Well, I've started again.

130
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,034
This popcorn kernel
is driving me crazy.

131
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:48,684
Oh honey, don't put your hand in your mouth.
It's so unbecoming.

132
00:07:50,913 --> 00:07:52,282
What was that?

133
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,837
It's alive!

134
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,759
Hey, what's your problem?
It's a guaranteed "A."...Kids?

135
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,039
What do you think you're doing?
- Smoking.

136
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,627
Please don't smoke in front
of me. I just quit a year ago.

137
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,867
Oh, you poor, misguided girl.

138
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,119
Don't you miss it?

139
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:35,486
The first cool drag
in the morning,

140
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:39,021
a relaxing smoke on the roof
on a warm summer night.

141
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,569
And if I ever have sex, I think I'm going
to smoke afterwards.

142
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:46,472
Have you ever read the
warning on the side of the pack?

143
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:50,246
Well, I'm not a fetus.

144
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:54,754
Those things will take
10 years off of your life.

145
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:56,435
Yes, but that's off
the end of your life,

146
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,876
and those years
are crappy anyway.

147
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:03,029
Well, there happens
to be a policy here..

148
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,977
cigarettes are only allowed in
university-Sanctioned smoking zones.

149
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:06,993
Take it outside.

150
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:11,993
All right, if you're going
to be a big...fetus about it.

151
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:27,219
My people.  Dr. Finkel.
Father.

152
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,269
Mrs. Cross,
you smoke, too?

153
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,279
It comes as a surprise
to many people.

154
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:39,294
Look at us...we suck, we blow..
a posse of oral fixators.

155
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,286
Oh, yeah, we're bad.

156
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,833
They can isolate us, but
they'll never separate us.

157
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,510
Let them outlaw smoking.

158
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:49,147
Then they'll just have to
deal with a whole bunch of...

159
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,842
smokin' outlaws!
Who's with me?

160
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,270
All right.

161
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,092
All right,
rinse out your mouth.

162
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,565
Now spit.

163
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:19,733
You've never been to a...
dentist's office before, have you?

164
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:22,114
Well, you know,
gal on the go.

165
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:26,127
All right. Could you
open wider, please?  Wider.

166
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:29,830
You can't smoke in here.

167
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:33,744
All right, I'll smoke
in the waiting room.

168
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,415
Er, you can't smoke in
the waiting room, either.

169
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,727
Then I'll smoke in the hall.

170
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,614
I'm sorry, you can't smoke
anywhere in the building.

171
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:42,955
You know, you're awfully
smug for a man in a paper coat.

172
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,325
Oh, yes!
The corn is gone. See?

173
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:25,242
So, Tommy, how was
your science fair?

174
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:29,227
Oh, uh...
funny story. Um...

175
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,322
remember that frog
I reanimated?

176
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:35,217
Well, it kind of developed
a taste for human flesh.

177
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:39,507
Someone's got to go see
my science teacher tomorrow.

178
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:42,439
Well did you tell Dick?
- I thought he was with you.

179
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,469
He ran off. That was hours ago.
- That's not like him.

180
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,150
Well, what are we supposed
to do? Dick is always here.

181
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:53,171
Wait a minute.
Of course...this is a test.

182
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,466
What?
- For the next 60 seconds,

183
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,800
she's going to emit
a high-pitched tone.

184
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:03,719
No.
Dick is testing me.

185
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:11,043
He's conveniently "disappeared,"
- leaving me in charge.

186
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:14,003
Well, I'm gonna show him.

187
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:17,378
Okay, troops, line up
in order of height.

188
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,348
Descending.

189
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,878
It's time
for decisive action.

190
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:28,354
Harry!
- Yes, sir-- ma'am-- ma'am-- ma'am sir.

191
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:34,306
You're going to climb the
utility pole and fix our phone line.

192
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:36,532
Ohh, well, I'll need
a flashlight.

193
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:39,433
Don't worry. It's plenty
bright with all that lightning.

194
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:41,916
Well, how do
I get up there?

195
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:44,963
We've got that big metal
ladder in the garage.

196
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:46,678
Oh, wait.

197
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:51,246
You can knock the box open with this metal golf club.
- Good, Tommy.

198
00:12:51,247 --> 00:12:54,134
Oh and you want to be safe. Wrap
this chain around your waist

199
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,702
and attach it to the
power line in case you slip.

200
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,046
Prepare to be dazzled.

201
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,901
Oh, well...

202
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:29,529
I'm sure someone will find me
before the building closes.

203
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:34,713
Maybe not.

204
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:44,808
Now, I'm not one to discourage
a child's creativity,

205
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:47,705
but that frog took a bite
out of Patti kinland

206
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:49,366
the size of
a silver dollar.

207
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,448
Dime, tops.
- That frog destroyed

208
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,927
all the other experiments
and attacked six students,

209
00:13:55,928 --> 00:13:57,642
and Tommy refuses
to apologize.

210
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,843
Well, it's clear that Tommy
must be disciplined.

211
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,833
And in the absence
of Mr. Solomon,

212
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,855
we ask that you
take responsibility.

213
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:07,305
Oh, I'm ready
to take responsibility.

214
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,106
Believe me, I can handle
responsibility. No problem.

215
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:13,751
Tommy, I'm hereby placing
you under house arrest.

216
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,474
Well I just thought counseling--
- Your rations will be cut in half.

217
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,796
You will report to
calisthenics at 0500, sharp.

218
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:21,867
Could I be placed in a
foster home or something?

219
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,723
I'm his mother.
I'll handle him.

220
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:28,320
I thought you were his sister.
- Sister, mother, whatever.

221
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:30,660
I think you're
actually my aunt.

222
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,663
In our family,
it's kind of hard to tell.

223
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:45,422
Oh, Danny boy
the pipes,the pipes are calling

224
00:14:45,423 --> 00:14:53,684
from glen to glen
and down the mountainside

225
00:14:55,318 --> 00:15:03,059
the summer's gone
and all the roses falling

226
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:11,363
'tis you, 'tis you
must go
and I must bide

227
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:20,486
but come ye back
when summer's in the meadow

228
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,205
hey, you're not bad.

229
00:15:30,784 --> 00:15:31,674
Thank you.

230
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:43,213
'Tis I'll be gone
in sunshine or in shadow.

231
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:46,979
You're not
so bad yourself.

232
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:53,280
What do you mean my cars' not
ready? You promised it by Friday.

233
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:54,598
Today's Friday.

234
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,433
The carburetors' a rebuild,

235
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:00,152
that takes extra time.
- I'm over here.

236
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:02,876
On the plus side, your
tranny's in really good shape.

237
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:04,371
Ah, good news.

238
00:16:04,812 --> 00:16:06,864
Excuse me,
this is my car.

239
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:10,027
Uh, she's right.
I just stand here and nod.

240
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:13,188
Well, you gotta humor 'em.

241
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,617
This redhead
came in last week.

242
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:19,589
I think she was driving a
sunbird. She opened that hood..

243
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:30,933
hello... I'd like my car ready
in a half hour.

244
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,633
I don't want a 200%
mark-Up on parts.

245
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,379
And I'd like it washed.

246
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,156
Thank you. Do you hear that, high commander?

247
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:42,724
Sally?

248
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,320
Oh, yeah.

249
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,051
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:53,836 --> 00:16:54,876
Women, huh?

251
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,175
Oh, boy.

252
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:22,162
Dick?
- Sally.

253
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:26,572
Dick, you can come out now.
I've passed your little test.

254
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:29,573
Nina, where's Dick?

255
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:32,194
I haven't seen him in two days,
I was just about to call you.

256
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,713
Will you excuse us for just a minute?

257
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,090
He's not here, he's gone.
He's actually gone.

258
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,465
I can still hear you.

259
00:17:42,124 --> 00:17:44,598
Could you leave, please?
- Try and stop me.

260
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:48,559
This wasn't a test.

261
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,229
I really am
high commander.

262
00:17:52,995 --> 00:17:55,271
We await your orders,
high commander.

263
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:00,255
We're here waitin'.

264
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,708
If Dick were here,
he'd know what to do.

265
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:07,900
If Dick were here,
he'd know where he was.

266
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,355
We gotta find him.

267
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,336
Dr. Bankson.

268
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:29,301
Dr. Bankson,....
we meet at last.

269
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,406
I'm looking for someone...
Dick Solomon?

270
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,305
Who the heck are you?
- Ah.

271
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,920
Looks like you've
chosen a poor time

272
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,547
to sedate yourself,
Dr. Bankson.

273
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,028
But you know
what they say..

274
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:51,860
the dentist who drills his own teeth,
has a fool for a patient.

275
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:56,099
Ah, I didn't expect you
to cooperate.

276
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,227
Well, maybe you'll talk...
for Mr Sucky thing.

277
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:06,082
Death has reared
himself a throne,

278
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,591
in a strange city
lying alone.

279
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:11,507
Where good and bad
and worst and best,

280
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:14,559
are gone to
their eternal rest.

281
00:19:16,414 --> 00:19:17,715
That's nice.
What is it?

282
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,061
It's just...
something I made up.

283
00:19:22,062 --> 00:19:25,398
Liar. That's Edgar Allan Poe.
I was there when you read it.

284
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,845
Then why ask?! Just to play
mind games with me?

285
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:33,595
What mind? Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

286
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:35,873
Dick, is that you?

287
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,084
Harry?
- Dick?

288
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:43,811
Harry, open the door!
Open the door!

289
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:47,058
How do I know
it's really you?

290
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:52,125
It's really me!
- Well, you would know that.

291
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,156
Harry! - Dick!
You saved me!

292
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:57,130
God, when I think of
all the times...

293
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:00,023
Oh I'm so glad..

294
00:20:06,213 --> 00:20:07,801
A voice inside of you?

295
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,641
And you never knew
it was there before?

296
00:20:10,163 --> 00:20:13,651
By the second day, I was
hearing my inner voice, too.

297
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:14,353
What was it saying?

298
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:16,623
I have no idea.
I don't speak French.

299
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,022
You should have seen
the janitor's face,

300
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:21,506
when he walked in
on the four of us.

301
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,063
I'm just glad you're alive.

302
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:27,393
Thank you, Sally.
And good work finding me.

303
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,067
Good work?

304
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,233
I was paralyzed. I
thought I could do your job.

305
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:35,898
You're so arrogant,
bossy, and condescending,

306
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,442
you make it
look so easy.

307
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:40,123
Well, I'm not
perfect, lieutenant.

308
00:20:40,545 --> 00:20:43,855
After all, I got locked in
a stairwell for three days,

309
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,638
just because
I needed a cigarette.

310
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:48,162
Yeah, that was stupid.
- Yes, it was.

311
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,854
Really stupid.

312
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:52,598
Point taken.

313
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:56,299
I mean, didn't you even think
to check the door first?

314
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,615
You'd expect a bonehead move
like that from me, but you?

315
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:02,369
Okay, a bonehead is
where I draw the line.

316
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:05,808
Excuse us.
- After all, I am the high commander.

317
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,895
oh, well...
- Whoo-ooh!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
