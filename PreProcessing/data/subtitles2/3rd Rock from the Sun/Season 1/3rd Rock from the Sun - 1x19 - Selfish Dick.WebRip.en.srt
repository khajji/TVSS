1
00:00:10,522 --> 00:00:12,211
What is your problem?
- I'm sorry.

2
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,530
I just can't believe what
passed for literature in the '70s.

3
00:00:15,447 --> 00:00:16,917
Knock, knock, knock.

4
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,385
This delivery came
for you C.O.D.

5
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:21,386
You weren't here, so I paid the guy.

6
00:00:21,387 --> 00:00:24,303
Thank you.
That saves me 28 dollars

7
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:26,535
plus 5 dollars shipping
and handling.

8
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:27,755
What is it?

9
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:30,728
It's something to warm up
my side of the office.

10
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:33,432
Dr. Albright has her
collection of tribal death masks,

11
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,968
and now I have these.

12
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,445
Look at this one.
It says, "plan ahead",

13
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:40,223
but the person
who made it forgot to.

14
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:44,583
Take that, Mr. Advice giver. Pow!

15
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:48,721
"You don't have to be crazy
to work here, but it helps".

16
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:50,942
It sure does!

17
00:00:52,055 --> 00:00:54,856
I can't wait to show these
to Dr. Albright and Nina.

18
00:00:54,857 --> 00:00:56,712
You know, over time,

19
00:00:56,713 --> 00:00:59,350
I've come to think of
them less as my co-workers

20
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,133
and more like
a family.

21
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:03,587
I'm the all-knowing father,
Mary's the wife,

22
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:05,671
and Nina is our
adopted love child.

23
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:08,386
Well, I better
be going.

24
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:11,713
The forecast for today
is laughter.

25
00:01:16,454 --> 00:01:19,377
So, Sally, you still want me
to teach you to make guacamole?

26
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,580
Yeah. I planned
my whole day around it.

27
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,279
Okay. Now... ow! ow!

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,730
Darn.

29
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:29,083
You're bleeding.
- Oh, no, no, I'll be fine.

30
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,626
Just get me a little gauze.
- Sure, I can handle that.

31
00:01:31,627 --> 00:01:33,521
It's just a little
flesh wound.

32
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:36,945
I've inflicted far worse
than that thousands of times.

33
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,044
Of course, never on
creatures who bleed.

34
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,663
I'll just...
- Oh!

35
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:43,446
Sally, are you okay?
- I know what to do.

36
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:46,282
I've seen this before. We've
gotta get this woman to the E.R.

37
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:49,025
Don't worry. Get her into the living room.

38
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,435
I'll put a damp cloth on
her forehead. She'll be fine.

39
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:53,341
Oh, she's a big girl.

40
00:01:53,342 --> 00:01:55,840
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm losing her.

41
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:59,301
Oh! I'm sorry.

42
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,989
 Watch out for the post.
- Huh?

43
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,681
Wait, I gotta rest for a second.
- Yeah, me, too.

44
00:02:09,427 --> 00:02:11,854
You know, maybe
the emergency room

45
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:13,542
isn't such
a bad idea.

46
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:17,663
Let's get her downstairs and
load her into my el Camino.

47
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:20,377
Careful, careful.
- Don't drop her down the stairs.

48
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:21,153
Huh?

49
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,959
I said "don't" drop her
down the stairs.

50
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:32,125
Oh-hh!

51
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,727
"One of these days I am
going to get Organizized".

52
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:26,059
Funny.

53
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,085
I knew you'd love it. Whoever
wrote this is a raving genius.

54
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,607
I have the best news!

55
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:36,011
Professor fuscoe has been
hired by Princeton.

56
00:03:36,012 --> 00:03:38,626
I didn't know the two of you were so close.
- I think he's a moron,

57
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:40,094
but I get his office!

58
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:42,307
The big office
with the bay window

59
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:44,907
and the view of the apple tree?
- Yes!

60
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,419
Nina, you would have
been so proud of me.

61
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,023
As soon as I heard
it was available I went to that

62
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,670
overly friendly woman
who handles these things.

63
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:55,112
Yeah. What is her problem?
- Who cares? Anyway..

64
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,145
It was between me
and professor Suter,

65
00:03:57,146 --> 00:04:00,233
and I said, "Mr. Suter
is a very nice old man,

66
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:03,513
but he seems very content in his
broom closet. Why disturb him"?

67
00:04:03,514 --> 00:04:04,773
And she bought it!

68
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,051
Oh oh, this is
wonderful!

69
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:13,483
My funny signs will look
just great in the new office.

70
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,607
I'll leave the two
of you alone now.

71
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:19,626
Ah, the thing is,

72
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:22,677
the new office,
it's a single.

73
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:25,083
Great! We can share
the same desk.

74
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:29,187
No, you have
to stay here.

75
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,409
Oh, I see.

76
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:34,096
You're leaving me.

77
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,682
I guess it was a mistake
to get so close.

78
00:04:38,874 --> 00:04:40,536
Well, we'll still
see each other.

79
00:04:40,537 --> 00:04:42,485
Oh Please, don't patronize me. Just go.

80
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,137
Dick, I've never had
my own office.

81
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:48,109
I've waited
12 years for this,

82
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,061
and I need the extra space
for my artifacts.

83
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:52,887
To hell with
your tchotchkes!

84
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,239
I want you
to stay here!

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,190
Well, Sometimes you can't
get what you want.

86
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:01,036
You're getting what you want.
- Sometimes you can.

87
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:02,508
I need boxes!

88
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,998
Fine.

89
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:07,036
Mr. Potato man is
all the company I need.

90
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:08,660
Right?

91
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:11,279
Answer me!

92
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,758
She looks just
like snow white.

93
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,374
Snow white with dried
spittle on her chin.

94
00:05:26,086 --> 00:05:27,946
Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

95
00:05:27,947 --> 00:05:32,722
Oh, good, honey,
you're out of the woods.

96
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,655
I'm going to run upstairs
and see a friend of mine.

97
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:37,510
"She just went from a double "d" cup to a "B".

98
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:38,681
What, intentionally?

99
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:42,145
I know.
Can you believe that?

100
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,778
What happened?
- You fainted.

101
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,637
Oh, Sally, you just gotta pull through.
- Ahh!

102
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:52,256
But you're a fighter.
You've always been a fighter.

103
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:55,255
Oh, my god, why are you
talking like that? Am I dying?

104
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,544
Oh no no, that's just the way they
talk on those medical dramas.

105
00:05:58,545 --> 00:05:59,532
Damn it!

106
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:02,890
Okay, Miss Solomon.

107
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:05,598
You might have a slight
concussion from your fall.

108
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,780
I'd like to keep you
overnight for observation.

109
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:09,617
Well...

110
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:11,639
am I going to be
all right?

111
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,557
Don't you worry
about a thing.

112
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,619
We take good care
of people here.

113
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,395
Oh, thank you.

114
00:06:19,396 --> 00:06:21,930
I don't know why, but
that made me feel better.

115
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,799
Can I have a word
with you, doctor?

116
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:32,286
What is it?
- This woman is the only sister I've got,

117
00:06:32,287 --> 00:06:34,246
and if that means
having to use

118
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,963
your best doctors
and nurses,

119
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:39,075
well, I'm just going to
have to live with that...

120
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:41,823
damn it.

121
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:56,827
Dr. Solomon,
I'm Judith.

122
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:59,317
I'm going to be sharing this office with you.
- Judith.

123
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,663
This is my assistant..
my brother, Roger.

124
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:03,040
Roger.

125
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,592
Please don't shake my hand.
I've just washed it.

126
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,229
Two rules: when I do
not wish to be disturbed,

127
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,608
I will place
my nameplate

128
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,331
face down on my desk.

129
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:21,162
And in the morning, whoever
arrives first will flip on the ionizer.

130
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:25,056
You know, the woman who was
previously in this office

131
00:07:25,057 --> 00:07:27,103
had no trouble with
the level of ionization.

132
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,822
Believe me,
you will like me,

133
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,601
most people do.

134
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:54,479
Ha! well,
this is nice.

135
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,447
I rush all the way over here, and
I find you lolling around in bed.

136
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,718
Dick, it was so scary.

137
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:02,109
I was completely unconscious
for a half hour.

138
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,256
Lucky you. After today,
I'd pay to be unconscious.

139
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:09,224
What happened?
- Mary moved into a new office.

140
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:11,179
Uh-huh?
- Meaning?

141
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,186
I don't want
her to move.

142
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:15,171
I don't care if it's
the office of her dreams.

143
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:18,332
I don't care if she's never been
happier. I'm so lonesome, I could die.

144
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,243
Hello! Sally's
in the hospital.

145
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:23,933
Oh...yeah..anyway..

146
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:26,238
from now on,
I'm thinking only of myself.

147
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,314
I'm going to be completely..
 what's the word for it?

148
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,475
Selfish.
- No, Smart.

149
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:34,043
I'm getting her back,
no matter what.

150
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:36,879
I thought you said she was happy there.
- She thinks she is,

151
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,098
but what does
she know?

152
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,897
I'm the high commander. I
know what's best for everything.

153
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:43,867
Now, why was I here?

154
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:47,052
Oh, right. Get well.
That's an order.

155
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,718
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have to liberate old man Suter

156
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:52,304
from his broom closet.

157
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:57,012
I brought you some jell-o...
Ahhh aahh aah!

158
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,777
Professor Suter, a
terrible injustice has been done.

159
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:09,825
What?

160
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:15,372
I said, a terrible injustice has been done!

161
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:18,072
I heard you.
What's the big injustice?

162
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,525
Somebody has
taken something

163
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,654
that rightfully belongs to you.
- What?

164
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,230
Somebody has
taken something

165
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:28,596
that rightfully
belongs to you!

166
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,346
Are you okay?
Professor Suter?

167
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:33,495
Are you okay?!

168
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,910
Yes, the one
with the bay window

169
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,327
and the apple tree.

170
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,420
How long has it been
since we talked?

171
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:47,383
Seven years? Well, you be good. Bye-bye.

172
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:52,597
Company.
- Look who I ran into Mary.

173
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,253
You remember
professor Suter.

174
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:58,292
Hello, Mary.
- Hello, professor.

175
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,758
Dr. Solomon told me
about your good fortune.

176
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,712
I wanted to say
congratulations.

177
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:05,964
Thank you.

178
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:08,708
I used to have an eye
out for this office.

179
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:11,746
Ah, the bay window!

180
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:15,665
And the apple tree.

181
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:19,295
My wife and I used to
picnic under it all the time.

182
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:22,279
She's dead now.
- Oh.

183
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,841
Mary, you have
better eyes than I.

184
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:28,443
Do you see anything carved
on the trunk out there?

185
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:32,008
No.

186
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:36,768
Oh I see it.
It's a heart.
A heart, Mary.

187
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,459
I carved it on the day I proposed,

188
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,905
right before I went out to fight the Germans.
- Oh.

189
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,340
You must have loved
her very much.

190
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,837
You'll never know.

191
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:53,364
Mary, I have a very special
favour to ask of you.

192
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,073
What?

193
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:01,054
Could you
some afternoon

194
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:02,835
help me gather
apple blossoms

195
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,469
and then take
them with me

196
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,304
to my wife's grave?

197
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,835
'Kay.

198
00:11:11,945 --> 00:11:16,504
Bless you, Mary.
- Come on, professor Suter.

199
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:20,000
Let me walk you down
to your... tiny office.

200
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:22,223
I think Dr. Albright
wants to be alone

201
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,941
with her thoughts.

202
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,532
Don't you let him
manipulate you.

203
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,444
This is your office. I'm not just
saying that because I finally got a window.

204
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,983
I'm being objective.
- I know you are,

205
00:11:33,764 --> 00:11:35,374
but I'm starting
to feel bad.

206
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,812
You listen to me, woman.
Keep the dream alive.

207
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:44,658
I'm really going
to miss this place.

208
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:47,847
Yeah, but you got
some lovely prizes.

209
00:11:47,848 --> 00:11:50,063
I know.
A sipper cup,

210
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,211
a pair of circulation socks
and a kidney-shaped salad bowl.

211
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,945
Sweet!
- I could just hang out here all day.

212
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,289
I know,
it's like Disneyland

213
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,913
with a slightly higher
fatality rate.

214
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,080
Hey, look what I got.

215
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:05,515
Ooh!
- Wow!

216
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,212
It was just hanging over
there behind a door.

217
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:09,924
Whoa!
are there any left?

218
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:12,067
Yeah, and the best part is,
you can go anywhere you want to,

219
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,775
people treat you like a god,

220
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,251
and you get 10% off
everything at the gift shop.

221
00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:22,258
Let's go.

222
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,047
I need two more units of "o"
negative. 10 cc's of narcane.

223
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:30,176
Come on.
- I want done directly now. Do it.

224
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:31,938
Whoa! Here comes
another one.

225
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,639
Check for vitals.
- Rest: 12, bp: 140/100.

226
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,710
Got a difficult airway.
Can't get through.

227
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:42,239
probably ruptured his aorta.
- All right, hold his legs.

228
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,168
It just never ends.
- And what if it did?

229
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,197
Let's just pray
that day never comes.

230
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:53,118
Let's go.
- Yeah!

231
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,244
So...

232
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:03,794
you got plans
for tonight?

233
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:06,002
Personally, you kidding?

234
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:09,515
I could sleep forever.

235
00:13:09,883 --> 00:13:11,497
When's our next shift?

236
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:12,931
Well, it's
hard to say.

237
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:14,378
We're not doctors.

238
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,127
Hello, everyone!
- You're in a good mood.

239
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:21,239
I'm in a great mood.
- Did Dr. Albright move back in with you?

240
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,553
Not yet.
But today I realised

241
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:26,786
it's not about getting Mary
back and getting what I want.

242
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:29,708
It's about getting justice
for professor Suter...

243
00:13:30,987 --> 00:13:32,697
and getting what I want.

244
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:36,365
So I called up the Dean, and
I told him it was a travesty

245
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:39,139
to keep a 75-year-old man
locked away in the basement.

246
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,952
Now I'm ready to...

247
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,305
par-tay.

248
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,392
So what are we
celebrating, brotha?

249
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,306
My ruthless commitment
to myself.

250
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:51,135
Wow. You're not just
the high commander,

251
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:53,421
you're presidential
material.

252
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,548
Looks like
a burst appendix.

253
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:08,550
Don't let the saline
count fool you.

254
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:10,974
I know this man
is a diabetic.

255
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:14,916
No, he isn't.
- You're suspended.

256
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:21,757
She's going to be
all right, isn't she?

257
00:14:25,295 --> 00:14:26,612
She's going
to be fine.

258
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:30,307
Here, let me show you what
a doctor once did for me.

259
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,132
Everything's going
to be all right.

260
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:38,423
We take good care
of people here.

261
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:43,071
Thank you, doctor.

262
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:47,553
This must be a tough job.
- Oh, ugh.

263
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,080
I've seen stuff that would make
your eyes pop out of your head

264
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,824
and splatter
against the wall.

265
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,043
In fact, I have
seen that, too.

266
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,537
Looks like
a burst appendix.

267
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:03,726
Don't let the saline
count fool you.

268
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:06,651
I know this man
is a diabetic.

269
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,321
This is a uterus.

270
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,930
You're suspended.

271
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:16,570
Father rice,
I find myself

272
00:15:16,571 --> 00:15:19,057
in the midst
of a moral dilemma.

273
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,203
That's why we have a
theology department, Dick.

274
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,496
What can I do for you?
- It's professor Albright.

275
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,199
She's strayed.

276
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:30,282
No news there.

277
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,604
Uh...who is it this time?

278
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:38,134
Professor Suter.

279
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:40,520
Ooh.

280
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,678
That's why, father,
I implore you

281
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,661
to use your position
to shame her.

282
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:51,669
Uh, that's not exactly
what we do anymore.

283
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,238
Someone's got to get her
out of that new office.

284
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,865
New office?

285
00:15:57,716 --> 00:15:59,127
Up on the second floor.

286
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:03,031
Bay window, apple tree?
- Yeah, that's the one.

287
00:16:03,904 --> 00:16:05,715
I'll be darned.
I hadn't heard.

288
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,280
So Albright got
that office, huh?

289
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,074
Hmm. Thank you, Dick.

290
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,274
Roger says you must never
leave these on his desk again.

291
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:23,549
Whatever.

292
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:30,135
"One of these days I am
going to get Organizized".

293
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:34,853
That's marvelous!

294
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:37,262
It's moronic!
Now be quiet.

295
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,246
There you are.

296
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:49,576
You were right.
It was a burst appendix.

297
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,525
The saline count
fooled me.

298
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:56,587
I didn't know he had
diabetes. He'll live now.

299
00:16:57,606 --> 00:16:59,510
Remember this face...

300
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,938
and beg
that one day

301
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,709
you'll be half
the professional that..

302
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,605
Dr. Moshepipchik is.

303
00:17:15,795 --> 00:17:16,455
Get out of my way.

304
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:18,406
Can't you people see
I'm carrying a box?

305
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:20,294
Nina!

306
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,785
Mary, you're back.
- Yes, I'm back.

307
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:27,508
Dean Sumner said
it was an oversight,

308
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:30,106
that he had already promised
my office to someone else.

309
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:33,296
Backstabbing weasel. That's
the last time I suck up to him.

310
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,516
Professor Suter.

311
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,832
So I guess everything
worked out, huh?

312
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,107
Oh, shut up.

313
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:43,838
Thanks to that idiot
campaign you mounted on my behalf,

314
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,070
they're forcing me to retire.
- Why?

315
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:48,489
Because you reminded them
I was over 70

316
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,345
and still
on the payroll.

317
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:52,559
I haven't taught a class in four years.

318
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,832
What have you been
doing all this time?

319
00:17:57,402 --> 00:17:59,112
Working on
my screenplay.

320
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:01,131
It's like "die hard",

321
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:03,601
but it's set
in an office building.

322
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,619
"Die hard" was
in an office building.

323
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:09,570
Up yours.

324
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:14,079
Mary?
- What?

325
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:16,508
Somewhere in the recesses
of your heart,

326
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:18,187
aren't you just
the tiniest bit happy

327
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:20,435
that we're
a family again?

328
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,783
This isn't oncology.
This is a hospital, damn it.

329
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:32,952
Aww ha, look at all
the little people!

330
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,000
Hello, precious.

331
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:41,316
Hello!
- Wow!

332
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,673
That one right there looks
just like Winston Churchill.

333
00:18:43,838 --> 00:18:45,462
So does that one.

334
00:18:45,463 --> 00:18:48,703
Hey, this one looks like
black Winston Churchill.

335
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,515
It's amazing,
isn't it?

336
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:02,273
An entire ward
of pure distilled life.

337
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,917
I guess people don't just
come here to get repaired.

338
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:11,955
Aw! Shh! don't cry sweetheart.

339
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,404
This part's easy.

340
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,515
Just wait till you have to
choose a long distance carrier.

341
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:22,450
I wish I could have started
from scratch like you guys..

342
00:19:23,289 --> 00:19:25,208
knowing,
but not knowing.

343
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:30,247
Seeing, and then
all at once forgetting.

344
00:19:32,195 --> 00:19:33,440
Enjoy it.

345
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,212
Time here moves
really fast.

346
00:19:43,644 --> 00:19:45,649
Father, I've made
a terrible mistake.

347
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,733
In order to get my way,
I've harmed a friend..

348
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,526
someone I deeply love..

349
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,527
a man I barely know,

350
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:56,166
and a large unpleasant
woman in sensible shoes.

351
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,205
I feel just awful.

352
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:01,005
Dick?

353
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,387
All of god's creatures

354
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:04,878
make mistakes,

355
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,014
and he forgives them.

356
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,316
Let me show you something.

357
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:12,955
When I walk up
to my bay window

358
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,127
and see that
apple tree outside,

359
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:18,654
I'm reminded of
how simple life can be

360
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:20,537
when it becomes
less about having

361
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,342
and more about being.

362
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,832
Oh, you're
a good man, father,

363
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:29,027
in a really, really
great office.

364
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:32,277
It is isn't it?

365
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,742
When I've realized that when
getting what you want

366
00:20:35,743 --> 00:20:37,383
comes at the expense
of others,

367
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:40,207
it's not all
satisfying

368
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,112
Even if it's the last
bag of circus peanuts?

369
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:46,742
Well, that would be
pretty satisfying.

370
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,476
This came for you from the hospital.
- Those people are so nice.

371
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:53,684
It's probably
a "get well" card.

372
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,777
It's a bill
for 35 hundred dollars.

373
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,449
Oh, look. It's says, "thank
you for your prompt payment".

374
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,881
Did you pay them?
- No.

375
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:05,926
I didn't pay 'em.
- Wasn't me.

376
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,480
Well, somebody
must have paid them.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
