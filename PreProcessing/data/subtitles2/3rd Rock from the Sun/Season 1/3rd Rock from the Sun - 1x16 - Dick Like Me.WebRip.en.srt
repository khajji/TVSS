1
00:00:01,254 --> 00:00:03,786
Why do we have to come to
school to talk to Tommy's teachers?

2
00:00:03,787 --> 00:00:06,178
I know, it's a waste of time.
Why can't they come to us?

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,406
The high school teachers on this
planet are so full of themselves.

4
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:12,771
It's all those TV
commercials glorifying learning.

5
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:14,612
You know,
"the more you know".

6
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:18,412
It makes them
drunk with power.

7
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:20,749
Yeah, well, that's going
to change right now.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,599
Where's this
Mr. Randell, anyway?

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,752
When that mealymouthed
little worm shows up,

10
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:26,485
I'm going to teach him
the meaning of the word..

11
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:28,386
hiya.

12
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:31,558
Dr. And Mrs. Solomon?
- No.

13
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,612
No, no, no.

14
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,879
I'm his sister,
a woman.

15
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:42,006
Not married.
Just me,

16
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:43,754
single Sally.

17
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:47,507
Mr. Randell, I'd like to get out of
here while I'm still clean-shaven.

18
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:50,783
So you can begin lavishing
Tommy with praises

19
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:51,934
anytime you're ready.

20
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,538
Well, the truth is
that...

21
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:56,969
I think Tommy can do
a lot better.

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,919
Be careful, sir. You're
talking about the creature

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,483
I've come to
think of as my son.

24
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:03,491
He could do better.

25
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:05,677
You know...

26
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:10,013
whatever.
- Excuse us.

27
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:11,626
What are you doing?
- I don't know.

28
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:13,239
He's giving off this vibe.
Can't you feel it?

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,737
Yes, I think I do.

30
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:16,191
Does it feel like a
stabbing pain in your left buttock?

31
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:21,120
No.
- Then I appear to be sitting on a tack.

32
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:26,466
Dr. Solomon, Tommy's
very bright, no question.

33
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,478
Unfortunately, Tommy's having
a little trouble fitting in.

34
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,210
What do you mean, fitting in?
- Excuse me,

35
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,035
but there's something about
the thickness of your neck

36
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:35,229
and the broadness
of your shoulders

37
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,055
that makes me think
you'd be an agile hunter

38
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,007
and provide well
for our children.

39
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:44,313
I chaperone the school
dance every year.

40
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:45,636
Would you..?
- Yes.

41
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,803
Great.
- Wait a minute. What about Tommy?

42
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:51,148
He's fine.
Great kid.

43
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:52,819
Well...

44
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,112
why didn't you say so
in the first place?

45
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:58,232
Next time, you might try
organizing your thoughts

46
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,922
on a little index
card first.

47
00:01:59,923 --> 00:02:01,523
Come on, Sally.
- Ow!

48
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,003
Wasn't he cute?
- Totally adorable.

49
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,681
A little on the scattered side, though.
- He asked me to a dance.

50
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,571
I get to go dancing!
- Nice.

51
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:12,237
What's dancing?

52
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,046
Harry, can I ask you
a question?

53
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,511
Uh, sure.
Just give me a second

54
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:04,252
to finish what
I was doing.

55
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:13,497
Okay, what is it?

56
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,397
Can you dance?
- Hmm.

57
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,230
I have no idea, but I'll try.

58
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,250
Why, yes, I can.

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,250
It appears
I'm quite good.

60
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:33,524
How are you doing that?
- I have no idea.

61
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:36,183
I think it's sort of a
built-In function. You try.

62
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:44,727
Wow! You suck.

63
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:49,832
You must feel
like crap.

64
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,805
That's it,
spank me.

65
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:03,322
Tommy, I talked to your
teacher, Mr. Randell.

66
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:06,315
He said that you're not fitting in.
- Of course I'm not fitting in.

67
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:09,654
To fit in, you have to be something.
- Well, we're something.

68
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:12,121
We're human beings. Why,
has anyone said differently?

69
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:15,717
No, it's just everybody at
school is something extra.

70
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:18,343
You know, they're African-
American or Italian-American

71
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,892
or Asian-American,
audio-Visual American.

72
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:25,050
Well, we're human-American.
That should be enough.

73
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:27,753
Dick, it's part of my
mission as an adolescent

74
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:29,350
to rebel against
my upbringing.

75
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:32,127
If you don't tell me what we
are, then I can't do my job.

76
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,312
Frankly, I can't work like this.

77
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,352
All right, if we have to be
part of some group, we will be.

78
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:41,385
I'll do some research.
I'll ask around.

79
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:43,263
I'll find out what
the best thing to be is.

80
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:46,711
By the end of the week, we'll be that.
- What should I be till then?

81
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,845
Well, we're
carbon-Based life-forms.

82
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:51,155
Just tell everyone
we're carbo-Americans.

83
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:00,955
Aztec, Toltec,

84
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,681
Toltec, Inca, Inuit,

85
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:05,490
Bedouin, Indian,

86
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,443
Sikh.

87
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:10,362
Aztec, Toltec,
Toltec, Inca, Inuit,

88
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:11,491
Bedouin, Indian, Sikh.

89
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,357
Aztec, Toltec, Toltec,
Inca, Inuit, Bedouin, in..

90
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:16,865
what are you doing
at my desk?

91
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,362
Anthropology,
it's fascinating.

92
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:21,465
Such a wealth
of cultures.

93
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,029
Up until now, I always thought
that what you did was pointless

94
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,987
and of no interest
to anyone but yourself.

95
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:30,377
It's certainly not as fascinating as physics.

96
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:32,435
I mean, everybody
loves maths.

97
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,369
Get away from my desk.

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,401
Nina, what is that thing on your head?

99
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:42,276
It's called a "daku".
- I think it's beautiful.

100
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:43,745
Thank you.
It's authentic.

101
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:46,713
It makes me feel connected to my ancestors.
- Oh.

102
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,491
So that's the traditional
headdress of ancient secretaries?

103
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:59,338
No, of my African
ancestors.

104
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,020
In case you haven't noticed, I'm black.

105
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,305
Well, of course
I noticed.

106
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,879
And, Dr. Albright,
you are?

107
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,965
Could I be
any whiter?

108
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:15,804
What?

109
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,522
I'm sorry, all you people look alike to me.

110
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:20,402
Excuse me?
- What was that?

111
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:24,006
Nothing, I just don't see why
people have to divide up

112
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,594
into these
arbitrary subsets.

113
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,703
I mean, skin color? Please.

114
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:30,812
you may see color,
but I see people.

115
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:35,142
Aren't we fortunate to
have someone so enlightened?

116
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:38,172
O pious one,
show us the way.

117
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,051
This verges
on sarcasm.

118
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:44,308
You know, my heritage
happens to be very important to me.

119
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:47,752
As it should be. I'm Irish,
and I'm very proud of that.

120
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,880
And you're... what?

121
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,660
Me? Uh,
I,I,I'm, uh...

122
00:06:52,661 --> 00:06:53,853
one of those, uh...

123
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:56,620
you know, one of
the really good ones.

124
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:01,092
You're this big
anthropologist. You tell me. What am I?

125
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:05,365
Certifiable.
- Yes, that's what I am....Certifiable.

126
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,569
Certifiable and
damn proud of it,

127
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,283
as my father was before me
and his father before him

128
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:11,827
and his father
before him.

129
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,489
Certifiable.

130
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:16,283
Of course,
we no longer practice.

131
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:25,193
You see, Sally, dancing
is all about attitude.

132
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,287
Watch Harry.

133
00:07:26,288 --> 00:07:30,272
See, I got that "hip-hop,
street, don't care about Nothin'

134
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:31,524
'cause I'm all of that

135
00:07:31,525 --> 00:07:34,242
and a side of fries"
kind of attitude.

136
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:36,261
Right, whereas
my attitude is more

137
00:07:36,262 --> 00:07:39,184
got home from teaching physics
and I'm wondering what's for dinner

138
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:42,414
but I ain't gonna sweat it '
cause I ain't even from here.

139
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,600
hey! Ho, ho!

140
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,244
Hey! Ho, ho!

141
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:49,230
Although we dis 'em,
we love this solar system

142
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,388
I hate this!
- What?

143
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,197
I can't believe I have to
learn to dance to be with this guy.

144
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:01,373
Well, you know, if you
really want Mr. Randell,

145
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,539
use the skills you're
comfortable with.

146
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,711
Shoot a tranquilizer dart into his
neck and drag him back to your place.

147
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,813
Harry, that is not the
behavior of a human female.

148
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:14,165
Exactly. I want to
charm him, beguile him.

149
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,449
I want him to buy me
a pwesent.

150
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:20,012
Tommy, how was school?
- Awful.

151
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:23,733
I lost my math book, and I couldn't
convince anybody that I was Samoan.

152
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,624
Well, don't worry.

153
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,696
The answer to all our
problems is right here in this book.

154
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:31,883
It's loaded with every
possible genre of human.

155
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,041
It's like a catalog.

156
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:35,591
You can take your pick,
whatever you want to be.

157
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:39,433
So who do you want to join, hmm?
- They're too scrawny.

158
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:42,183
Mm-hmm. Them?
- No, ugly flag.

159
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:45,701
Nah, too many gods.

160
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,278
I'm not putting that
on my head.

161
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:51,109
Ah-ha! Here we go.

162
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,273
Canadians.
Yeah, right.

163
00:08:57,347 --> 00:09:00,258
Now, let's have a look at
Einstein's boundary conditions

164
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,160
according to the theory
of relativity.

165
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,420
Einstein, a Jew,

166
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:07,274
never could have made
this breakthrough,

167
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:10,717
had it not been for the
earlier work of Copernicus, polish,

168
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,840
or tycho Brahe,

169
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,140
the unlucky Dane
from Prague.

170
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:17,169
Which brings up
another question..

171
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,443
how many Puerto Ricans do we
have in class? Any Puerto Ricans?

172
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:25,229
Leon, what are you?
- You don't have to answer that.

173
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,358
Dutch.
- I love your tulips and your dikes.

174
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,761
Oh, thank you.

175
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:33,578
However, I turn your people
down because of the silly shoes.

176
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:36,775
Okay, no Puerto Ricans?
Any Latinos in general?

177
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,513
Anyone with
Latino information?

178
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,479
Dr. Solomon, with all due
respect, I find this offensive.

179
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,368
Pittman, you won't be left
out. I'll get to the Asians.

180
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:49,159
Why are you suddenly so
interested in what everybody is?

181
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,322
I have to know. It's important.
- No, it's not.

182
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:52,504
Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

183
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:53,876
Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

184
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:55,535
Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

185
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,922
The only thing that
matters about a person

186
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,824
is what they
have inside.

187
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:01,564
Oh, yeah?
Then how come

188
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,039
you only date
good-looking guys?

189
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:06,617
That's not true.
- You turned him down.

190
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:07,781
Shut up!

191
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:13,858
Here are your books.
I read each one of them,

192
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:15,813
and I'm just as confused
as I ever was.

193
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:19,169
You read 15 books
in one night?

194
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,400
I took a couple
of hours out

195
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,258
to watch Japanese
golf on cable.

196
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,450
The problem is, these
books are full of dry facts

197
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:30,086
but no value judgments.

198
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,723
I mean, this is your field.. you tell me.

199
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:35,697
Out of all the possible ethnic
groups, which one is the best?

200
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:39,121
Oh, no, there's no best.
It's all subjective.

201
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:41,899
Which do you find the most interesting?
- There are so many.

202
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,061
Um... I love the creative
ambition of the Maori people,

203
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,953
uh, the Polynesian
culture

204
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:49,976
with its joyous
embrace of nature,

205
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:52,319
uh, the quiet
dignity of..

206
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,150
what's the sexiest?
- Italians.

207
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:58,047
Italians?
- Smoky, swarthy.

208
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,176
Gotta have 'em.

209
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:01,277
Gotta go.

210
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,413
Italian?

211
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:15,274
In napoli

212
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:19,309
where love is king

213
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:24,112
where a boy
meets a girl

214
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:28,725
here's a-what-a
they sing

215
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,138
when-a Da moon

216
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:37,396
hits your eye
like a big pizza pie

217
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,505
that's Amore

218
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:45,043
what are you doing?
- Buona sera, Signorina.

219
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,712
When-a Da world
seems to shine

220
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,716
like-a you've had
you too much wine

221
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:57,170
that's Amore

222
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:01,427
there's a ring
ting-A-ling-a-ling

223
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:03,943
ting-a-ling-a-ling
and we sing

224
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,107
vi...

225
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:08,863
Ta Bella

226
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:13,216
hearts will play tippy-
tippy-Tay tippy-tippy-Tay

227
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,026
like a gay...

228
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:21,034
tar... antella

229
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:28,303
What the hell's going on out there!

230
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:30,716
Nothing, Mr. Wagner!

231
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:34,599
Would you please get out of here
before somebody calls the cops?

232
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,797
The cops, they cannot-a thwart my passion!

233
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,621
I will stand
right here

234
00:12:39,622 --> 00:12:43,415
till a pack of wild dogs,
they chase-a me away!

235
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,639
Dogs!  Run!

236
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,971
Usually when a student gets
hurt, we let them go home early.

237
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,366
Someone from your family
could come pick you up.

238
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,828
Someone like...

239
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,450
Sally.

240
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:12,901
Why did you say
her name like that?

241
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,794
All I said was...

242
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,020
Sally.

243
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,516
No, thank you. I don't
really need to get picked up.

244
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:25,585
Exactly what happened?
- I don't know what I did wrong,

245
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:27,615
but I'm kind of new
at being Korean.

246
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:41,539
Oops. You left this
in my driveway.

247
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,069
What happened to it?
- I backed over it

248
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,345
five or six times.

249
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:48,685
It was an accident.

250
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,797
Do you have any idea

251
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,236
how badly you embarrassed me last night?

252
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:55,583
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

253
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,594
to find a concertina
in Ohio?

254
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,716
What the hell was
going on in your head?

255
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:04,291
I know what this is. You don't
like Italians as much as you claim.

256
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,707
Wait a minute, since when
don't you like Italians?

257
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,315
Please, we're discussing prejudice
here, something you know nothing about.

258
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:15,333
I'm black.
- Oh!

259
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,294
Right, right.

260
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:21,312
Nina is... black.

261
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,335
Sally, come out of there.
- Go away!

262
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,461
Then we're coming in!

263
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:37,341
What's wrong?
You look beautiful.

264
00:14:37,342 --> 00:14:39,970
Sure, you can put on a tight
little dress and look sexy and gorgeous,

265
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:41,239
but you know
how men are..

266
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,331
all they care about
is how you dance.

267
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:46,249
What's the matter with you?
- I'm afraid.

268
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,494
Of what?
- I'm afraid I'm going to do something stupid,

269
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,308
and he won't
like me.

270
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:52,802
Don't leak. I hate it when you leak.

271
00:14:52,803 --> 00:14:55,497
What's wrong with me?
- I have no idea.

272
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:58,660
Dick, maybe I'm just
shooting pork in a barrel here,

273
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:02,008
but isn't that exactly how
you feel about Dr. Albright?

274
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:04,229
Oh, please.
- That is so wrong.

275
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,275
What I have with Dr. Albright...
- Mr. Randell is young...

276
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,004
Come in!

277
00:15:11,005 --> 00:15:12,232
Ow.

278
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:16,015
Sorry to interrupt, but,
Sally, your date's here.

279
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,409
What am I going to do?
- I'll tell you what you're going to do.

280
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,256
You're going to be great! You know why?
- Why?

281
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:23,242
Because you're one of us. And
although I don't know what that is yet,

282
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:26,045
when I find out, that's what you'll be.
- Thank you.

283
00:15:26,046 --> 00:15:27,138
Everybody ready?
- Ready.

284
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:27,945
Let's go.

285
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:31,039
Now go out there
and be a girl!

286
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,983
You look incredible.

287
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:43,952
Come on!
- Thank you.

288
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:45,852
That's very sweet of you.

289
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,885
Well...

290
00:15:57,616 --> 00:16:00,210
well... so..
- What?

291
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:03,042
Would you like to..
- Bear your children?

292
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:08,253
No. I was going
to say "dance.

293
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,527
Oh.

294
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:13,721
Uh, that was really
embarrassing, wasn't it?

295
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,734
No.

296
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:18,013
No, not at all.
So would you like to?

297
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:19,051
Bear your children?

298
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:22,786
Dance?

299
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,883
Oh. Um...

300
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:28,658
well, see, I don't
really think that that would...Okay.

301
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:44,902
Ahhhh.

302
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:47,815
Now, this I can do.

303
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,603
I was kind of afraid
to come here tonight.

304
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:56,114
Why?
- I just wasn't sure I'd have a good time.

305
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,475
Oh. Are you having
a good time?

306
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:01,691
Oh, yeah.

307
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:05,871
Can I put my arm
around you?

308
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:08,393
Yes.

309
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,270
Can I put my head
on your shoulder?

310
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:16,635
Please.

311
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,345
Can I put my hand
in your pocket?

312
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:32,749
Do you need change?

313
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,397
Desperately.

314
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:40,451
You're so
wonderful. My whole front is warm.

315
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,357
You mind if I turn around?
- Well, I..

316
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,825
mmm.

317
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:49,985
Toasty.

318
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,164
I don't want to put you on the
spot, but if we don't kiss soon,

319
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,804
my head's going
to explode.

320
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:59,639
You know what's good for that?
What?  Calcium.

321
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:16,560
Whoa, this
planet sucks

322
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,425
lord, it makes me
wanna cry

323
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,446
yeah, I said
this planet sucks

324
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:26,893
lord, it makes
a poor boy wanna cry

325
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,603
anybody'd know
we was leavin

326
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:34,489
lord, I might just lay
my head down and die

327
00:18:35,296 --> 00:18:36,676
Tommy, what are
you doing?

328
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:38,197
Well, I'm black now.

329
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,951
I'm black,
and I got the blues.

330
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,477
You can't be black.
Nina is black.

331
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:47,312
I get the impression from her they
have strict rules about these things.

332
00:18:47,313 --> 00:18:51,070
I can't even be black ?
- I command you to put that thing down.

333
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,707
High commander
starts bossin'

334
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,373
best believe
you better jump

335
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:57,355
ooh!

336
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:59,821
All right, stop it!

337
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:00,853
Stop it!

338
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,755
Who died and made you
t-Bone walker?

339
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:09,638
Mrs. Dubcek, as long
as you're up here,

340
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:11,760
what ethnic group
do you come from?

341
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:14,502
Well, I'm a little Czech, a little Romanian.

342
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:17,854
I'm your basic Slavic mutt,
like my third husband.

343
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:20,330
Oh. What were
your first two?

344
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:25,034
Well, the first was Irish, and
the second was one of your people.

345
00:19:29,964 --> 00:19:32,635
Our people?
- Yeah. Well, you know, Jewish.

346
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,061
Jewish! Oooh!

347
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,174
So what tipped
you off?

348
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:45,588
With your name it's pretty obvious.
- Our name?

349
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:46,696
Solomon.

350
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:50,320
Oh, you wonderful,
wonderful woman!

351
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:51,995
Thank you so much!

352
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,367
I have to go now.

353
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,895
This rules.
I'm still a minority.

354
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,664
You know, chicks
dig minorities.

355
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,114
Oh! Who knew that Solomon
was a Jewish name

356
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:03,852
when we took it off
the side of that truck?

357
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,547
Go figure. We could have
been the wal-marts.

358
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,270
We're Jewish.

359
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:16,025
I don't know
what to say.

360
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:18,203
Mazel tov!

361
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:24,355
I'm sorry,
it just popped out.

362
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:28,770
Isn't it great
to know who we are?

363
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:31,040
I finally feel
like I belong

364
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,973
to big melting pot
they call earth.

365
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:37,549
What a magical night.

366
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:42,163
Everything was perfect.
I was great.

367
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,138
He really liked
my kissing,

368
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:48,722
except the spitting
and biting.

369
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:52,503
So you really like him, huh?
- What's not to like?

370
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:54,840
He's intelligent, kind,

371
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:56,203
sweet, gentle.

372
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,787
So...

373
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:01,773
is he Jewish?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
