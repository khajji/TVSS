1
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,157
Aliens are all around us.

2
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:05,969
This is the story of a band
of four such explorers.

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,760
In order to blend in they
have assumed human form.

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,208
This is the high commander.

5
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,779
He has assembled an elite team of experts.

6
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,904
A decorated military officer.

7
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:19,247
A seasoned intelligent specialist.

8
00:00:19,304 --> 00:00:22,354
And...well, they had an extra seat.

9
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,673
The Earth is covered with
a deep hard crust.

10
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:28,236
Although it does have
a wonderful chewy center.

11
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:59,766
Is it cable yet?
hey, hey, is it cable?

12
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,574
You're wired.
Ohhhhh

13
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:05,158
This is the second
most exciting thing

14
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:07,616
I've ever held
in my hand.

15
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:09,184
Harry, you ready to go?

16
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,966
Oh Dick, we've got cable,
72 channels.

17
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,613
And unlike primitive
free television,

18
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:18,620
this one you get to pay for.
That's nice.

19
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,660
Sally, are you finished in the bathroom yet?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:25,714
You live in an attic?
You're poor?

21
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:27,692
It's so cool.

22
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:29,638
Thanks.
Hi!

23
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,909
Who's that?
This is Cheryl. She's a cheerleader.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,555
A what?
Show them a cheer.

25
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:35,990
Oh not in front of all these people.
Come on, come on.

26
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:36,807
Okay.

27
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:41,897
Ready! Okay!

28
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:49,402
R a m s
Let's go, rams!

29
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:51,099
Whoo!

30
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,059
So...

31
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:57,467
she's proud
of her spelling.

32
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:59,579
I'll meet you in the
kitchen. We can study in there.

33
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,299
Tommy, what happened
to August?

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,086
August?... well, August
is bright and intelligent

35
00:02:05,087 --> 00:02:07,119
and funny, and I love
to be with her, but,

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,792
Cheryl's easy.

37
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,151
So you're jeopardizing
a meaningful relationship,

38
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:14,201
for pure physical pleasure.
Exactly.

39
00:02:14,257 --> 00:02:16,245
Very well. Carry on.
Thank you, sir.

40
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,443
Sally, here's your coat.

41
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,129
And I want you to be
on your best behavior.

42
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,208
This is a party in honour
of Leonard Hanlin.

43
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,732
Why? Nobody
likes him.

44
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,778
They hate him,
but they honour him.

45
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:29,535
It's a human phenomenon
that I find fascinating.

46
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,773
Behind his back
they deride him,

47
00:02:31,774 --> 00:02:34,335
but to his face
they kiss his ass.

48
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:37,242
Well, that's just the kind of
stunt you can see only on cable.

49
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,252
Plus we got sports,
music, movies.

50
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,701
Oh, and look.

51
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:44,948
"El mundo pacífico"

52
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:51,512
Ah, that's muy bueno.
No.

53
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:11,220
Oh.
English, Spanish, French...

54
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:14,269
I know, I know.

55
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,757
Earth.. go figure.

56
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,641
Dr. Hanlin, it is an honour
to have you here.

57
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:24,198
Well, thank you,
Dean Sumner.

58
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:26,709
And, you,
be a pleasant toady

59
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,366
and bring me another one
of those, would you?

60
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:33,484
Dr. Hanlin, we so admire
your accomplishments.

61
00:03:33,485 --> 00:03:36,216
Well, I admire your
courage, Mrs. Sumner.

62
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,065
An Audubon print over
the mantle passing for art..

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,423
that takes guts.

64
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,813
Look who I found.
It's Dr. Solomon.

65
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,853
Well, an honest man
in a den of bootlickers,

66
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:53,621
not that I don't enjoy
having my boots licked.

67
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,161
It's just that I find
you all contemptible.

68
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:00,220
So tell me, Dick, what
do you think of my work?

69
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,733
Mechanistic
and disturbingly fascist,

70
00:04:02,734 --> 00:04:06,152
but pretentious high schoolers
might find it thought-provoking.

71
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:08,939
I think it's
groundbreaking.

72
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,424
I don't need the opinion
of a water boy with tenure.

73
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:13,457
I'm talking
to my friend.

74
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,355
I like you, Solomon.

75
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:18,907
Well, I don't
like you.

76
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,157
But I don't think anybody
hates me more than your friend,

77
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:26,178
doctor, um...
- Albright.

78
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:29,301
Yes. Probably because
I turned her down.

79
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,602
I need something
from the bar.

80
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:33,565
Yes, that should solve
all your problems.

81
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,058
Well, then let's
get drinking.

82
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,764
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

83
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,458
Well, somebody
said there was a

84
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:44,155
giant flaming
jackass over here.

85
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:47,080
They put it out.

86
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,168
I hate that man.

87
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,063
I wish there was some way he could be..

88
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:55,464
nicer?
No, dead.

89
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,756
Well, you're published
again. Congratulations.

90
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:02,269
Nina, what are
you doing here?

91
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:03,978
You're a secretary.

92
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,516
You're Dr. Solomon's
sister.

93
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,725
You're a lot better-looking
than he is.

94
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:16,600
Hey, I'm up here.

95
00:05:17,857 --> 00:05:19,906
Yes, all women would
like to think that.

96
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,554
How would you like
to have your eyeballs

97
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:26,381
in the bottom of a martini
glass? 'Cause I can do it.

98
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:30,580
Oh, oo-ooh.. The amazon's going
to manhandle me.

99
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,333
You're not worth
a broken nail.

100
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,064
Dr. Hanlin?

101
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:48,303
Dr. Hanlin!
Somebody call 9-1-1.

102
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:51,414
I think he's dead.

103
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,321
Dr. Albright,
you got your wish!

104
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,775
Okay, so the kinds
of triangles are

105
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:08,298
isosceles,
equilateral, scalene.

106
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,605
And what's
the other one?

107
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,677
Why do I have to know this
if I'm going to be a teacher?

108
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:19,719
You want a soda?

109
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,585
'Kay.

110
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:23,827
Em, there's juice, too, if you'd
rather have that, or water.

111
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,328
Hi.

112
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:30,079
August, you're here.

113
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,734
Yeah, we have a science
project, remember?

114
00:06:33,735 --> 00:06:36,894
em, yeah, right.
I think I want a soda.

115
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:39,750
Oh-hh! Hello,

116
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:40,809
Auggie.

117
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:46,426
Cheryl. There's
something different about you.

118
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:49,500
Is it your hair? No.

119
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,840
Oh, you're
holding a book.

120
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:58,307
Tommy, could
you hurry up?

121
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,089
I'm really thirsty.

122
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:04,817
Cheryl's helping me
with my math homework.

123
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,184
She is

124
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,151
You know, if you want to hang
out with Cheryl, that's okay.

125
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:13,874
We haven't made any serious
declarations of our feelings,

126
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,739
so there isn't
the issue of ownership.

127
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,743
But.. and,
just like Cheryl,

128
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:19,217
this is a big "but"...

129
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:22,605
you could at least
be honest with me.

130
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:26,467
August, I'm sorry.

131
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:30,479
Hello!

132
00:07:31,982 --> 00:07:33,778
I thought you were
bringing me something to drink.

133
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:35,887
Oh, right.
Sorry. Sorry.

134
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:37,710
Diet.
- Sorry.

135
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,361
I can't believe this. I've
never seen anybody die before.

136
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:46,889
I know,
it's amazing.

137
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,925
One minute, he's active,
and the next, he's inert.

138
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:52,559
First he's limber,
and then he's stiff.

139
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,118
His eyes are twinkly,
then they're milky.

140
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,408
He's rosy, then sallow.
Oily, then dry.

141
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,123
Gurgly, then silent.
- Will you stop!

142
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,275
Dick? Dick,
we have a problem.

143
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,611
What?
- I killed him.

144
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,022
Oh, that's
just great.

145
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:11,896
Didn't I say
best behaviour?

146
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:14,988
I never meant to kill him.
- Why can't you be like Dr. Albright?

147
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:17,058
She wanted him dead, but
did she act on it? No...

148
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:19,246
because she's
a lady.

149
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:23,873
The police are here.
We've gotta get outta here.

150
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:26,883
We will. Just walk out calmly.
- Okay, here we go.

151
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:29,529
Look casual.

152
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:40,026
No. No, no. I think we all know
why Dr. Hanlin died.

153
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,616
He had a bad heart.

154
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:48,438
He ignored his doctor's
advice. He brought it on himself.

155
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:50,061
Oh, thank god!
- Yes!

156
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,715
Let's eat!
- All right!

157
00:08:55,946 --> 00:08:58,272
Promise me something.
what?

158
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:02,424
Promise me that you'll never do
what Dr. Hanlin did at the party.

159
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:04,925
Feel up the caterer?
I won't.

160
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,313
Promise me you'll
never collapse

161
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,083
and be hauled away
under a sheet.

162
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:11,916
Because the thought
of you lying there,

163
00:09:11,917 --> 00:09:13,850
purple, rigid
and distended,

164
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:17,415
just makes me
so sad.

165
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,202
'Kay.

166
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,009
You know what we
should do right now?

167
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,372
Run out of here,
grab a couple of horses,

168
00:09:26,373 --> 00:09:28,110
ride bareback through
the woods all night,

169
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,204
and make love
in a meadow at sunrise.

170
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,745
I have a class
in five minutes,

171
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:38,105
and that's just the first
of my reservations.

172
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:41,192
Forget class.
Let's live!

173
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,250
Let's taste danger.

174
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,944
Let's go for the gusto,
consequences be damned.

175
00:09:45,945 --> 00:09:48,632
Let's drive fast
and eat cheese.

176
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,141
Are you insane?

177
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,930
I've simply awakened to
the sensual possibilities

178
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,107
of everything
around me.

179
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:05,516
You know, I think
she's fully inflated.

180
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:07,392
What is it, Nina?

181
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:10,084
This letter just came for
you. It's from Dr. Hanlin.

182
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:12,811
"Dear Dr. Solomon,

183
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,276
if you are reading this,
it means that I am dead.

184
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,796
As one honest man
to another,

185
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:21,584
it is my dying wish that
you deliver an honest eulogy

186
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:23,821
without any embellishment
or flattering crap."

187
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:26,985
An honest eulogy,
I can do that.

188
00:10:27,238 --> 00:10:28,396
No, you can't.

189
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,262
An honest eulogy for
that man would be insulting.

190
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:35,117
Well, I'll just have to
find something to say about him

191
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,237
that's both honest
and uplifting.

192
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:38,794
Oh, how about

193
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:41,780
"we love him more today
than yesterday"?

194
00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:46,630
S  P... I R... I T

195
00:10:46,631 --> 00:10:48,722
Go, spirit, let's hear it!
Go, spirit, let's hear it!

196
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:51,333
S P... I R... I T!

197
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:54,649
Go, spirit!  Let's hear it! Go, spirit! Let's hear it!
- Oh, gosh!

198
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:56,905
oh, that is..

199
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,092
she's got the spirit.
Isn't she wonderful?

200
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:04,169
Yeah, the magic
never ends.

201
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,595
Mrs. Dubcek, did you hear this?
- Yes, I heard it.

202
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:09,051
I don't know what
is going on up here,

203
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:11,268
but I have plaster
falling into my jacuzzi.

204
00:11:12,503 --> 00:11:14,411
I've never heard it
called that before.

205
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,820
Take it outside.
- Later, Tommy.

206
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:24,752
So, Tommy, can't
find fulfillment

207
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:25,921
in a meaningless
relationship

208
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:28,246
with a superficial,
simple minded bimbo?

209
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,546
I know. I'm just
as baffled as you are.

210
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,121
Mrs. Dubcek,

211
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:38,753
have you ever been involved
in funeral arrangements?

212
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:41,715
Well, not for myself..
for my second husband.

213
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:45,634
Lovely funeral, very nice.
- Well, I..

214
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:49,112
I've been working on this
eulogy. What was his like?

215
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,662
Well, it was
an outdoor service.

216
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,906
And then this woman came
along, asking for directions

217
00:11:53,907 --> 00:11:56,902
because she was lost and she
couldn't find her way home.

218
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:58,443
And we were so touched,

219
00:11:58,744 --> 00:12:02,408
that we just forgot about
Carl's eulogy and just planted him.

220
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:07,262
So I-- I just
need to find

221
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:10,405
some babbling eccentric
to create a diversion.

222
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,657
What are you doing
on Saturday?

223
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:19,820
You're just lucky, you're so
damnedably handsome.

224
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:25,279
Why does death have
to be so inconvenient?

225
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,483
Mmm, to die,
to sleep.

226
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:31,653
To sleep,
perchance to dream.

227
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,165
Ohh!
There's the rub,

228
00:12:36,444 --> 00:12:38,740
for in that sleep
of death

229
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,682
what dreams may come...

230
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:46,258
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil

231
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,207
must give us pause.

232
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,386
What's that from?
- I don't know, some Mel Gibson movie.

233
00:12:56,998 --> 00:13:01,433
Mel Gibson, he's dreamy.
Mmmmmm.

234
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,609
If we measure
"x" in grams

235
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,453
and "y" in centimeters
per second,

236
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:14,164
then "z" is measured in a
unit of energy we call ergs.

237
00:13:14,165 --> 00:13:17,566
The complete conversion of
one gram of mass into energy

238
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:21,968
thus releases one times three
times 10 to the 10th power squared,

239
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,204
which brings me to another
point-- Your lives are fragile,

240
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,538
and you're all
going to die!

241
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:31,057
Your time is short, and...

242
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,233
I barely know
any of you.

243
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:36,173
Close your books.

244
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,669
I want to sit
among you.

245
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:43,383
I want to share your
thoughts, learn your fears,

246
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:46,623
expose your darkest secrets. Who's first?

247
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,739
Bug, what about you?
- Uh...

248
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,046
why are you called bug?
- I got hit by a Volkswagen.

249
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,806
And, Leon.
- What?

250
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,729
Where are you from?
- Here.

251
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,040
You see?
This is fascinating.

252
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,024
Uh, who's next?
Pitman.

253
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:07,631
Uh... what about you, Dr.
Solomon? Where are you from?

254
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:12,828
Okay.

255
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:16,928
I'm sure that you've all
heard of the radio telescope.

256
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,389
Well... funny story,

257
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,388
true story.
I'm not human.

258
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:25,662
Well, that's all
the time we have.

259
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:27,742
Oh, and by the way,

260
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,766
I assume that some of you have
taken a class from Dr. Hanlin.

261
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,179
Does anyone have any
stories about him?

262
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,276
I need something nice.
- oh, sorry.

263
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,489
I know that it was
his final request,

264
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,604
that I be forthright
and honest,

265
00:14:44,605 --> 00:14:47,024
but the problem is, I can't
seem to find anything good

266
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:50,198
to say about this man,
and I've been looking.

267
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,142
You know, Dick,

268
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:56,559
everyone has goodness
within them.

269
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,814
If you look beneath
the surface far enough,

270
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,503
I think you're
going to discover

271
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,578
a basic inner core
of goodness

272
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:07,277
that, well, makes us all
children of god.

273
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:08,562
Well...

274
00:15:10,331 --> 00:15:13,198
I guess I'll just have to
try to find that in Dr. Hanlin.

275
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:15,964
Leonard Hanlin?

276
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,906
Oh, well, good luck.

277
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,657
Listen, August, about Cheryl..
- No.

278
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:40,537
No, look, we used to be
involved. That's over.

279
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:41,831
I'm okay with that.

280
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,840
Now let's not let it affect
our academic relationship.

281
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,400
No, I made
a mistake with her.

282
00:15:48,401 --> 00:15:51,122
See, I don't want Cheryl. I want you.

283
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,298
Of course
you want me.

284
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,424
What can I do
to fix this?

285
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,228
You could take me
someplace nice.

286
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,302
All right,
um... okay.

287
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,449
There's this thing I got
to go to tomorrow afternoon

288
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,760
'cause my dad
knew this guy.

289
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:13,082
It's, um...
you have to dress up,

290
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,240
'cause it's really,
really nice.

291
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:17,452
Sure.

292
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:23,677
So when they asked me to come
to earth, I thought, "why not?"

293
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,359
I was in a rut, working
for the big giant head.

294
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,177
You know him.
- Harry!

295
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:33,714
Uh, just a minute.

296
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,763
Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

297
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:43,508
Dr. Hanlin.

298
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,983
How did he get here?
- I gave him a ride.

299
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,811
This isn't
Dr. Hanlin anymore.

300
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:56,468
It's an empty vessel.

301
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,879
See, if he were alive,
could I do this?

302
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:02,860
Could any man alive
resist a fresh banana?

303
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:07,259
I rest my case.

304
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:10,322
But, Dick, when
our mission ends

305
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:11,831
and we leave this planet,

306
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,331
will our bodies
end up like that?

307
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,080
Of course. It's happened a million times.

308
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:18,622
We study a planet.
We take on the life-forms.

309
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:21,510
We finish the job. We
discard the life-forms. The end.

310
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:23,308
Dick, I feel
different here.

311
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:27,430
I mean, I like Sally. What
will happen to her when I'm gone?

312
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,721
What happens
to all her stuff?

313
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:31,303
All her shoes?

314
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:34,960
You won't care,

315
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:36,896
because the thing
that's really you

316
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:38,444
will be
in another galaxy.

317
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:42,354
And Sally will be...
just like Dr. Hanlin.

318
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:44,822
Whoa, Dick, he's
going for the banana.

319
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:46,333
Oh, no!

320
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,030
I need to run
this eulogy by you.

321
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:53,031
Just say whatever
you're going to say.

322
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:55,451
No, no, I think I've found
a positive angle.

323
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:57,974
"Office space is at a premium on this campus,

324
00:17:57,975 --> 00:17:59,959
so you'll be happy to hear--"
- Stop!

325
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,198
The man is dead.

326
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:04,150
We're ready to start.

327
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,006
See how nice it is?

328
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:14,318
This...
is the thing for the guy

329
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,579
you invited me to?

330
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:18,071
Yeah.

331
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,219
What?

332
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,199
How...

333
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:35,107
can we honour
the memory

334
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:39,064
of a man like
Leonard Hanlin?

335
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:41,843
Well...

336
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:51,586
he was governed
by the laws of physics,

337
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:54,806
as are all
living things.

338
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,063
It is a scientific fact

339
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:00,948
that hearts
and clocks slow down

340
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,179
as they approach
the speed of light,

341
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,040
the point
at which matter

342
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,747
is converted
into energy.

343
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,675
Dr. Hanlin's heart
approached that speed

344
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:12,420
on Friday evening...

345
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:15,252
at 7:57,

346
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,132
according to
the coroner,

347
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,531
converting his matter
into energy,

348
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:23,798
into pure white light.

349
00:19:25,602 --> 00:19:27,061
Though he is
no longer with us,

350
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:30,941
he is all around us.

351
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:40,621
Thank You.

352
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:49,055
That was absolutely
beautiful.

353
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:54,187
Matter to energy?

354
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,719
Could you have
been more trite?

355
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,030
Why didn't you
just phone it in?

356
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,094
The fact that someday
we'll lose these bodies

357
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,381
makes me want more.

358
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:14,931
I want to share
myself with someone.

359
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,030
And I think
we all know who.

360
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,632
I want to savor
every moment.

361
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:23,379
I want to see places
outside of Ohio.

362
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,647
Hmm, I want one of
those big cheeseburgers

363
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,118
with three buns.

364
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:31,712
I want one
of those things,

365
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,771
you see people with them. You
know, they're like this big.

366
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,305
A baby?
- Yeah.

367
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,058
Aren't you kind of stuck
with a baby for your whole life?

368
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:44,176
No, you only have a baby
for, like, two years.

369
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,147
Men.

370
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:52,494
Dick, when are we going
to leave these bodies?

371
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:55,701
When we've learned
everything there is to know

372
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,271
about life.

373
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:01,876
Whoa. Good thing
we got cable.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
