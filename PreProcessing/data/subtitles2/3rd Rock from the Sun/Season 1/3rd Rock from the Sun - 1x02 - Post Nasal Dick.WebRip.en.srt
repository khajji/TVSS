1
00:00:00,929 --> 00:00:03,546
The force-carrying particles
exchanged between matter particles

2
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:05,497
are said to be
virtual particles

3
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:08,189
because, unlike real particles,
they cannot be directly detected

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,467
by a particle detector.

5
00:00:11,653 --> 00:00:12,482
The people
on this planet

6
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:13,911
will swallow anything.

7
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,800
Oooh, finally.

8
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,087
My pictures of
"the today show" gang.

9
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:23,406
Ooooh, my favorite-

10
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:25,101
Martha Stewart.

11
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:28,775
Is it autographed?
- No, but she signed it

12
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,478
She looks
good enough to eat.

13
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,382
So, how was school today?
- The best ever.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,672
I had my very first
makeout session.

15
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:49,468
Good for you.
- It was with Dina, my lab partner.

16
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,749
Dina, the one with the...?
- Oh, yeah.

17
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,523
So tell us everything.
I want details.

18
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,343
Well, at first
I was conflicted.

19
00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:59,129
you know.. we come from very
different backgrounds.

20
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,639
I'm an alien,
and she's a presbyterian.

21
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,781
I have a highly
developed mind,

22
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:06,353
and she's got that...
big, pouty mouth.

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,132
I tell you, Dick, it was a tough decision.

24
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:10,127
What tipped the scales?

25
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:10,922
She let me.

26
00:01:14,586 --> 00:01:16,124
Well, what happened next?

27
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,013
Well, I don't know what came over me,

28
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,142
but... they
were so big

29
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:21,356
and round

30
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,340
and beautiful,

31
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:26,678
I just had to touch them.
- And then what?

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,012
She screamed, "ow,
my eyes!" and that just...

33
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:32,047
basically killed the mood.
- Damn.

34
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,007
As many intelligent people know..

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,507
.. aliens are all around us.

36
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:40,423
This is the story of four
such explorers.

37
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,864
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

38
00:02:16,921 --> 00:02:18,603
I'm not reading
387 pages

39
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,039
if he can't make up his mind
in the first sentence.

40
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,343
Great. Wonderful.

41
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:27,019
Thanks for nothing.

42
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:29,437
What happened?

43
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,994
My date for a wedding tomorrow
night cancelled at the last minute.

44
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:34,970
His brother came out
of the coma.

45
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:40,151
A wedding?
- Yeah, a big reception.

46
00:02:40,186 --> 00:02:43,314
A ritual?
- Very traditional- crying, dancing.

47
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,401
And the female devours the male
immediately after the ceremony?

48
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:52,196
No. That's a process that takes
years and years.

49
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:56,187
Nina, are you married?
- No.

50
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,489
Why not? What are
you doing wrong?

51
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:00,311
You sound just
like my mother.

52
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:03,283
That must be very
confusing for you.

53
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,783
oh I wish I didn't Rsvp. I hate
going to these things by myself.

54
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:11,256
I'd love to go to
the wedding with you.

55
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,221
Oh!

56
00:03:13,332 --> 00:03:15,089
I couldn't ask you to do
that at such short notice.

57
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:16,785
Oh I don't mind.
- It's a two-hour drive.

58
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:19,683
Well I'll pay for the gas.
- You'd have to wear a suit.

59
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,949
I'm wearing a suit.
- A nice suit.

60
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,947
I'll get one. You can pick it
out, whatever it takes. I'll do it!

61
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:29,059
You're going to make me say this,
aren't you?- What?

62
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:33,076
It's not that I don't find
you charming in your own way.

63
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:34,970
It's just that you
tend to make

64
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,062
a vivid impression
on people.

65
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,669
Well, I am
the high commander.

66
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,617
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

67
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,874
I promise you I'll be
on my best behavior.

68
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:46,334
You won't bring any of your family?
- Just me.

69
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:50,175
Fine.
You can come.

70
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,197
Excellent!

71
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,516
My first wedding!
I can't wait!

72
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:55,750
Oh, and be sure
to wear something

73
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,169
that shows the crack in
your breasts.

74
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:07,425
I don't know what the school nurse
is talking about. I don't see any bug.

75
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,464
I know. She said
I probably got it from Dina,

76
00:04:10,465 --> 00:04:13,182
but I don't get how, unless
the bug swam in with the saliva.

77
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:17,827
This is interesting. My throat tickles.
- Mine, too.

78
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:20,794
You know, I tried using
a stick to scratch it,

79
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,766
but that just brought up
a whole new set of problems.

80
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,895
Okay, Sally, this shirt,
this tie, these socks?

81
00:04:28,896 --> 00:04:31,508
Or this shirt, this tie, these socks?
- Stop. What's wrong with you?

82
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,356
I'm sorry,
but Mary's counting on me.

83
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,963
I want to look my best
for the wedding.

84
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,947
What is it with you and that blonde?

85
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,287
Nothing, this is strictly research.

86
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,795
But to describe her
as blonde is inaccurate.

87
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,092
Her hair is
more like honey

88
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:47,684
with flaxen highlights
and just a whisper of gold

89
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:50,005
dancing playfully
about the halo

90
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:51,257
that surrounds her.

91
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:54,443
So she's not blonde.

92
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:58,076
I'm sorry. I guess I just haven't
seen her through your love goggles.

93
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,509
I don't love her,

94
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:02,818
this is a perfect opportunity
to observe a wedding firsthand.

95
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:04,973
There's a lot we don't understand.
- Like what?

96
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:07,093
Well, it's really
a very fascinating ritual.

97
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:10,243
The ceremony begins with
the bride being given away.

98
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,579
Excuse me. Given away,
like an object?

99
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,479
As in "free girl
with every large fries"?

100
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,407
Wait. There's free
girls? Can I go?

101
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,241
Fries? Can I go?

102
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:25,168
No... I'm afraid not. Dr.
Albright has already RSVP'd.

103
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:27,647
You said you'd stop
spelling in front of me.

104
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:33,863
Wow!

105
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:36,089
What was that?

106
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,124
I don't know,

107
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,535
but I want
another one.

108
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:45,447
oohhh

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,663
Ohhh

110
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:58,762
Was it as good for you
as it was for me?

111
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,463
Good morning,
Dr. Solomon.

112
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:07,601
Good morning.

113
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,777
Nina, I seem to be having a little
trouble swallowing this morning.

114
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:13,157
Do you happen to know if
there's an alternate stomach access?

115
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,051
Are you sick?

116
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,704
Yes, and the novelty is
starting to wear off.

117
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,924
You're sick and you're
breathing my air.

118
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,050
Which air is yours?

119
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:25,917
I'll get you some tea.
- What's this?

120
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,535
This is brilliant!

121
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,747
You're sick. You should be home in bed.

122
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:44,848
But this is my first date
with Dr. Albright.

123
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:46,979
Dr. Solomon, I'm sure
she'll understand.

124
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,721
oh Nina, please. This is
very important to me.

125
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:51,784
Promise me you won't let
Dr. Albright know...

126
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:54,014
that... I'm sick.

127
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,940
She won't hear it
from me.

128
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:00,918
Good morning.
- Good morning, Dr. Albright.

129
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:01,926
I'm fine, thanks.

130
00:07:02,414 --> 00:07:05,134
Good. I'm looking
forward to tonight.

131
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,866
Aren't you?
- Absolutely.

132
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:09,882
It'll be fun. Why don't you
pick me up around 7:00-ish?

133
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,322
7:00-ish on the dot.

134
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,874
Better make it 6:30. You
might have trouble park... ing.

135
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:17,866
You might, but I'm
very good at it.

136
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:20,884
Oh, I'm late
for class.

137
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,434
See you tonight.
- Can't wait.

138
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:33,779
oooh.. My head is throbbing.

139
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:35,532
Me, too.
- Mine's worse.

140
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,309
And my back is aching.

141
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:39,143
Me, too.
- Mine's killing me.

142
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,144
My breasts feel like

143
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,065
two hot steaming
bowls of chili.

144
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:47,303
She wins.

145
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:50,388
This is all
your fault.

146
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,674
You brought a foreign
germ into this house.

147
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,272
Hey, I have as much
a right to be here

148
00:07:55,273 --> 00:07:56,561
as anybody else.

149
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,147
See you later.

150
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:13,288
I'm not wearing pants.

151
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:17,850
I was wondering why the
lint brush wasn't working.

152
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,563
Dick, you are obviously
too sick to go.

153
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:25,445
Why don't you just stay home and
drip fluids with the rest of us?

154
00:08:25,446 --> 00:08:27,726
Nonsense. I feel
perfectly fine.

155
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,189
Dick, I think Sally's right.
You should just stay home.

156
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,776
No. Now, help me
get my pants on.

157
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:35,262
And don't worry about me.

158
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:38,604
I've never been defeated
by a single-celled organism.

159
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:41,320
They are stealthy,
but they are stupid.

160
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:45,213
I am the high commander, and
I refuse to let this beat me.

161
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:47,641
Okay, fine. If you insist on being stubborn,

162
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:49,633
at least take some
of this cough syrup.

163
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,565
I don't need it.
- Dick, you have to,

164
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:53,627
the lady at the drugstore
said if this doesn't work,

165
00:08:53,642 --> 00:08:55,863
we have to put
a vaporizer in your room.

166
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:58,024
Oh, no.

167
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:03,091
Yahhh, tastes bad?
- No.

168
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,273
I just didn't clear
the zipper.

169
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,257
We are gathered together
here in the sight of god

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,731
and in the face
of this company

171
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,898
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony

172
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:22,824
which is
an honorable estate,

173
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:26,348
instituted of god,
signifying unto us.

174
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:30,778
.and his church, which holy
estate Christ adorned and.

175
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,478
now, which of
those guys is god?

176
00:09:33,845 --> 00:09:35,616
Be quiet.
- Okay,

177
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,284
but be sure to introduce me
later because I want some answers.

178
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,309
Shh! Shh!
- Shh! Shh-hh!

179
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,235
Now, how were those two
able to find each other?

180
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:50,483
oh, It was fate.

181
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,784
He's rich.
She wanted money

182
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:56,100
so she could sit on her
ass. I give it a year.

183
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:57,105
Oh..

184
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,447
that is so beautiful.

185
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:02,262
Look at them.
They belong together.

186
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,849
Do you think they have any idea
how ugly their children will be?

187
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:07,313
Ha ha haha.

188
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:09,771
Shh!
- Oh, you shush.

189
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:12,875
Shh!
- Shh-hh!

190
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:18,453
Oh, this is so moving-

191
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,526
the love,
the closeness.

192
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:25,259
Hold me.
- Oh, get off!

193
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,890
shh!
- I don't want to play anymore!

194
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:36,685
Whoooo!

195
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,044
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

196
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:40,289
I got another hole here.

197
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:46,522
Whoooo!

198
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:49,901
I made chicken soup.

199
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:52,038
It's supposed to make
us feel better.

200
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,598
Ahh!

201
00:10:59,882 --> 00:11:02,126
Sally, you're amazing.
As sick as you are,

202
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,447
you keep taking care of us.
- Yeah, I know.

203
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:07,918
I don't understand. All I want
to do is curl up into a ball.

204
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,254
Yet, somehow I'm compelled
to nurture you.

205
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,526
God, what
a cruel disease.

206
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:15,710
Why did we choose bodies
that could decay so easily?

207
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,909
I told you we should
come here as ducks,

208
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:20,476
but nobody listens to me.

209
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:22,358
How could Dina
do this to me

210
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:24,586
after I was nice enough
to spread the word

211
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:26,112
that she was
a good frencher?

212
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:29,361
After all the battles
I've fought in

213
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,597
and all the places
I've been,

214
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:33,937
I just can't believe
I'm gonna die

215
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:36,176
on a flea-infested
little planet

216
00:11:36,177 --> 00:11:38,601
in the boondocks
of the galaxy.

217
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:41,820
in this outfit.

218
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,532
Now I'll never
fall in love,

219
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:48,660
never get used,
cheated on,

220
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,668
tossed aside
like an old shoe.

221
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:53,974
I'm glad I'm dying.

222
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:58,101
You know, I never told you
this, but I always thought

223
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:00,753
you'd make a totally
kick-Ass high commander.

224
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:02,585
Thanks.

225
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:04,991
I've always admired
your eloquence.

226
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:07,833
What about me?

227
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,978
No one can take a blow
to the head like you, Harry.

228
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,763
You don't know
what that means to me.

229
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,371
I love you guys.

230
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:30,259
I really wish you hadn't
wrestled the maid of honor for that.

231
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,979
Oh I see. Men and women
are completely equal

232
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:35,955
until something pretty is being given away.
- Keep your voice down.

233
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,313
What was with that little
girl throwing away flowers?

234
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:39,650
What the hell
was her problem?

235
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:42,559
It's time to leave.
- Oh, wait.

236
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:44,956
I haven't given you
your gift yet.

237
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,285
It's a toaster.

238
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,850
Where did you get this?
- In the room full of prizes.

239
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:55,486
I'd like to propose a toast
to the bride and groom.

240
00:12:55,487 --> 00:12:56,671
hear, hear.

241
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,449
To a lifetime
of happiness together.

242
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,906
We give it a year!

243
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,743
Mary?
Mary, who is

244
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,828
this interesting
character you're with?

245
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,619
Dr. Richard Solomon
from the university.

246
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,572
Ah, well, I didn't think
that you could top

247
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,811
the personal
trainer/playwright,

248
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,386
but you always
come through.

249
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:19,291
I'll have you know

250
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,173
Dr. Solomon is a highly
respected scholar and educator.

251
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,980
He may be
a bit eccentric,

252
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:25,770
but he is a wonderfully
exciting man.

253
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:28,592
I'm sure I'm having a much
better time than you are.

254
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:34,890
I'm proposing a toast.

255
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:37,965
I think I speak for
everyone when I say

256
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:41,525
that the most beautiful,
radiant woman in the room

257
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,834
is not the bride
but Mary Albright!

258
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:45,995
yes, yes!

259
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:48,951
Hi.

260
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:54,639
I have a special dish
and a special helper today-

261
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,074
Harry Solomon.

262
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:59,536
Harry is an alien.
I love aliens.

263
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,076
Mmm, and I love your
traditional oyster stuffing,

264
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,367
in theory.
- Thank you.

265
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,534
Now, you're not feeling
very well, are you, Harry?

266
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:11,006
Oh, Martha, I feel
like I'm going to die.

267
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,742
Well, you need
a reason to live,

268
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:17,289
and I think I have one-
fall crisp

269
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:20,054
granny smith
apple cobbler.

270
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:23,275
Mmm!
A lattice crust.

271
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:27,843
Now, open wide.

272
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:35,326
Mmm!

273
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:37,804
You're
not going to die,

274
00:14:37,805 --> 00:14:40,106
and that's
a good thing.

275
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,121
Harry.

276
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,476
Mm-mmm!

277
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,866
Mmm! Mmm!

278
00:14:52,027 --> 00:14:52,854
Come in.

279
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,186
Martha Stewart says
I'm not gonna die.

280
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:04,261
Is Tommy home?
- What? Oh, hey, Dina.

281
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:05,862
Hey, Tommy.
- What are you doing here?

282
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,489
I just came by to see how you're feeling.
oh well, I'm feeling better, thanks.

283
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:13,154
I'm really sorry I gave you the flu.
oh no, don't worry about it,

284
00:15:13,155 --> 00:15:14,885
'cause anytime you want
to give me anything,

285
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,125
just let me know,

286
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:19,002
'cause if I had to
do it all over again,

287
00:15:19,539 --> 00:15:20,580
I'd do it
all over again.

288
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:23,717
So is there a chance we
could do it all over again?

289
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,235
We could go
to my house.

290
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,162
Great! Yeah, yeah.

291
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:30,333
Who's that?

292
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:33,284
Oh this is Dina.
She's the one that got us sick.

293
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,605
Destroy the incubator!

294
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:41,013
Thank you so much.

295
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:51,443
Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I could stay here all night.

296
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:53,859
Not with me. I'm leaving.
- Very well.

297
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,580
Wait.

298
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:59,530
Listen. It's 4/4 time
with a half-beat hesitation.

299
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:01,290
We have to dance.
- No, we don't.

300
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:03,647
Yo quiero bailar
contigo.

301
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,961
Porteque.

302
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:12,325
What?

303
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:15,784
Allow me to translate using
the universal language.

304
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:18,106
of dance!

305
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,814
Oh, god, we're good!

306
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:59,244
Oh, my. oh, my god,
you're burning up.

307
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,030
That's right. I'm burning up for you, baby.

308
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:04,014
I'm taking you home and putting you to bed.
- All right!

309
00:17:05,444 --> 00:17:07,269
We're having sex
tonight!

310
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:08,659
Ahh!

311
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:14,845
Oh, what a lovely
place you have.

312
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,132
Lie down.

313
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:19,369
Oh, not there.

314
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,088
Why didn't you tell me
you were sick?

315
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,766
Dr. Albright?
- What?

316
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:25,943
I'm sick.

317
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,512
Do you know how dangerous
what you did was?

318
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:33,139
Yes I know, because I
think I'm dying.

319
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,998
Oh, shush.
- No, no, let me talk.

320
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,581
I have to tell
you something.

321
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:38,970
I don't know how much time
I have left,

322
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:39,971
so listen closely.

323
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,921
If you wake up in the morning,

324
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:45,596
and find a quivelling purple
mass,

325
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,797
wearing my watch.

326
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,513
Don't touch it.

327
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:53,017
I won't.

328
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,763
Did you drink this
entire bottle?

329
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:01,872
I have to tell you this.

330
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,734
No!, you have to lie down.

331
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:05,895
I come from a different world.

332
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:08,187
And this is news?

333
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:09,985
No, you don't understand.

334
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:12,362
I'm an Alien from
another planet.

335
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:13,663
I'm telling you this because,

336
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,564
I love you.

337
00:18:24,096 --> 00:18:25,629
Whatever you say.

338
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,076
So much trouble-

339
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,267
but you are sweet.

340
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:35,706
I know.

341
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:42,398
Good morning Nina.

342
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:44,625
You'll be glad to know
that I'm feeling much better.

343
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,434
I am so happy for you.

344
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:48,222
I'm going home.

345
00:18:48,223 --> 00:18:48,974
Why?

346
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,816
Because I'm sick that's why.

347
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:52,376
Really? what a coincidence.

348
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:54,805
Your getting sick just as I'm
getting better.

349
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,512
Have a nice day.

350
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:08,542
Doctor Solomon, nice to see
you're feeling better.

351
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:09,543
Yes, much.

352
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:11,703
I want to thank you for
coming to the wedding with me.

353
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:13,148
I know you were sick.

354
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:14,149
Meant a lot to me.

355
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,150
Oh it was my pleasure.

356
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,944
You seem to have more
teeth than usual.

357
00:19:20,388 --> 00:19:22,461
You don't remember anything
you said to me. do you?

358
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,094
Did I say anything I shouldn't have?

359
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:26,185
Actually, you said a lot of things.

360
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:28,470
Could you be a little more specific?

361
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:31,749
Oh let's just say you
were very revealing.

362
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,078
I was delirious,
I was rambling.

363
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:37,481
What did I say?

364
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:39,983
You said.

365
00:19:42,787 --> 00:19:43,963
I love you.

366
00:19:46,243 --> 00:19:48,090
Isn't that silly?

367
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:08,700
That was a close one

368
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:10,596
I wasn't sure we
were going to make it.

369
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:11,902
Yeah, when I thought I
was going to die.

370
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,370
I told Dr Albright I loved her.

371
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:15,536
Why did I do that?

372
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:16,583
When you face death-

373
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:19,035
you re-asess your priorities.

374
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:22,560
I've decided not to get those
breast implants.

375
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,546
You know you have
to admire these humans,

376
00:20:26,547 --> 00:20:27,646
there lives are so fragile.

377
00:20:28,147 --> 00:20:30,300
And yet they're so
willing to commit their hearts

378
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:31,878
to one another for
a lifetime.

379
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:35,130
Or an afternoon, with some
peachy dish in a mini skirt.

380
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:37,311
Hey! hey! at least I'm
getting some here alright.

381
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,401
Well said.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
