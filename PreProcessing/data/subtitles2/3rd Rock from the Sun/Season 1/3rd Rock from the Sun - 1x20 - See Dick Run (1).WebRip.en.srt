1
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,291
I think you'll
like this, Dick.

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:08,416
The commercial said the
extra ingredient is love.

3
00:00:19,012 --> 00:00:22,283
Next time try making the
extra ingredient cheese.

4
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:24,312
What's with Harry?
- Don't bother him.

5
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:26,949
He's transmitting my status report.
- Status report?

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,460
To the big giant head?

7
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,539
Why should we have to answer to
that pencil-pushing desk jockey anyway?

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,876
Frankly, I don't care
what he thinks.

9
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:35,997
What did it
say about me?

10
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,336
Resume normal functions
in three,

11
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,220
two, one.

12
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:49,143
What did I miss?
- So what did you put in the report?

13
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:52,362
Lots of time and effort.
- Come on, read it back.

14
00:00:54,165 --> 00:00:55,427
"Dear big giant head,

15
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:57,899
how are you? We're fine.
So's the weather Yada, yada, yada.

16
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:00,601
"The mission is taking
longer than anticipated.

17
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:03,813
The being designated Sally
has bravely infiltrated

18
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,072
the female gender.

19
00:01:05,073 --> 00:01:07,389
The Harry unit is
functioning adequately.

20
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:09,349
The high commander
has squandered six months

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,200
in the futile pursuit of a single earth woman.."

22
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,333
Wait, wait!
What was that?

23
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:16,732
I am functioning
adequately.

24
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,880
That thing about my futile
pursuit of Dr. Albright.

25
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:21,193
How could you write
this about me?

26
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,854
I'm the information officer.
I'm sworn to tell the truth.

27
00:01:23,855 --> 00:01:25,634
Well, the truth is
that through Mary

28
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:29,073
I have explored every facet
of the male/female dynamic.

29
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:31,497
Have you established a
monogamous relationship with her?

30
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:33,385
No.
- Have you bonded emotionally?

31
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,479
No.
- Have you had one successful date?

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,853
Well, if by successful
you mean pleasant,

33
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,915
no.

34
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,102
Well I wouldn't
sweat it, Dick. you know,

35
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,244
The big giant head never
reads these things, anyway.

36
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:48,279
Perhaps I have been remiss,
but mark my words.

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,776
By the week's end,
I will have established

38
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,904
an emotional beachhead
with Dr. Albright.

39
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:53,627
This I vow.

40
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:56,663
Yeah, and Harry's going
to win the Nobel prize.

41
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:59,946
Well, I'm happy
just to be nominated.

42
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:43,493
Good morning.
- Good morning, Nina.

43
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:45,106
Those are nice.

44
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:46,971
They cost 89 dollars.

45
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,347
Don't tell her that.
- Oh, right.

46
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:52,989
Good morning.
They cost 89 dollars.

47
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:57,499
Oh.
- Dr. Albright, would you do me the honour

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,212
of joining me
for dinner tonight?

49
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:00,956
No.

50
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,731
Why are you doing this?

51
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:09,362
Can't you see how much
pain you're causing?

52
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:11,207
He's nothing,
if not resilient.

53
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,208
Not him, me!

54
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,128
The two of you are driving me
up the wall.

55
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,939
You're obviously
attracted to him.

56
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,210
Take a chance
on love, woman.

57
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,123
I don't know.

58
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:23,897
Look at him.

59
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:31,839
I suppose it's time to
give the big dog a biscuit.

60
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,780
And I do
have to eat.

61
00:03:37,558 --> 00:03:39,788
Okay, I'll go out with you.
- Yes!

62
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,359
Come on, Dick, I really need to get in there.

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,036
I'm sorry. I need to be handsome tonight,

64
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:50,244
and I mean
Sears-Catalog handsome.

65
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:55,583
If he wants to get somewhere
with her, he should follow my lead.

66
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:58,242
Mr. Randell and I have
a dreamy relationship.

67
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,731
Yeah, you don't even
call him by his first name.

68
00:04:01,722 --> 00:04:04,176
That's what sophisticated
people do on this planet.

69
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,537
I realize it's not as
romantic as you and August

70
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,060
meeting in the lunchroom
and sharing your pudding cup.

71
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,642
Hey! We were just voted
cutest couple, so shut up.

72
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,587
Okay, where's my shoes?

73
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:19,126
I think I saw one of them
right over there.

74
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,717
Oh, my god,
it's Harry.

75
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,037
His cranial microreceiver,
it's activated.

76
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:32,561
Transmission incoming
from the big giant head.

77
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:35,231
Thank you for calling
the big giant head.

78
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,308
He cares about "you".

79
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:41,793
Your status report was
received. Please wait for comments.

80
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:44,618
Oh, no, no, no.
- Please, please, no comments.

81
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,224
There are no comments.

82
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:50,203
Resume normal functions
in three, two, one.

83
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,997
I told you the big giant
head never reads those things.

84
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:57,168
I really resent how
we're supposed to jump

85
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:59,022
every time the big
giant head sends a message.

86
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:01,214
I know, everyone knows he only got the job

87
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,106
by kissing
the big giant butt.

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,248
Oh, this is fun.
What a great idea.

89
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:37,938
Hey, he knew what
he was getting into

90
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,370
when he took this job.

91
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:42,366
August?

92
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,061
we share more than pudding, don't we?

93
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:46,263
You've got pudding?

94
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,954
No, I was using it as a
metaphor for our relationship.

95
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,891
Our relationship
is soft and gooey?

96
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:56,264
No, no. Never mind, okay? Never mind.

97
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:58,283
You didn't have to walk
me up. I know the way.

98
00:05:58,284 --> 00:05:59,944
I don't mind.
You mentioned coffee.

99
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:02,005
Hey, guys.
Hi, Mr. Randell.

100
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:05,137
Well, sit down.
Take off your shirt.. shoes.

101
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:11,822
Tommy, I need the parlor
to entertain Mr. Randell,

102
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:14,551
Mr. Kevin Randell.

103
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:17,235
We're doing homework.
- Yeah, Mesopotamia.

104
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:19,835
Oh, the fertile
crescent.

105
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,191
Would you like
to see it?

106
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,227
Pardon?
- Never mind.

107
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:34,993
I'll see to that coffee.
Tommy, help auntie Sally.

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,431
Excuse us.

109
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:39,155
I need the living room to
be alone with Mr. Randell.

110
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:39,941
Why?

111
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:40,979
I think I'm falling in love with the guy.

112
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,667
You just want the
living room so you can make out.

113
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,017
So how's history this year?
Good. - Good.

114
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,713
Thanks for
bailing me out.

115
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:01,221
You are so much fun.

116
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:04,124
Dr. Albright, your hand is on my knee.

117
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,654
Do you want me to move it?
- Please.

118
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:08,952
No, I meant
move it around.

119
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,330
Well, August
sure left early.

120
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:16,585
Yeah, after you dumped coffee
on her, she got the hint.

121
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,671
She made a rude comment
about my jell-o with cheese.

122
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,764
Jell-o with cheese?
What kind of woman are you?

123
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:23,479
Come on, let's not squabble. We're family.

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,321
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

125
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,721
Let's play a game, shall we? What'll it be?

126
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:30,836
Bite me.
- All right, who's it?

127
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,701
Okay, fine.
You know,

128
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:37,040
you try to help, but
this is the thanks you Ge..

129
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:40,859
Transmission incoming
from the big giant head.

130
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,786
What, again?
- Thank you for your status report.

131
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,515
I judge your mission to be
a complete failure.

132
00:08:46,516 --> 00:08:49,488
Replacements arrive
in 24 hours.

133
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:53,144
Resume normal functions
in three, two, one.

134
00:08:58,587 --> 00:08:59,556
What'd I miss?

135
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:03,924
They're aborting the mission.
- Replacements arrive tomorrow.

136
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:05,774
They're sending us home.

137
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:13,746
ohh!
ooohhhhhhh!

138
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,002
Oh, Dr. Albright,

139
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:23,247
that was the greatest
30 seconds of my life.

140
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,935
Ahh! Smell
the spring air.

141
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:34,982
What do you say
we have class outside?

142
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:37,317
The world is
such a perfect place.

143
00:09:37,318 --> 00:09:40,153
What are we doing indoors?
- Dr. Solomon.

144
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:41,430
What is it, darling?

145
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,865
Well, I think we're supposed
to be having our final exam.

146
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,410
and I'm shooting for a "d,"
so I'll need the full hour.

147
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,491
Final exam?

148
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:55,273
Today?

149
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,333
I forgot.
Isn't that a hoot?

150
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,415
You see, I didn't make
it home last night.

151
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,718
I could have,

152
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,453
but I was awfully
comfortable where I was,

153
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:11,329
in a place that's
definitely not home.

154
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,982
Dr. Solomon,

155
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,192
are you...
all right?

156
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:17,037
Oh I can't talk about it.
It's too personal.

157
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:20,396
Let's just say.. I had sex
with Dr. Albright.

158
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:21,952
Oh!

159
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,503
Dr. Solomon, we don't
need to know about this.

160
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:30,018
That's where you're wrong,
bug. You might learn something.

161
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:34,214
Last night at 11:22,

162
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:36,072
eastern standard time,

163
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,161
my spiritual
self, "x",

164
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:40,117
and my corporeal
self, "y",

165
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:42,625
were fused together...

166
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:45,264
for the first time.

167
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,291
But let's move on.

168
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:55,015
Dick, I need to talk to you. I have big news.

169
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:57,348
Oh you do?
Well I have big news, too.

170
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,437
Can we please just step
outside for a minute?

171
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,186
All right. Class,
while I'm gone,

172
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:03,988
I'd like you to ponder
being naked under cool,

173
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:05,764
cool sheets.

174
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:10,395
We're leaving?!

175
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:16,147
Nooooooooooo!

176
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:22,486
Just answer my question.
- All right.

177
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,884
Hypothetically speaking,
if you were out of my life,

178
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,520
I'd experience
separation anxiety,

179
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,458
and I'd probably harbor
some resentment.

180
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,099
But you know that even if we weren't
together, I'd always care about you?

181
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,616
Wait a second,
are you dumping me?

182
00:11:35,617 --> 00:11:38,849
No. No!
- It's that cheerleader Cheryl, isn't it?

183
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,122
Well, let me clue you in
pal. It's all padding.

184
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:43,176
No, August, you don't..

185
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,382
you don't understand.

186
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:47,768
Wait. It is?

187
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,700
Do you like my Coffee?

188
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:52,223
I put Cheese in it.

189
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,697
It's good isn't it?

190
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,628
It's erm... Cherry.

191
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,673
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

192
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:06,542
If I could never make coffee for you again..

193
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:07,573
not that that's
going to happen.

194
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:10,056
I mean, I'm here with my pot,
ready to pour.

195
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:13,047
Would you miss me?

196
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,348
Why are you
asking me this?

197
00:12:16,187 --> 00:12:17,450
I don't know.

198
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,236
Call it girlish
insecurity.

199
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:24,507
How would you feel?
- Awful.

200
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:26,505
Awful like somebody
ripped your heart out

201
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,375
and then showed
it to you?

202
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,650
Well, not showed
it to me.

203
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:34,963
So what you're saying is,
without me

204
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:36,719
you'd be
a lonely, miserable wreck

205
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,002
for what, a week, a month,
the rest of your life?

206
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,086
The rest of my life.

207
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:44,990
Oh, Mr. Randell.

208
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:50,008
You don't know how
happy you've made me.

209
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,075
Certainly.

210
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:01,909
I thought you and Dr.
Solomon had a date again tonight.

211
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,352
We did.
- He stood you up?

212
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:06,921
Oh, no,
I talked to him.

213
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,866
He said he got an
upsetting phone call from a friend

214
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,154
with a big head,

215
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:14,160
and he didn't think
he'd be much fun tonight.

216
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,276
Oh. Well, my all-time
favorite excuse was

217
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:19,484
"I have a terminal
illness".

218
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,443
You actually had that
pulled on you?

219
00:13:21,444 --> 00:13:24,864
Yes, but in all fairness,
the guy died.

220
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,109
So you going
to be okay?

221
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,169
Nina, I am at the stage
in my life

222
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,649
where I refuse to let
a man's childish behavior

223
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,255
steer me off course.
I am taking the high road.

224
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:39,987
Yeah? If I were you,
I'd go over there and nail

225
00:13:40,022 --> 00:13:41,225
his sorry ass
to the wall.

226
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,783
That "is"
the high road.

227
00:13:48,248 --> 00:13:51,443
I can't believe we're being
called back. I don't want to go.

228
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,175
I know. I'm so upset.
I don't know what to pack.

229
00:13:54,176 --> 00:13:57,102
Do you think I could take
these open-toed metallic sandals?

230
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:00,490
Lieutenant, once we're out of
here, we won't even have feet.

231
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:03,811
But they look like a pump
and feel like a sneaker.

232
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,711
Pull yourself together.

233
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:09,637
I've grown attached to
certain things on this planet, too.

234
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:11,840
You think I'm not going
to miss the sunsets,

235
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:13,563
the change of seasons,

236
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:16,114
the way my students
avert their eyes

237
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,723
when I pass them
in the halls?

238
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:22,333
You know what I'm going to
miss the most? All of you.

239
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,867
What do you mean? We're still going
to be together. We're still a unit.

240
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:27,283
I know, but we won't
be a family anymore.

241
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:29,389
Oh, lieutenant.
- Oh, sir.

242
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:34,511
I promised myself
I wasn't going to do this.

243
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:35,853
Harry, be brave.

244
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,813
This is no time for
weakness. We must be strong.

245
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:43,644
Dick.
- Mary.

246
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:45,755
Dick.
- Mary.

247
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:46,830
Dick.
- Harry.

248
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:47,731
What?

249
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,838
I'd like a few words
with you in private.

250
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,122
Mary, we have
no secrets.

251
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:57,672
Whatever we have to say to each other
we can say in front of the whole group.

252
00:14:57,673 --> 00:15:01,414
Last night when we were having..
- Let's go out onto the roof.

253
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:06,141
Well, I'm going to go down and get my
record collection for the trip back.

254
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:08,312
You know, tunes
for the road.

255
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,113
Great, 14 light-years
of glen Campbell.

256
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,056
I have something to say to you.
- So do I.

257
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,214
Something important,

258
00:15:17,215 --> 00:15:19,844
but I don't know
how to start.

259
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,280
Let me take
a stab at it.

260
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:24,197
You love me. Last night
meant the world to you,

261
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,894
but you have to push me
away so you don't hurt me.

262
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:28,528
Someday I'll see it
was all for the best.

263
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,689
Please believe you!
Please believe you!

264
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,541
That's it exactly.

265
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:35,177
Mary, you understand
my every thought.

266
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,745
I understand. You've had
the milk. Why buy the cow?

267
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:42,542
No, I want you.
I want the cow.

268
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:47,998
For what, a one-night stand in the barn?

269
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,055
I will not be
treated this way.

270
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:52,398
You hurt me.
- How did I hurt you?

271
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,095
Do you know why we ended
up at my place last night?

272
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:58,525
Not because I was lonely. Not
because I had too much sake.

273
00:15:58,526 --> 00:16:00,864
We ended up
there because...

274
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:02,683
I care for you.

275
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,436
Oh, Mary.

276
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,874
Why did you have to wait
until now to tell me?

277
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,824
What's wrong with now?

278
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:15,821
I wish I had a machine
that could freeze time.

279
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,971
Unfortunately, I left it
in my other jacket.

280
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:23,938
Dick?
- Aah!

281
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:28,071
Dick, come in here. I've got
wonderful news from "home".

282
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:29,116
You..

283
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,594
wait right here.
I'll be right back.

284
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,498
Dick's here.
What is it?

285
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:45,107
Okay, there was a mistake in the message.
- Tell me!

286
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:48,082
Dick, you're the only one
who's going. We all get to stay.

287
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,009
Yeah!
- Yeah!

288
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,388
awwww!

289
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,152
How did you get
your information?

290
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:59,632
Well I was down in the basement
getting my record collection,

291
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:03,164
and I bumped into your replacement.
- My replacement?

292
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,589
It's in the basement. He
wants to talk to you, Dick,

293
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:07,890
Now.

294
00:17:15,158 --> 00:17:15,877
Hello?

295
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:19,717
Hello?

296
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:21,992
Hello?

297
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,488
Where are you?

298
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,728
You..

299
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,016
you're gorgeous!

300
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:34,750
Thank you.

301
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:37,383
This body should
suit me nicely.

302
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,914
The big giant head
is very unhappy,

303
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,943
Commander.

304
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,566
I've been sent here
to replace you

305
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:47,736
and complete
the mission

306
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:51,245
with ruthless
efficiency.

307
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:56,274
And now I'm
afraid it's time

308
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:59,460
for me to assume
command.

309
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:03,509
You think you can just
waltz in here and take over?

310
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,759
You have no idea!

311
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,770
The people here are so complex.

312
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,179
They have all these
feelings and impulses,

313
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,369
dreams and fears.

314
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,796
And every time
you've mastered one,

315
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:15,847
another one catches
you by surprise.

316
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,502
Tonight I finally
made a breakthrough.

317
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,603
One of these people
cares about me.

318
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,382
You can't make me
leave now!

319
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,979
Oh, yes, I can.

320
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:27,073
What about...

321
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:29,783
Mary?

322
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:33,103
I'll take care
of her... good.

323
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:35,642
No. I won't
allow it!

324
00:18:36,043 --> 00:18:38,032
I love her!
I'm not leaving her!

325
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,685
How touching.

326
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,516
You know, you've actually
changed my mind.

327
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,555
I think I will
let you stay here,

328
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:47,441
right here,

329
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,386
forever.

330
00:18:57,104 --> 00:18:59,517
No. You're not..

331
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,098
Oh, my god!

332
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,482
He's turned me
into a mime!

333
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:16,117
You know, if you play "
Wichita lineman" backwards,

334
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,420
you get our
national anthem.

335
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,704
What's so funny, Dick?

336
00:19:25,705 --> 00:19:29,240
I am not... Dick.

337
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,287
I'm your new
high commander.

338
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,057
From this point forward,
you will refer to me as such.

339
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,053
Okay,

340
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:39,482
Such.

341
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,394
What have you done with Dick?

342
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,164
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

343
00:19:51,897 --> 00:19:54,860
There's going to be a
lot of changes around here.

344
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,623
For instance..

345
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:59,102
from now on this

346
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,208
goes here.

347
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,296
And that's just
the first of many...

348
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,360
changes.

349
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,104
Wow, what
a black hole.

350
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,885
Ah, Mary.

351
00:20:27,069 --> 00:20:28,157
Is everything all right?

352
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:29,642
Oh everything's perfect.

353
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,668
For the last six months,
I've been a bumbling fool.

354
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:36,292
As of right now,
that's over.

355
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,098
I only care about
one thing now,

356
00:20:40,099 --> 00:20:41,722
and that's pleasure..

357
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:45,495
yours and mine.

358
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:48,584
Oh, please.
- That's good.

359
00:20:49,411 --> 00:20:51,343
I like it
when they beg.

360
00:20:52,254 --> 00:20:56,095
How dare you..
- Shh!

361
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:58,045
Let daddy drive.

362
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,195
Wow!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
