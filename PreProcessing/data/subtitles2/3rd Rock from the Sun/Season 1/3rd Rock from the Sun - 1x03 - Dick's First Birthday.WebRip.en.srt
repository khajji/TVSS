1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,538
As many intelligent people know,
aliens are all around us.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,074
This is the story of a band
of four such explorers.

3
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:10,083
In order to blend in they
have assumed human form.

4
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:12,308
This is the high commander.

5
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:14,779
He has assembled an elite team of experts.

6
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:16,904
A decorated military officer.

7
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,247
A seasoned intelligent specialist.

8
00:00:19,704 --> 00:00:22,354
And...well, they had an extra seat.

9
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:25,750
The Earth revolves around
the sun

10
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:28,401
But ask more humans,
and they'll say..

11
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:29,632
..it revolves around them.

12
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,690
It's such
a beautiful night.

13
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:06,672
Harry, why don't you come out
and look at the stars with us?

14
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:09,285
Oh, no, you're
not putting me out

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,470
for the night again.

16
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,761
Fool me once,
shame on you,

17
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,218
Fool me six times,
shame on me.

18
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:20,227
What are you
babbling about now?

19
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:22,747
Oh it's just something I learned
from this self-help tape

20
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,465
I bought at the yard sale
down the block.

21
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:28,813
Dr. Martin Blaine's path to
personal transformation: say yes to you.

22
00:01:28,814 --> 00:01:30,900
This is going to help me
solve my confidence problem.

23
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:33,225
Why do you have a confidence
problem? What, are you stupid?

24
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:37,009
Tommy, why aren't you
looking at the stars?

25
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,631
I have too much
studying to do, Dick.

26
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,999
Your homework is taking up
way too much of your time.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,038
Tell me about it. They've
changed phys ed to health class,

28
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,950
and I have to memorize
287 different body parts.

29
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,449
You have
an owner's manual?

30
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:55,106
Well, here's a picture of all the
different organs in our abdominal cavity.

31
00:01:55,107 --> 00:01:56,841
Oh, my god!

32
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:59,027
You know,
I read someplace

33
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:01,498
that you can stretch
a man's nerve endings

34
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,582
from new York
to San Francisco,

35
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:05,569
but he would die.

36
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,388
Hey look, here's
a section

37
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:10,030
on virginity
and abstinence.

38
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:13,092
I haven't experienced
sex yet, so...

39
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:16,137
I guess that makes me a virgin.
- Congratulations.

40
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:19,377
Thanks. It feels
kind of weird, you know.

41
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:22,225
I mean, I'm proud of it, but
I'm also a little embarrassed.

42
00:02:23,122 --> 00:02:24,075
Is there anything
that men have

43
00:02:24,076 --> 00:02:26,544
that they're both proud and
ashamed of at the same time?

44
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:29,766
No.
- Drawing a blank.

45
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:41,201
Ezekiel Begat Jedidiah.
Jedidiah Begat Ephraim.

46
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,226
Ephraim Begat Lemuel.

47
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,678
Man, these people
Begat their brains out.

48
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:48,855
Good morning, Dr. Solomon.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:51,020
When's your birthday?
- My what?

50
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,343
I'm updating the office
birthday list. When's your birthday?

51
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:56,078
Do I have to tell you?
- What, are you pleading the fifth?

52
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,999
Er..the fifth sounds fine.
This month.

53
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:01,851
Ah, that's this Monday.
How old will you be?

54
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:05,035
Why do I have to tell you a
specific number? Are you keeping score?

55
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,956
Well If you're going to get
sensitive, never mind.

56
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:10,037
I just don't see why
age is so important.

57
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:12,567
I've guess you've got a
milestone creeping up on you.

58
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,563
No. No, that's
my underwear.

59
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,593
Good morning.
- Hello, Dr. Albright.

60
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:21,667
Ah, Laurie, Dr. Solomon.
Laurie ivers.

61
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,404
Hello.
- Hello.

62
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,158
My, you have
a firm handshake.

63
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,871
Thanks..Laurie's visiting the
campus for a few days.

64
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:29,015
You are in really
excellent condition.

65
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:32,317
Thank you. I work out a lot.
- I can tell.

66
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:33,849
It's very firm.

67
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:37,483
Laurie's studying for her
doctorate in anthropology.

68
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,296
She's considering
coming here to Pendleton.

69
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:41,570
oh, well, you've chosen a
very mediocre institution,

70
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,399
and we'd love to have you.

71
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:44,368
Thanks.

72
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:46,647
Would you shake
my hand again?

73
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,623
Um, I suppose.

74
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,511
Ah, Nina, why don't
you take Laurie

75
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:57,141
to the library to show
her the Inca exhibit?

76
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:59,231
Exhibit? It's three coins and a spoon.

77
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:02,031
Don't spoil it for her,
just take her.

78
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,313
err, It was nice meeting you.

79
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:06,986
What a coincidence.
It was nice meeting you.

80
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:12,776
Oh, will you act your age?
- What has my age have to do with it?

81
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,616
Like you didn't know.
- I don't know.

82
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:17,008
Well, I do.
- What are we talking about?

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,036
All I know is that
when I was Laurie's age,

84
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:23,016
I did not appreciate having
middle-Aged men fawn over me.

85
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:24,208
You were once her age?

86
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:29,644
Yes, believe it or not.

87
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,455
Very well.
Not it is.

88
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:41,329
Now, you say Mrs. Dubcek
brought it to us?

89
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,123
Uh-huh.

90
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,138
What do you
think it wants?

91
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:49,185
What is it trying
to tell us?

92
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:51,948
The thing that
scares me the most

93
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:54,448
are the little oranges
in its stomach.

94
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,883
Hello, I'm Dr. Martin Blaine.

95
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,684
Come join me on a path
to personal transformation.

96
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,166
Say yes to you.
- Yes.

97
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:11,699
First of all, you should learn to be
comfortable talking about yourself.

98
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:14,280
When asked your name, you
should say it loud and clear.

99
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,485
Let's try this out.
What's your name?

100
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:18,919
That's a great name.

101
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,756
What is your
primary goal?

102
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:23,285
Harry Solomon.

103
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:27,306
Tommy! Sally!
Harry, come in here.

104
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:30,106
Duh !, what's that?

105
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:31,877
Don't worry.
We've killed it.

106
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,876
Sit down. We have to talk.
- Sally: what is it?

107
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:38,359
There's an important detail
that we forgot to attend to.

108
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,527
We need birthdays.
- No, thank you.

109
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:42,404
This guy I saw at a
restaurant had a birthday,

110
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:44,989
they set his food on fire
and then blew on it.

111
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,912
Well, nevertheless,
we have to have them

112
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:49,725
and we have to know
how old we are.

113
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:51,750
For some reason,
we're expected to act our age,

114
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,154
and we don't
even know what that is.

115
00:05:53,155 --> 00:05:54,702
How are we supposed
to figure it out?

116
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:55,844
We're smart.
We'll guess.

117
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:56,898
How old would
you say I am?

118
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,690
I'm going to say 35.

119
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:05,164
What's so funny?
- It just kind of sounds ridiculous.

120
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,396
Okay, 39.
- Hello. Come on.

121
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:09,777
40?

122
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,600
41, 2, 3, 4?

123
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:15,860
Uh... 5! 5! 5! 45! Yeah.

124
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:19,361
45'S fine. Body's
broken in. It's still solid.

125
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,952
Not too old
to have sex.

126
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,429
Uh, commander,
permission to speak freely?

127
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,290
Permission granted.

128
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:29,598
Humans over 35 cannot have sex.
- No!

129
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,002
Give it up.
It's over.

130
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:34,192
Well, why? They have
the same equipment.

131
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,618
Cause it's gross,
that's why.

132
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:38,237
How old are you?
- 14.

133
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:40,634
Well can you have sex?
- Well, I'm not supposed to.

134
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:43,535
Why not? - Apparently, I have
my whole life ahead of me.

135
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:48,541
Dick, can I be 70?

136
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,971
Why?
- Well, that Paul Newman guy is 70,

137
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,035
and people are always saying
that he looks great.

138
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:55,788
Done. You're 70.

139
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:58,261
And?
- You look great.

140
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,651
Ok, Sally, how old
are you?

141
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,653
Well...

142
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:06,179
whatever the perfect
age is, I'm it.

143
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,807
I mean, maybe I got stuck with being a
woman, but at least I'm in my prime.

144
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:11,476
Check out how firm
this is, huh?

145
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:16,391
You know, if I was a guy,
I'd be all over me right now.

146
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:21,961
If I was a guy,
I would be, too.

147
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,487
Now that you boys are going
through the road to manhood,

148
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm sure many of you have
noticed certain... feelings.

149
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,908
What is it, Solomon?
- What kind of feelings?

150
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,199
You know what kind of feelings.
- No, I don't.

151
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:42,006
You'll know 'em
when you get 'em, hmm?

152
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:43,498
Now,
they're perfectly normal.

153
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,750
For god's sake,
don't act on 'em.

154
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:47,901
Er, sorry, you're losing me.

155
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,757
You play sports,
you focus on your schoolwork,

156
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:54,194
and when you take a shower, you wash
your hair and get the hell out of there.

157
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,069
Oh, you're talking
about sex!

158
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,520
Yes.
- Great! Great.

159
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,044
Tell me exactly
how it's done.

160
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:05,966
Well,

161
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,013
you're... men,

162
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:10,408
and your male
and your female,

163
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,959
they have these...
certain parts,

164
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,465
that are, uh...
how do you call, uh...?

165
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,101
complementary
to each other.

166
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:24,460
These parts
come into play...

167
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:28,172
and that's how
we all were born.

168
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,370
I'm sorry, but
can we get somebody

169
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:33,726
who's actually had sex
to teach this class?

170
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,092
Thanks for showing me
around the campus today.

171
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:43,669
You know, you are really a lot of fun.
- I know.

172
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:48,252
Laurie, I was having a
discussion with a young man last night,

173
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,060
and he said that someone
my age was too old to..

174
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:53,640
well, just too old.

175
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,042
That is so typical
of our culture.

176
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:59,399
You know, in many ancient
societies, like the Incas,

177
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,988
age was worshiped
and revered.

178
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,383
That's all
I'm asking for.

179
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:08,412
Exactly when does
puberty end for a man?

180
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:09,973
Six months after death.

181
00:09:13,106 --> 00:09:15,617
Guys my age are always
trying to prove something,

182
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,594
not like older men.

183
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,714
They've been there.
They've done it. It shows.

184
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,790
Oh like you. You've really
got your head together.

185
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,143
Actually,
it came that way.

186
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,559
Well, I'd better
get moving.

187
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,765
You are moving. Everything
on this planet is moving.

188
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,606
You are so clever.
- Oh, no.

189
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,624
Well, bye, Dr. Albright.
- Bye.

190
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,430
So, see ya.
- Because you're still looking.

191
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,029
You can breathe now.

192
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,458
Hey, if you could change
one thing about me,

193
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:02,196
what would it be?

194
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,895
Nothing.
- Bingo.

195
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:10,772
Doesn't get any better
than this, huh?

196
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:15,249
Check this out. See how this
curves in right here, right?

197
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,516
Watch this.
Upsy-Daisy.

198
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,771
Springs back
just like a cat.

199
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:23,829
Laurie says
that men my age

200
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,571
should be worshiped
and revered, like the Incas.

201
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:29,595
Don't you think that's right?
- Oh Yes.

202
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:31,980
The Incas would take
a prominent man,

203
00:10:33,368 --> 00:10:34,545
like you,

204
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:38,204
and they would anoint him
with oils, adorn him with robes,

205
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,352
and then the high priest
would cut him up

206
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:43,073
and then ram a stick
in his head

207
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,267
and parade the head
through the village,

208
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:48,967
and the young virgins
would throw flowers at him.

209
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:52,132
What kind of flowers?

210
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,279
Well, it says here that
this is guaranteed

211
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,526
to restore
your natural luster.

212
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:02,079
Oh, Dick, you're getting
your luster back.

213
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:04,582
That's wonderful.
How much longer?

214
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:06,455
Oh, er..two minutes.

215
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,027
Welcome back to
The Miss Universe Pageant.

216
00:11:09,028 --> 00:11:11,854
And now we continue
with our Parade of Nations.

217
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:13,361
Miss Finland.

218
00:11:13,562 --> 00:11:16,280
Well, they only have
contestants from earth.

219
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:18,875
I think this pageant
is fixed.

220
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,204
These women
should be enormous.

221
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,575
Miss universe should have
her own gravitational pull.

222
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,243
I think I'm feeling it.

223
00:11:28,113 --> 00:11:30,615
My primary goal is
to meet miss Finland.

224
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:33,148
I will meet
miss Finland.

225
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:36,331
I deserve to meet
miss Finland.

226
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,696
Ooh! Check out the yabos
on miss Tunisia.

227
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,022
I deserve those yabos.

228
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,465
These women,
they're all vibrant,

229
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,814
healthy, strong, young.
They're just like Sally.

230
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:51,236
Thank you. I've been
thinking about this.

231
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:54,126
Every time I turn on the Tv
or open a magazine,

232
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:55,513
I see people like me.

233
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:59,617
All the ads are aimed
at me. I am what counts.

234
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,587
I think you're full
of something, lieutenant.

235
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:05,783
No, no, no, no. If I don't
watch a Tv show, it's canceled.

236
00:12:05,784 --> 00:12:07,623
I don't like
a soft drink, history.

237
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:10,424
If I don't like a certain
feminine product with wings,

238
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,887
they'll make one
with a propeller.

239
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:15,850
I am the target
demographic.

240
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,845
Face it, Dick.
I'm young,

241
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:20,689
hot and all-powerful.

242
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:23,594
You just said
yes to you.

243
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:25,686
I'm done.

244
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,010
How do I look?

245
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:31,093
Um... Dick,

246
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:33,140
um... okay,
if somebody

247
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,283
were helping you
with an experiment,

248
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:37,010
and things went awry,

249
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:39,494
and you became
horribly disfigured,

250
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:42,154
you wouldn't hold it against them,
now would you? Why? What happened?

251
00:12:42,155 --> 00:12:44,807
Nothing. Destroy
all the mirrors now!

252
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:47,188
No, no!
I've got to see!

253
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,329
Oh, my god!

254
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,738
I'm gorgeous!

255
00:13:04,054 --> 00:13:05,031
Good morning, Nina.

256
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:08,174
Well!
Good morning.

257
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:10,610
I was going to ask
what you did this weekend,

258
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:12,436
but I think
it's painfully clear.

259
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:16,048
By the way,
happy birthday.

260
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:17,387
hmm...

261
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,605
brace yourself.

262
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:31,925
Hello..
oh, my god!

263
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:34,578
What's the matter?

264
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,362
Nothing.

265
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:40,268
Laurie called me last night.
- Really?

266
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:41,757
What did she say?

267
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:47,905
What was that?
- What?

268
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:53,653
That squeaking.

269
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,376
Why I have no idea.

270
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,945
What did Laurie say
when you talked to her?

271
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:32,148
She's decided to come
here next year.

272
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:33,852
Oh, isn't that nice?

273
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,064
Yes.

274
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:38,166
Um...

275
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:42,430
could you walk over there
and get me that pencil?

276
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:48,866
But you have one
right on your desk.

277
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:50,684
I know, but...

278
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,802
I need that one.

279
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:55,656
Okay.

280
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:07,601
Thank you.

281
00:15:08,501 --> 00:15:11,733
Oh, I got you
a birthday card.

282
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,156
Hmm. "Happy birthday.

283
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,861
You look like
a million dollars.

284
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:17,005
Oh!

285
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:19,090
Old and wrinkled.

286
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:23,054
What kind of a cruel
hoax is this?

287
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,806
It's a hallmark card.

288
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,472
A hallmark
of degradation!

289
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:29,716
The first line lulled me
into a false sense of security,

290
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,161
and the second line
ripped out my heart,

291
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,798
and slapped me
across the face with it,

292
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,915
awakening me to harsh reality.
- It's an old joke!

293
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,266
For an old fool!

294
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:40,210
Well, I want
no part of it.

295
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:43,478
I'm leaving, while I
still have my dignity.

296
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,576
Congratulations, you have completed

297
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:05,420
your path to personal
transformation.

298
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,094
Say yes to you.
- Yes.

299
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,747
And never forget, when
the world gets you down,

300
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:12,340
stay positive.

301
00:16:12,341 --> 00:16:15,086
I'm almost completely
sure that I will.

302
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:20,188
Damn! A wrinkle!

303
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,794
I've peaked!

304
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:32,050
The truth is,
time measured in years,

305
00:16:32,051 --> 00:16:33,370
would have
no significance at all.

306
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:35,530
If a second-rate sun
hadn't pulled this planet,

307
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:37,933
into the little suck party
we call gravity,

308
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:42,250
causing everything on it
to wither... and die.

309
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,185
Thoughts on that? Bug?

310
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,527
It doesn't look
dyed to me.

311
00:16:49,553 --> 00:16:51,026
Let me simplify.

312
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:53,406
If a year is not a year
anywhere but earth,

313
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:56,017
what does that make time
in the universe?

314
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:58,521
Leon, time is what?

315
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:00,947
Don't think, Leon.
Just answer. Time is what?

316
00:17:00,948 --> 00:17:03,301
Take a shot. Go!
- Time is relative?

317
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:06,917
My god, Leon,
you're right!

318
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:09,372
My head hurts.

319
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:13,327
Leon, I have
a follow-up question.

320
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:18,068
Sorry, time is up.
Oh, and by the way,

321
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,018
you're all
55 minutes older.

322
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,921
Dr. Solomon.
- Laurie.

323
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,290
I couldn't leave
without saying good-bye.

324
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,553
And I couldn't say good-bye
without your leaving.

325
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,760
Oh, you changed your hair.

326
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,186
Finally,
someone noticed.

327
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,254
Laurie, car's outside.

328
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,858
Oh, I'll be right there.
- Who's that?

329
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,235
Oh that's Doug.
He's my boyfriend.

330
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:43,767
But I thought you
only liked older men.

331
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:46,200
I do. He's 29.

332
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:48,532
Bye.

333
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,573
Dr. Solomon,
there you are.

334
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:02,684
Remember we were
supposed to meet in your office?

335
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,156
Oh forgive me,
My tired brain forgot,

336
00:18:05,157 --> 00:18:08,015
while your youthful synapses
stored the information,

337
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:09,926
and retrieved them,
ssst, like a flash.

338
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:12,327
Okay, I'll come back.

339
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:15,188
Leon, let me ask
you something.

340
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,514
Let's say that two people
of different ages met

341
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,898
at a university.

342
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,716
One is older but dashing, the
other, youthful and stimulating.

343
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:26,977
They obviously enjoy
each other's company,

344
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:30,602
but the age difference
keeps asserting itself.

345
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:34,277
Do you think that that should
make a relationship impossible?

346
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,799
Dr. Solomon, are you
coming on to me?

347
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,291
Oh! Never mind!

348
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,078
Oh, Dick.

349
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:48,275
Your posture tells me
you've got the blues.

350
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:50,261
Let my positive energies,

351
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,891
spark you out of your
doldrums and into a happier..

352
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:55,659
oh, go away.
- I will. And thanks for listening.

353
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,219
Hello.

354
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:04,617
How're you feeling?
- Like a million dollars.

355
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,297
I thought I'd try this
again. Oh, here.

356
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,937
Happy birthday...

357
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:13,521
from Dr. Albright.

358
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:15,722
You wrote this yourself.

359
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,350
Yes.

360
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:21,131
Thank you.
It's just lovely.

361
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,464
You're welcome.

362
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:24,313
Dr. Albright,

363
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,735
have I been
a perfect ass?

364
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:28,625
Nobody's perfect.

365
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,052
Why do I have
to be this age?

366
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:35,865
You're focusing too much
on the container.

367
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:37,683
This body is not you.

368
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:39,579
I know that.
- No, you don't.

369
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,037
Trust me, I do.
- No, I don't think you do.

370
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:43,549
If you think,
No..shut up.

371
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:46,824
You're only on this earth
a short amount of time.

372
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:47,976
Well, that was the plan.

373
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,111
Listen, if we're
over the hill,

374
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:56,166
we might as well
enjoy the ride down.

375
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:58,516
Thank you
for saying "we".

376
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:01,571
It just slipped out.

377
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,167
You know, the light of
the moon is so magical.

378
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:19,621
It shows me what you
must have looked like,

379
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:21,353
so many years ago.

380
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,220
That was...
almost beautiful.

381
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:33,014
So, this is
your favorite spot.

382
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:35,265
It's so...

383
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:37,421
cheap.

384
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:42,509
I think gray hair makes
you look distinguished.

385
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,107
Thank you. I think you would
look distinguished with gray hair.

386
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:47,746
No, I don't think so.

387
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,067
Men look distinguished
with gray hair.

388
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,341
Women just look old.

389
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,382
When women get breasts,
they look sexy.

390
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:55,549
When men get breasts,
they look old.

391
00:20:58,171 --> 00:20:59,903
Good point.

392
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,135
How old are you?

393
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:05,032
How old are you?
- You first.

394
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,156
No, you first.
- You.

395
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,910
42.
- Me, too!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
