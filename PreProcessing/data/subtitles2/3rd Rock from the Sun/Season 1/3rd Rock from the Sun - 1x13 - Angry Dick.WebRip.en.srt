1
00:00:06,324 --> 00:00:08,121
It's a perfect night
for observing.

2
00:00:08,122 --> 00:00:10,333
It's warm, dark.
The air is crystal clear.

3
00:00:10,723 --> 00:00:12,577
Okay, they're in bed.

4
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,849
You know,
I'm not satisfied

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,346
watching the Mullers from afar.
This isn't what humans do.

6
00:00:23,347 --> 00:00:26,138
Humans don't just observe
each other. They interact.

7
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:29,781
We should make contact with them.
- Ohh!

8
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:32,817
Here's something
different.

9
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,788
You know, without their
clothes, they seem kind of..

10
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,341
gelatinous?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:43,309
What is he looking for?
- I'm not sure yet.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,987
Wait. Wait!
Yes, this is it.

13
00:00:46,988 --> 00:00:49,099
I believe they're
going to mate.

14
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,680
Tommy, pay attention.

15
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,312
Why? This is like

16
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:57,847
sweating to the oldies
without music.

17
00:00:57,848 --> 00:01:00,409
This is important.

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,909
Sex is how humans enrich
their relationships

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,256
and reaffirm the commitment
they've made to each other.

20
00:01:05,257 --> 00:01:07,533
It's the most sacred, intimate part..
- they're done.

21
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:11,493
Already?

22
00:01:11,796 --> 00:01:14,431
Thank you very much!

23
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,445
with the fiery eyes?

24
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,076
Katie couric.

25
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,263
Katie couric.

26
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:11,212
It sounds like something
beautiful stuck in your throat.

27
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:13,231
Mrs. Dubcek,

28
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:15,512
I need to go next door
and become neighborly.

29
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:20,366
What do you know about the Mullers?
- They're lovely, very nice.

30
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,903
Of course,
I shouldn't talk.

31
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:26,729
It's true your voice is not
one of your best assets,

32
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,945
but go ahead.
- All right.

33
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:31,497
The Mullers have had
their ups and downs.

34
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:35,056
I guess her husband had some
problems in the bedroom area.

35
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:36,548
Which area?
The closet?

36
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,937
That's what I thought
it was at first, too,

37
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:41,518
but it turned out to be
a vitamin deficiency.

38
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,113
Vitamin deficiency? Mr.
Muller and I can talk about that.

39
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:47,080
No, no. Stick
to sports or cars.

40
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,812
Cars, yes.
That's great!

41
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:52,574
I have a car.

42
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:56,089
Oh, why am I doing
this to myself?

43
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:59,888
She probably doesn't
even know I'm alive.

44
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,371
No, she knows.

45
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:21,808
Hi there, neighbour. You know anything about cars?
- Is this your car?

46
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:24,232
Yeah. I seem to be
having some trouble with my...

47
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,804
spark nuts.

48
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,466
Well sometimes with these
old ones,

49
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,602
you're better just to call the
junk man and have it towed away.

50
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:34,898
No, I couldn't do that.
I love this car.

51
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:37,628
It has a compartment
just for gloves.

52
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:39,838
Dick Solomon.
- Frank Muller.

53
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,789
Haven't seen you
around much.

54
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,416
I've seen a lot of you
and your wife.

55
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:49,514
She says you're some big
deal professor at the college.

56
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:51,699
Hardly. It's
quantum astrophysics.

57
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,185
A drugged monkey
could do it.

58
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,884
What about you?
- I work the line at the ball bearing plant.

59
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:58,421
No, the cincor plant?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:01,457
Are you kidding?
I love your bearings.

61
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,078
What do you make? Thrust bearings or linear?

62
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,375
Actually, I do
journal bearings.

63
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,981
Wow! Is that plain
or rolling contact?

64
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,479
On a good day, both.

65
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:13,288
Man, the stories
you must have.

66
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,914
A few, a few.

67
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,811
I thought you'd be more of an egghead.
- No, all meat.

68
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:33,851
Frank!
- There's the boss.

69
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,942
Well, I'll see
you around.

70
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,368
Oh, no big deal,

71
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:41,170
but your car's parked

72
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,421
about eight inches over the
property line. Could you watch that?

73
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:46,797
I'll go you one better.
I'll stop doing it.

74
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:48,776
Thanks, friend.

75
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,395
"Friend."

76
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:01,327
Watching television
is amazing.

77
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:04,128
I haven't had a thought
in my head for three hours.

78
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:07,208
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

79
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,485
Pseudofamily.
- Where have you been?

80
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:12,884
I have been...

81
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:15,306
in Frank Muller's garage.

82
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,981
We bragged, we laughed,
we tinkered.

83
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:19,893
He let me touch
his stuff.

84
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:22,220
It feels so good to be
around Frank.

85
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,602
It fills an empty space
I've been feeling right here.

86
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:27,864
I think it's
because we're friends.

87
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:31,675
So no one told you
it was gonna be this way.

88
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:38,040
What is this?
- Shake 'n bake chicken. Just eat it.

89
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:41,414
No, this isn't chicken.
This is just... flakes.

90
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,666
Okay, stay right there.
- Sally, you must learn to cook.

91
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,465
How far do you think you're
going to go with just a fabulous body

92
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:50,483
and the intellect of a genius?
- The box had a picture of a chicken on it.

93
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,933
I shaked it, I baked it. What
else am I supposed to do with it?

94
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,318
Why don't you ask Mrs.
Muller? Get close to her.

95
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sure she knows
how to cook something.

96
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,364
Do I have to?
- Yes. They're plump. We're emaciated.

97
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:02,812
You do the maths.

98
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,767
Making a friend
is so simple.

99
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,533
You may not be as good
at it as I am,

100
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,007
but I command you to try.
- What is the point?

101
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:13,073
We're not going to learn about
humans by watching television.

102
00:06:13,074 --> 00:06:15,638
We have to mix
ourselves among them,

103
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,477
walk a mile
in their pants.

104
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,768
I just don't know how
to talk to women.

105
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:22,777
I'm sure you can find
something to say to her.

106
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:25,753
You could walk on the beach
and discuss itching.

107
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:31,560
Oh, how exciting.

108
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:33,713
I am so glad
I get to be the woman.

109
00:06:33,714 --> 00:06:37,213
Next planet, I get to be
something big with horns.

110
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:40,500
Okay, so
the shake 'n bake

111
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:43,445
is just a cocoon for the chicken.
- Yep.

112
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:46,648
And chiclets are not
chicken at all, right?

113
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,994
You're not from Ohio, are you?
- No.

114
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,455
I can tell.

115
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,335
I don't envy you having
to take care of three men.

116
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:58,025
I only got Frank,
and he's a full-time job.

117
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:01,521
Just once I'd like to see
that man pick up a sock.

118
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:04,470
I'd like to see men put
their dirty dishes in the sink.

119
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,718
I'd like to see them
do laundry.

120
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,704
I'd like to see them crammed
between two steel wheels

121
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,702
and ground
into a fine paste

122
00:07:13,591 --> 00:07:16,653
You know, I'd like
to see that myself.

123
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,965
You let me know.

124
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:25,813
Oh, you're dangerous.
- Oh, yes, I am.

125
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:30,716
I like you.
You can come by anytime.

126
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,078
I will.

127
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:34,358
But do me a favor,

128
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,758
before you settle down and
get married, you have some fun.

129
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,513
If I had your figure, I'd find
some old millionaire in Florida

130
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:43,367
and slowly suck
the life out of him.

131
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,383
I have the very
equipment to do that.

132
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,185
I'm sure you do.

133
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:55,719
Hi, neighbor.
- Hey, how're you doin'?

134
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,051
Harry, Tommy, this
is Frank, my friend.

135
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:01,009
Yeah, hi.
- Is this place magnificent?

136
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,130
It's the garage mahal.

137
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,912
Well you've gotta have someplace to
get away from the clucking.

138
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,125
Ooh, color.

139
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:17,934
60 channels of it.

140
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,353
Knock yourself out.

141
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,670
Dick, look. Debbie says
that the new promax router

142
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,954
can handle even
the wildest curves.

143
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:29,251
I don't know
if Debbie realizes

144
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:30,969
that can be taken
two ways.

145
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:34,935
Frank, this is new.
What is it?

146
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:36,842
A back scratcher.
- May I?

147
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:38,182
Be my guest.

148
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:41,769
Oh! Oh, this
is heavenly.

149
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,241
That spot has been
driving me nuts

150
00:08:43,242 --> 00:08:45,867
ever since
we landed. Oh!

151
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:47,239
Please, keep it.

152
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,001
Really?

153
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:52,230
I've never received
a gift before.

154
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:54,885
I have to give you something,
take Tommy.

155
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:59,636
Frank!
- That's the boss calling.

156
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:01,816
You know, it's fascinating,
every time his wife calls,

157
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,345
he jumps.

158
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:05,813
See you around.
- You can count on it. I like you, Frank.

159
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:08,216
After all the time
I've spent at the university,

160
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:12,697
it's refreshing to meet someone
who doesn't pretend to be smart.

161
00:09:28,138 --> 00:09:30,695
"Jerry dates a blind
girl. Repeat."

162
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:33,176
Jerry dates
a blind girl.

163
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,762
You know, it gains nothing
the second time.

164
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:39,946
This has been a
rebroadcast of the 11 o'clock news.

165
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,827
We will resume
programming at 6:00 a.m.

166
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:47,851
It's the snow show.

167
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,696
I saw this one
last night.

168
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,590
So what do we do now?

169
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,438
Why don't we go visit
our friends, the Mullers?

170
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:59,293
lets.
- Great! Will they be home?

171
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,922
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Where else would they be?

172
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,074
Hi, neighbor.
- Wh-what's the matter?

173
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,199
Nothing.
- It's 3:00 in the morning.

174
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,967
Patty said I could
drop by anytime.

175
00:10:16,968 --> 00:10:19,193
Don't worry,
we brought gifts.

176
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:21,387
A flank steak
for milady

177
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:24,170
and "the Tv guide
crossword" for monsieur.

178
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:27,453
And by the way, the answer to "I blank Lucy"

179
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,615
isn't what you think.

180
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:32,623
Who is this?
- That's my daughter Cindy. She's in college.

181
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:34,699
My compliments.
She's a definite triumph

182
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,733
of aerobics
over genetics.

183
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,564
I think someone would
like to see her naked.

184
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,211
So, let's fire up
the barbecue.

185
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,668
Frank, if
you're in danger, shout!

186
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:52,096
Go back to sleep!
- You seem upset, Frank.

187
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:53,632
Go home.
- Why?

188
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:56,452
Maybe they want to have sex.
- Again?

189
00:10:56,453 --> 00:10:58,101
Excuse me?
- It's not what you're thinking.

190
00:10:58,102 --> 00:11:01,023
It's just that we're
so fascinated by you.

191
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:03,234
We've never met anyone of
your economic class before.

192
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,763
My class?

193
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,892
Like you're so much
better than we are?

194
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,400
Well, yes,
but you'll evolve.

195
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:11,465
And until then,
we can still be friends.

196
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:14,726
Friends?!
You are not my friend.

197
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:16,931
We're best friends.

198
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:20,051
No, we're not!
Get the hell outta here!

199
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,465
And another thing.

200
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:27,029
Get your precious car
off my property!

201
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,791
Fine! We can tell
when we're not wanted.

202
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,675
We're not wanted.
Ohhhh.

203
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,838
It seems that
some of the...

204
00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:48,687
subtler principles
of electron motion

205
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,676
were beyond
everyone's grasp.

206
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,955
Be thankful it's just a grade.

207
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:55,361
In most places,
this kind of performance

208
00:11:55,362 --> 00:11:56,891
gets you a spanking
that still burns

209
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:59,561
when you're
blown out the airlock.

210
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:03,201
Dr. Solomon, are you at least
going to grade us on a curve?

211
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:05,846
Of course not..
I grade on a transient loop.

212
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,638
What?
- It's very simple.

213
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:15,807
Your expected score
is located here,

214
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,197
the parameters of your actual
performance are here, here and here,

215
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:21,631
driving the expectation
versus performance data

216
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:24,873
into the last three loops,
two of which can't be seen

217
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:29,801
because, of course,
they're factored only in time.

218
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,445
So is my "a"
still an "a"?

219
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:39,162
Oh, Caryn.

220
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:41,283
No.

221
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,530
This shouldn't be all
that difficult for you.

222
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,280
The interactions
of elementary particles

223
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:49,491
are far simpler than the
interactions between people.

224
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:51,467
For example.. Leon,

225
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:54,174
do you have any friends
in this class?

226
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:59,005
Well, sometimes
I talk to Caryn.

227
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:02,155
So Caryn is your friend?
- Yes.

228
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,118
I see. Pitman, you and
bug are friends, right?

229
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:09,319
Yeah, since third grade.

230
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,376
We used to trade
underwear on sleepovers.

231
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:15,521
Shut up.

232
00:13:15,522 --> 00:13:17,590
And this friendship
weathers all circumstance,

233
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:20,910
survives the frictions of
daily life completely intact?

234
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,027
Absolutely.
- Yeah, totally.

235
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:23,884
Even though he obviously
thinks you're stupid?

236
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,334
You think I'm stupid?

237
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:26,496
Only in a good way.

238
00:13:27,145 --> 00:13:28,968
So there you have it..
friendship,

239
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,340
obviously just
a big waste of time.

240
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:32,786
And yet everyone
on the planet

241
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:35,930
gets all worked up about
these pointless little behaviours,

242
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,876
blissfully unaware of
the great vaporizing meteor

243
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:40,901
due in 2015...

244
00:13:42,742 --> 00:13:46,565
which obviously doesn't
exist because I'm kidding.

245
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:54,726
Patty, thanks for
letting Harry come along.

246
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:57,838
He's a little traumatized
by all the tension at home.

247
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,555
Wheee eeeeee!

248
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:03,413
So does Frank know
you're with me?

249
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:05,415
No, I told him
I was setting a perm.

250
00:14:05,987 --> 00:14:07,194
Does Dick know
you're with me?

251
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:08,767
No, I injected him
with a sedative.

252
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:10,288
I've got at least
two more hours.

253
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:12,700
Ooh,
like "Thelma & Louise,"

254
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:15,531
except we just came to the
supermarket and we haven't murdered anyone.

255
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,451
It's early yet.

256
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:21,717
They're so stubborn. Why
do men have to be that way?

257
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,650
I'm still trying to figure
out their fascination with

258
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,474
burping the alphabet.

259
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,231
Now, the key to tomatoes
is you gotta squeeze 'em.

260
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,109
If they're soft,
they're ready.

261
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:35,633
This one's ready.

262
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:41,138
I'm the high commander!

263
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:46,122
When our interests are challenged...
- What are you watching now?

264
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,767
It's the president
Clinton show.

265
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,054
He looks good on camera,

266
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,427
but his show
is incredibly dull.

267
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,862
Dick, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

268
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,550
No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

269
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:01,234
Okay, but your back
is starting to bleed.

270
00:15:03,044 --> 00:15:05,852
I wish I had a remote.
Frank had a remote.

271
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:08,731
If you like Frank so much, why
don't you go live at Frank's house?

272
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:11,410
Sit down.

273
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:13,039
What is
your big problem?

274
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,724
Nothing. I just
reached out to Frank,

275
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:15,849
and he kicked me
in the teeth

276
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,569
because Frank hates me
for no good reason.

277
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,652
But, hey, that's Frank.
- Humans are not perfect.

278
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:24,524
Well, that's a convenient
excuse, isn't it?

279
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:27,189
You just can't admit when you're wrong.
- Oh, please.

280
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,294
It's not like I've never
bonded with a life-form, lieutenant.

281
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:32,570
Yes, yes, we know.
You've bonded beautifully

282
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:34,748
with creatures
on nine different systems.

283
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:37,275
And those that
wouldn't bond we ate.

284
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:41,342
It's different here, Dick.
To bond with a human,

285
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,559
you have to give and take,
like me and patty.

286
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,869
It's not worth
the trouble.

287
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,471
I can be perfectly content
as a disaffected loner.

288
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,675
Was that you?

289
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:53,493
No... and I
always tell you.

290
00:15:55,785 --> 00:15:57,972
Someone's towing away
the rambler.

291
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:00,301
It's Muller!

292
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:02,778
why is he taking the car?

293
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:06,971
Because he knows
I love it.

294
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:08,854
I told you, Solomon..

295
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:13,199
eight inches
over my property!  Ha!

296
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,688
Dick, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

297
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:18,051
There's an odd sensation
moving through my body.

298
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:23,034
Whooo.... the hell does
that stupid sack of fat

299
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:24,948
think he is anyway?!

300
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,694
Dick?
- I have a plan.

301
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:31,273
Remember, we're not allowed
to liquify humans.

302
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,731
Okay, I have
another plan.

303
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:38,588
That's it. I'm invoking a
supreme directive.

304
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,518
I'll need witnesses.

305
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:44,626
What is it?
- I want you to remember who you are.

306
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:47,609
I'm the high commander.
- And what is the high commander's oath?

307
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:52,215
As high commander, I
vow to handle all problems

308
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:53,715
with strength
and deliberation.

309
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,581
I will strive to understand
other life-forms.

310
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:58,319
I will avoid aggression

311
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,848
and make peace with
all those who piss me off.

312
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,620
What are you doing here?

313
00:17:09,316 --> 00:17:11,288
We've come to apologize
and make a peace offering.

314
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:14,720
So the great professor
offers the lowly chump a present

315
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,333
and makes it better.
- That's what we're hoping.

316
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,189
It's a double-sleeved
roller bearing.

317
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,039
Look, you can talk
down to me,

318
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,707
you can wake me up
at 3:00 in the morning,

319
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,099
but you can't buy me off.

320
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,847
It's cambered.
- Get out!

321
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,743
Aren't you listening,
chunky? He's apologizing.

322
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:34,848
Now, now, now.. we are not
going to sink down to his level.

323
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:35,998
My level?

324
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,070
You people always go
straight to the snob stuff.

325
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,234
Who are you calling "people"?
You want a piece of me, huh?

326
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,134
You want a piece, huh?

327
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:46,472
Oh!

328
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:48,975
You want to fight?
Come on! Come on!

329
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,768
That's enough.
- Get your hands off of me.

330
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,129
Sorry.
- I-don't-like it!

331
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,079
Please don't do that.
- Oh, yeah, what are you gonna do about it?

332
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,339
Huh? Huh? Huh?
Egghead! Brainiac!

333
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,011
Dick, I am so disappointed in you.

334
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:06,894
I don't know what
happened. I just lost control.

335
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,930
Yeah, well, you hurt a human.
- We are in so much trouble. What if he talks?

336
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:13,343
He won't if we finish him off.
- This is awful!

337
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,827
Well, you should feel awful, pal.
- But I don't.

338
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,027
I feel better,
and powerful.

339
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:19,889
This is why
people have friends..

340
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,037
so they can hit them.

341
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:25,637
This is incredible. It's
the best I've ever felt!

342
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:30,871
Well, there's
the down side.

343
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:40,822
Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:42,997
I'm so sorry
about all this.

345
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:44,393
but Frank can be
such an idiot.

346
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,896
How's your brother?
Is he licking his wounds?

347
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:50,489
He tried, but he couldn't
reach 'em, so he made Harry do it.

348
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,312
Hello.

349
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,233
You let sleeping dogs lie, Frank Muller.

350
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,841
This is guy stuff. Don't
get your panties in a wad.

351
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:03,255
That's some
good advice, thanks.

352
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:06,629
So, uh, how're
you doin'?

353
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,588
I'm swollen, thank you.
- So am I.

354
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:12,110
Why are you
suddenly so civil?

355
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,111
Now we understand
each other's boundaries.

356
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:16,473
You know my limits.
I know your limits.

357
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:18,238
Now we can respect
each other.

358
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,933
Wait, let me see if I can
get this straight.

359
00:19:20,934 --> 00:19:23,461
In order to achieve
each other's respect,

360
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,890
you had to resort to
violent confrontation.

361
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:29,481
Now, doesn't that
strike you as stupid?

362
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:34,284
Kids, huh?
- They don't understand the world.

363
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,501
So, uh,
we still friends?

364
00:19:39,005 --> 00:19:40,467
Sure.

365
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:50,346
Okay, I finished
my letter.

366
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,048
"Dear president Clinton,

367
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,360
I've seen
your program on TV,

368
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,623
and I think
you need help.

369
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:01,131
Maybe in
the next episode

370
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,918
there could be gunfire

371
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:07,329
or even some explosions.

372
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,226
I know I'd like that.

373
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:12,221
Thanks for letting me
share my thoughts..

374
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,431
oh, I forgot to include
my name and address.

375
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:18,570
You know,
patty is a woman

376
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,524
of unexpected depth
and wisdom.

377
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,584
She does things
with contact paper

378
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:24,856
most women
can only dream of.

379
00:20:25,278 --> 00:20:26,865
I think I finally
understand

380
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:29,079
this compelling urge
to make friends.

381
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,785
It isn't intellectual
at all.

382
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:33,977
These bodies have a basic
physical need for other people.

383
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:36,095
Well, in a biology
this primitive,

384
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:38,089
there are bound to be
a few weaknesses.

385
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,016
But that's the paradox.
It's not a weakness.

386
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,680
That need is what
brings them together,

387
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:46,038
and that unity is an
enormous source of power.

388
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,012
Yeah, it's powerful, all
right, but it's dangerous.

389
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:52,538
There are some urges we're just
going to have to learn to control.

390
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:55,050
Whoa! Their
daughter's home.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
