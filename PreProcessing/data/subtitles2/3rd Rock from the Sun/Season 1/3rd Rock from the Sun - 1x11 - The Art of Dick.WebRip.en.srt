1
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:05,017
Look at this "Garfield."

2
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:15,569
I don't care what language
you speak, that cat's funny.

3
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:17,990
What have you
got there, Harry?

4
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:21,986
Yesterday I was exploring the
park, and I found this stone.

5
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:24,190
Look at it.
It's been worn

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,560
to a perfect sphere by the
elements and dimpled by time.

7
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,904
Harry, that's
a golf ball.

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,773
You've got way too much
free time on your hands.

9
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:36,370
Well, you know, Dick, I've tried a lot
of different things since we got to earth,

10
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:39,827
and I've made a discovery..
I'm not good at anything.

11
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:41,588
There's got to be something
that you can do.

12
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:43,870
Here, let me look
through the want ads.

13
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:47,270
What's that smell?
- I'm making blueberry muffins.

14
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,353
Smells like they're done.
- No, the timer didn't go off.

15
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:51,935
Yes, but lieutenant..
- I have incinerated entire armies.

16
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:53,700
I think I can handle
an oven.

17
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,128
I'm glad to hear
you say that

18
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,230
'cause I signed you up for a bake sale.
- What's a bake sale?

19
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:03,307
It's just an attempt to
revive a failing educational system

20
00:01:03,308 --> 00:01:04,554
through parental
involvement.

21
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:07,263
A fine cause.
I'm there.

22
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:10,294
I really think you should
check on those muffins.

23
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,198
The box said 15 minutes.
You don't argue with the box.

24
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:15,227
Here's something
that you could do.

25
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:17,342
They want somebody to
sweep up the burger palace.

26
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,830
Oh, sure,

27
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:22,042
after about four years
of grad school maybe.

28
00:01:22,043 --> 00:01:23,786
Now they're done.

29
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:26,710
Ooh! Look at this.

30
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,411
Here's a job I can do.

31
00:01:28,412 --> 00:01:30,946
"Police seek third gunman".

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,512
Tomorrow I'm going to march
right down to the police station

33
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:41,562
and tell them I'm the man they're looking for.
- Good for you.

34
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:42,631
They're ready,

35
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:44,283
but they're just going
to be a little burnt.

36
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:33,654
This is the bake sale committee, right?
- Yes.

37
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,822
I don't believe I've seen you before.
- I don't believe you're blond.

38
00:02:41,185 --> 00:02:44,309
Okay, everybody,
let's take our seats

39
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,330
and get started.

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,904
As you know,
this is my sixth year

41
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:51,024
as chairman
of the bake sale.

42
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:52,116
And, um...

43
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,159
I think we've done
pretty darn well.

44
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,367
Last year, we raised $500.

45
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:01,272
How much did you
make before that?

46
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:02,889
Well, I don't
want to brag,

47
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,791
but we've made roughly $500
each of the last six years.

48
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,437
Uh-huh. So what
you're saying is,

49
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,345
the group is stagnating
under your leadership.

50
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,865
You're new around here.

51
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,109
Let's start the meeting,
shall we?

52
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,124
Any thoughts
on this year's sale?

53
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,242
Yeah, I have a thought.

54
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,825
This group isn't advancing.
It's retreating.

55
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:24,673
You dropped
the ball, sister.

56
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:27,631
I am a master chef.

57
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:30,689
I trained at the culinary
institute of Pittsburgh.

58
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,675
I think I know a little bit about baking.

59
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:36,041
Okay, well, here's what
I know about baking: zip.

60
00:03:36,042 --> 00:03:37,871
These troops
need a leader,

61
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:41,057
not some chirpy, weak-
chinned, underachieving drone.

62
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,042
No offence.

63
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:46,092
Look, if you aim for 500
bucks, you get 500 bucks.

64
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,508
But there's a saying
where I come from...

65
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:50,592
"when you want to punch someone in the
nose, you aim for the back of the head."

66
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,935
That is, if they
have a head.

67
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:56,425
So aim for 10 grand and don't
settle for anything less than five.

68
00:03:57,995 --> 00:03:59,375
Um, grace...

69
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:01,752
I think she should
be in charge.

70
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,593
Ah! Good morning, Nina.
- Good morning.

71
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:16,671
Nina, my brother Harry is trying to
find something to keep himself busy.

72
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:18,785
I was just wondering,
how did you get this job?

73
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:20,797
I found a magic lamp
on the beach,

74
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,518
and this was
my first wish.

75
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:24,506
Wonderful.

76
00:04:24,507 --> 00:04:26,953
How can Harry get hold
of a magic lamp?

77
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,071
Good morning, Dr. Solomon.
- Ah, Dr. Albright.

78
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,185
There's something different
about you this morning.

79
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:38,526
I have a new blouse.
- No, that's not it.

80
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,471
And I hope you didn't pay
too much for it.

81
00:04:42,278 --> 00:04:44,095
That's it! It's the box. What's in it?

82
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:46,599
Oh, this?
Painting supplies.

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,352
I'm taking a painting class.
I'm not very good at it.

84
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,373
So, you're bad.

85
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,363
I wouldn't say
I was bad.

86
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,243
You have to understand I have
incredibly high standards

87
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,634
and I tend to be
very critical of myself.

88
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,072
But, as an amateur,

89
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:02,661
I've demonstrated
quite a bit of potential.

90
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:03,690
So, you're bad.

91
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:06,636
Yeah,

92
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:09,672
but art is
essentially subjective.

93
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:11,458
There is no good or bad.

94
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:14,202
So if you stink, you're still allowed to do it?
- Well...

95
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:17,422
that sounds perfect.
- Are you interested?

96
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,372
Me? Don't be
ridiculous.

97
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,222
I was talking about Harry.
- Oh.

98
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:24,408
Oh, you thought I was worried
about being less than perfect?

99
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:26,887
That's rich.

100
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:31,723
Here's how
it's going to work.

101
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:35,252
Doors open, crowd come in. First
thing they see: finger pastries.

102
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,737
They nosh a little,
they're delighted.

103
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,767
They continue on
to the layer cakes.

104
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:40,916
The smell hits 'em,
they're drooling like rabid dog

105
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,921
Then the heavy artillery.

106
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:45,406
They reach the walnut bread, the
almond bars, the cashew squares.

107
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:47,093
Bang! We got 'em
by the roasted nuts.

108
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,477
Carry on, lieutenant.
- Thank you, sir.

109
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,103
Sally, that was
Andy Larson on the phone.

110
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,239
Did you really make his mom do
one-Handed push-ups till she cried?

111
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,023
Yes. She had to be broken
for the sake of the unit.

112
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:06,113
You know, this art
is fascinating.

113
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:08,391
Every era, every culture,

114
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:09,823
they all have
their own art.

115
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:12,401
What drives them to create this?
- Naked women.

116
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,599
These are not
naked women.

117
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,175
They're nudes.

118
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,945
Nudity is the artist's
passionate celebration of the human form.

119
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,218
Well, party on.

120
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:26,188
Dick, why is it that you see
nude people in museums,

121
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,326
but they never show 'em on Tv?
- Sure, they do,

122
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:30,658
but never in comedies,
only in dramas,

123
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,839
and, even then,
only when the ratings sag.

124
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,187
Harry.

125
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,165
Harry, what's wrong?

126
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:41,058
I got fired from my job
at the kids' pizza place.

127
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:43,275
Oh, no.
- Yes. They dressed me up like a giant mouse,

128
00:06:43,276 --> 00:06:45,643
so I figure I'll just
get into character,

129
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:48,085
and then they complain
when I eat off the floor.

130
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,583
Don't you worry about that. I
found something else for you to do.

131
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,347
You're coming with me
to an art class.

132
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:55,949
Art? I wasn't creative
enough to be a rodent.

133
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:58,621
No, no, you don't have
to be creative to do art.

134
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:01,708
You just have to be a certain
type. You've been ostracized,

135
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:04,780
spit upon, and strangers
repeatedly tell you that you're crazy.

136
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,171
You've got
everything it takes.

137
00:07:07,536 --> 00:07:09,886
"The last supper"
by Leonardo Da Vinci.

138
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,834
Boy, the guy in the middle really
knows how to throw a party, huh?

139
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:15,836
And he's sitting
in front of the archway.

140
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:19,236
So what?
- The negative space in the archway

141
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:20,771
draws our focus.

142
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:23,059
And the hills
outside the archway

143
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,619
fade into a bluish haze,
creating distance.

144
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,199
So it's sort of like
it's not just a party,

145
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:30,851
it's a going-away party.

146
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:35,273
Harry, I'm impressed.
- Mmm, me, too.

147
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:36,792
Can we buy it?

148
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,907
Don't be silly. After one
week, we'd be sick of it.

149
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,371
Oh, Dick, this
is wonderful.

150
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:50,358
Do you have any idea
how good it feels

151
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:54,093
to do something for the
first time and not suck at it?

152
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:58,448
Well, hello. It's nice to
see a couple of fresh faces.

153
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:02,501
Well we're very fresh,
Squeeze my head, it's soft.

154
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,408
Oh, Harry, that's
really interesting.

155
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,709
I remember that.
- Yeah.

156
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,965
That was that thing that
burst out of that guy's thorax.

157
00:08:14,966 --> 00:08:16,677
And we hit it and hit it
and hit it...

158
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:18,988
and it just wouldn't die.

159
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,227
It's... a family joke.
Sorry.

160
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:27,335
All right, class,
let's take a look

161
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:29,350
at what we've been working
on for the last two weeks.

162
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:31,720
Who would like to be first?
- Mary.

163
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:38,927
I call this painting
"spirits of spring."

164
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,581
When I was growing up
in Indiana

165
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,862
and all the other kids would
exclude me from their playing,

166
00:08:43,863 --> 00:08:46,466
I'd sit in my yard
and anxiously await

167
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:49,642
the tiny crocuses to pop their
happy heads out from their winter sleep.

168
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:52,320
Oh! That's
a beautiful story.

169
00:08:52,321 --> 00:08:54,358
Oh!
- It's a lousy painting,

170
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,188
but it is
a beautiful story.

171
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:58,916
It's very nice,
Dr. Albright.

172
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,574
Anyone have any comments?
- Uh, well, I..

173
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,522
oh, never mind.
It's stupid.

174
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,703
Well, don't let that
stop you, Harry. Go ahead.

175
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,179
Well, um...
I just find

176
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,874
that my focus is drawn
to the upper right corner

177
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,038
but when it gets there,
there's nothing to see.

178
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,069
Maybe you could add
a splash of yellow

179
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,111
to carry out the motif
you've already established.

180
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:23,258
But what do I know?
- Actually, that's a very good suggestion.

181
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,384
Really?
- Really?

182
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:28,340
Yes! Harry, you've really
opened something up for me.

183
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:30,188
I know exactly
what you're saying.

184
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:34,240
Thank you.
Wow! Thank you!

185
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:39,295
You work with her.
Is this sarcasm?

186
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,207
Low-mass black holes form

187
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,357
only when matter is
compressed into enormous densities

188
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:51,358
by very large
external pressures..

189
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,645
and this demonstrates which
principle of quantum matter physics?

190
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:02,372
I'll give you a hint. It has
nothing to do with geometric cosmology.

191
00:10:02,373 --> 00:10:03,571
Anyone?

192
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:07,517
If no one answers,
I'll have to pick someone.

193
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:10,108
Someone please answer.
Please raise your hand.

194
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,721
Please, someone.
Answer, please.

195
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:14,924
Leon, since you're talking,
I'll ask you.

196
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:17,903
What's the principle?
- Wetness?

197
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:21,548
No. Try again.
- Dr. Solomon, why do you keep calling on Leon?

198
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:23,518
It's just not
funny anymore.

199
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:26,380
That's nonsense.

200
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,768
Leon, the only way of
understanding the universe

201
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,972
is to find the limits
of your own intelligence.

202
00:10:30,973 --> 00:10:32,652
I think I've
reached my limit.

203
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,999
Bug.
- Yes, Dr. Solomon?

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,785
You're hiding something.
- It's just a doodle.

205
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:40,761
A doodle?

206
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:43,312
Why, this is
a picture of me

207
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:46,492
with antlers and something
coming out of my buttocks.

208
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:49,981
It's a tail.

209
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:51,817
Well, it is

210
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,525
That's brilliant!
The lines, the contours,

211
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:57,704
the way you've picked up the
essence of my rugged good looks.

212
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,741
It's just a doodle.
- Just a doodle?

213
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:04,114
And Alan thicke
is just an actor.

214
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,537
Tomorrow I want everyone to
bring in three sharpened pencils,

215
00:11:08,538 --> 00:11:10,848
and bug will teach
us all how to doodle.

216
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,319
All right.

217
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:33,335
Damn!

218
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,384
I've tasted your butter
cookies, Mrs. Stevenson,

219
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,477
and, yes, I can believe
it's not butter.

220
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,535
Use a butter substitute, and
you'll find yourself saying,

221
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:50,005
"I can't believe I was bounced out
of this bake sale right onto my ass."

222
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:51,988
Get with the program.

223
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:00,306
Tommy,

224
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,940
do you ever doodle?

225
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:12,415
Why? Was I in
the bathroom too long?

226
00:12:16,217 --> 00:12:19,228
I.. I can't doodle.

227
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,652
Well, Dick,
you're kind of old.

228
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:25,632
Old? Picasso doodled
on tablecloths

229
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:27,120
late into his 60s.

230
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,653
That's disgusting.
- I know.

231
00:12:29,654 --> 00:12:31,385
I just can't draw.

232
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:34,879
Oh, doodling! Oh.

233
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,697
It's inexplicable.

234
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,376
I, who bestride this world
like an intellectual colossus,

235
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:44,629
I, who make lesser men quiver
in awe of my cranial prowess,

236
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,250
I, who..

237
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,364
I've forgotten my point.

238
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:51,152
Dick,
I invented a new color.

239
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:53,468
I combined
red and yellow.

240
00:12:53,469 --> 00:12:55,216
I call it red-yellow.

241
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:59,117
I can't wait to show it in art class.
- Great!

242
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:02,328
Mix up a whole vat of it.
Go! Hop to it,

243
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:06,964
you ironically-gifted
chowderhead.

244
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,648
Why did I say that? What's wrong with me?
- Could it be..

245
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:13,018
and this is just a wild guess.. that
Harry is way better at something than you?

246
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,956
Give me some credit.
I'm the high commander.

247
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,890
I don't engage in
petty rivalry.

248
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:20,355
Look, Dick, you're actually
younger than me, right?

249
00:13:20,356 --> 00:13:23,165
Right.
- But on this mission you got to be taller.

250
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,845
Now, don't you think that
eats my lunch just a little bit?

251
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:30,147
You don't see me whining.
- How can you be so cool about it?

252
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:32,747
'Cause I'm older
than you, little buddy.

253
00:13:36,255 --> 00:13:38,444
Tommy, I got a
reconnaissance report from Mrs. Nadle.

254
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:40,790
Our only real competition
is the kissing booth.

255
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,821
This year
they have hookers.

256
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:47,304
Sally, those are cheerleaders.
- Not if they're charging.

257
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:51,792
Banana nut muffin heads.

258
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:54,680
Are there two parts banana to every one part walnut?
- Yes, ma'am.

259
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,441
I can't hear you.
- Yes, ma'am!

260
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,827
Mmm, mighty tasty rugula,
Mrs. Greenstein.

261
00:14:03,828 --> 00:14:04,789
Thank you, ma'am.

262
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:11,011
Now, before we open the doors, I
just have one more thing to say.

263
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:13,681
You are, by far,
the saddest, sorriest,

264
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:15,606
most pathetic group
of mothers...

265
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,341
I have ever had
the honor of commanding,

266
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,133
and I'll never
forget you.

267
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,218
Music.

268
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:25,374
Doors.

269
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,002
All right, ladies,
take no prisoners

270
00:14:29,003 --> 00:14:31,329
or personal checks.

271
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:40,122
Dick, are you mad at me?

272
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:45,723
No.
- Lately you get this weird grin,

273
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:49,067
like you're hiding something.
It's not about art class, is it?

274
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,377
Art class? Why, no,
I don't care about art.

275
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:54,659
Let's not forget what one of the
great thinkers of the 20th century said..

276
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,471
"art is no damn good."

277
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,832
What great thinker said that?
- Jesse helms.

278
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,517
Besides, I've made
a command decision.

279
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:06,218
We're not going to art class
anymore. It's not productive.

280
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,065
We've experienced it.
Let's move on.

281
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:11,582
All Righty.

282
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:18,849
Permission to speak,
high commander?

283
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:23,657
What did you say?
- Permission to speak, Dick?

284
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,092
You've never asked
permission to speak before.

285
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,252
I've never had anything
worth saying..but..

286
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,878
Dick, this art thing
means a lot to me,

287
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,091
and I have no idea why.

288
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,187
All I know is that
I like doing it.

289
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:40,146
So I want to go tomorrow
whether you go or not.

290
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:43,085
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:48,289
There's no need to be sorry
for something you're good at Harry.

292
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,753
You go to class.
- Really?

293
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:52,755
Ye-es.

294
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,659
If that's what makes you
happy, then I'm happy.

295
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:01,568
Ohh, thanks, Dick.

296
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:04,290
Mmm, now there's
the smile I like.

297
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:16,623
You're soaking wet.

298
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,321
Am I?

299
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,737
You've been acting strangely.
What's wrong?

300
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:22,977
It's kind of hard
to talk about.

301
00:16:22,978 --> 00:16:25,354
I have this... friend

302
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:28,863
whose brother Harry is a
much better artist than he is.

303
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,059
Oh, so this is
about you and Harry.

304
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,340
Am I that transparent?

305
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,618
I'm going to tell you
a little story.

306
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:40,655
My partner
in dance class in college

307
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:41,978
was a girl named Nadia.

308
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:44,210
She got all the leads,
all the attention.

309
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,126
People would
call her lithe,

310
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,904
willowy, leggy.

311
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:53,068
I rehearsed with her.

312
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:55,201
I showed her a tremendous
amount of support.

313
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:56,501
I went to all
the recitals.

314
00:16:56,903 --> 00:16:59,069
She'd leap and twirl
on the stage,

315
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,393
exuding this incredible
sensual grace,

316
00:17:02,046 --> 00:17:05,281
while I sat there,
a frozen smile on my face,

317
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,836
loathing her
for my own inadequacies.

318
00:17:07,837 --> 00:17:09,564
Well, you have
any pictures of her?

319
00:17:10,866 --> 00:17:12,953
That's not the point.

320
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:14,679
The thing
I came to realize

321
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,085
was that she
needed me there.

322
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:20,128
My support inspired
her to dance.

323
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:23,608
That was enough for you?
- Well, look at the "Mona Lisa."

324
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,280
She never picked up
a paintbrush,

325
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:28,526
and yet she inspired the most
famous painting in the world.

326
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:31,749
So it's like whistler and his mother.
- Exactly.

327
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,792
Van Gogh and his potato eaters.
- Yes.

328
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,526
Michelangelo
and his, uh...

329
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:37,752
ceiling full of naked guys
trying to touch fingers.

330
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:40,451
More or less.
- Inspiration.

331
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:41,897
Yes.
- Yes!

332
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:45,132
Thank you!
Thank you!

333
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:48,501
That little story
really helped me. Thank you!

334
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:49,995
Sure.

335
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:54,891
Oh, and by the way, I
love your stubby little legs.

336
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:04,031
Harry, were
your parents artistic?

337
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:07,385
Not really. My mother was a cold receptacle,

338
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,915
and my father
was just a machine.

339
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,237
Well, we all have
our baggage.

340
00:18:14,318 --> 00:18:16,575
But don't forget,
out of suffering

341
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:17,743
comes creativity.

342
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:20,451
You can't spell "painting"
without "pain.

343
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:23,412
Mmm...or "ting.

344
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:30,174
Oh, Dick, you came.

345
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,810
Are you going to paint?
- Even better.

346
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:35,568
I now accept the fact that I
do not have artistic talent,

347
00:18:35,569 --> 00:18:37,739
like you, like Harry.

348
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,565
I know now that
I will never be able

349
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:42,096
to be a part
of a class like this,

350
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,593
but Dr. Albright
has made me see

351
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:47,884
the joy that I can take
in inspiring other people.

352
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:50,104
No, I will never be
an artist,

353
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:52,653
but I can make
a great subject.

354
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,692
Prepare to meet...

355
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:57,746
your muse!

356
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,250
Oh, great...

357
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:20,773
I'm gonna need
more pink.

358
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,521
You're telling me

359
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:28,423
Dr. Solomon
posed for this?

360
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,146
Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,938
Mmm, well, hello,
Dr. Solomon.

362
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:37,147
Well, hello, Nina!

363
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:42,506
Well, I'll leave
you three alone.

364
00:19:44,741 --> 00:19:47,239
Oh! This is wonderful.

365
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,360
I really did inspire
you, didn't I?

366
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:52,385
Yes. - You know, the whole time
I was standing there,

367
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:55,251
I kept thinking about
how you inspired Nadia.

368
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:58,899
Whatever happened to her?
- Alcoholic,

369
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,978
trailer park,
seven kids.

370
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:03,922
No, it really
is a shame.

371
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,253
What do you call it?

372
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:12,408
"Middle-aged naked guy
who can't paint."

373
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:18,494
Leading that bake sale
was exhilarating.

374
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,719
Those women were crying
out for leadership.

375
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,818
You know, over half this
planet's population is female.

376
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:26,659
If I could just
harness their power,

377
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,570
we could easily turn men
into a slave race.

378
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,132
Or maybe just talk hair.

379
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:40,511
You know, I've discovered

380
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:42,465
that here on earth
every human has

381
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:44,731
his own talents
and his own flaws.

382
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:46,894
The smart ones have learned
to use their talents,

383
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:48,004
but the happy ones

384
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,952
have learned
to accept their flaws.

385
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:53,220
I know I've accepted mine.

386
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:55,492
Permission to mention
your receding hairline, sir?

387
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:58,825
Permission denied.

388
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:02,711
Well, here's my latest
painting. It's a still life.

389
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:05,090
That's very interesting.
- And very dark.

390
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:06,436
It's a bunch
of rotten fruit.

391
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:10,898
Yeah, I really got
to learn to paint faster.

9999
