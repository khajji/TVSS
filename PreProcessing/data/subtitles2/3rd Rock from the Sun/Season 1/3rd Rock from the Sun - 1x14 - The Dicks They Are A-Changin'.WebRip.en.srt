1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,338
These deodorants
are a rip-off,

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,902
they always run out by
the time I get to my feet.

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:08,331
Dick, the mail's here.

4
00:00:08,332 --> 00:00:11,501
Ooh, it's my package
from the carousel Cd club.

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:14,371
You infiltrated a club?
- Good work, Harry!

6
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:17,001
I got 10 CDs
for one penny.

7
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:20,086
All I've got to do is buy
eight more at regular store prices

8
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:23,686
which are often at or
below retail store prices.

9
00:00:23,787 --> 00:00:27,772
Well, way to go.
- Like taking candy from a baby.

10
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:29,549
Such primitive
technology.

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,341
I wonder if the people on
this planet will ever discover

12
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:33,123
the superior sound
of vinyl.

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,910
What kind of music did you get?
- I told them to surprise me.

14
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:42,374
well, this is surprising.

15
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:46,393
Uh... why am I
doing this?

16
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,636
Same reason I'm doing
this, I suppose.

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:54,707
This is very powerful.

18
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:57,294
I'm feelin' funky

19
00:00:58,102 --> 00:00:59,582
This is not good.

20
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,819
I can't stop!
- Nobody panic.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,620
Let's get out of here!

22
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,259
Enriched wheat flour,
Butylated Hydroxyanisole,

23
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,256
sodium acid pyrophosphate.

24
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:01,478
Needs more Butylated
Hydroxyanisole.

25
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:03,997
Isn't this interesting?

26
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:07,366
They opened up a
hard rock cafe in Vietnam.

27
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:10,160
The world
has changed, huh?

28
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:11,091
It sure has.

29
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:14,004
Once it was completely
covered with ice.

30
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,055
The administration
office called.

31
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:21,142
They contacted Stanford about
transferring your graduate records,

32
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,538
but they don't seem
to have them.

33
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,361
Are you implying that
I don't have records?

34
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:25,362
All humans have records,
and I'm a human.

35
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:27,209
Therefore, I have records.

36
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,759
I'm sorry, but Stanford says
they have no record of you at all.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,992
Oh, those incompetents.

38
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:33,957
Do I have to fly out to Denver
and straighten this out myself?

39
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:37,394
Stanford's in California,
not Denver.

40
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:40,311
Well, that explains it. They
lost my records in the move.

41
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,900
So you were at Stanford
in the '60s.

42
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,634
Ah, who wasn't?
- I was at Berkeley.

43
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,641
God, that takes me back.

44
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,470
I remember I was at
Stanford once to protest at..

45
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,139
there's only two things
I know about the '60s:

46
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,104
I wasn't born yet, and no one cares. Peace.

47
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:04,500
I guess you had to be there.
- Apparently so.

48
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,995
It was fun though
wasn't it?

49
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:09,091
Out-of-control,
mind-numbing,

50
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:11,261
self-destructive fun.

51
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,105
It sounds like a cliché but

52
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:15,048
I actually remember
burning my bra

53
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:16,806
in front of the Lincoln
reflecting pool.

54
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:20,736
I hope you had the good sense
to jump in and put yourself out.

55
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:24,787
God, I was a rebel.

56
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:01,456
You wouldn't believe it
to look at me now,

57
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:03,461
but back then
I was a wild woman.

58
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:07,066
If I wanted to do something, I just did it.

59
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,379
Did you ever drop acid?
- Oh, constantly.

60
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:13,591
You did a lot of tripping?
- That's how I dropped the acid.

61
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,667
No, seriously,
I want to know.

62
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:20,388
Were you involved in any movements?
- Well, uh, uh, this one.

63
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,065
It's one of my favorites.

64
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,100
Dr. Solomon,
every time

65
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,391
I ask you
about your past,

66
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:32,395
you change the subject.

67
00:04:32,396 --> 00:04:34,995
You know who keeps changing the
subject all the time? My students.

68
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:37,323
One of them is going to
Alaska. How's your brother?

69
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:41,334
Dick, I'm here. Let's go.
- You heard him. Gotta go.

70
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:43,959
You call your father Dick?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,041
When he was younger,
I used to call him peanut.

72
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:51,325
Have to run. See you
tomorrow. Have a wonderful night.

73
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:56,094
''What about Tommy''

74
00:04:56,095 --> 00:05:00,192
''He'Il miss you
when you go''

75
00:05:02,374 --> 00:05:04,912
''Ma's on her own''

76
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:05,913
''Karen's almost grown''

77
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:09,335
this is so sad.

78
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:11,214
''Worried so''...

79
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,638
country singers have
really tough lives.

80
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,744
''stay with Dad awhile''

81
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,651
Why?

82
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:22,606
What's her complaint?
She lives in a trailer.

83
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,512
She could just
roll away somewhere,

84
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:30,109
and the Cd club
would never find her.

85
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,763
What are you
talking about?

86
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:35,280
Do you have any idea
what's involved with this?

87
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,066
The paperwork,
the decisions.

88
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:40,483
Why didn't I go with the
cheese of the month club?

89
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,246
No guesswork,

90
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,130
just cheese.

91
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:49,852
That was a fiasco. You're
the information officer.

92
00:05:49,853 --> 00:05:53,036
How can you brief us on American
history and leave out an entire decade?

93
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:54,722
So I left out the '60s.
So what?

94
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:57,264
Exactly how far back did
you establish our identities?

95
00:05:57,265 --> 00:05:59,082
Five or six... months.

96
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,876
Your assignment
was to provide

97
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:04,084
full and complete
histories for all of us.

98
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07,116
I had a book report due on "are
you there, god? It's me, Margaret."

99
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:12,568
Tommy, I'm not sure
you understand

100
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,225
the importance of this.

101
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:16,983
Humans are creations
of their past.

102
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:19,762
Society, culture,
even biology,

103
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:23,078
demand that they carry around
their past like baggage.

104
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,560
And your lack of effort almost
exposed the entire operation.

105
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:29,286
Fine. So from now on,
my homework comes last.

106
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:31,070
Those are the house
rules, mister.

107
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:32,487
Hello! Hello!

108
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:35,468
I found those books on the '60s.
- Good, good.

109
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,420
Never mind the bourbon stains.
- Thank you, Mrs. D.

110
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:41,589
Oh, the '60s. What a lovely, lovely decade.

111
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:44,739
A lot of the stuff in this
apartment is from the '60s.

112
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,723
Boy, classic things
never go out of style.

113
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:52,091
Those long-haired freaks
thought they were so cool.

114
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:53,367
Let me tell you
one thing.

115
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:56,184
I was reading poetry
with Jack Kerouac

116
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,930
in a cage in 1956,

117
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:00,168
both of us buck naked.

118
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,204
Yes, well, thank you

119
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,143
for that disturbing visual.

120
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:09,645
I didn't hear
Kerouac complain.

121
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:17,578
Aw, "the electric
kool-Aid acid test."

122
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,972
Getting nostalgic?
- Ah, yes, "those were the days, my friend."

123
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:24,127
But you know,
all this uproar,

124
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:26,587
all this rhetoric, all this
talk about mass movements

125
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:28,631
what's happening here?

126
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:31,415
History is made by the
individual, not by the masses.

127
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,657
Who said that?
- I did.

128
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,965
No, where is that from?
- My mouth.

129
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:39,224
No, somebody said that.

130
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,087
Hello.

131
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:42,423
That was me.

132
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,880
This is so weird.

133
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,091
Right on.
- You've been rinsed and hung out to dry.

134
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:56,186
Think about it.
Dig it, babe.

135
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:57,414
That's what's happening.

136
00:07:57,415 --> 00:08:00,584
History is made by the
individual, not by the masses.

137
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:05,153
Who said that?
- I did.

138
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:09,425
wow!
- That's beautiful.

139
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:16,949
What's the matter?
- I couldn't put it together until now.

140
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,811
It finally clicked..
the evasiveness,

141
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:22,655
consistencies
in your past.

142
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,030
Dick Solomon is a false
identity, isn't it?

143
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:27,765
False identity? Me?

144
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,217
You could have
trusted me, you know.

145
00:08:33,218 --> 00:08:36,935
Well, I, I, I, I..
- There are so many people in the government

146
00:08:36,936 --> 00:08:39,364
who would love to get
their hands on you.

147
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:40,901
You can't
let that happen.

148
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:42,855
They'd parade me around
like an animal.

149
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:44,886
Don't worry.

150
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,290
Your secret's safe
with me, Manny.

151
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,842
Manny Rosenberg.

152
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,089
But I'm not Manny Rosenberg..
- Of course not,

153
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:59,683
because Manny Rosenberg

154
00:08:59,684 --> 00:09:01,507
is still being hunted

155
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,397
by the Fbi.

156
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,186
For food or sport?

157
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,047
So Manny Rosenberg was..

158
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:22,584
what?

159
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:26,002
Manny Rosenberg
was an act

160
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:27,613
What?

161
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:29,368
Excuse me.

162
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:36,398
Okay, where was I?

163
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,670
Manny Rosenberg
was an activist

164
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:40,628
involved in inciting
a riot in 1971.

165
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:43,014
Is there anything else?
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

166
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,825
All right, I found
another box in the basement.

167
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:46,977
What's "x-mas"?
- I don't know,

168
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:49,827
but it's got to be something
psychedelic. Check this out.

169
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,183
This is heavy.
- Far out.

170
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:55,083
My mind is blown.
- Who is this?

171
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,225
I think it's
jerry Garcia.

172
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,721
Look, here's a picture
of Manny Rosenberg.

173
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,359
He looks exactly
like you.

174
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,816
Oh, damn!

175
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:07,293
I was supposed to get
a completely original body.

176
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:09,472
Those guys in research
can't do anything right.

177
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:11,261
What do you expect?
They're non-union.

178
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,427
This could really
be trouble.

179
00:10:13,428 --> 00:10:15,229
Tommy, how are you coming
along with our histories?

180
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,520
I have them right here

181
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:18,643
legal documents,
school records,

182
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:20,481
doctored pictures,
the works.

183
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:23,426
Dick Solomon, class nerd, held
back by a domineering mother,

184
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:27,020
went to work for Nasa in '74, but was
fired after a minor procurement scandal.

185
00:10:27,021 --> 00:10:28,702
Newspaper clippings
are enclosed.

186
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:30,975
Major burnout led to a string
of second-rate teaching jobs,

187
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:33,929
yada, yada, yada, ending up here.
- This is excellent.

188
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,625
What about me?
- Stockbroker during the greedy '80s.

189
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:40,048
Made and lost several fortunes
before psychological problems

190
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:43,444
and gender confusion led to a
sex change operation in 1988.

191
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:49,963
I'm next.
- Harry, you're adopted,

192
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,513
but we haven't
told you yet.

193
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:57,989
Ohh, that's gonna hurt.

194
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,734
Dr. Albright,
I'm glad you're here.

195
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:07,716
Good morning,
Dr. Solomon.

196
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:10,557
Yes, well, I'd
like to clear up

197
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:12,977
a few misunderstandings
about yesterday.

198
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:14,248
For some reason,
you mistakenly think

199
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:17,037
that I'm this
Manny Rosenberg fellow.

200
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:19,705
I brought in this
documentation to prove....

201
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:21,221
Oh don't even bother.

202
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,233
I told you
you could trust me.

203
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:26,626
You probably don't remember,
but we've actually met before.

204
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:29,233
You spoke
at my campus in '69.

205
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:32,121
Now, that's impossible.
I was in the circus then.

206
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:35,082
The flying solomoskis.
There were six of us.

207
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,586
Two of us plunged
to our deaths.

208
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:41,630
I don't expect you to remember me,
what with all the people you've met.

209
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:44,845
You're sitting on my desk.
You've never done that before.

210
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,921
Do you remember ever being
at Berkeley, at a rally?

211
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:51,055
You're not listening to me. I
brought all this in to prove to you

212
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,286
the stories you must have.
- What?

213
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:56,405
You know I'd be lying
if I said I found this

214
00:11:56,406 --> 00:11:59,062
less than intriguing.

215
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:10,685
Well, all those years
underground, you do a lot of living.

216
00:12:16,164 --> 00:12:17,281
Harry?

217
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:20,933
You got another package
from the Cd club.

218
00:12:21,545 --> 00:12:24,976
I don't have time to listen
to the ones I have.

219
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,333
Those demons,
they're not human.

220
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:30,098
Neither are we.

221
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,798
Well, yeah, but we have
an excuse. Hello.

222
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,773
I'm off to Dr. Albright's.

223
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:40,986
She bought my phony profile, huh?
- I don't even need it.

224
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:43,619
She likes me much better,
now that she thinks I'm Manny.

225
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,081
Oh, great, so after all I went through

226
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:47,647
creating a background
for you?

227
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,156
Do you realize I got you
a weekend in Cancún

228
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:52,057
with twin gymnasts?

229
00:12:52,494 --> 00:12:54,919
All I got at the orphanage
was a beating

230
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,643
when I asked
for more gruel.

231
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,135
hello.
- For you.

232
00:13:13,136 --> 00:13:15,455
You shouldn't have.

233
00:13:15,456 --> 00:13:16,918
I'm glad you came.

234
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:20,220
And to think
all this time

235
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:22,569
I was just a desk away

236
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,187
from danger.

237
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:27,709
The thought of the F.B.I.
watching us right now

238
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,678
is such a turn-on.

239
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:32,404
Yes. And even
if I wasn't Manny,

240
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,097
it would be
just as exciting.

241
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:35,554
Don't be silly.

242
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:41,347
Are these...
"magic" brownies?

243
00:13:41,348 --> 00:13:43,613
Pepperidge farm.

244
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:48,413
You know, I think
I have something.

245
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:51,685
I found it when I moved eight
years ago. It's in the freezer.

246
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:53,096
It's a joint.

247
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:55,340
Oh, a doobie.

248
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:58,023
Let's Bogart
that fat boy.

249
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:03,355
You know what I regret? I
never made it to Woodstock.

250
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,883
Ah, yes, Woodstock,
the three-day concert

251
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,666
held on a farm
in upstate new York

252
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,863
that included many of the most
popular music bands of the time,

253
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:13,538
felt to be the culmination of
the counterculture movement,

254
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:17,366
captured by the song, "
Woodstock," by Joni Mitchell.

255
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,179
Found it!
- The song was popularized

256
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,737
by Crosby, stills & Nash,
which is ironic

257
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:23,248
since theirs was the more
commercial version

258
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:25,770
which is the antithesis of
the spirit of the festival.

259
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:29,924
Here we go.

260
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:43,722
This isn't a joint.

261
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,250
It's a frozen French fry.

262
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:51,768
Oh, well, I guess we'll
just settle for wine.

263
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,958
You're an inspiration
to all...

264
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,366
neo-trotskyite
anti-Stalinist Marxists.

265
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:05,196
You know, you're pretty
tuned in for a bourgeois chick.

266
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:20,417
Meet me on the waterbed
upstairs in five minutes.

267
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,535
Oh, and, uh...

268
00:15:22,407 --> 00:15:24,082
lose the pins.

269
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,296
What?

270
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:39,620
Here's to... waterbeds.

271
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,147
Okay..here's to...

272
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:45,507
floor lamps.

273
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,220
Hello.
Carousel Cd club?

274
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,643
I'll call back later.
- Do not hang up that phone.

275
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:56,182
You can do
this, Harry.

276
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,135
You can break free.

277
00:15:58,605 --> 00:16:01,144
You can take
your mind back,

278
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,437
or at least
what's left of it.

279
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,432
Okay, Sally, I will.

280
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:10,092
Listen to me, buster. I'm not
happy, and I want my money back.

281
00:16:10,093 --> 00:16:12,934
Very good.
- I'm supposed to press "2" now.

282
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,798
Yes. Hello?
We need to talk.

283
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:19,686
I'm at a place
in my life

284
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,533
where I'm just not ready
for this kind of commitment.

285
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:25,435
I think it's best
that we break free,

286
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,072
go our separate ways.

287
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:29,048
You will?

288
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:31,049
Oh, thanks!

289
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,856
Hmm?

290
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:34,917
Well...

291
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:37,753
yes, I guess
I do have a friend

292
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:39,569
who might be interested.

293
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:43,584
Her name is
Sally Solomon.

294
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,687
Oh! Oh,
I can't believe

295
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:53,495
we're doing this.

296
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,054
Your hands are
so small and delicate.

297
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,349
I'm not positive,

298
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,502
but I think I can fit
your entire foot in my mouth.

299
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:04,909
Oh!

300
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,727
You are a superfreak.

301
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,715
"The kind you don't
take home to mother."

302
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,429
Oh, Manny, Manny!

303
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,983
Now I'm feeling
a moral dilemma.

304
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm not sure I can
go through with this.

305
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:22,088
My bedroom's upstairs.

306
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,700
Race ya.

307
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:27,539
Oh, what the hell.

308
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,135
What the hell...?
- Don't be uptight, babe.

309
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,748
Leave your hang-ups
in suburbia.

310
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,082
You're leaving?
- You bet your bippy I am.

311
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,591
hey!
- You miserable creep!

312
00:17:53,592 --> 00:17:55,985
I don't understand.
- Think about it.

313
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:58,657
It's like you put a
purple haze inside my brain.

314
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:00,147
Give it a rest.

315
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:03,700
What did I do wrong?
- You know what you did.

316
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:09,960
Come on, Manny.
Berkeley..1969.

317
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,801
Oh, you're mad
at Manny.

318
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,465
Yes, Dr. Albright

319
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:17,837
is mad at Manny.

320
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:20,760
Oh! Oh, Manny.
It's okay

321
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:22,720
because I have something
to tell you

322
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:24,406
that's going to straighten
this whole thing out.

323
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,055
I'm not Manny.

324
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,800
Isn't that ironic?

325
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:32,734
Right, you're
not Manny.

326
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,645
You just look
exactly like him,

327
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,091
know everything
about his past,

328
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:40,044
and have been carrying on this
ridiculous charade for three days.

329
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:41,910
You know me so well.

330
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,532
Boy, I have been handed

331
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,587
some lame stories
in my life,

332
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,239
but you take the cake.

333
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,612
I don't want the cake.
I want you.

334
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:58,993
Oh, my god,
you ARE Dick Solomon.

335
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:05,236
And you let me make
a complete fool of myself!

336
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:06,682
How could you do that?

337
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:08,627
I needed to tell you.
I was going to tell you.

338
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:11,050
What stopped you?
- I thought you might sleep with me.

339
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:15,386
Oh.

340
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,207
Now I understand.
- Oh, thank goodness.

341
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,320
Get out!

342
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:26,579
You selfish, inconsiderate,
opportunistic bastard!

343
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:28,122
You're right.

344
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,822
I guess I'll be going.

345
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:36,977
About inconsiderate,
I did bring brownies.

346
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:44,768
I sure am glad you won't be getting
any more of these CDs in the mail.

347
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:47,061
Yeah, and even
if we do,

348
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,686
there's no reason to think that I
would have anything to do with it

349
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:52,514
cause I didn't.

350
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,710
Dick, someone's
here to see you.

351
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:58,215
I don't want to be seen.
Tell them that I'm not here.

352
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,061
He's not here, Dr. Albright, so go away.

353
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:02,259
Mary! Mary!

354
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,440
You've come
back to me

355
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,001
because you've forgiven me
for what I've done

356
00:20:07,002 --> 00:20:09,921
and.. and because
you realise

357
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,987
that my deceit,
although sophomoric,

358
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:14,788
was meant as a pure
gesture of affection.

359
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,497
Well..some of that.

360
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:20,329
Would you leave the two
of us alone for a minute?

361
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:21,375
Sure.

362
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,140
Remember every word.
We want all the details.

363
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,031
Will do.

364
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:31,703
Look, I.. I may
have overreacted

365
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:33,143
to this Manny thing.

366
00:20:33,636 --> 00:20:36,322
And I understand
that men have a tendency

367
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:39,147
to go overboard to
impress me. I understand that.

368
00:20:39,148 --> 00:20:41,213
The only reason
I pretended to be Manny

369
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:44,097
is because you liked him
so much more than me.

370
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,015
Manny wasn't
what he seemed,

371
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,591
but you are exactly
what you seem.

372
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:52,498
And I'll admit that

373
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:55,166
your lack of nuance
is refreshing.

374
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,635
Damn, I think
I'm wearing

375
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:58,052
Harry's underwear again.

376
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:01,365
Well, a little nuance
wouldn't hurt.

377
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,293
So we're still friends?

378
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:06,620
Peace.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
