1
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:05,561
No.

2
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:17,592
Oh! Bazooka Joe...

3
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:22,054
you're an imbecile!

4
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,637
Good morning.
- Dr. Albright.

5
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:33,658
I am about to reveal

6
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,179
something astounding.

7
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:38,944
I think you're
overestimating yourself.

8
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:42,550
Behold!
An Atm card.

9
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:43,435
Oh.

10
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:45,940
Congratulations.

11
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:48,035
You're now a member
of a very elite group

12
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:51,630
of 2, 3, hundred million
Americans.

13
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:53,903
My name is raised. You
can touch it if you want.

14
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,906
No, thanks.

15
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,333
When I press it
into my forehead..

16
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,964
you can read
my name backwards.

17
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:05,736
Pace yourself,
we have a whole semester.

18
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,442
Nina, did I show
you my new..

19
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:10,240
yes, you did, and, no,
I don't want to feel it.

20
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,233
I have a great idea.

21
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:16,296
To celebrate, why don't
I use my new Atm card

22
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:19,096
to withdraw money from one
of many convenient locations,

23
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:20,115
even after
business hours,

24
00:01:21,745 --> 00:01:23,608
and take you out
to dinner tomorrow night?

25
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:25,823
All right.
- Really?

26
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:27,843
Yes.
- You're not just toying with me?

27
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:30,823
You do understand
it's dinner, out?

28
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,494
Yes,

29
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:34,440
but it can't just be
dinner out of the house.

30
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:36,687
It also has to be
dinner out of the car.

31
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:41,419
Yes. Now all I have to do is
put this card into the Atm,

32
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,559
punch in my secret
code, 1-2-3-4

33
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,258
oh, no!

34
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,886
I was never supposed to
reveal my code to anyone!

35
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:54,969
Ooh, well, now you're
going to have to kill us.

36
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:38,295
That was the mall. Wasn't it great?
- How would I know?

37
00:02:38,296 --> 00:02:39,678
The escalator
broke down,

38
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:41,990
and I was stuck there
for an hour and a half.

39
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,403
You know, I think
the entire planet

40
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:47,274
should be covered
by one big roof.

41
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,750
And we should never
be more than 15 feet

42
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,999
from a wienie
on a stick.

43
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,993
Tommy, look what I bought for you.
- A basketball?

44
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:58,319
I've decided that you should join your school's team.
- Why?

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,305
Because it's important
that you experience

46
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:03,327
the humiliation of adolescent
boys at the hands of bitter adults

47
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:05,682
trying to rewrite
the failures of their youth.

48
00:03:07,038 --> 00:03:08,207
It'll be fun.

49
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:12,786
All right, who ripped the
radio out of the dashboard?

50
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,137
What are you talking about?
- The radio, it's gone.

51
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:19,512
Wait a minute, I know what's happened here.

52
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,434
You see it all the time
on the news.

53
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,015
Oh, uh... toupees.

54
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:29,775
No, crime.
We're victims of crime!

55
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,386
What are we supposed
to do now?

56
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,493
The radio's gone. I think we
all know what we have to do.

57
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,124
I can't believe
Dick did this to me.

58
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,285
Why do I have
to play basketball?

59
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:55,912
I know. Team sports are so infantile.

60
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:57,234
It's all masculine
posturing.

61
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:59,747
All the preening and flexing.
- Exactly.

62
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,932
What I really hate is that
there's some primitive part of me

63
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,992
that really
responds to that.

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,001
And what I really hate

65
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:10,902
is being cursed with
the heart of a champion.

66
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:25,183
What is Harry doing?
- It's part of my new security procedures.

67
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:26,391
Oh! Red alert!

68
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:32,867
There's a squirrel
approaching the building.

69
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:36,487
This seems a bit
extreme, lieutenant.

70
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:39,379
With all due respect,
high commander, butt out.

71
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,690
Security's my domain. I'll
take the blame for the radio.

72
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:44,870
Oh, please.
- No, I should have been guarding the rambler

73
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:46,623
instead of shopping
for loofahs.

74
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,965
You're overeacting.

75
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:52,335
Dick, I have been telling you
this planet is in a bad neighborhood.

76
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:56,317
We have been on far worse
planets than this,

77
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:58,681
inhabited by creatures
with far worse breath.

78
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:03,082
I mean, at least we're on a
planet that's governed by laws.

79
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,120
You're too distrustful
of humans.

80
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,136
It's just those
two little eyes

81
00:05:07,137 --> 00:05:08,541
right in the middle
of their head.

82
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:11,473
Makes 'em all look like
they're up to something.

83
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:13,630
Knock, knock.

84
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,293
Hi, hi. I heard about your car radio.

85
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:19,577
Did you call the cops?
- I don't think that's necessary.

86
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:21,446
Don't be silly.
You go down to the station,

87
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,800
you ask for
officer Franco.

88
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,414
An Italian gentlemen,
very nice.

89
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,371
He came right over
when my boyfriend

90
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,130
got beat up
in my living room.

91
00:05:32,156 --> 00:05:34,017
Your boyfriend got beat up
in your own house?

92
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:36,258
Yeah. Well, my husband
didn't care for him.

93
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,146
Wow,

94
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:52,534
I smell the fist
of justice.

95
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:55,961
I smell doughnuts.

96
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,415
Can't you feel
it, Harry..

97
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,147
the stifling sense
of order?

98
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:05,651
The discipline? The
almost robotic lack of emotion?

99
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:07,243
The fluorescent lights?

100
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,587
God help me.

101
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,109
I love it.

102
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:15,409
What can I do
for You?

103
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,369
Just let me be
near you.

104
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,185
Okay.

105
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,142
My name's officer Don.

106
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:28,948
Well, officer Don, we're
here to report a crime.

107
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,284
I blame myself.
I dropped my guard.

108
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:33,976
It's not your fault.
Crime happens.

109
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,161
On the surface, Rutherford may
look like small town America,

110
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:39,535
but just beneath
the well-manicured lawns

111
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:41,925
lies a hotbed
of criminal activity.

112
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:44,047
We may be in the shadow
of Cleveland,

113
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:47,188
but it's in the shadows
where evil lurks.

114
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,971
Wow! Hey,
when you do this,

115
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:55,406
it sort of looks like
"Nypd blue." Wow.

116
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:56,407
Oh, my.

117
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:04,986
Now, what happened?

118
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:06,695
The radio was stolen
out of our rambler.

119
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:09,289
A.M. With those push buttons?
- Yes.

120
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,502
Those sick bastards!

121
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,308
Fill out this form.
- Form? Then what happens?

122
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,536
I make a copy of it.
- And then?

123
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,653
Then on Thursday a girl
comes in and files it.

124
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,707
Paperwork.
If I had my way,

125
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,691
I'd be out in the streets
putting the rats back in their holes.

126
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:27,835
Well, Don, if I had
a gun like that,

127
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:31,127
I wouldn't be sitting behind a
desk until I ran out of bullets.

128
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:43,726
Hi.

129
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:45,632
So what are you
here for?

130
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,879
Well, they picked
me up for vagrancy,

131
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,985
but that's not
the real reason.

132
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,223
I'm here because
they know.

133
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:55,055
They know I'm from the
planet clarion in the bard spiral

134
00:07:55,056 --> 00:07:57,444
on the Cepheus
dracond border.

135
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:03,183
Do you know Steve?

136
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:09,285
Dear lord,

137
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:12,393
if it be within your
great wisdom and mercy,

138
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,731
please grant us the strength and courage

139
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:20,680
excuse me, coach.
- We're in the middle of a prayer Solomon.

140
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:24,107
Do you think we should be
bothering god over a basketball game?

141
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,639
This is important.
- The other team's praying, too.

142
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,311
Oh, so our god is stronger
than their god?

143
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,954
There's only
one god, Solomon.

144
00:08:34,955 --> 00:08:37,901
Am I the only one seeing a
conflict of interest here?

145
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:40,566
Yes! All right,
first in, out on the court!

146
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,371
Let's go! Hustle it out there! Get out there!

147
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,578
There you go.
- Coach, what about me?

148
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,831
I'm sorry.
You're not tall enough.

149
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:49,142
What are you saying?

150
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:53,275
You're too damn short!
Get outta here.

151
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:54,276
Oh!

152
00:08:56,393 --> 00:08:59,636
Why, yes, I will have
another transaction,

153
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:03,004
and this time
in...espanol.

154
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:08,271
I'll be done in a minute. I
just want to see what my limit is.

155
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:10,002
Take your time.
- Look at this.

156
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:13,746
I put the card in, and money
comes out. Card in, money out.

157
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:15,312
Oh!

158
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:18,801
You see this? As much as I
want over and over again.

159
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:21,227
Isn't it amazing?
- Yeah. Now give it to me.

160
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,081
What?
No, no, no.

161
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:26,866
This is my money, but I'm
sure you can have your own card..

162
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,732
Quit foolin' around.
I said, hand it over.

163
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,880
No, let me explain
this to you again.

164
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,116
This $300 is mine,

165
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,488
just like the 100
I just put in my wallet.

166
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:38,223
Yah! Whoa! Yah!

167
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,442
This is all my fault.

168
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:44,912
What was I thinking,
letting you go out by yourself?

169
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:47,571
A man who could steal a
wallet is capable of anything.

170
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:49,913
He could have put you
in a vat of saline

171
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:52,102
and harvested your organs
over a period of months,

172
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:54,996
forcing you to regenerate
kidney after kidney after..

173
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,320
will you stop!
- Now, just relax.

174
00:09:57,321 --> 00:09:59,077
You've got to calm down.
- How can I calm down?

175
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:01,413
I feel
so utterly exposed

176
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:02,849
and vulnerable,

177
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,235
and not in that
fun spanky way.

178
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,202
It's all right.
You're safe now.

179
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:11,848
What kind of a place is this where
you can't wave handfuls of money around

180
00:10:11,849 --> 00:10:13,287
in the middle
of the night?

181
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:18,303
Sir, did this guy have
any distinguishing marks?

182
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,349
His skin was
rather nice.

183
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,323
Well, Mr. Solomon, I can
see that you're pretty upset,

184
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:27,419
so I'll just be giving my home
phone number... to your sister.

185
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:34,195
Call if you have
any... needs.

186
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:40,818
Oh, why did this have to happen?
- It was late.

187
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:43,954
Why did I have to be at that place at
that time, taking out all that money?

188
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:46,211
Don't blame yourself.
- I don't, I blame you!

189
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,020
What?!
- You had to agree to go out with me.

190
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:50,572
You always turn me down. Why
did you pick now to say yes?

191
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:52,659
I don't know.
- You see, you weren't thinking.

192
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:54,849
You can't take
a random act

193
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,431
and turn it around to
blame an innocent person.

194
00:10:56,432 --> 00:11:00,089
Just watch me.
- Why did I think tonight would be any different?

195
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,461
You are insane.
- It's the world that's insane!

196
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,517
They talk about the
universe being random. Ha!

197
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:06,588
This is the place that's random.
- I'm leaving.

198
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:07,989
People assaulting
total strangers

199
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:10,928
for no other reason
than to take their money!

200
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,034
That's right,
run away from the problem!

201
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:15,170
Sooner or later you're going to
have to come to terms with the fact

202
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:17,563
that the earth is a cold, dark and evil place

203
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:18,564
crawling with crazed
ne'er-do-wells

204
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:21,768
and arsenate
jackanapes!

205
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,278
Well, I don't
like it!

206
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:28,392
Lieutenant!
- Yes, sir.

207
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:30,943
This planet has
crossed the line.

208
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:33,173
Assemble
the giant robot.

209
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:39,709
We didn't pack it.
- We didn't? Why not?

210
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:42,851
I wanted to, but you needed
the room for your exercise bike,

211
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,470
which, I might add,
you never use.

212
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:53,543
The strengths of
the refracted light

213
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:55,193
varies...

214
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,180
in accordance
with its velocity

215
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:02,006
as measured in light years per second.
- Dr. Solomon.

216
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:05,120
What is it, Leon?
- Why are you writing like that?

217
00:12:05,121 --> 00:12:07,227
Because we live in world
where, as soon as you turn around,

218
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,810
someone is waiting to stab you
in the back and steal your wallet.

219
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:12,938
Dr. Solomon, you have to
have more faith in people.

220
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:16,277
You know, I think that deep
down there's a basic decency..

221
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,112
oh, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

222
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:23,011
Your chirpy optimism
has no place in reality.

223
00:12:23,012 --> 00:12:25,534
Guess what.
Santa Claus is dead!

224
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:28,504
Beaten senseless
for his shiny black boots!

225
00:12:28,505 --> 00:12:30,896
And his reindeer
don't give a damn!

226
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,087
You know,
Dr. Solomon,

227
00:12:38,088 --> 00:12:40,772
you seem to be carrying
around so much baggage.

228
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:43,288
You're not getting any of
it, so get away from me!

229
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,686
Okay, Let's get this straight.
I don't care how much it costs.

230
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,822
I don't care how difficult
it is to accomplish.

231
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:56,949
I want a security system
that will guarantee

232
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,285
that every moment
of our lives

233
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:01,362
will be filled with a sense of
absolute safety and contentment.

234
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,030
That would be
the electro fort 2000.

235
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:07,496
The alarm connects directly
to our command center downtown

236
00:13:07,497 --> 00:13:11,217
where we immediately dispatch
trained patrolmen to your door.

237
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:13,090
I see. I just
have one question.

238
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,182
Sure.
- Where do I bury my family

239
00:13:15,183 --> 00:13:17,244
after the burglars have
pumped bullets into their skulls

240
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:19,396
while your guys
are strolling over?

241
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,069
That almost
never happens.

242
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,129
May I have a
glass of water?

243
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,412
Where's Tommy?
He should be here.

244
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:30,790
It's all under control. He's in
the driveway playing one-on-one.

245
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,028
Tommy.. Tommy,
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,760
I didn't know I'd be that
good. I've never played before.

247
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:39,302
Your company is
obviously run by amateurs.

248
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,879
This is totally
unsatisfactory.

249
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,447
Allow me to show you
a few schematics

250
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,982
that I drew up.

251
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:48,821
Okay..now, the giant
swinging blade

252
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,637
would fall from here.

253
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:54,465
Steel spikes plunge into
the burglar's eyes here.

254
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,129
And the conveyor belt
drops the carcass

255
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,002
into the tank of
great white sharks here,

256
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:04,147
here... and here.

257
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:07,917
It'll work.

258
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:11,217
Now, that's
a plan.

259
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:18,483
Let's go, girls, don't forget about defence
for crying out loud!

260
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,491
Coach.
- What?

261
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,911
We're up 40 points with two
minutes to go. Come on, put me in.

262
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:23,887
I promise I won't
touch anything.

263
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,921
I'll just stand there.

264
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:31,307
Well.....erm.......No!

265
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:34,743
Ohh! Come on Coach, my girlfriend's
watching.

266
00:14:36,912 --> 00:14:38,554
This is not
just my chance.

267
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:42,374
This is your chance to be
remembered as the beloved coach Strickland

268
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,448
and not as
coach suckland.

269
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,771
That wasn't mine.

270
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,682
Okay, Solomon, enough.
I'll put you in. Just shut up.

271
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:53,169
Thanks, coach.
- You know where player Hansen is?

272
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,602
The guy with the neck thicker than my waist?
- Yeah, that's him.

273
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,728
You go stop him from driving the lane.
- All right.

274
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,436
Good job.

275
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,704
Good morning.
- How are you feeling?

276
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:16,542
Wired, thank you. My entire
house is wired for security.

277
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:18,901
This afternoon I'm getting
an alarm system for the car.

278
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:21,897
Oh, good. Now all you need
is an armed guard

279
00:15:21,898 --> 00:15:24,627
to walk you from the house to
the car. Then you'll be all set.

280
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:26,209
What a good idea.

281
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:29,305
A big scary one. I could hire a criminal.
- Ooh.

282
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:32,417
They're taking my money anyway.
Why not give it to them hourly?

283
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:35,991
All right, stop.
Now you are a victim.

284
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:38,316
You have lost
all trust in humanity.

285
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:42,237
Oh Mary, sweet little Mary.

286
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:45,272
Do you actually believe
that you can trust people?

287
00:15:45,273 --> 00:15:47,550
Yes, I do.
- Really?

288
00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:52,354
Do you trust me?

289
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:56,168
Of course I do.
- And why not?

290
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,019
You work with me.
You see me every day.

291
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,679
You know that
I care about you.

292
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,303
If you can't trust me,
you can't trust anyone.

293
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,834
Do you trust me?
Huh? Huh? Huh?

294
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,849
Dr. So.. ooh.

295
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:13,717
The... police called.
They have your mugger.

296
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,282
They what?
- They have your mugger.

297
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:17,772
This is great!
- You have to go down and identify him.

298
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:20,960
Oh, no.

299
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:24,273
You've got to confront him.
- No, no!

300
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,513
It's the only way to
reassert control over your life.

301
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:29,125
You'll feel better,
believe me.

302
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:31,619
Well, will you
go with me?

303
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,819
Yes, but give me
a minute.

304
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,921
There's one thing that
I really have to do.

305
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:49,674
Okay. Let's go.

306
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,294
I'll get the car.

307
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:02,536
You know, I'm
real proud of you.

308
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,409
For what, the way I slipped
in and out of consciousness?

309
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,739
No, for the way
you were unashamed

310
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,584
to show how
non-athletic you are.

311
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,408
Look, August, I've been
thinking about this.

312
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,222
I've been trying to do everything
that you think that I should do,

313
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:23,612
but it's just
not working.

314
00:17:23,613 --> 00:17:25,140
And I'm sorry
if this redefines

315
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:27,468
the parameters
of our relationship.

316
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:29,356
But you're just going
to have to accept me

317
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:31,284
for who I am,
regardless if I'm short

318
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:33,514
or lousy at basketball
or whatever!

319
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:43,176
You know, I kind of like it
when you're assertive like this.

320
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:46,837
You do?
- But not all the time.

321
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:50,745
Oh. Well, how often do you
think I should be assertive?

322
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:53,399
Well, Tommy, if I told you that..
- Right, right.

323
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,097
I'll figure it out, I'll
figure it out. Is now a good time?

324
00:17:56,098 --> 00:17:57,137
Sure.

325
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,665
Come on.
- Okay.

326
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:08,661
Okay, Mr. Solomon, it's
time to finger your perp.

327
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:11,673
Believe me, I've tried,
but she just won't let me.

328
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,033
No, we need you
to I.D. Your assailant.

329
00:18:21,088 --> 00:18:22,746
Ohh oh well,

330
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,412
I, I, I hope I can remember
what he looks like.

331
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,894
I didn't really get
a good look at him.

332
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:31,725
It was dark, and it
happened so quick.

333
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:33,459
You!

334
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:39,400
You owe me $400!
You..

335
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,951
That's a positive I.D.
- Take his cuffs off!

336
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:45,015
Take 'em off!
I want a fair fight!

337
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:46,831
Rusty.

338
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:52,817
Oh, and by the way,
mugger boy,

339
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:56,655
your skin is not nearly as
creamy as you'd like people to think!

340
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:01,006
Dr. Albright,
thank you.

341
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,385
You were so right.. all I
had to do was confront him.

342
00:19:03,386 --> 00:19:04,888
And beat him
senseless?

343
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:08,012
No, no, no,
that was pure gravy.

344
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,440
Oh. You know,

345
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,353
we never had that dinner.
Care to join me?

346
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:15,711
Mmm, no, not tonight.

347
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm going to do
something

348
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:21,499
that I haven't done for quite awhile.. sleep.

349
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:24,081
Of course, you're welcome
to join me, if you like.

350
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:27,559
I'll pass.

351
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,354
Just being polite.

352
00:19:33,864 --> 00:19:37,097
So, Don, when are you
going to torture him?

353
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:39,439
No, no, he still
has to go to trial.

354
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,831
So then you'll torture
him at the trial?

355
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:43,170
We don't work that way.

356
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:46,055
Everyone has equal rights.
That's the law.

357
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:49,156
Oh, Don,

358
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:51,883
I thought I knew you,

359
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:56,028
but we come
from different worlds.

360
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,068
No, we don't.

361
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,425
You come from a place
filled with laws

362
00:19:59,426 --> 00:20:01,788
and rights
and fair trials.

363
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,992
I come from a place
where the wind blows cold

364
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:07,666
and the only thing
you can count on

365
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,251
is that you can't
count on anything.

366
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,081
You're from Chicago?

367
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,111
Good-bye, Don.

368
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,984
It's too bad.
We could've been great.

369
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,509
Sally, you've
got me all wrong.

370
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,151
Uh, they brought me up
on brutality charges.

371
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,059
There's a video!

372
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,568
I think we should
transfer $500

373
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,279
from our money market account
to our checking account.

374
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,185
We don't have
a money market account.

375
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:43,192
Shh! It doesn't
know that.

376
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:46,517
I'm proud of us for coming
out here tonight.

377
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:49,359
Dr. Albright said
a very wise thing.

378
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,387
She said if you let fear
drive you into hiding,

379
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:55,486
then the criminals
have won.

380
00:20:57,258 --> 00:20:58,999
Dick, there's
someone behind us.

381
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,278
What do they
look like?

382
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:06,120
75, female, very frail.
-  What do we do, lieutenant?

383
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:08,243
Knock her down and run for the car.
- What about the money?

384
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:11,085
We don't have time. Go!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
