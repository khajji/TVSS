1
00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:02,950
Hello!
- Hi, Dick.

2
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:04,065
I brought home
a pizza.

3
00:00:05,582 --> 00:00:08,187
Hey, Dick, how was your day?
- Sally, what are you doing here?

4
00:00:08,188 --> 00:00:09,461
I thought you were
supposed to be out

5
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:11,939
investigating your chemical
attraction to Mr. Randell.

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,956
We had a date,

7
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:14,810
but he had to cancel.
His mother came in town.

8
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:15,610
So?

9
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:18,153
I don't know, he said he
wanted to break me to her gently.

10
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:21,764
So Dick, aren't you going
to ask me how my day went?

11
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,308
Good work, Harry.
Well-Done.

12
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,157
Sally,

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,752
just because you
haven't been invited somewhere

14
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:29,507
is no reason
not to go.

15
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:31,786
Your next assignment
is to meet this mother

16
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:33,526
and study
her maternal power.

17
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:36,341
I could seduce her
if you like.

18
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,657
Uh, no, Harry.

19
00:00:38,658 --> 00:00:40,790
Tommy, have you infiltrated
the glee club yet?

20
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,416
Yeah,
they're very happy.

21
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,992
End of report.
- Good work, Tommy.

22
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:48,753
Hey, what about me?
- Well, what about you?

23
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:50,752
That's my point.
You're the high commander,

24
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:53,687
and she's in charge of security.
He's the information officer.

25
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:55,357
What am I?
- Well, you're...

26
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:57,901
you're Harry.

27
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:01,089
Oh, sure, I got
the fancy title,

28
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:06,658
but what do I do? What am I good at?
- Uhhh...

29
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,142
you.. you paint.
- Oh, yeah, I like painting.

30
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:11,393
Painting, yes.
great, go, paint.

31
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:13,679
Oh, okay, off to my painting.

32
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:16,508
Just yell if you need me.
- Sure, whatever.

33
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,484
Oh, Dick, they've
screwed it up again!

34
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,901
Oh, man!
- Oh, damn!

35
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,822
What's this, Tommy?
- "Star wars." It's a movie.

36
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:07,823
What's all that supposed to be?

37
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:09,895
Outer space.
Can you believe it?

38
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,794
If outer space
was that happen,

39
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:15,326
I never would
have left.

40
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:19,894
Hey Tommy, I'm almost ready.
- Whoa! Where are you going?

41
00:02:19,895 --> 00:02:22,207
I'm taking Tommy to school.
- Oh.

42
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,194
Well, be sure to talk
to that Mr. Randell.

43
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:26,200
Oh, will he be there?

44
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,528
Gosh, I hope
I don't distract him.

45
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:29,425
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

46
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:33,043
You are in big trouble,
and big, big trouble.

47
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:33,792
What's going on?

48
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:35,712
He was painting something
awful on the side of the house.

49
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:37,439
A post-impressionist
urban mural.

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,815
I was given full permission.
Tell her, Dick.

51
00:02:40,816 --> 00:02:44,004
Well, I promise you, Mrs.
Dubcek, Harry will not go unpunished.

52
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:46,009
He will sit in his room
and think about what he did

53
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,422
while you repaint
your house.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,948
Idle hands do the devil's
work. When I was a young girl..

55
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,342
the glacier receded,
creating the great lakes.

56
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,231
I'm sure it was incredible.
Bye-bye, now.

57
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:59,545
Good-bye. Bye-bye, now. Good-bye.

58
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,679
Well, thanks a lot, Dick.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,969
You tell me to paint,

60
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,767
and then you hang me out
to dry like a shirt,

61
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,188
a wet shirt.

62
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,440
A wet shirt
that needs drying.

63
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:18,213
Why is Harry so upset all
of a sudden? Is he mad at me?

64
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,714
No. He just
feels left out.

65
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:24,355
He's searching for his identity, so
he's acting up to get your attention.

66
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:28,017
How do you know all this?
- I see it with sophomores all the time.

67
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,775
What he needs now
is an authority figure.

68
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:32,682
He's got an authority figure.
I'm the high commander.

69
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:34,594
No, I mean a parent.
- Yes.

70
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:37,159
Mr. Randell has a mother,
and he turned out dreamy.

71
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,555
Of course...
Harry needs a father.

72
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,548
I should have seen it.

73
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,011
Well, I can fill
those shoes.

74
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm pretending
to be your father.

75
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:50,280
Of course, I may have
to neglect you for awhile.

76
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:53,178
I know. I don't mind.
You're a terrible father, anyway.

77
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:56,163
Well, you're
a lousy son.

78
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,046
I'm old and set
in my ways.

79
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:00,571
It's going to be different
with my second son.

80
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:05,330
I'm going to be a terrific father to Harry.
- Oh, sure.

81
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:08,393
And I'm going to start off by
being completely honest with him.

82
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:10,691
What do you mean, honest?
- I'm going to tell him about that

83
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:13,029
"thing"
that they put in his head.

84
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,600
Oh, no, no.
- You can't tell him about the thing.

85
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,783
Telling him about the thing
would be a bad thing.

86
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:21,062
Shh! Ix-nay
on the thing-thay.

87
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:24,631
Uh, Harry, I've
made a decision.

88
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:26,284
From now on,

89
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,027
I don't want you to think
of me as your commander.

90
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:31,227
I want you to think
of me as a father,

91
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:33,684
a father
who outranks you.

92
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:38,655
Well, a father? Why?
- Guidance, emotional support.

93
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:40,154
I'll be there for you.

94
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,512
I'll be the wind
beneath your sheets.

95
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:47,269
Harry, you need anything
at all, you come to me.

96
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,579
Well, okay.
Can I borrow the car?

97
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,971
No.
- Can I have some cash?

98
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,099
No.
- Can I bring a woman to my room?

99
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:56,707
Never happen.
- Sure.

100
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:02,634
Oh, well, thanks,
commander.

101
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,839
I mean, Dick.. dad.

102
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,737
Father Dick.

103
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,266
Oh.

104
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:16,031
Hostilities didn't
begin to escalate

105
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:19,786
until the confederate
troops attacked fort Sumter.

106
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,115
And four years later, the
war is pretty much over.

107
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,194
 Mr. Randell.
- Sally.

108
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,346
Hey, Solomon.
- What?

109
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:37,486
Are Randell and your aunt like,
uh, you know?

110
00:05:37,487 --> 00:05:40,465
You know?
- You know?

111
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:44,131
I don't know, why don't you
raise your hand and ask, you mook?

112
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,806
So, did you want to talk
to me about Tommy?

113
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,053
No. Tommy's doing fine.
- Oh.

114
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:53,543
Well, then,
since I'm here,

115
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:54,938
can I meet your mother?

116
00:05:56,743 --> 00:05:58,298
I don't know that you're
ready to meet my mother.

117
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,719
We could have dinner,
the three of us.

118
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
You don't think it's a little early?
- No, no.

119
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,875
I think breakfast would
be early. Dinner's fine.

120
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,002
I don't know, Sally.

121
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,410
She's not an easy person
to get to know.

122
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,917
She's extremely protective,
and she never thinks

123
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,934
anyone or any thing
is good enough for me.

124
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,281
I think she's really
going to like me...

125
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,572
a lot.

126
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:21,275
Hey, bye, Tommy.

127
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:29,002
...Which can be
directly applied

128
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:32,684
to newton's
second law of motion

129
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,920
which, for personal reasons, is my favourite.

130
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:38,924
Isaac newton, of course,
has been called

131
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:42,079
the father of modern physics,
which brings me to another question.

132
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,174
How many of you have fathers?
Show of hands. Anyone? Fathers?

133
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:49,069
Everyone has
fathers. Good.

134
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:52,550
So, who would like to relate
some fatheresque experiences,

135
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:54,312
something very fathely?

136
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,618
Uh, okay, well,

137
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,465
my father and I have
this very special..

138
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:00,916
no, no, no,
Caryn. Please.

139
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:04,220
I'm only interested
in father-son experiences.

140
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:09,158
Bug? tell me about your father.
- My father? Very strict.

141
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:10,555
It didn't matter
that I was the youngest.

142
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,270
When I'd act up, he'd give me his belt.
- You wore the same size?

143
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:18,368
As punishment, he'd put me over
his knee and give me a whooping.

144
00:07:18,369 --> 00:07:20,729
So he gave you
a whooping and a belt?

145
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,171
Uh, with a belt.

146
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,943
And then he gave
you the belt?

147
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,587
Um.....yeah.

148
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,588
Leon, did your dad
ever give you a belt?

149
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,513
No. No,
my dad's great.

150
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:36,847
We have this tradition,

151
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:39,398
every August, we rent
a cabin on lake Erie.

152
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,899
We pick up a case
of tall boys, get faced,

153
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,580
and hit on the girls who
rent the pontoon boats.

154
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,767
He's really good at it.

155
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,327
Tomorrow there
will be a pop quiz

156
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:54,391
on the effects
of thermal dynamics

157
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:55,752
Remember, it's
a pop quiz.

158
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:57,760
If you study,
I'll know.

159
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:03,245
Harry!

160
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:07,256
Son, look what
I brought home for us.

161
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,108
It's a six-pack
of tall boys.

162
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:13,875
Let's say we get faced and
then I'll give you my belt.

163
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,122
Forget it, man.
- What's this?

164
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:23,245
I'm cutting out.
I'm blowing this joint.

165
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:25,315
I'm taking
some powder.

166
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:28,252
You're leaving? You can't leave.
- Face it, Dick.

167
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:29,970
I have
no purpose here.

168
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,837
I'll find you
a purpose.

169
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:35,332
I'll set up a meeting for you
with the campus job counselor.

170
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,111
That's your world,
man, not mine.

171
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:41,484
See, I'm rejecting
all that "9-to-5,

172
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:43,118
make a living,
become a success,

173
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:44,718
feel good about
yourself crap.

174
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:47,545
That's a sucker's
game, man.

175
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,668
Well, colour me gone.

176
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:53,555
But, Harry.. wait.
You're part of the unit.

177
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:56,254
We need you.
- What do you need me for?

178
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,791
Well, uh... because...
we love you,

179
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,470
and you're important
to the family,

180
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,950
and, uh...
you're so pretty.

181
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,341
Well, I may be pretty, but
I know I'm not important.

182
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,887
Well no, Harry..you are important.

183
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,802
I wasn't going
to say this.

184
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:17,803
Harry,

185
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,974
you've got a thing
in your head.

186
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,196
A thing?

187
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,687
A cranial
micro receiver chip.

188
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,549
In my head?
- Yes,

189
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,814
but it's not in the part
you use. It's in your brain.

190
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:41,896
This is so exciting.

191
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:45,313
I think it's every little girl's
dream to meet her boyfriend's mother.

192
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,267
I always thought
it was to get married.

193
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:52,574
Mr. Randell, it's
only been two dates.

194
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,362
When?

195
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:59,440
Hi, honey.
- Mother.

196
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:00,596
Mmm!

197
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:03,584
Well, this
is Sally.

198
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:06,143
Mrs. Randell, it is such
a pleasure to meet you.

199
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,784
You sure squeezed out
a winner, lady.

200
00:10:12,431 --> 00:10:16,172
Why, thank you.
- Why don't we sit down?

201
00:10:18,365 --> 00:10:20,388
Now, which Sally
are you?

202
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:26,024
The only Sally.
- I have to apologize.

203
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,182
It's just that he's
so darn handsome.

204
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:31,652
He attracts so many women, I
tend to get you all confused.

205
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,072
Actually, mother,
I was the one

206
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:36,520
who was attracted to Sally.
She has a beautiful smile.

207
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:38,790
Oh, absolutely.
Are those caps?

208
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,950
Oh, no,
they're teeth,

209
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,353
they go all the way
back. See?

210
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:47,388
Isn't she sweet?
Hm hmm.

211
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:53,376
So I have a receiver
chip in my brain?

212
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,758
And I have this, why?

213
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,983
Well, because

214
00:10:57,984 --> 00:11:00,802
sometimes our
supreme leader,

215
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,221
the big giant head,

216
00:11:02,222 --> 00:11:04,822
well, he needs to
communicate with us,

217
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:07,397
and we picked you..
you, Harry.

218
00:11:07,398 --> 00:11:10,663
Without you, we can't maintain
contact with the home office.

219
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:13,517
There now, don't you
see how important you are?

220
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:17,733
Oh well... does Tommy know about this?
- Yes.

221
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:20,286
Does Sally know about this?
- Yes.

222
00:11:21,012 --> 00:11:23,853
Do you know
about this?

223
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:26,628
Yes.

224
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,825
Look, I'm sorry,
I should have told you sooner, but..

225
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:33,534
isn't it neat to find
out new things about yourself?

226
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:39,431
You have destroyed my life!

227
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,512
Harry, please.
- Oh-hh, so it's okay

228
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,662
for me to have
a thing in my head,

229
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,901
but it's not okay
for me to know about it?

230
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:51,251
And you call
yourself a father.

231
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,662
I'm out of here.

232
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:55,309
No, Harry, you are
not leaving!

233
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,511
You're coming right
back here! That's an order.

234
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:01,609
You know, Dick,
if you were my father,

235
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:04,088
I would think that you would
care enough about my feelings

236
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,671
to just let me go.

237
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,524
You're right. You need to
sort this out for yourself..

238
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:10,415
Go.

239
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,951
But as high commander, I must
have access to that transmitter.

240
00:12:13,952 --> 00:12:15,233
Stay!

241
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,376
But I want you to have
your own space.

242
00:12:18,377 --> 00:12:20,108
Go.

243
00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:22,146
But I can't allow
this breach of protocol.

244
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:23,956
I order you to stay!

245
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:26,326
Leave the nest.
Fly.

246
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,837
I need your head.
You come back here!

247
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:31,951
I'm sorry. Go.
No, stay!

248
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,316
No, go!
Stay! Go!

249
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,614
Stop!

250
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,523
You're tearing me apart!

251
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,075
Give me a beer.
- What kind?

252
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:54,570
The kind you drink.

253
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,014
Hi, I'm margueritte.
Who are you?

254
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,437
I don't know
who I am.

255
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:20,954
All I know is

256
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:23,394
I got something
inside my head,

257
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,757
something that could
go off at any minute,

258
00:13:25,758 --> 00:13:28,819
some sort of
answering machine

259
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,391
with some
cosmic message

260
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,429
sent from somewhere
out there

261
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,351
in the universe.

262
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,488
I'm an Aquarius.

263
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,868
Hey, who are you
talking to?

264
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,689
I don't know, some guy.
- Was he hitting on you?

265
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,201
Why? You jealous?

266
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:47,738
Hey, you talkin'
to my girl?

267
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,718
You don't look old enough
to be her father.

268
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,798
What are you,

269
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:53,743
a comedian?

270
00:13:54,213 --> 00:13:57,297
No, that would be
buddy Hackett.

271
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,072
You got wheels?
- On my car.

272
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:02,360
Okay, you and me, pal.

273
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,757
Dead man's curve. We're
gonna play a game of chicken.

274
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:07,957
I'll stop
at the colonel's!

275
00:14:11,661 --> 00:14:14,220
I wonder how he's doing
out there all by himself.

276
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,493
You know, if you're
a bad father, they leave.

277
00:14:17,494 --> 00:14:19,801
If you're a good
father, they leave.

278
00:14:19,802 --> 00:14:22,300
A parent's love
is like a river.

279
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:24,889
No matter how deep
or strong its current,

280
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,029
it's always flowing
towards a sea of separation.

281
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,486
Lighten up, Dick. You're going to
give yourself a hallmark hernia.

282
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:36,506
Hello. Yes?

283
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,442
The police?
You've got Harry?

284
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,498
He crashed the car...
at dead man's curve?

285
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:43,499
We'll be right over.

286
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,129
Tommy,
something terrible has happened.

287
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,928
Harry crashed the car
at dead man's curve.

288
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:49,773
Why is the father
always the last to know?

289
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,375
Okay, so we've
left the dance,

290
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:57,849
and we're parked in your son's car...
- Sally

291
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,445
and he can't seem
to undo the top hook.

292
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:03,109
Sally, please don't.
Oh come on.

293
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,601
it's a cute story.

294
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:07,806
Let her talk.
- I ordered the salmon. What did you order?

295
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,458
My, that's an interesting dress you're wearing.
- You like my dress?

296
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,728
Good, 'cause I didn't
know if you'd be impressed

297
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,245
by how confident I am
to wear a dress like this.

298
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:19,583
Or maybe I should have gone with
something a little more conservative,

299
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:21,660
as if to say
"what's underneath here

300
00:15:21,661 --> 00:15:23,927
is not for anybody
but your son".

301
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,970
Well, I think that dress
says it's not just for my son,

302
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,075
it's for
the whole room.

303
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,044
Good. That's a relief.

304
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,663
If you want to control my life,
you could be more subtle about it.

305
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:39,634
I don't want
to intrude,

306
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,469
so if you'll excuse me,

307
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,778
I'm going
to the ladies' room.

308
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,899
I think she's upset with
you. I'm going to talk to her.

309
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,634
Sally, I don't think it's--
- Shh! I'm doing it for you.

310
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:01,104
Frances, are you
all right?

311
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:04,103
Me? I'm fine, honey.
It's you I'm worried about.

312
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:05,540
Me?

313
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,322
Well,

314
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:10,667
I'm afraid you're just
not my son's type.

315
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,038
What do you mean?
- Now, don't get me wrong.

316
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:16,145
You're really not half
as cheap as you look.

317
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:20,272
I get it.
You're insulting me, aren't you?

318
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:23,764
I have made such
a huge mistake.

319
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:26,797
I thought you were nice,
but you're not nice.

320
00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:27,846
You hate me.

321
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:31,712
I am so glad we finally
understand each other.

322
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:34,225
Me, too, Frances, 'cause as
long as I'm going to date your son,

323
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,585
I don't want
any problems.

324
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,207
Over my dead body.

325
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,899
Doable.

326
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,657
If you're going
to throw a punch,

327
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,327
try putting your weight
into it, like this.

328
00:16:54,052 --> 00:16:55,263
Ow!

329
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,718
Will the ladies be returning?

330
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:01,686
One of them will.

331
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:10,172
I'm Dr. Solomon.
Where's my son, my son Harry?

332
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,980
Well the good news is
he's alive.

333
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,983
Oh, thank god!

334
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:17,627
But I have to warn you,
he don't look so good.

335
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:22,436
That's what he
always looks like.

336
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,190
Harry!
- Oh, Dick.

337
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:28,863
Harry, I've failed you.

338
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:31,547
If I'd been there for you
when you needed me,

339
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:34,360
then you wouldn't have run out
of the house. You could have died.

340
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,020
Dick, I almost
did die.

341
00:17:37,446 --> 00:17:38,296
What happened?

342
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:41,719
It was the most amazing journey.
- What do you mean?

343
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,544
I was leaving the colonel after picking up chicken--
- Wait. Why a chicken?

344
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:48,064
Long story short,
I have no idea.

345
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,201
So, I was on my way
to the big race,

346
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:54,054
and a paper bag
blew across the road.

347
00:17:54,055 --> 00:17:56,242
I was afraid it was full
of bunnies, so I swerved.

348
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:01,831
And right as the car was
flying into the ditch,

349
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:06,363
my whole life flashed
before my eyes.

350
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,727
Harry, I don't mean to be
insensitive, but what's your point?

351
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:13,741
Well, all I
could think was,

352
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,063
"I have a rage
to live".

353
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:19,231
And then the car
landed, and I said,

354
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:21,483
"hey, world,
I'm alive!

355
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,588
And these pants
are washable."

356
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:31,075
That's a beautiful story.
- Thank you.

357
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,410
Oh, Dick,
it doesn't matter

358
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:35,898
that I'm an underling
with a thing in my head.

359
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,385
What matters most
is life itself.

360
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:40,157
And the greatest
thing about life

361
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:41,829
is not having
a purpose.

362
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:45,213
It's finding...
a purpose.

363
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:46,571
Why, Harry,

364
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,876
you sound
exactly like me.

365
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:52,253
Like fake father,
like fake son.

366
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,850
Dick, could we just
drop the father thing

367
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:58,013
and go back to being
fake brothers?

368
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,306
You don't want me to be your dad anymore?
- No.

369
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,561
Good,

370
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:07,161
because I was this close to
drop-kicking your sorry butt

371
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,542
from here
to the outlet mall!

372
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,096
I'm sorry you had to pay
the damages at the restaurant.

373
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:22,113
No, it was worth
the 1700 dollars.

374
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:25,838
Wait till my brother's
wife hears about this.

375
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,938
Once at Christmas,
she took a clumsy swing,

376
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:30,614
but mom got her in a
headlock and she blacked out.

377
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,621
You were great.
- I really liked her.

378
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,931
I don't think she liked you.
- I didn't like her, either.

379
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,085
I really like
you, though.

380
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:40,861
Same here.

381
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:44,610
Ow!

382
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:47,430
Your mother wears
a lot of rings.

383
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,140
No...

384
00:19:50,724 --> 00:19:52,311
pain can be good.

385
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,683
You know, someday I'd
like to be a real father

386
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:03,784
with a real son..

387
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,549
a little guy who'd be
sweet and cuddly,

388
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,957
pink and puffy,

389
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,890
just like his old man.

390
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,454
You do realize that your son
could wind up being a daughter?

391
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:16,859
Oh, no, no,
not my son.

392
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,992
I bet Mr. Randell
would make a great father.

393
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:23,592
I can see him now,
sitting with his kids,

394
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:25,262
helping them
with their homework,

395
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:28,169
telling them what a cow
pie their grandmother is.

396
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,018
A lovley image.

397
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,395
Yeah, all
this romance talk

398
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:34,947
makes me want to
call my girlfriend.

399
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:37,690
Hey, Harry, can you
give me a dial tone?

400
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,667
Well, aren't we witty.

401
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:47,136
Let me ask you this. Has the
big giant head ever called us?

402
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:50,057
Not yet.
- How will we know when he does?

403
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,107
Well, when the big
giant head calls.

404
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:53,845
Harry will
suddenly go blank

405
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:55,855
and stare off
into space.

406
00:20:58,317 --> 00:21:01,397
Like I said, how will we
know when he does?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
