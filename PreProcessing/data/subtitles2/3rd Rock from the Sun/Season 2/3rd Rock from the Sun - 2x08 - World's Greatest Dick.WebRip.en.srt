1
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,094
Come on, I want to go to the magic shop.

2
00:00:07,095 --> 00:00:08,696
Harry, Sally,
go get some change.

3
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:10,829
We'll wait here
with the car.

4
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:18,550
I got to get new sneakers. My toes
are bursting out of these things.

5
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,863
I just bought you those
three months ago.

6
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:22,240
You know you're a freak, don't you?

7
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:24,344
Leave me alone, I'm growing.

8
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:25,641
If it were just the growing,

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,060
but for every inch you sprout,
you become that much more insolent

10
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:30,782
and do that much worse in school.

11
00:00:30,783 --> 00:00:31,940
So what?

12
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:34,041
You're going to become
the world's tallest idiot.

13
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:35,969
Why are you
on my case?

14
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,561
I just can't stomach

15
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:40,913
another of those interminable
parent-teacher conferences.

16
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,838
Look, I did not ask to be the
teenager, okay? You made me.

17
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:46,889
"Lone star
drilling company."

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,137
I bet they have change.
- Yeah, oil men are rich.

19
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:56,044
Well, check you out.

20
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:58,333
You look just like
a real woman.

21
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:01,314
Thanks.

22
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,624
That's what
I was going for.

23
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,759
You know, I still can't get
used to those mood swings.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,460
Way to commit, girl.

25
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,271
I'll be right back.

26
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:15,329
Hello.

27
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,960
Are you familiar with the art of illusion?

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,883
Hi there.

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,620
Hi there.

30
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:26,346
Could you change
a dollar?

31
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:28,267
For you I could
change anything.

32
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:31,997
You know, I don't see a lot
of men as good-looking as you.

33
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,549
I don't see a lot of men
as good-looking as you.

34
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:44,137
Well, we're fabulous,
aren't we?

35
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,871
Oh, yeah.

36
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:25,731
Hello, hello,
you've got a visitor.

37
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:28,395
Dr. Solomon, I'm Candace Ballard.

38
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:29,755
Hello. What do you want?

39
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:34,282
I'm Tommy's
guidance counselor.

40
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:38,759
And, by the way, my guidance
counselor might stop by tonight.

41
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,793
Didn't I tell you to
become the model student?

42
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:48,181
I did. I've aced every test.
- Then what's she doing here?

43
00:02:48,182 --> 00:02:50,569
I don't know, I'm brilliant, not clairvoyant.

44
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,341
Is it too much to ask that you
just once make me a proud father?

45
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,347
It's not my mission
to make you proud.

46
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,337
It is if I say so.
- It is not!

47
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:01,731
Say it's your mission.
- No!

48
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,590
Go on, say it's your mission.
Say it, say it.

49
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:05,489
It's my mission.

50
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,112
Is everything
all right?

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,509
Everything's fine.
- Then I'll see you la

52
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,421
you get back in here
and sit down!

53
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,987
Sit down.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:19,685
Give me your coat.
- Okay.

55
00:03:36,426 --> 00:03:39,662
How am I supposed to learn
if you keep letting me out?

56
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,102
Well,

57
00:03:47,103 --> 00:03:49,125
I have some news.

58
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,153
Maybe you'd
better sit down.

59
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,555
Tommy scored higher on
the national merit quiz

60
00:03:57,556 --> 00:03:59,192
than anyone
in Ohio's history.

61
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:01,914
It's not my fault!
- That's a good thing.

62
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:04,759
No, that's a good thing.
You should be proud.

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,109
You've raised
a very bright boy.

64
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:09,811
I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that?

65
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,192
You've raised
a very bright boy?

66
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:14,794
No one's ever said that
to me before. Say it again.

67
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:16,657
Well, actually, I wanted..
- No, just say it!

68
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:18,878
I love that.. the bright boy part.
Say it! Say it!

69
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:19,902
Bright boy!

70
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:22,563
In fact, he's done so well,

71
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:25,528
I think he should transfer
to the Pickney country day school

72
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:26,982
for the gifted.

73
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,740
Because I raised
a gifted son?

74
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:34,156
Yes! Look at what you've already given him..

75
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:36,299
the stimulation,

76
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,867
the nurturing,

77
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:40,781
and not to mention...
the genes he inherited.

78
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:44,214
You're right.
I do give a lot as a father.

79
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:46,326
Oh!

80
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:57,706
Sally.

81
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:02,494
There's something
I have to tell you about

82
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:03,667
your boyfriend.

83
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:06,860
He cooks,
he loves the arts,

84
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:08,773
he wears great shoes,

85
00:05:08,774 --> 00:05:10,837
and he's single.

86
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:12,466
Yeah, what's your point?

87
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,943
Sally,

88
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:17,020
marry this man.

89
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:20,282
Tommy!
Come in here!

90
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,236
Tommy!
Great news.

91
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,394
I'm sending you
to the Pickney school,

92
00:05:24,395 --> 00:05:26,028
where our accomplishments
will be recognized.

93
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:29,928
What?! No, I don't want to go.
I'll have to leave all my friends.

94
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,465
Stop thinking of yourself.

95
00:05:31,466 --> 00:05:34,543
Think of me
and how proud I'll be.

96
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:37,640
He'll go.
- Wonderful.

97
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,605
A little something
to graze on.

98
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,310
I'm out.

99
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,986
I'm out
of the closet.

100
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,675
I love this family.

101
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:03,123
What is Dick's problem?

102
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:05,391
I don't want to go to the Pickney school.

103
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:06,598
Of course you don't.

104
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:07,824
Your father's
a professor.

105
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,770
By rejecting education,
you're rejecting him.

106
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,988
Rejection's the most
powerful weapon there is.

107
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:14,696
Well, maybe on earth.

108
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:19,966
I know this is going to be
miserable. I already hate it there.

109
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:22,570
You know, all those brainy
girls are going to be ugly.

110
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:25,467
Are you saying that

111
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,084
intelligent girls are, by
definition, unattractive?

112
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,694
Yeah, most
of them are.

113
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:36,908
Oh, well, not all of them are.

114
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,623
I mean..
in fact,

115
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:43,593
on the graph of smart girls
and the graph of pretty ones,

116
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,490
you're the sole
intersection,

117
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,327
the single point
of perfection

118
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:50,397
in an infinity
of stupid and homely.

119
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:56,868
Wow, you are gifted.

120
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,291
You're smoking.

121
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:18,729
I guess my body just
responds to the classics.

122
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,556
They're having a dance
contest here next week.

123
00:07:22,557 --> 00:07:23,805
We'd be unbeatable.

124
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:26,093
Especially if we target our key competition

125
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,051
and sever their
achilles tendons.

126
00:07:29,462 --> 00:07:29,998
What?

127
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,773
You're just so great.

128
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:34,067
You're a warrior
in a world full of phonies.

129
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:35,624
You're not afraid
to be who you are.

130
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,035
You're in the military,
and you wear a dress.

131
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,376
I just want to be
all that I can be.

132
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,612
You're the strongest
person I've ever met.

133
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,940
I know.

134
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:54,701
Tommy, we're thrilled
to have you here.

135
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:59,066
Dr. Solomon, as a parent and
educator, kudos to you.

136
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,664
You've raised a very special boy.

137
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:02,740
Yes, I have.

138
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:05,203
And you've had the foresight
to bring him to the right place.

139
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:07,410
Well, I am
the high commander.

140
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,355
Yes. Well,
people of brilliance

141
00:08:13,356 --> 00:08:15,567
can't be expected
to function in a society

142
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:17,451
that's run
by intellectual midgets.

143
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:19,225
That's what
we always say.

144
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:26,890
Yes, yes,
you and Tommy

145
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,857
have found a home here
at the Pickney.

146
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:32,156
It's not just for exceptional
students. It's for exceptional parents.

147
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:35,240
Then you must be
delighted to meet me.

148
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:41,336
Ah, Aramis, thanks
for stopping by.

149
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:44,859
Tommy, consider Aramis
Pickney's welcome wagon.

150
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,078
I'm here to show you
what's wired and what's tired.

151
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:51,224
Somebody shoot me
in the head.

152
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,187
Well, Dr. Menard, now
that the children are away,

153
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,655
let's discuss me
at great length.

154
00:09:14,366 --> 00:09:16,363
Oh, hey!
How was your day?

155
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:19,797
Great. I am the king of Dorkopolis.

156
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,708
My liege.

157
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,419
Tommy.

158
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:35,033
Lookin' good.

159
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:38,979
Dick, feelin'
stupid.

160
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,884
Oh, Dick!

161
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:45,022
You've got money in your shoes. Ooh!

162
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,746
You've got money
in your shoes.

163
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:49,662
I want money shoes.

164
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,581
Harry, no, money shoes
are for Pickney students

165
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,393
and Pickney
parents only.

166
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:57,717
Oh... rats.

167
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:06,222
Tommy, look at this.

168
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:09,810
First in your class.
You're a genius.

169
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,893
You've made me
so proud, son.

170
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:13,305
Is there anything you need?

171
00:10:13,306 --> 00:10:15,733
Money? A ride somewhere?
Cuff links?

172
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:19,142
Can I build you a darkroom?
Anything you want.. name it, it's yours.

173
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,866
I want to go back
to my old school.

174
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,528
Cuff links it is.

175
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't put bumper stickers on my car.

176
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,024
Why do you think
it was me?

177
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,900
"I am the proud
secretary

178
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,466
for the father of the
smartest kid at Pickney".

179
00:11:04,124 --> 00:11:06,538
It may have been me.

180
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:15,953
Dick, did you see this
article about Tommy in the paper?

181
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:19,152
Tommy, my son,
the child genius?

182
00:11:19,153 --> 00:11:20,408
Yes, that Tommy.

183
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:23,360
"Finest to compete in
Pickney's knowledge bowl.

184
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:24,798
Smartest kid
expected to win".

185
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,748
Ah, here it is.

186
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:32,535
"Tommy's father,
Dr. Dick Solomon,

187
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:36,395
physics professor at
nearby Pendleton university,

188
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:40,424
reminds people that genius
is 1% perspiration

189
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,599
and 99%
brilliant father".

190
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,862
You don't think I
overstated my influence, do you?

191
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,408
No.

192
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:54,706
And hip,
and hip,

193
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:56,604
and hip, hip, hip.

194
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,556
Now the arms,
and arms,

195
00:11:58,557 --> 00:12:00,570
and out,
and in.

196
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:03,157
And, Sally, you're
leading again.

197
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,313
I keep forgetting
I'm the girl.

198
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:13,542
I've got to go, 
I'm getting my chest waxed.

199
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,419
Uh... hey, you want to come?
I've got a coupon.

200
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,338
No, I prefer to tweeze.

201
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,319
Ouch!

202
00:12:22,564 --> 00:12:24,473
I'm not usually
attracted to your type,

203
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:26,899
but you are
something special.

204
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,718
Well, what you see
is what you get.

205
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,428
So you're pretty into him, huh?

206
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,827
I think he might be the one.

207
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,190
Why would I want
to wax my chest?

208
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,486
Okay, Tommy,

209
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:55,194
I read that you're competing
in the knowledge bowl.

210
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,562
So what?
- So, we have to review.

211
00:12:57,563 --> 00:12:59,427
What?! Dick,
that's stupid.

212
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:01,691
I'm the information officer.
I know everything.

213
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,869
Maybe, maybe not.

214
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,306
What's that
supposed to mean?

215
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:06,860
How about physics...

216
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,808
in Russian?

217
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:19,929
Wrong. It's...

218
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:21,871
Now you asked the question wrong..

219
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,486
If you want it "crytami",
you should have asked...

220
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,054
Famous Ontologists
in Greek.

221
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:41,810
..Bryant Gumbel.

222
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:46,056
In the form
of a question.

223
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:47,923
..Bryant Gumbel?

224
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,552
Whatever!

225
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,314
Poets of
the Li river delta.

226
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:58,081
Complete Huang Po's classic
couplet of love and betrayal.

227
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:43,320
This isn't even
a so-called life.

228
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:45,329
Oh, well,

229
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,239
as Harry Houdini
once said,

230
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,286
pick a card,
any card.

231
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:51,527
It's my mission
to be a teenager,

232
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:54,084
but right now I hate my
father, I hate my school,

233
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:56,714
and my life seems
hopeless. Some teenager I am.

234
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:57,618
Cut the deck.

235
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,310
If I'm going to do my job,

236
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:00,652
I've got to be
in a real school,

237
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:03,217
one with metal detectors
and pregnant cheerleaders.

238
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,004
Fold the edges of your card ever so slightly.

239
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:10,286
Why am I even putting
myself through all this?

240
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,220
So Dick can
feel proud?

241
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:15,711
Pick another card, add the
value, multiply it by four.

242
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,988
So, I mean, this
whole thing's crazy.

243
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,639
I'm not Dick's son. I'm
the information officer.

244
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,889
I've got to bring this
mission back on course.

245
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,387
Write the number on your
arm so that I cannot see it.

246
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:27,854
There's only one thing left to do..
- Shuffle.

247
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:29,438
Sabotage.

248
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:33,601
All right, we're okay

249
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:36,017
as long as none
of those are clubs.

250
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,899
Pick a card.

251
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,187
Ta-da!

252
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,345
Remember to phrase
your answer

253
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:51,413
in the form
of an answer.

254
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:54,642
Okay, next question:

255
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:57,230
"Tabula Rasa" is a Latin term meaning what?

256
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:01,308
Tommy knows this one.
What's wrong with him?

257
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:05,578
"Tabula Rasa"
means blank slate.

258
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:06,744
That is correct.

259
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,364
He's probably
just nervous.

260
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:10,188
Relax, damn you!
Relax!

261
00:16:14,044 --> 00:16:15,776
Which impressionist
painter

262
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,903
is known for his series
of water lilies?

263
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,808
That's a very easy
one, Dr. Menard.

264
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,467
The answer is...

265
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:25,517
Picasso.

266
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,575
No!

267
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:32,973
The answer is
Claude Monet.

268
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:34,539
Dr. Solomon,

269
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,978
competition is
essential to learning.

270
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,022
Bite me!

271
00:16:39,971 --> 00:16:42,806
What is the outer
envelope, or atmosphere, of gas

272
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:44,429
surrounding
the sun called?

273
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,944
Ooh, mmm...
that's a toughie.

274
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,766
you have 10 seconds.

275
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:01,876
Five seconds.

276
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,922
Three, two, one.

277
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,355
It's called the corona!
You've been there!

278
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:08,878
You know that!

279
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,478
Dick, come on. He's trying. He's your son.

280
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,571
Son?
He's not my son.

281
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,362
I have no son!

282
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,227
Let's go win us
a contest.

283
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,923
Sally, why don't you wear that
little red number you've got?

284
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:34,183
It'll look better with my outfit.

285
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:35,645
But I look so hot.

286
00:17:35,646 --> 00:17:38,383
You must have something flashier
than that. Let me see your closet.

287
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:39,532
Fine. Help me with the zipper.

288
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,562
Don't worry, I'm very good at this.
Now slip out of that dress.

289
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:44,071
Oh!

290
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:52,887
Oh!

291
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,635
Look, I've made
a big, big mistake.

292
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:58,014
What's wrong? What did I do?

293
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:01,566
How can I put this?...I expected... more.

294
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,510
What, I'm not
your kind of woman?

295
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:07,281
Oh, Sally,

296
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,219
you are a woman.

297
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:16,461
What did
you think I was?!

298
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,550
Wow.

299
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:35,386
I have never seen such
reprehensible behavior.

300
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:37,993
I know, I don't blame you
if you have to expel Tommy.

301
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:41,478
Dr. Solomon, we still
consider Tommy Pickney material.

302
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:44,602
It is you who are
banned from the Pickney.

303
00:18:44,838 --> 00:18:47,417
I'm banned?
Well, guess what.

304
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,904
Tommy didn't even want to come
to this robot factory outlet.

305
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:53,836
I made him.
Me, me, me!

306
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:57,018
And now I'm putting him back in a
real school where he can be himself,

307
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,017
the kind of school
where kids aren't judged

308
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:01,628
on how well they test
or how much they know.

309
00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:03,860
Where they aren't
judged at all.

310
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:07,103
Where they have the freedom
to stay faceless and nameless

311
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:08,813
from "K" through 12.

312
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,136
Carrying their diplomas
straight through the golden arches

313
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:15,234
and on into their
waiting mac Jobs!

314
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:18,524
Come on, Tommy.
We're going home.

315
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,901
Thank you, sir.

316
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:29,622
Dick and Tommy were
the best of pals.

317
00:19:29,623 --> 00:19:32,320
But then, one day,
Dick used Tommy

318
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,363
to make himself
look good.

319
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,708
Now, to get back at him,
Tommy used Dick

320
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,733
to make Dick
look very bad.

321
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:44,488
Now, apart they were just
two separate handkerchiefs.

322
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:45,938
Oh, shut up, Harry.
- Shut up, Harry.

323
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,992
But then, magically,
they got back together.

324
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:57,740
Why did you do
that to me?

325
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:58,943
I don't know.

326
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,639
I guess 'cause you made
my life suck.

327
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,002
Why didn't you just tell me that?

328
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,657
I tried to. You were
impenetrably happy.

329
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:09,194
What is it about the
father-son relationship that

330
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,574
makes communication
so difficult?

331
00:20:12,227 --> 00:20:13,928
Is it the father
using his son

332
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,629
to make good on
his unfulfilled dreams?

333
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,803
Or is it the son

334
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:21,155
defining himself by rejecting his father?

335
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:23,637
It's neither. It's both.

336
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:25,505
It's men.

337
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:29,442
And how did you acquire
this new expertise?

338
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:31,430
Oh, yeah. What happened with Glenn?

339
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,121
Well, remember
when we said that

340
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:35,406
two sexes must
be so limiting?

341
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,163
I think Glenn
found a loophole.

342
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:49,407
You're
a precocious kid,

343
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:50,909
but this is
a game of wisdom.

344
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,021
All right, old man,

345
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:55,176
let's settle this
once and for all.

346
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,980
Checkmate!
- Oh, damn it!

347
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:07,907
Oh!

348
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,287
Oh, wait. Look.

349
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:12,346
My rook can take your..

350
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:14,076
oh.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
