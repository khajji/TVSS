1
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:10,712
High Commander's log.

2
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:16,601
Make that "former"
high commander.

3
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:20,079
I am writing this so that future generations

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,496
will know
the truth.

5
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,004
It all began
two days ago.

6
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:26,407
Okay, where's
my shoes?

7
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:29,826
Oh well I think I saw one of them
right over there.

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,830
Harry received a message
from the big giant head

9
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:36,638
saying that I was
to be replaced

10
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,255
the very next night.

11
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:40,619
Cruelly, that was
the very night

12
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:42,709
that Mary
finally said,

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,875
"I care about you".

14
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,915
Mary, you understand
my every thought.

15
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:51,538
I understand. You've had
the milk. Why buy the cow?

16
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,209
No, I want you.
I want the cow.

17
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,031
But I was summoned
into the basement

18
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,665
to meet
my replacement.

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,935
And here I am
in this encasement.

20
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:07,278
No.

21
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:12,159
I must make
an erasement.

22
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:20,478
Ignoring all
military protocol,

23
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:24,034
he confined me
in this invisible box.

24
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:31,289
Oh, my god!

25
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,909
He's turned me
into a mime!

26
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:46,168
What's going on in that pan?
- I'm cooking sausages.

27
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:48,098
Those are links.
I like patties.

28
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,823
I'm sorry, sir.
- Sorry won't do.

29
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:53,610
Press that meat, soldier.
I like my links flat.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,563
Who ate
my Strawberries?

31
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:05,163
What Strawberries?
- I had a pint of Strawberries in here

32
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:06,829
with a note
clearly marked mine.

33
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,501
I didn't take 'em.
- It wasn't me.

34
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,788
Man, them strawberries
was good eating.

35
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:24,676
It is becoming
all too clear

36
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,295
how my predecessor
chose to run things.

37
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:31,390
You will find things to be quite
different under my command, Tommy.

38
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,968
Uh, no, I'm Harry.

39
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:39,287
No, I've decided that from now
on you will be known as Tommy.

40
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,477
What about me?

41
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,902
You will be known
as Tommy, too.

42
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:47,636
But wait. Tommy and then the
number 2, or Tommy as well?

43
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,199
You will all be
known as Tommy!

44
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,816
And that's not all. Lieutenant?
- Sir!

45
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,359
From now on, you will wear skirts.
- Skirts?

46
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,766
Something long that
looks pretty when you twirl.

47
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:01,747
And stay away from pleats.
You know, nothing too fussy.

48
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:03,415
Okay.

49
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,371
Furthermore, when coupons arrive in the mail,

50
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,441
I get first dibs.

51
00:03:09,785 --> 00:03:12,548
I may open a box of
cereal to get the prize,

52
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:14,456
but I do not then
have to eat...

53
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,368
the cereal.

54
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:21,940
The bathroom has been stocked
with two kinds of toilet paper.

55
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,703
I, and I alone,

56
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:26,054
get the quilted kind.

57
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:31,030
You will go to a barber.
I will go to a stylist.

58
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,234
But wait, wait, wait. We have
so much more hair than you do.

59
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,131
You will never
mention that again!

60
00:03:37,715 --> 00:03:39,546
Have I made myself
clear, Tommy?

61
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:42,642
yes.

62
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,257
When someone asks you
what time it is,

63
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:18,404
you do not say
"it's time to die".

64
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,318
And, uh, where do I go for work?
- The university.

65
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,035
Ah. So I run
the university.

66
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:32,196
Not so much run.
You teach a physics class.

67
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,549
I'm a teacher?!

68
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,604
Were all the janitors' jobs taken?

69
00:04:37,413 --> 00:04:40,347
Six months on this planet, and
that's all my predecessor achieved.

70
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,680
How pitiful.

71
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,007
He was spending a lot of time
on that whole Dr. Albright thing.

72
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:47,595
Ah, yes, Mary.

73
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,962
I've got plans
for her.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
There's my girl.

75
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,619
I feel so pretty.

76
00:05:03,243 --> 00:05:05,799
Now pay attention. I
have an assignment for you.

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,071
Lieutenant,
take this down.

78
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:10,348
I will require
the following items:

79
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:14,454
500 rolls of silver
reflective duct tape,

80
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:17,485
144 ceramic
custard cups,

81
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,385
one subatomic spectrometer,
and one turkey baster.

82
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,711
You see, I am building
the greatest incubator

83
00:05:24,712 --> 00:05:28,329
these puny humans
have ever known.

84
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,366
And when it
is completed,

85
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:34,962
I will spawn
my own private army of...

86
00:05:37,976 --> 00:05:39,231
of...

87
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,888
fuzzy easter chicks.

88
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,643
What are you looking at? You
have your assignment. Hop to it!

89
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,601
Can you give us a ride?
- No. The car is mine, and mine alone.

90
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,426
You're humans.
Use your feet.

91
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,418
You know, I was this
close to kicking his butt.

92
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:01,402
Yeah.

93
00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:05,509
Yeah, I was gonna
kick his butt,

94
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,859
but, you know,
I figured you'd do it.

95
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:11,310
Well, when he comes back, I'm kicking his butt.
- All right.

96
00:06:11,311 --> 00:06:13,489
What are you guys complaining about, huh?

97
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,369
I deserved his job. I
should be high commander.

98
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,608
I have the seniority.
I know the territory.

99
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,115
So why wasn't
I promoted, huh?

100
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:21,116
Because I'm the woman.

101
00:06:21,117 --> 00:06:23,513
Once again, the woman
was passed over.

102
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:26,772
You want me to kick his butt?
- Harry,

103
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,288
there's not going to be any
butt-Kicking. He is high commander.

104
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,129
Like it or not,
we're sworn to follow him.

105
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,839
Anyway, maybe this mission
could use a little discipline.

106
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,779
Yeah, nice skirt,
Tommy.

107
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,236
All right, how do
you work a car?

108
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,822
See, it's the difference
between good fabric

109
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:51,215
and cheap fabric.

110
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:55,734
Then again,
my third husband liked 'em cheap.

111
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:59,384
Yes, yes, that's
fascinating.

112
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:00,700
Say, Dr. Solomon,

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,291
could you come over and give me a hand
with my lint trap?

114
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,407
No, I...

115
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,611
I'd love to really, but
I'm afraid it's impossible.

116
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:13,107
You see, I have
a bad back.

117
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:15,562
I think I know why
you're down here.

118
00:07:15,563 --> 00:07:19,182
Same reason my second
husband used to come down here.

119
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:22,208
Bottle of scotch hidden
in the insulation.

120
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:26,520
Of course,
I always knew.

121
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,693
The pink fuzz in his beer gave him away.

122
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:39,415
Mrs. Dubcek.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:44,130
Yes?

124
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:47,306
I need you
to do me a favour.

125
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:50,451
Could you go upstairs
and tell Sally

126
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:51,983
that I'm down here?

127
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:55,223
But if you see me
standing there..

128
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,449
and this is
very important..

129
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,098
don't say
anything to me.

130
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,292
Just take Sally aside
and whisper it to her.

131
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:05,715
Whatever you do,
make sure

132
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:08,408
"I" don't hear "you".

133
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:13,009
Come again?

134
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:17,723
Never mind.

135
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:39,796
Stop it.

136
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:43,308
Okay, here's the duct
tape. How much do we need?

137
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,092
500 rolls,
silver reflective.

138
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,897
Okay, well, how
about eight rolls

139
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,585
of sort of grayish?
- That's fine.

140
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:53,743
What do you think Dick's
doing now? You know, old Dick.

141
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:56,373
You don't think they reassigned
him to the brown planet, do you?

142
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:57,978
Ooh...

143
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:03,319
Dennis!
- Tom, Sally, Harry.

144
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,213
What are you guys
doing here?

145
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:07,029
We just had to pick up some duct tape here.

146
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,496
No, I mean, on Earth.

147
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,632
Oh. Well, we're
doing that thing where we're

148
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,570
supposed to be a human family.

149
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:13,936
I dodged
that assignment.

150
00:09:13,937 --> 00:09:17,178
We've seen you on TV.
18 rebounds a game.

151
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,930
Don't people
suspect anything?

152
00:09:20,714 --> 00:09:22,754
Look at you..
the hair, the tattoos.

153
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:24,428
Like you could be human.

154
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,664
They think I'm weird
or something.

155
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,278
I hear that.

156
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,889
Listen, Dennis,
I gotta ask you.

157
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,729
Madonna..
where is she from?

158
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,965
Detroit.
- Detroit, earth?

159
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,260
Nooooo!

160
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,153
Yeah, she's here.
She's here.

161
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,946
What about Michael Jordan?
- Robot.

162
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,613
I told you so. See?
- All right, all right.

163
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,925
Well, guys,
I gotta be going.

164
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,586
Proceed boldly
and with stealth.

165
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:53,619
Jam on.

166
00:10:06,644 --> 00:10:08,987
I like what you've done with your desk.

167
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:11,625
Would you like me
to do it

168
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,045
to yours?

169
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:17,907
No.
I like it messy.

170
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,805
Bad girl.

171
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,830
So, Dr. Albright,
refresh my memory.

172
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,177
Have you and I...

173
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,000
had sex yet?

174
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,310
Why, yes,
I believe we have.

175
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:31,788
How was it?

176
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,664
It was... nice.

177
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:38,640
Next time, it won't be... so nice.

178
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:47,668
What did you do to him?
- I don't know, Nina.

179
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:50,290
Nina, where's that
comprehensive course syllabus?

180
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,342
You only asked me to do it 10
minutes ago. I'm not a machine.

181
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:55,027
Oh, pity.

182
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:58,702
What are you doing? Trying
to show off in front of her?

183
00:10:58,703 --> 00:11:00,232
I don't have
to show off.

184
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,115
I just have to...

185
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,536
show up.

186
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:08,258
Isn't he naughty?

187
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:15,652
Old Dick would have never
ordered us out onto the roof.

188
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:18,341
Except for that one time he
ordered us out onto the roof.

189
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,148
Oh, well,
that time, sure.

190
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,558
A small fire has broken
out in the living room.

191
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,992
There's a fire
extinguisher next to the stove.

192
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:31,488
The stove is
in the kitchen.

193
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:33,898
Obviously.

194
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:36,903
This guy's
such a hard-ass.

195
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,554
May I remind you that that
hard-Ass is our high commander?

196
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,122
You're the weapons
expert.

197
00:11:41,123 --> 00:11:42,361
Isn't there some way
to get rid of him?

198
00:11:43,466 --> 00:11:44,856
No, we're stuck
with him.

199
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:48,079
We can't just frag him with a
grenade while he's taking a shower.

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,424
But listen, showers
accidentally explode all the time.

201
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:52,838
I didn't hear that, soldier.

202
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,773
He said that showers..
Shut up!

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,972
Thank you very much. The fire
extinguisher is now on fire.

204
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,546
I miss the old Dick.
- I miss the old Dick, too.

205
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:05,411
Well, missing him's not going
to bring him back.

206
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:08,747
I will admit that
the old Dick's methods were

207
00:12:08,782 --> 00:12:10,965
a little different
than this Dick, but..

208
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,856
it's not up to us to
question his directives, okay,

209
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:15,559
He is in command,
and that's that.

210
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:18,452
He's...

211
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:22,118
he's just mean, and there's
nothing we can do about it.

212
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,446
Whoa, whoa.

213
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,613
You're getting all wet. Stop.
- Stop leaking.

214
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:26,947
No, you're right.

215
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:29,183
As Dick always
used to say,

216
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,565
never let 'em
see you leak.

217
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:36,429
The fire's out of control.
I'll be back in two hours.

218
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,157
I miss Dick.

219
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:57,148
What do you want?

220
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:03,149
What do you want?!

221
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:08,350
Stop it.

222
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:12,518
Stop it!

223
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,459
Hello.

224
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,926
Dr. Albright, dinner, my place, tonight.

225
00:13:24,316 --> 00:13:27,138
Is that an invitation?
- No.

226
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,881
Well...

227
00:13:29,122 --> 00:13:32,390
the cat thinks he has the mouse by the tail.

228
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:35,671
Yes, but sometimes
the cat likes to...

229
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,035
play with his prey

230
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,804
before he goes in
for the kill.

231
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:43,832
Well, the cat
may have claws,

232
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,142
but the mouse
is quick.

233
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:47,471
True,

234
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,568
but the mouse
will always fall

235
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,387
for the cheese.

236
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,962
The cat likes
a little cheese, too.

237
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:58,064
And milk,
and dead birds...

238
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:00,669
but he always

239
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,502
licks himself clean.

240
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:10,393
You were asking
me to dinner?

241
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,778
Uh, yes.
- I'll be there.

242
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,545
No, I'm the cat!

243
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:25,538
Here's the syllabus
that you wanted.

244
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,475
Why, this is
beautiful, Nina.

245
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:29,455
So...

246
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,987
exquisitely
beautiful.

247
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:34,393
Well, we got a new
toner cartridge..

248
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:35,692
don't be so modest.

249
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,542
I'll see you later.

250
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:48,040
All right.

251
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,584
Excuse me. There must be some mistake.

252
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:10,633
This classroom is mine.
Find your own.

253
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,819
Dr. Solomon, we were all
just waiting for our grades.

254
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:16,737
Oh, grades.

255
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,217
I didn't realize
teaching involved evaluation.

256
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,234
Very well.

257
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:26,203
You need your hair
straightened.

258
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:28,236
You're too short
for your face.

259
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,526
You have a museum-quality torso.

260
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:34,264
You... are harmless.

261
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:37,011
You will be spared and used to
carry and used to carry heavy things.

262
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:41,470
You..
- Dr. Solomon, we meant our letter grades.

263
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,707
I've decided
to give you all...

264
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:49,350
"d"s.
- We got "d"s.

265
00:15:57,613 --> 00:16:00,513
Isn't this beautiful?
I mean, look at her,

266
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,700
reunited with
the birth mother

267
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,279
she never knew.

268
00:16:05,626 --> 00:16:07,943
I love "Ricki lake".

269
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:11,818
The other day, this woman finally
came face-to-face with her stalker.

270
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:14,102
And he was so sweet,
she agreed to go

271
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,922
out on a date
with him.

272
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:18,706
Well, maybe if
I went on that show,

273
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:20,754
they would reunite
me with Dick..

274
00:16:22,387 --> 00:16:23,536
Johnson.

275
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,999
Dick Johnson.
Little Dickie Johnson.

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,453
Stop looking at me.

277
00:16:30,835 --> 00:16:33,527
And who is this
exquisite creature?

278
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:37,345
Uh... maybe you'd better
go downstairs, Mrs. Dubcek.

279
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:38,455
Mrs. Dubcek.

280
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,964
I will see you later,
Mrs. Dubcek.

281
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,041
Turn that
rubbish off.

282
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:59,811
From now on,
we watch only golf.

283
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,396
But I was going to watch
"the jerry springer show".

284
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:09,245
Transmission incoming
from the big giant head.

285
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:11,541
Warning, warning!

286
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,652
Danger, danger!

287
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:15,359
Due to
a clerical error,

288
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,672
your high commander may
have been accidentally replaced

289
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:21,091
by a disgruntled
former employee

290
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:22,092
of the big giant head.

291
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,477
He should be
considered armed

292
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:26,624
and extremely
unpleasant.

293
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,865
And remember, when you're
thinking of giant heads,

294
00:17:29,866 --> 00:17:32,428
think of the big
giant head.

295
00:17:33,941 --> 00:17:36,093
Resume normal
functions in three,

296
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,774
two, one.

297
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,591
All right,
what was it?

298
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,275
Wrong number.
- Oh.

299
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:01,062
Now shut up and get me that turkey baster!

300
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,136
Why don't you make me
get the turkey baster?

301
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:26,729
Hi, old Dick.

302
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:36,203
Dick!
- Harry!

303
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:47,853
Invisible box?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,030
Yes?
- What is the meaning of this?

305
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:00,062
I distinctly asked for
reflective duct tape.

306
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:02,627
Oh, about that, see,
that was all they had.

307
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:05,646
Typical. Did you get
the custard cups?

308
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:09,102
We didn't
so much get them, as failed..

309
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,499
to get them, sir.

310
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:14,012
Did you try jenny's
restaurant supply on fifth street?

311
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:16,996
They're not open to the general public.
- Oh.

312
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:20,195
That's right. Can't let
just anyone make custard.

313
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,468
No, of course not,
not on this planet, No,

314
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,462
no, that would
be too simple.

315
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:28,214
No, we have retail,
and we have wholesale.

316
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:31,093
We have pink packets
and blue packets,

317
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:32,770
republicans
and democrats,

318
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,089
and the party that
crazy midget started.

319
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,276
So many choices.

320
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,760
How they all love
their free will.

321
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:48,311
Everybody has
a different point of view.

322
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,464
There should be only
one point of view..

323
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:53,839
my point of view.

324
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:59,043
Well, I have a message
for these humans.

325
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:02,030
The buffet is
about to close..

326
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:03,418
forever.

327
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,394
What is it, boy?

328
00:20:22,975 --> 00:20:24,404
I think he wants us
to follow him.

329
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:30,702
Dick!
- Dick!

330
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:34,274
Sally! No, look out!
There's an invisible..

331
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,084
oh, you guys,

332
00:20:40,085 --> 00:20:42,106
there's
an invisible box.
