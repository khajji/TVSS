1
00:00:03,621 --> 00:00:07,330
44 across, "men are from
Mars, women are from..."

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,864
let's see, five letters
starting with V.

3
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:14,345
Ah! "Vegas".

4
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:19,449
Dick! Dick, look who
I met outside.. Michel.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,447
Michelle?
You're a girl?

6
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,907
No, he's from France.
- Hello.

7
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,359
Michel asked me to take
a picture of him

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,602
standing next to that statue
of general Rufus Putnam.

9
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:29,785
Oh did you make him put his
finger in the general's nose?

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:31,734
Oui.

11
00:00:31,835 --> 00:00:34,074
"Oui."
That means yes.

12
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:43,521
Mary! Nina!

13
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:46,503
This is Sally's delightful
new French guy, Michel.

14
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:50,024
Ah. Mary, Nina.
Your names could be French.

15
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:55,830
I took three years
of French in high school

16
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,158
and I can't remember
a thing.

17
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,469
No no no,
I am in America,

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,268
I am the one
who needs to learn, hmm?

19
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,758
Okay.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,173
Oh! Michel, how do you say "
nice to meet you" in French?

21
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:12,037
Enchanté.
- Enchanté.

22
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,981
Okay, how do you say, five,
five, five, o, one, eight, nine?

23
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,905
Cinq, cinq, cinq,
zéro, Un, huit, neuf.

24
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:20,288
Okay, you might want
to write that down.

25
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,286
Nina!

26
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,758
Michel,
we should be going.

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,142
Yeah, it was fantastic
to meet you all.

28
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:28,182
Oh, yeah. Oh.

29
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:29,827
He is so charming.

30
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:31,182
Ow! Oui!

31
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,468
On my foot I have a big,

32
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,478
painful, oozing blister.

33
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,907
A blister!

34
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,915
So Michel, what time is
it in France right now?

35
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,275
Uh... 4:00 A.M.

36
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,346
Wow, it's so early.

37
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:29,268
You have been
so wonderful to me, Sally.

38
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,991
I never meet
a woman like you.

39
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:32,640
And you never will again.

40
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:37,285
You are not only
beautiful, you are kind..

41
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:41,206
but more beautiful right?
- Yes.

42
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:45,019
So, um, how long are you
planning on staying in Rutherford?

43
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:49,575
Sally, I.. I love this place,
I would like to stay very much,

44
00:02:49,576 --> 00:02:54,227
but your government
is... not so nice.

45
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,818
Except for Abraham Lincoln.

46
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,623
Yes, nice man,
very very nice man.

47
00:02:58,624 --> 00:02:59,575
But...

48
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:03,212
your country is not safe
for someone like me.

49
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:07,135
Uh... there is only one
safe way for me to stay here,

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,496
kind girl.
I need to get married.

51
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,639
Sally?

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,162
Would you marry me?

53
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:17,684
Yeow! Damn!

54
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:20,646
Hot diggity dog!,
Oh man, oh man, oh mama!

55
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:26,301
It's just that... nobody
has ever asked me that before.

56
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,659
Oui.
- Oh!

57
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:36,949
You're what?!
- I'm getting married.

58
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,248
Why are you doing this?

59
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:40,408
Two reasons, I'm a woman,
and he asked me.

60
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,138
Lieutenant, aren't you
forgetting something?

61
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,418
You're right, the wedding announcement!

62
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,354
No no! The mission.

63
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:48,266
Dick, this is my mission. It's
what women are supposed to do,

64
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:51,120
get married, have babies, hire
total strangers to raise them,

65
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:52,498
and then wonder
where they went wrong.

66
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,899
Very true.

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,589
It happened so quickly. How
did he know it was time to ask?

68
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,191
He's a man,
men know these things.

69
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:02,633
But I'm a man.
Am I missing something?

70
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:05,871
You? Never.
- No flies on you.

71
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:08,931
Dick, trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

72
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:10,574
Besides, I've dated
more than any of you.

73
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:12,260
But by no stretch
of the imagination

74
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,055
have you been
the most promiscuous.

75
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,988
Trust me, high commander,
Michel's a great guy.

76
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:21,292
Plus he's loaded, look.

77
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:24,381
He's giving me $5,000, he
wants to marry me so badly.

78
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:26,631
2,000 upfront and the rest
when the deal's done.

79
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:29,296
As a gift?
- No no, Tommy...

80
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:31,335
this is what's known
as a dowry.

81
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,465
It's an old-world marriage
custom and Michel is from there.

82
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,294
Maybe if we hold out,
he'll throw in a goat or two.

83
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,780
And the best part of everything is
I get to have a wedding, you know?

84
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:46,251
Big white dress,
long veil, crappy band.

85
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,561
Ah. It will be a day
I'll always remember.

86
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,426
Okay, there's work
to be done!

87
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:53,211
Harry, I want you to find me
something old, something new,

88
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:54,657
something borrowed,
something blue, go!

89
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:56,077
Tommy! Get me a deal on flowers!
- Flowers!

90
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,478
Dick! Your job is to sit back,

91
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,773
and just get overwhelmed
by the whole process, okay?

92
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:09,597
Hi, can I help you
with something?

93
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:11,869
Yeah, my sister is getting
married, she needs flowers.

94
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,700
Ah, anything in mind?
- Cheap.

95
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,562
Ah. You know what?

96
00:05:15,563 --> 00:05:18,838
I have a sample bouquet from
a wedding we did yesterday.

97
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,910
Something like this maybe?

98
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,204
Yeah yeah, that's nice,

99
00:05:24,205 --> 00:05:27,451
but it doesn't really uh...
pop, you know what I'm saying?

100
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,841
I was thinking something
maybe a little more like this,

101
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:33,234
and maybe a spray of these..
oh, these are great.

102
00:05:33,235 --> 00:05:34,730
Could you hand me
the ribbon back there?

103
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,584
No, the ivory.

104
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,133
Let's see.

105
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:41,272
Now this rocks.

106
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:44,588
Young man, you have
quite a knack for this.

107
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:47,521
Flowers eh? Cool.

108
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,815
She's getting married.
- Oh, that's so romantic!

109
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:56,759
She just met him!
- I wish I'd have met him first.

110
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,805
Dick, do you have
a problem with this?

111
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:02,545
No, why should I? Sally's
fulfilling her purpose as a woman.

112
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,733
Oh, please, Dick,
not every woman

113
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:08,489
feels her life is incomplete
until she got a man.

114
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,088
Well, hasn't your life
been better since you met me?

115
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:16,370
Yes. But we've taken the time
to learn about each other.

116
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,541
And we've learned a lot

117
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,546
We've been together over a
year, we're not getting married.

118
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,449
Certainly not.
- We've never even discussed it.

119
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,260
You never brought it up.
- Neither have you.

120
00:06:23,261 --> 00:06:24,792
We're talking
about it now.

121
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:33,506
I have a phone call to make.
- Me too.

122
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:44,033
Whoa, beautiful flowers.
- Oh, thanks, I arranged them.

123
00:06:44,034 --> 00:06:44,981
Really?
You did a great job.

124
00:06:44,982 --> 00:06:48,050
Ah-ah, don't touch. You don't
want to over-bunch the vase.

125
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:52,668
Each flower has to be
allowed to have its own moment.

126
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,925
Oh, yeah, moment.

127
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:58,076
Erm, my uncle wally owns
a flower shop in Florida.

128
00:06:58,077 --> 00:07:00,808
His roommate Jasper,
helps him run it.

129
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,574
So, you think he'll
pass it down to his kids?

130
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:08,794
No, I think the legacy stopped
right there in south beach. Sorry.

131
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,976
See, this is the third set of
little people you've sent me,

132
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:17,589
and once again they bear no
resemblance to me or my future husband.

133
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,788
Get it right!

134
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:23,268
Sally! I got it,
everything you asked for.

135
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,672
Oh, what a relief!

136
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:30,624
Something old..

137
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,122
a radial, courtesy
of the alley.

138
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:37,554
Something new..

139
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:40,683
a tub of Vaseline with
an unbroken seal. Sweet!

140
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:44,520
Something borrowed..

141
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,922
a cup of sea salt
from Miss Dubcek.

142
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:51,738
And finally, the piece
de resistenance..

143
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:55,183
something blue..
a lifesaver!

144
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:58,604
Minty.

145
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:00,749
That's perfect, Harry.

146
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:11,374
Ooh! Those are beautiful!

147
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,830
Oh thanks, I was tempted
to use willow branches,

148
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:15,704
but they seemed
a bit stark.

149
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:20,174
You're very artistic.
- Yeah, I'm sure that's the word.

150
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,704
Hello, Sally.
- Hey.

151
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,949
I heard the news.
Wow!

152
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,660
It happened so suddenly.

153
00:08:28,661 --> 00:08:31,121
Cut to the chase, Mary.
Sally, she thinks you're crazy.

154
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:33,218
What?!
- No, I didn't say that.

155
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,296
It's.. it's just
that I'm concerned.

156
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:38,505
I want the best for you and
this all happened so quickly.

157
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:40,673
Mary, you are
so transparent.

158
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,225
You're jealous.
- What?

159
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:46,164
You are.
- You are! - Yeah.

160
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:50,115
You wanna get married too.
- You do!

161
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:53,946
Well sure, when I'm ready.
- And you don't think I'm ready?

162
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,031
Well, I just think
you should wait.

163
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:59,191
Until when? I'm middle-aged and I
have to walk out of the bedroom

164
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:01,525
backwards so my husband
won't see my ripply butt?

165
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,636
Oh, stop.

166
00:09:05,184 --> 00:09:07,934
Mary!
That's what you do!

167
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:17,301
Okay. I guess this was
none of my business.

168
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:18,757
You're doing it again!

169
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:22,271
I'm sorry I even tried.

170
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:24,045
No wait, Dr. Albright.
Wait wait wait!

171
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:27,814
Look. Look, just.. here.
Sit down here, okay?

172
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:29,707
It's just that I got so...

173
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,336
damn arrogant, you know,
that I got proposed to.

174
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:36,570
I mean, it's like I finally got
something I can lord over other women.

175
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,536
And that's not right, no.
- No.

176
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,946
I want you to be happy
for me, Mary.

177
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,386
I'd like you to be
in my wedding.

178
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:48,158
Bridesmaid?

179
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:50,933
Better. I want you to
be my maid of honour.

180
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:54,186
My bitter old maid
of honour.

181
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:02,532
Gentlemen, how do you know
when it's time to get married?

182
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:04,888
Right when that little
stick thing turns blue.

183
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:10,818
I mean, do you get married when the
relationship stops to be about sex

184
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,836
and starts becoming deeper?

185
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,592
Deeper than sex?

186
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,782
I just don't know
if I'm ready.

187
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:23,883
Dr. Albright is tightening the old
matrimonial chokehold, isn't she?

188
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,718
Oh I wish. Unfortunately
she wants to get married.

189
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:30,146
I guess I'm just
gonna have to ask her.

190
00:10:30,147 --> 00:10:34,143
Well why don't you buy yourself some
time by giving her an engagement ring?

191
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:37,684
A ring?
- Sure, something big and showy, you know.

192
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:41,525
It proves how much you care for her and
that way you can drag it out for years.

193
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,048
So I just tag her,
put her on the shelf,

194
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:48,120
so I can pick her up whenever I
want like.. like human layaway?

195
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:52,022
I like it.

196
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:58,457
I like that one.
- Hmm, it's very you.

197
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:02,331
Sally, I've been
an insensitive clod.

198
00:11:02,332 --> 00:11:04,289
Yeah, I'm used
to that by now.

199
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,264
No no. Not to you,
to Dr. Albright,

200
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:10,131
which is why I've decided
to ask her to marry me.

201
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:11,259
Good for you.

202
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,649
Thank you.
And as high commander,

203
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,852
my wedding is
more important than yours.

204
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,963
So I get to go first.

205
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,695
What?!

206
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:22,329
You horrible,
horrible man!

207
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,246
Why do you wanna rain
on my parade?

208
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,075
The one chance
I get to feel special,

209
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,747
and you want
to take it away from me!

210
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:31,116
I want to be the bride!
Me, bride!

211
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:41,269
I.. I'm sorry, forgive me.
I'm being selfish.

212
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,620
You're right.
You should go first.

213
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,790
You've already ordered your cake and...

214
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,445
I haven't even popped
the question yet.

215
00:11:48,446 --> 00:11:51,533
Now stop crying.
There's my girl...

216
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:56,445
and what a big girl
you are.

217
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,201
And soon I'll have to
give you away to another man.

218
00:12:01,402 --> 00:12:03,049
And what a pretty bride
you'll make.

219
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,798
"Where are you going,
my little one, little one"

220
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,919
"Where are you going,
my baby, my own"

221
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,942
"Turn around
and you're tiny"

222
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:21,972
"turn around
and you're grown"

223
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:25,043
"turn around
and you're a young wife"

224
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,873
"with babes of your own".

225
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,124
To you, Dr. Solomon.
- To me.

226
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:42,160
You are a great American.

227
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,209
In France, it would be
very hard to find a man,

228
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,458
that would accept money
for his sister.

229
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,848
And it was
impossible in Wisconsin.

230
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,755
Hmm, yeah.

231
00:12:50,756 --> 00:12:53,337
She's all yours now. I bet you
can't wait to sleep with her.

232
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,083
Pardon?
- You know, the big night, la nuit grande.

233
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,874
No no no,
professor Solomon,

234
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,106
this is a legal arrangement
only, I will not touch your sister.

235
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:06,184
No, You have to!
She's dying to!

236
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:09,160
Are you positive?

237
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:13,109
Of course, it's like those
sneakers ads say, "just do her".

238
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:20,699
You are a very
strange family...

239
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,893
but strange in a way...

240
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,192
I can accept, huh?

241
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:29,176
Salut!
- A votre santé. - D'accord.

242
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:41,789
Oh, don't push.
I'll buzz you in.

243
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,611
Wait to push.

244
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:49,603
I'll buzz, then you push.

245
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:56,546
Listen to me!

246
00:13:57,964 --> 00:14:00,659
Wait for the buzzer
to stop!

247
00:14:09,975 --> 00:14:12,147
And they wonder why old
downtown Rutherford is dead.

248
00:14:12,148 --> 00:14:14,109
You can't get
into the stores!

249
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,272
Good morning, sir,
lovely day.

250
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:25,043
Yes. Is there
something I can show you?

251
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,665
Engagement rings
for women.

252
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,392
Oh, excellent, excellent.

253
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:31,529
Diamond engagements
are right over here.

254
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,864
Uh... we'll start small.

255
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:36,604
Ooh, this one looks nice.
How much is it?

256
00:14:36,705 --> 00:14:39,893
Ah-ha, that one is...
three thousand dollars.

257
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:42,898
For a diamond!

258
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,948
Where I come from, we use
the big ones for doorstops!

259
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,736
Sir, you mustn't think
in terms of price.

260
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,462
The ring is a symbol.
- A symbol?

261
00:14:51,463 --> 00:14:54,730
Yes, the circular shape
represents never-ending love.

262
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,723
Circular shape...

263
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,352
Great!
I'll give her my watch.

264
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:15,488
Knickers?
- They're crushed velvet.

265
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:19,282
Nice, do you... like them?

266
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,013
I made them.

267
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,218
Tommy...kiss me.

268
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:30,613
Err... do you wanna
go out to the rambler?

269
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:33,387
There's a few minutes
before this whole procession.

270
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,458
No, I was just
checking something.

271
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,302
Hey! Hey, don't start
the mower

272
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,420
unless you're ready
to cut the grass!

273
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,674
Oh, Sally...

274
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,411
you look so beautiful,

275
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:54,025
so exquisite, so..

276
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:55,701
bold!

277
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:59,839
You, my lucky lady, are
in charge of that train.

278
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:03,824
Hey, Harry.

279
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:09,121
Um... who's that?

280
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,953
Sally, meet
blind Joe Slocum.

281
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,998
He's old, I borrowed him
from the tip top club,

282
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,243
and he plays the blues.

283
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,292
Okay, so what do you have that's new?
- He's my new friend.

284
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,861
So are you of the
bride's family or the groom's?

285
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:28,940
Neither, I am with the
immigration and naturalisation service.

286
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:32,511
I have reason to believe that there is
an illegal alien in the wedding party.

287
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,046
Really?

288
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:41,320
Mary.

289
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,592
There's something I've got to ask
you before this whole thing starts.

290
00:16:44,593 --> 00:16:47,322
Oh Dick, not again.
You're on Sally's left,

291
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,772
and remember, no skipping
down the aisle.

292
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:54,749
Can I borrow
a toothbrush?

293
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,571
There is the most adorable man
out there with the government.

294
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:59,063
He's looking for aliens.

295
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,051
Thank you, Miss Dubcek.

296
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:07,228
Now go out there and hypnotise
him with your feminine wiles.

297
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,419
Never been a problem. Oh!
- Okay.

298
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,311
Family meeting!
Family meeting.

299
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:16,490
Where?
- Are you sure?

300
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:17,476
I've got to see Michel.

301
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:24,913
No, wait wait wait!
wait wait wait...

302
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,420
What's going on?
- They're white.

303
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,103
I'm...I'm so sorry, Michel,

304
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,494
but I can't marry you.
- What?!

305
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:38,542
I'm sorry.

306
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:41,909
But I need to get married,
they'll send me back. I'm an alien.

307
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,319
What?

308
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,559
I'm an alien.

309
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,783
Wow, okay.

310
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:52,136
See this is never gonna work
because... I'm an alien too.

311
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,689
What? Then.. then what is the point of this?
- I don't know.

312
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,717
Then give me back
my money.

313
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,214
Well I can't,
I spent it on the dress.

314
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,732
What? But..

315
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,309
Pull yourself
together, man.

316
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,556
Listen, somebody's here looking for you.
Now come with us and we'll protect you.

317
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:10,558
No! No no no no, I am sick
of you and your crazy people.

318
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,666
Crazy people!
You're crazy!

319
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,267
Hey, you!

320
00:18:16,017 --> 00:18:16,870
Come on, Albright.

321
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,053
Oh, Mary, uh..
we're leaving town.

322
00:18:53,054 --> 00:18:56,238
No particular reason,
you know, call of the road.

323
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:58,236
Oh, Dick, you shouldn't
be embarrassed.

324
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,137
Michel's the one
who got arrested.

325
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,381
They got Michel!
Oh!

326
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,201
The other guy from
immigration. It was an ugly fight.

327
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:08,448
The French tend to kick
a lot when frightened.

328
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,705
Immigration?

329
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:15,091
Yeah, they said they'll be sending
him back to France in the morning.

330
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:19,340
Of course, he's from
another country!

331
00:19:19,341 --> 00:19:21,467
That's why he's an Alien.

332
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:23,563
Alien from France.
- Oh.

333
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:26,149
Not a quivering purple tube
from a distant galaxy,

334
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,985
sent to study humankind.

335
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,001
What? I said "not".

336
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:34,053
I'm sorry, Sally.

337
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:36,954
It's all right, you know. I
got the cake, I got the dress,

338
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,846
I got almost all the way
to the altar.

339
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:42,013
But you didn't get married.
- I know, but what the heck.

340
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,369
Hey, as long as we're all
dressed up, who wants to go bowling?

341
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:46,740
Tommy, Harry,
grab my train.

342
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,766
She made
a beautiful bride.

343
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,179
She'll make
a beautiful bowler.

344
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,097
Mary.

345
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:02,327
There's something I've been
wanting to ask you for several days now.

346
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:06,139
I thought about it long and hard
and I know it's the right thing to do.

347
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,903
Mary...

348
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:10,052
will you wear my watch?

349
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,852
I can't wear this.

350
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:18,251
Oh, I see...

351
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:21,423
I thought it's
what you wanted.

352
00:20:21,623 --> 00:20:23,158
It's just too big.

353
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:25,856
I know it's a big step,

354
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,408
but don't you think that maybe
someday you might want to wear it?

355
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:33,100
Well... maybe if..

356
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:35,390
if I gain
a lot of weight.

357
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:41,187
Cake?

358
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:54,392
Some white irises,
Gerber daisies,

359
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:57,431
and a sprig of eucalyptus
for balance and scent.

360
00:20:58,575 --> 00:20:59,624
Cool, what you doing?

361
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,929
Yeah, I'm making a centerpiece
for the football team.

362
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:07,119
Really?
- Yeah, it'll go great on their training table.

363
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,989
I can't wait to see their
faces when they see this baby.

364
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:18,033
Ooh, it's fun to stay
at the Y.M.C.A.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
