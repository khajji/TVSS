1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:04,936
The big day
is tomorrow,

2
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:08,205
And these turkeys seem to
know what's coming their way.

3
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:20,270
It's the end
of the world!

4
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:23,070
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?

5
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:23,892
Dick!

6
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:26,763
There's a terrible
crisis.

7
00:00:27,104 --> 00:00:29,440
We were at the store,
and the place was a madhouse.

8
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:31,309
People were cramming
everything they could into their carts,

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,498
especially these giant
balls of butter.

10
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:35,843
I got one
for each of us.

11
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:37,455
I'm telling you,
something is up.

12
00:00:37,456 --> 00:00:39,302
The radio said the
airports were jammed

13
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:40,737
with people trying
to get out of town.

14
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:42,833
As a matter of fact, I just
saw a report on a turkey ranch,

15
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,884
and those birds were
talking apocalypse.

16
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,133
Apocalypse?
- Well, more like "apocalopolis".

17
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:52,338
What does this
all mean?

18
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:54,701
Well, I have a thought..
we're all gonna die!

19
00:00:54,702 --> 00:00:56,764
All right,
let's not panic.

20
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,851
Tonight we'll turn off the
lights and hunker down in the kitchen.

21
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:01,371
Tomorrow morning I'll make a run to the
university and find out what's going on.

22
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:03,956
Police and secure the perimeter!
- What?

23
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:06,022
Lock the doors!
- Oh, yeah!

24
00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:11,659
Hello? Hello? Mary!

25
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,159
Mary!

26
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,377
Mary, what have they done to your hair?

27
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,220
Speak to me, Mary!

28
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:24,164
Dr. Solomon, what are you doing here?

29
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:25,509
I'm trying
to find Mary,

30
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,048
but she's probably
already dead!

31
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:31,497
Are you sure she's not
home eating a big meal,

32
00:01:31,498 --> 00:01:32,904
celebrating
the holiday?

33
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,845
"Holiday"?
What do you mean, "holiday"?

34
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:39,749
It's thanksgiving.
- Ohh!

35
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,447
So it's not
the apocalypse.

36
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:43,641
It's.. what
did you call it?

37
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:45,399
Thanksgiving.

38
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:49,746
You should be home with your
loved ones around a dinner table,

39
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:51,840
giving thanks
for what you've got.

40
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,755
But.. well, why
are you here?

41
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:57,066
Yeah, well, I took
St. Patrick's day off.

42
00:01:58,529 --> 00:01:59,975
For six months.

43
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:04,605
So Mary isn't dead?
- Probably not.

44
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,301
She's giving thanks.
- That's right.

45
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:07,997
With her loved ones.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:11,520
But.. but..
but that's me!

47
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:14,038
Go on home.

48
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,609
Have a beer.
Take a nap.

49
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,552
You'll feel like
a human being.

50
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:21,296
Well, of course I will,
'cause that's what I am,

51
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,105
a human being.

52
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:27,369
Overlooking
the holidays was simply..

53
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,154
human error.

54
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:06,337
Oh, Dick! We gotta
get out of here!

55
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:08,642
It's gotten worse. They've
stopped delivering the mail.

56
00:03:08,643 --> 00:03:10,425
Of course they have.

57
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:14,096
Someone's taken over the airwaves.
There's a terrifying parade on every channel!

58
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:15,999
Of course there is.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,368
I got the gnome! I got the gnome!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

60
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,730
Slow down there,
speedboat.

61
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:24,588
It's just thanksgiving.

62
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,590
"thanks-what-ing"?
- Thanksgiving, it's a holiday.

63
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,133
Like big, giant
head day?

64
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,135
Similar, except nobody
gets thrown into the sun.

65
00:03:34,604 --> 00:03:38,301
It's a national holiday.
Everybody gets to take the day off.

66
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,380
Except for Sally.

67
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:41,077
What?

68
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:43,556
She has to go into the kitchen
and make an enormous feast.

69
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,292
Great. Our first holiday
on earth, and I got to cook.

70
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:51,043
And then after we eat,
we have to give thanks.

71
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,182
To me, for cooking?

72
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:56,407
Ohh!
Sally.

73
00:03:57,244 --> 00:04:00,897
No, we have to give
thanks for something bigger,

74
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:03,475
Something more important,
something like..

75
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:07,641
well, not this, but
something like how good looking I am.

76
00:04:07,642 --> 00:04:10,288
Maybe if we just run it
through, it'll hit us.

77
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,050
Why should we
run through anything?

78
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,577
'Cause I called Mary,
she's coming over.

79
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:15,476
But what if we get it wrong?
It'll give us away.

80
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:16,340
Now, look, men.

81
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:19,848
When we first landed on this
planet, we didn't know squat.

82
00:04:20,324 --> 00:04:22,673
We didn't even know what
the word "squat" meant.

83
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:26,541
And we had to find out the hard way.
- And it hurt.

84
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,264
All we have to do is find a
human example and follow it.

85
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:33,021
Hello, hello, everybody!
- Mrs. Dubcek.

86
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,277
Close enough.

87
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:38,468
Happy thanksgiving, everybody
. This is my daughter, Vicki.

88
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:41,612
Oh, I didn't know
Mrs. Dubcek had a..

89
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,880
I mean, hello-o-o-o-o.

90
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,400
Hi. You have
great hair.

91
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:54,174
So, uh, what are you
ladies doing for thanksgiving?

92
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:57,259
We're going off to the beef 'n' griddle.
- Oh, no, you're not.

93
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,195
You're coming over to our house to help us.

94
00:04:59,196 --> 00:05:00,773
Uh, celebrate.

95
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:02,419
Yeah, we don't know what we're doing.

96
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,257
Uh, celebrate.

97
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:09,217
What do you say, Vick?
- I say, what the hell?

98
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:11,134
Then "What the hell"
it is.

99
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,157
Turkey, no turkey.

100
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,133
Turkey, no turkey.

101
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,573
Turkey...

102
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,484
and no turkey.

103
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:28,616
Oh, Harry, you've got a real
childlike innocence about you.

104
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:30,627
It's very sexy.

105
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:32,794
Turkey.

106
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:38,223
Wow, this is the ugliest
lingerie I've ever seen.

107
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,505
But buckles.
- Mmm.

108
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,445
Oh, that? No.

109
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:45,971
That's just a costume I
wore in a thanksgiving play

110
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,550
I did in junior high.

111
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:50,810
I was a pilgrim,
and every time I wore it,

112
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:54,871
I put everybody in
the thanksgiving mood.

113
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,162
Tommy?
- What?

114
00:06:05,163 --> 00:06:06,147
You heard what she said.

115
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:08,514
Forget it, Dick,
I'm not putting that thing on.

116
00:06:08,515 --> 00:06:10,786
Once again, you let us down.
- What are you talking about?

117
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,893
You're the information officer. You should
have prepped us for this holiday weeks ago,

118
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:15,767
and now you won't
wear the costume!

119
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,637
Is there any end
to your treachery?

120
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:21,286
Look Dick, if it's a holiday, why
don't you just take the day off my back.

121
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,880
Oh, I will.

122
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,937
I will not allow my disappointment
in you to destroy this festival,

123
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:28,349
even though the costume would put
us all in the thanksgiving mood.

124
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,203
Yeah, well, it'll put me
in the crappy mood!

125
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:31,808
You're always in the crappy
mood.

126
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,409
Now, come on, put it on!
- No!

127
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:34,667
Put it on!
- No!

128
00:06:34,668 --> 00:06:35,787
Happy thanksgiving!

129
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:38,495
Oh, happy thanksgiving,
Mary.

130
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,274
Put it on!
- No!

131
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,189
Ever since we got here, I can't do
anything right for you. Why is that?

132
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,458
Don't use use that tone of voice with me, old man.
- Oh! I'm going for a walk.

133
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,784
Oh, fine! And don't come
back until you're damn

134
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:51,502
ready to sit down with your
family and have fun!

135
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:08,258
Uh...Dubcek, so what am I
supposed to do with this thing?

136
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:11,451
You stick your hand right up
there and yank out its guts.

137
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,663
What's the point?
It's already dead.

138
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,121
That's how it's done.
- All right.

139
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:21,180
Sally, look who's here.

140
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,350
I thought you might
need a little help cooking.

141
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:26,075
Why? Don't you think she's ever cooked a
thanksgiving dinner before?

142
00:07:26,076 --> 00:07:26,977
Is that what you think?

143
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:29,122
Yeah, you don't think I've ever
cooked a thanksgiving dinner before?

144
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:31,798
No, I didn't say that.
- Because thanksgiving is not new to us.

145
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,721
And we're certainly
not new to thanksgiving.

146
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:37,615
So, when's dinner, three o-clock?

147
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:40,878
Today?
- Three! On the dot!

148
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:44,234
All right, move it. Uh,
Dubcek, take out the relish tray,

149
00:07:44,235 --> 00:07:46,831
and Mary, hold this.

150
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:51,898
Okay, now, does the fork go
on the right or on the left?

151
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:53,912
Well,

152
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,421
this goes here,

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,384
and this goes here.

154
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,752
Are those the rules?

155
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,283
Oh, forget about
the rules, Harry!

156
00:08:11,284 --> 00:08:14,634
Just put whatever you want to
put wherever you want to put it.

157
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:19,439
Can I put my shirts
in my underwear drawer?

158
00:08:22,525 --> 00:08:24,663
Go wild.

159
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:26,738
Okay.

160
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,186
Maybe you should rub it with a
little margarine before you put it in.

161
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:40,842
You heard the woman.
Rub that bird.

162
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,978
I don't think so. All it
needs is a little salt.

163
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:46,403
No margarine!
Heavy on the salt!

164
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,096
If you want
the skin to crisp..

165
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,169
Want skin crisp now.

166
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,500
Want you dead now.

167
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:59,212
Dick, my grandmother
had a saying..

168
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:02,840
"Get out of the kitchen before
I burn you with a hot spoon".

169
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,018
Your grandmother had
a rapier wit.

170
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,571
She did.

171
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,724
Dick, get out
of the kitchen!

172
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,898
And she was mean too.

173
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:23,993
Are you open?
- 'Course we're open. It's thanksgiving.

174
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:36,194
Excuse me. This game's not
three-Dimensional, is it?

175
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:41,242
Uh, yeah. Uh, you want to play some 8-ball?

176
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:45,087
What's 8-ball?
- Don't worry, we're not very good either.

177
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:52,632
Harry, you should see the
beautiful turkey Sally has in the kitchen.

178
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,081
Oh, there's a turkey here?
- Oh, it's enormous!

179
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:56,792
I want to see it!

180
00:09:59,768 --> 00:10:01,840
You murdered it!

181
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:09,514
Although we are very familiar with this
tradition, it never ceases to appall us.

182
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:21,343
Well, I did it.

183
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:26,364
Here it is, folks..
the perfect turkey!

184
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,989
Shouldn't we wait
for Tommy?

185
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,601
We're starting
without him.

186
00:10:35,003 --> 00:10:37,616
Well, but I poured some
grape juice in a wine glass,

187
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:40,244
and who's gonna sit
at the kids' table?

188
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:43,532
Doesn't matter.

189
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:46,554
Fine, okay. Thanksgiving's ruined. Hack away.

190
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:48,409
Oh, no, no, I..

191
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,482
I couldn't make the
first hack. Mary, you hack.

192
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:58,591
Before we hack the turkey,
shouldn't someone give thanks?

193
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,602
Uh, here we all are,

194
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:10,966
gathered together for a
completely authentic thanksgiving dinner,

195
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,592
perfect in every way.

196
00:11:12,593 --> 00:11:15,345
I just want to say
I am thankful

197
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,332
that we are all here
to feast on this dead bird.

198
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,097
We're not all here.
Tommy's not here.

199
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,022
Thank you so much
for bringing that up!

200
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,677
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

201
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:27,698
Don't worry. Tommy will be back.
- Thank you!

202
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:30,812
Hey. Excuse me.
I'd like to add

203
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:32,669
a little something,
if I may.

204
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,618
Uh, I just
feel that

205
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,651
this year I have so much to be thankful for.

206
00:11:39,413 --> 00:11:41,974
That thing under my armpit
went away.

207
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,100
And when I was
working at wal-mart

208
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,867
and that big stack of boxes fell on me.

209
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:54,796
I got workman's comp for
eight months, and that's..

210
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,527
that's twice as much
as my normal salary, so...

211
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:01,760
guess you'd
have to say that

212
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,328
god has been

213
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,780
very, very good to me.

214
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:09,828
Let's eat!

215
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:18,234
You know, I left because
they don't appreciate me.

216
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:20,925
And I do a lot for those
guys. 6 ball, corner pocket.

217
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:24,708
I mean, they just don't
understand how difficult it is to be a kid.

218
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,301
I mean, I do a lot at home, but you have
to have a life outside work too, you know.

219
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:29,590
7 ball, side pocket.

220
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:33,324
I mean, occasionally I screw
up. I'm only trying to be human.

221
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:35,950
But whatever I do, it's
never enough for those people.

222
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,802
8 ball, three banks,
back pocket.

223
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:38,738
You know what I mean?

224
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,736
That's game.

225
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:48,550
Tommy,

226
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,417
they're hard on you
because they love you.

227
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:53,176
Yeah, at least
you've got somebody.

228
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:56,691
My father used to take me
out to the shed every Friday,

229
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,301
whether I deserved it
or not.

230
00:12:58,302 --> 00:13:00,557
Why?
Because he cared.

231
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,305
He just wanted to make me strong, that's all.

232
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:08,181
I should go home
and thank him.

233
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:09,724
Well, why don't you?

234
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:13,332
I can't afford to,
you've got all my money!

235
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,465
Here, take it.
Go home.

236
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:21,113
Oh, Tommy, man!
You're the best!

237
00:13:22,556 --> 00:13:24,396
I love you, man!
I love you!

238
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:28,697
Hey, Frank..
- Hold on.

239
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:30,783
Hi, dad,

240
00:13:31,883 --> 00:13:33,593
it's Francis.

241
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:46,907
What are you doing?

242
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:49,123
It's tradition.

243
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:54,987
I like it.

244
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:06,330
What's the matter
with us, Harry?

245
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:09,676
I'm gettin' drowsy,

246
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:11,980
and I can't
fight it.

247
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,923
I feel like
I'm gonna explode.

248
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:20,354
I'm gonna
ex-uh-pul-lode!

249
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,804
Stay with me, Harry.
I'll save you.

250
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:31,548
No!
Save yourself!

251
00:14:33,763 --> 00:14:34,771
Harry!

252
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:38,229
Harry, can you
hear me?

253
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,503
Harry!

254
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:50,530
It's Dick! Come back to
me! Come back to me, Harry!

255
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,615
Dick?
- Harry!

256
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,630
Talk to me!

257
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,460
What's for dessert?

258
00:15:04,594 --> 00:15:06,273
Wow, your mother's
refrigerator

259
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:08,347
is far more spacious
than ours.

260
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,891
Did you get enough
to eat Pumpkin?

261
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,614
Well, that depends on
what you're talking about.

262
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:20,191
And what do you think
I'm talkin' about?

263
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,023
Yams.

264
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,932
Oh, I got yams for ya.

265
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,802
Don't you want to put a
little mini marshmallow on that?

266
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:52,298
Yahtzee.

267
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,483
No, Dick, that wasn't Yahtzee,
that was two of a kind.

268
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:57,484
Yahtzee.
- No, that's not a Yahtzee.

269
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,924
Yahtzee.
Five in a row.

270
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,558
They lost
the instructions.

271
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:04,362
Tommy knows how to play.
- Well, Tommy's not here.

272
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:05,182
Yahtzee.

273
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:09,385
It's too bad. He would
have really liked my stuffing.

274
00:17:09,386 --> 00:17:11,058
Well, he should have
put on the pilgrim costume.

275
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,983
Why didn't you put on
the pilgrim costume?

276
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:15,624
You're the one who wanted to show off
and have a big, stupid thanksgiving.

277
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,926
That's not why I had a big, stupid
thanksgiving. I did it for all of you.

278
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:20,705
Oh, admit it, Dick..
everything is about you.

279
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,127
What about you? You had a good time.

280
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:23,874
Oh, yeah, if you call spending
a whole day in the kitchen

281
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,854
with these two
jabbermouths a good time.

282
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:29,337
Hey! One of those
jabbermouths is his girlfriend!

283
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:30,064
Yeah!

284
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:31,380
I have had it with all of you!

285
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:34,400
This holiday is over!
- Oh, I see! Well!

286
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:38,300
Now I have something to give
thanks for. Thanks for nothing!

287
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:46,818
This is why I go
to the beef 'n' griddle.

288
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:54,770
I've never felt
this way before.

289
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,206
I've never felt
this sticky before.

290
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:02,566
Harry,

291
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:05,906
I got to go home
to Orlando tomorrow.

292
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:07,764
But I'll be back.

293
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,527
You know, I like you, Harry. You're..

294
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:13,693
you're not like
the other guys.

295
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:14,979
Ah.

296
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,106
No, ma'am.

297
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,819
Do you, uh.. do you think
we could make it work?

298
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,086
Oh, I don't know.
I'm pretty tired.

299
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,310
I meant us, Harry.

300
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,716
I definitely think

301
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:33,721
that "us" could work.

302
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:36,064
Me too.

303
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:39,435
Your family's a little
strange, though.

304
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:42,574
Ha! Your Mother's
Mrs. Dubcek.

305
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,924
Oh, Mary, I'm so sorry about everything.

306
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:52,280
What?
- Oh the tension, the fighting,

307
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,075
the lumpy gravy.
- Yeah.

308
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,275
You give and you give
and you give

309
00:18:57,276 --> 00:18:58,955
until you just
can't give anymore.

310
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:01,988
Mmm. Same thing
happens at my house.

311
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:07,627
This happens at your house?
- Why should my house be any different

312
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:10,617
than 99% of all
the homes in America?

313
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,905
What about the other
one percent?

314
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,870
Connecticut.

315
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:20,249
Hey, guys.
- Tommy, you're back.

316
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:23,979
Oh, I'll leave
you two alone.

317
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,391
Sorry I left
like that.

318
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:30,499
No, that's all right.
I don't think it was your fault.

319
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,356
I found out
something pretty cool.

320
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,340
You know how you tried to
make this a special day,

321
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,143
but all the resentment I
had for you came spewing out

322
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:38,947
and we ended up spending the
whole day avoiding each other?

323
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:40,903
Yeah.
- It's normal.

324
00:19:41,204 --> 00:19:43,380
I was gonna tell you
the same thing!

325
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:46,785
Yeah, the screaming, the
fighting, the exploding resentments..

326
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,436
that's what
thanksgiving is!

327
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,980
So we did get it right.
- Yeah.

328
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,648
Nailed it.
- Oh, yeah.

329
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:01,459
Tommy.

330
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,214
I've never felt
so content.

331
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,690
I look around
this room and I see

332
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,683
nothing but
familiar faces.

333
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,203
Well, some are more
familiar than others.

334
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:19,914
I barely know you.

335
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:23,432
But it doesn't matter,
because tonight

336
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,534
you're all family,

337
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:28,321
and this has been
the perfect thanksgiving.

338
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:30,692
And now for
the perfect dessert.

339
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:33,077
Surprise!

340
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:43,510
Well..I guess not everyone
likes jell-O.

341
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:52,948
Listen, Dick, we better not let another
one of these big holidays sneak up on us.

342
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:55,014
Oh, don't worry,
lieutenant, after this one,

343
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:57,556
there couldn't possibly
be another one for months.

344
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:03,324
You know, after cooking that huge
dinner tonight, I think I deserve a break.

345
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:05,197
What do you plan to do?
- I think...

346
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:09,070
tomorrow I'm gonna spend a
nice, peaceful day at the mall.

347
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:13,450
Really?
I hear there's a sale.

348
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:16,304
Really? Goody!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
