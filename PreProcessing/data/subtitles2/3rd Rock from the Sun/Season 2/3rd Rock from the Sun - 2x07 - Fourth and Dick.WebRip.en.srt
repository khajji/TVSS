1
00:00:05,126 --> 00:00:06,922
Oh, it's that thing again.

2
00:00:07,148 --> 00:00:08,826
I have a name.

3
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:12,858
Football, I thought
they canceled that in January.

4
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:14,670
Well, guess they
brought it back.

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,859
I still don't see the
point. What's it all about?

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,660
Well from what I understand, they
try to kill whoever has the ball.

7
00:00:23,163 --> 00:00:26,719
Those two guys in the
middle seem awfully... intimate.

8
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:30,808
Yeah, they've been going
at it the whole game.

9
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:34,295
Yeah, they should
just get a room.

10
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:35,946
Is there any upside?

11
00:00:35,947 --> 00:00:38,605
Well, if you make it down to the big poles,
you get to dance.

12
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,591
Dance?

13
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:44,285
And if you're really good, you win a trip
to some fruitbowl.

14
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:46,915
But only the best
dancers make it.

15
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,390
See ya.
- Whoa. Where are you going?

16
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,496
I have Glee club practice.
- Glee club?

17
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:54,074
Yeah.

18
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:55,971
Oh I see, you've changed your mission.

19
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,832
Now you're researching
what it's like to be a girl.

20
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,935
For your information, Glee
club is not just for girls.

21
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,877
Yeah, it's also for Geeks and Nancy boys.

22
00:01:05,895 --> 00:01:06,972
Hey!

23
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,393
Oh, he's dancing.

24
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,990
Hey!
- This is obviously a waste of time.

25
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,919
Go do something with one of
your girlfriends. That's an order.

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,964
Fine!

27
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,503
Wait a minute.

28
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:25,214
I don't have
any girlfriends.

29
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,584
You and me, sister.

30
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:30,291
You and me.

31
00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:17,309
They are so good.

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,310
They ought to be.

33
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:19,604
They've been playing
the same damn song

34
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,936
for the past
six hours.

35
00:02:21,937 --> 00:02:24,272
They're a marching band.
Why don't they march?

36
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,758
Preferably
into the ocean.

37
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,549
Oh come on Dick,
don't tell me you're not excited

38
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,179
about the homecoming
weekend.

39
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,064
You know, between
the Pendleton badgers

40
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:35,855
and Ohio western
mustangs.

41
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:38,790
Oh, it's football.

42
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,862
Everywhere I turn,
it's football, football,

43
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:44,014
big, fat shmutball.

44
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,111
Well, forgive me,
Mr. Intellectual.

45
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:51,805
God forbid you should come
down from your ivory tower

46
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:52,941
for four quarters.

47
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,925
Four quarters? I don't care
what you pay me, I'm not going.

48
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:58,549
It's bad enough

49
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:00,898
there was a giant
papier maché rodent

50
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,390
blocking my parking spot
this morning.

51
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,831
You mean
Pendleton J. Badger.

52
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:08,895
What does
the "j" stand for?

53
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:10,802
Nothing.

54
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:12,188
Nothing starts with "N".

55
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,207
It's just a kooky initial.

56
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,457
"Q" is kookier.

57
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,598
Why isn't it
Pendleton Q. Badger?

58
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,926
I don't know.
Why don't you ask him?

59
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:23,049
Anyway, I got us
great seats.

60
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,174
It's not just
a sporting event.

61
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,626
It's a long-standing
tradition..

62
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:30,162
Pendleton versus
Ohio western.

63
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:32,379
You know, if you really
want to defeat them,

64
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,306
the secret is right in
front of you.. the giant badger.

65
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,472
It's a Trojan float.

66
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:42,484
Load our team in. We push
it up to their school walls.

67
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,079
And they say, "look.
A friendly giant badger.

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,071
Let's bring it inside."

69
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:48,816
Later, that night,
they fall asleep,

70
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,609
and "Whammo"!

71
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,630
It could work.

72
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:54,991
It's not
very sportsmanlike.

73
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,283
Well, I'll admit it
doesn't involve any dancing

74
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:00,475
or homoerotic
butt-Slapping.

75
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:05,714
Although, you never know what
goes on inside a giant badger.

76
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:08,745
"Bali hai"

77
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:11,117
"may call you"

78
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,382
"any night"

79
00:04:13,383 --> 00:04:15,430
"any day"

80
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:17,764
"here am I"

81
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:20,220
"your special island"

82
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:22,885
"come away"

83
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:25,722
"come away"

84
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,723
"Bali hai"

85
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:30,488
That was really, um...

86
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,304
better.

87
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,357
Everyone take a seat.

88
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:39,033
You know, you mustn't
be afraid to sing

89
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:42,622
from your heart, from
your mind, from your body.

90
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,466
Music is the sound
your soul makes.

91
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,994
Try it like this.

92
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:54,383
"You'll hear me
call you"

93
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:58,276
"singing through
the sunshine"

94
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:05,107
"sweet and clear as can be"

95
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:08,249
"here am I"

96
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,222
"come to me"

97
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:14,918
"here am I, come to me"

98
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:18,153
"here am I
come to me"

99
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:21,712
"Bali hai"

100
00:05:26,103 --> 00:05:29,261
Okay, now who would like to
stand up and try it like that?

101
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:31,459
Tommy.

102
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:45,040
Nina, how's it going?

103
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,151
Well I'm kind of busy..

104
00:05:46,186 --> 00:05:47,541
Great..um..Listen, um...

105
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,711
we're friends, aren't we?
- Yeah, sure.

106
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:53,768
Good, 'cause I've decided we're best
friends. You got a problem with that?

107
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:58,366
Uh... no.
- Thanks, Nina.

108
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,767
I finally have a
girlfriend. You're my first one.

109
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,031
Oh, Sally, I am?

110
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:06,099
Why? Is that weird?
- Oh, no.

111
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,397
No, no. it's tough making
friends with women.

112
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,922
You're telling me. I can barely stand myself.

113
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:14,270
So, uh... what do you
want to do now, girlfriend?

114
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,396
You want to go shopping
or talk about cramps?

115
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:19,779
Shopping.
- Ok

116
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:24,119
And, for Monday, I want
you to read and outline

117
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,398
chapters eight
through 24.

118
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,464
Except for chapter 12

119
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:31,757
which you will refute in a 10-
page treatise with illustrations.

120
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,295
Oh, come on.

121
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:36,720
Dr. Solomon, it's homecoming weekend.
- Yeah, the big game.

122
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:39,162
Oh, yes, I forgot.

123
00:06:39,163 --> 00:06:42,295
God forbid that your intellectual
development should get in the way of

124
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,941
"the Big Game".

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,166
What could be more
important than "the Big Game"?

126
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,676
The fate of mankind
rests on the outcome of

127
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,796
"the Big Game".

128
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,614
Is he being sarcastic?

129
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,454
Oh, and I've got
news for you.

130
00:06:56,455 --> 00:07:00,071
The "j" in Pendleton J.
Badger, it's meaningless.

131
00:07:02,526 --> 00:07:05,572
Dr. Solomon, you've insulted my intelligence,

132
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:07,410
my religion,
and my family,

133
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,200
and that's okay.

134
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:12,063
But there's one thing you
cannot insult, and that's the badgers

135
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,190
because there's something you
don't even know about a badger, man.

136
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:18,077
When they dig holes,
they do it for a reason.

137
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:21,230
And their teeth, they're really
sharp when they're very young.

138
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:24,959
So I'm going to that game, and I
don't care if you fail me for it.

139
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:31,564
But you're
already failing.

140
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,807
Okay, as long as we
see eye to eye, then.

141
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,492
I just don't see
why you care so much about

142
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,582
a team that has
no chance of winning.

143
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:45,450
Why are you so passionate
about a lost cause?

144
00:07:45,451 --> 00:07:47,454
Ohio western's
record is 6-1.

145
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,785
They're going to win, why
don't you root for them?

146
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:51,927
But we go to Pendleton,
we're the badgers,

147
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:54,658
and the badgers are us, we're
us, not them, they're them.

148
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,443
We're us with the..

149
00:07:58,431 --> 00:07:59,055
don't you get it?

150
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:02,438
No, why didn't you
just go to western?

151
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,395
Because we...
choked on our S.A.T.s.

152
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:12,481
That skirt was really cute, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

153
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:14,847
And there were those shoes
that looked so great on you.

154
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:17,687
Thank you. So, this is where you live.

155
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:20,722
Oh, Nina, I'm glad you're
here, get me some coffee.

156
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:26,150
We're not at the office,
I'm here with Sally.

157
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,874
Yeah, that's right, she's
my friend, my best friend.

158
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,909
If she's going to get anybody
coffee, it's going to be me.

159
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,608
We'll see about that.
Nina,

160
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,136
who are you going to get
coffee for? Sally or me?

161
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,381
Okay, I have to go
home and feed my cat.

162
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:45,083
I didn't know you had a cat.
- I'm going to go buy one.

163
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:48,347
I'll call you in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

164
00:08:48,348 --> 00:08:50,334
According to
the "Daily Badgerian",

165
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,614
over 45,000 alumni

166
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,776
will return to Pendleton
for the homecoming game.

167
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,596
You'd think that
after four years

168
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:58,872
they'd want to put the
experience behind them.

169
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:01,132
All I know is, my friend
Nina and I are going together.

170
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:02,272
We bought new outfits.

171
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:04,008
I think I'm going to go, too.

172
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,009
Really?

173
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,431
It's not that I'm being sucked in,
it's purely scientific.

174
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:10,294
And who knows?
Pendleton might win.

175
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:12,314
That would be
Da Bomb.

176
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:18,053
You heard me.
Da Bomb!

177
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:23,462
Dick, can I talk to you for a second?
- What is it?

178
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,731
I met this woman that I really
like, and I think she likes me,

179
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,442
but she's
a little older..

180
00:09:28,952 --> 00:09:30,782
31.

181
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,906
But Tommy, do you really think a woman of
that age would be

182
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:33,770
interested in you?

183
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,503
Sure.
- Wow! Good job.

184
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,196
What's your first move?

185
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:41,232
I don't know, I want to take
her someplace special, but..

186
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,503
Excuse me.
What about August?

187
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:45,452
She'll understand. She's a good kid.

188
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:48,327
You know, there's a word
for what you're doing here.

189
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,996
Oh, right. It's called trading up.

190
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,942
Guys, guess what.
I went to the stadium

191
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,113
to see if I could get a
job as a vendor for the game.

192
00:09:58,114 --> 00:09:59,215
Did you get it?

193
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:02,842
No. I didn't have enough
experience to sell hot dogs.

194
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,155
So they hired me
as a security guard.

195
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:19,148
hi.
- hi, Tommy.

196
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,527
Sunny d?

197
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,373
Thank you.

198
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,432
You know, Tommy,
you may think I haven't noticed,

199
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,396
but I really think you're
making a lot of progress.

200
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,244
I'm trying.

201
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:34,470
I know you are,
and it'll pay off, trust me.

202
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:38,263
I'm counting on it.

203
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,033
Oh Miss, Miss  Frost,
I got you something else.

204
00:10:42,068 --> 00:10:44,185
It's a ticket to the
homecoming Pendleton game.

205
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,149
The Mustangs-badger game?
- Yeah.

206
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,165
That's very sweet,
but I couldn't accept a gift.

207
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,210
Oh no, but my dad, he gets
them for free.

208
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:54,726
He works
at the university.

209
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:57,185
They pay him squat,
so they give him perks.

210
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,600
Well, thank you,
Tommy.

211
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:09,732
Man on first.

212
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,848
Hey, buy us
a couple of beers?

213
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:17,302
Sure.

214
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,339
So, you girls going
to the big game?

215
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,159
We don't want to talk
to you. We're just broke.

216
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:28,138
This is so strange. I feel
this gnawing in my stomach.

217
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,638
I told you, this is not the place
for oysters Rockefeller.

218
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,075
No, it feels
more like tension.

219
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:36,730
I'm not sure, but I think I might actually
be nervous about the game.

220
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:39,440
Nervous? There's nothing
to be nervous about

221
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,840
because the badgers
are going to win!

222
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:45,611
Badgers beat the Mustangs?
In your dreams!

223
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:48,646
Go ahead, laugh now

224
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,034
'cause you're going to be crying tomorrow.

225
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh I don't think so,

226
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,553
we're going to beat you a million to one!

227
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:54,487
Oh, yeah, right, right,

228
00:11:54,488 --> 00:11:57,654
you're going to score
2,380 touchdowns a minute.

229
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:00,694
You're not going
to score anything.

230
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:03,683
These aren't the same badgers
you pushed around last year.

231
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:04,820
Oh, really?

232
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,984
Yeah. We've got a bunch of fifth year seniors,

233
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:09,026
and they bulked up
like crazy.

234
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:09,958
ooh!

235
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,043
Yeah! and they've got heart.

236
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:13,563
Yeah, one each.

237
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:16,915
Yeah.
- Yeah? Well, I got bad news for you, lady.

238
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,479
She's no lady, she's a
badger. Show them your teeth Mary.

239
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:24,231
Oh, yeah? Well, you're going down.

240
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:25,388
And you know why?
- Why?

241
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:26,693
Because badgers suck.

242
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:28,822
Badgers don't suck, they bite!

243
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:30,743
You guys are nuts.

244
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,963
Nuts like a Badger!
- Yeah!

245
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:42,267
Hurry!
Hurry!

246
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:43,948
Hurry!

247
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:45,978
What? What?

248
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,302
The western team bus
is just pulling up!

249
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,586
Oh, my god.

250
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,766
This glass is cold.

251
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:09,155
All right...

252
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,552
let's just drop
the axe there, little buddy.

253
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,651
I said drop it!

254
00:13:18,318 --> 00:13:20,116
August, there's something
I have to tell you.

255
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:21,101
What is it?

256
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:23,887
Well I never thought I'd say these words,

257
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:25,793
but I'm in love with another woman.

258
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:27,880
Who is it Tommy?

259
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:30,509
It's Miss Frost.

260
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,803
Miss Frost,
the glee club teacher?

261
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,574
I'm afraid so,
it just happened.

262
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:40,590
I understand.

263
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,463
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

264
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,387
You're not
upset or jealous?

265
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:50,186
No.

266
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:53,201
Not at all.

267
00:13:54,243 --> 00:13:56,739
I hope you two will be
very happy together.

268
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:00,791
Oh, there's something
I have to tell you, too.

269
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:03,012
I've been seeing
Val Kilmer.

270
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,232
Really?

271
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:07,140
Oh, I'm glad
you've got someone.

272
00:14:11,427 --> 00:14:12,656
Whew!

273
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:16,886
We're very
pleased, attendance is 19,438.

274
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,565
We'll beat ya!
We'll eat ya!

275
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:21,535
We'll bite ya!
We'll claw ya!

276
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,584
We'll beat ya!
We'll eat ya!

277
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,942
Go, badgers!

278
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:38,072
Oh Mary, you were so right.
I feel great!

279
00:14:38,073 --> 00:14:40,370
I just feel
tingly all over,

280
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:43,095
and that's not just
the lead paint talking.

281
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,875
You really went all out, didn't you?
- Yeah.

282
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,499
Bug and pitman did it. They
didn't want to, but I made them.

283
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,349
It goes all the way down, you know.

284
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,134
[You'Il be happy to know the
homecoming queen, is recovering nicely]

285
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:58,079
Tommy.

286
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,122
Oh, Miss. Frost.

287
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:02,515
What a coincidence.
"Corn Dog"?

288
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:09,795
Well, hello,
Mrs. Sumner.

289
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:12,141
How's the Dean?
- He's fine, thank you.

290
00:15:12,142 --> 00:15:14,149
Excellent. I'm afraid I'm going to
have to look in that bag.

291
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,050
What?
Uh, uh...

292
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:18,898
Oh, binoculars, huh?

293
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,205
And exactly who is it that
you were planning on looking at?

294
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:25,488
Because around here we got a little
thing called right to privacy.

295
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:27,509
Okay, spread 'em, lady.
- Oh!

296
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:33,507
This is Solomon.
I need a canine unit.

297
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,683
[ We request that
you stop throwing things

298
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:38,913
at the Pendleton band]

299
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,921
Please, god, block
the extra point!

300
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:45,489
I promise I'll never ask
for anything else!

301
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,474
Screw Mary's
shut-In grandmother!

302
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,215
Just block that kick!

303
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,634
Yes, yes, yes!

304
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:54,115
Aw!
- Yeah!

305
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,477
There is no god!

306
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:00,556
What do you think
about your badgers now?

307
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:03,929
Up yours, buddy. Quick,
Dick, give him the finger.

308
00:16:08,746 --> 00:16:12,491
Yeah!...Ooooooh!

309
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:15,231
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

310
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:18,219
I don't get it,
our guys don't advance.

311
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,223
They're in a constant
state of retreat.

312
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:24,400
I can't watch this
anymore.

313

23 get up here!

314
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:36,022
Get in there and remind
them we're going "that way".

315
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,543
23, get back here.

316
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:38,960
Excuse me, lady.

317
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,275
Hey, I'm the coach.

318
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:40,838
Oh, yeah?

319
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,329
So you're the idiot who's
running this team into the ground.

320
00:16:43,707 --> 00:16:45,842
That's me, you got a problem with that?

321
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:48,061
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do.

322
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:49,915
Let me tell you
what you can do.

323
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,558
Take that pretty little body of
yours, and march it up to the bleachers,

324
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,038
and park it.

325
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:57,624
I was just about to say
the same thing to you.

326
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,937
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

327
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:01,417
Yeah?
- Yeah!

328
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:02,704
Why are your guys
throwing the ball?

329
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,918
Your throwing guy's too
short to see over the fat guys.

330
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,357
You need to run left,
it's their weak side.

331
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,413
What do we do after that,
Miss Schottenheimer?

332
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:14,390
You do it again,
they won't expect it.

333
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:15,651
She's right, coach.

334
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:18,017
You shut up, or
I'll quit fixing your grades.

335
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,299
No.

336
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:23,968
No, no.

337
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,398
Oh, god, no!

338
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,745
Yeah, now that's a play.

339
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:36,642
You heard the lady.

340
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,936
If you get any more
of those good ideas,

341
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:43,682
you mark 'em down on this pad for me.
- Can do.

342
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:45,880
You're doing
a hell of a job.

343
00:17:54,482 --> 00:17:56,720
Yeah!

344
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,116
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

345
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:07,650
Apparently.

346
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:12,822
[Pendleton recovers the fumble
on the Mustangs 30-yard line]

347
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:15,449
Okay, everybody!

348
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,659
Here, come on,
let's try another one.

349
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:20,810
Sine, cosine,
cosine, sine!

350
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,379
Three-point-one-four- one-
five-Nine! Now you try it.

351
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,230
sine, cosine, cosine, sine!

352
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,721
Three-point-one-four-
one-Five..

353
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:34,382
What? What happened? What happened?

354
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:41,340
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

355
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:43,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

356
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:46,059
Let's keep it down!

357
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,270
All right,
who threw that?

358
00:18:50,177 --> 00:18:52,020
All right,
who threw that one?

359
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:53,237
Okay..

360
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,636
[Pendleton wins, I
can't believe it. Pendleton wins]

361
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,787
Hey, Nina,

362
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:02,154
look what they gave me
for winning.

363
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:05,613
Ooh, steak sandwiches.

364
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:11,642
Miss. Frost, I'm pretty
sure we can work this out.

365
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:14,010
Tommy, there
is no we.

366
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:14,983
There can't be,

367
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:17,074
and I'm not just
talking legally.

368
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:20,373
Well, then why did you spend
all that time singing to me,

369
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:23,645
luring me like a siren
to my destruction?

370
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:26,237
I'm a singing
teacher, Tommy.

371
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:27,449
I sing.

372
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,850
I didn't mean to give you
the wrong impression.

373
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:33,329
Look, I think you'd be better
off with a girl your own age.

374
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:36,888
Yeah. So what's your mother look like?

375
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,813
Listen.
Can you hear them celebrating?

376
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,536
Ah, yes, The happy sounds
of cars overturning

377
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:46,984
and stores
being looted.

378
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,889
I love the smell
of burning rubber.

379
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,739
It smells like victory.
- A sweet victory.

380
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:54,748
You know,
it's amazing.

381
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:57,550
There we were,
thousands of total strangers

382
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:59,067
all pulling together,

383
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,656
trying to transfer
our collective strength

384
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:03,928
to a tiny group
of young men

385
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,334
that we didn't
even know.

386
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:08,192
We cheered for them,
and they won for us.

387
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,238
I've never felt such a
feeling of joy and camaraderie.

388
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:16,572
The only sad part is that
everyone couldn't share it.

389
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:18,005
Someone had to lose.

390
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:20,674
I feel for
the mustang fans.

391
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,302
Ah, screw 'em.

392
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,109
You're right.

393
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:27,521
Badgers rule!
- Yeah!

394
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:29,435
Okay, lovebirds,

395

party's over.
Let's, uh...

396
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:34,845
take it inside.

397
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:52,395
Mustangs give
you problems.

398
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:54,104
Mustangs give
you grief.

399
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:55,811
Mustangs give
you trouble,

400
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:57,671
but the badgers
got the teeth.

401

Not lancers
