1
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:05,231
I love these Saturdays
in the park.

2
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:07,626
The soft grass,
the chirping birds,

3
00:00:07,665 --> 00:00:10,137
the "eyewitness
news" team.

4
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,574
Save the park!
Save the park!

5
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:14,873
Makes you want to scream at the
top of your lungs like those people.

6
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:16,669
Let's eat
over there!

7
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:20,015
No! I prefer this table! It's in the shade!

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,966
Hey, look!
A butterfly!

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,468
Hey, look, Sally!
It's your friend Don!

10
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:27,540
Sally.
- Don.

11
00:00:27,575 --> 00:00:30,340
A word to the wise. There's
trouble in the park today.

12
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,798
Trouble? Uh-oh. I
better take care of my baby.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,395
What is it?
- Sometimes a wrinkle runs through the city,

14
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,990
and it rears up
on its haunches

15
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,903
like an ugly monkey
ready to strike.

16
00:00:41,038 --> 00:00:43,481
Don, you always
have your finger

17
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,428
up the pulse
of danger.

18
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,648
Save the park! Save the park!

19
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:54,548
Save the park!
Save the park!

20
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,550
Hey, man, you want
to sign this petition?

21
00:00:56,585 --> 00:00:58,517
The town's going
to destroy bates park.

22
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:01,531
Uh... maybe in
a little while.

23
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,786
There's no time, the dozers are on their way.

24
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:07,602
Okay. I've chained myself to the tree.

25
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,917
Oh!
- Sir, sir, excuse me.

26
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:13,834
Is it true you've chained
yourself to that tree?

27
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:16,279
Yes, that's exactly
what I've done.

28
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:17,458
So you won't
free yourself

29
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,408
even though the city
bulldozers are on their way?

30
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:22,043
No, I cannot
do that.

31
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:25,565
He may be an organized protester,

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,274
he may be a rogue
mountain man,

33
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,875
but one thing's
for sure-

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,742
he may be a hero.
We got it.

35
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:10,626
Is it on
the right channel?

36
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,634
Some of the
stories we're tracking at this hour:

37
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,255
A fire breaks out in a nursing home...
- Ooh!

38
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,474
a search for survivors
continues at the Parma Heights mudslide,

39
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,580
and in our Science Watch,
a vet performs an operation

40
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,767
that allows a cat to smile
for the first time.

41
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,638
Aww!

42
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:26,816
That's the happiest cat
in the world.

43
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:29,539
Tonight's top story:
a protest in Bates Park.

44
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:33,231
Look! I'm on TV!
- You're wearing my shirt. My shirt's on television.

45
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:37,096
That's exactly what I've done.

46
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:38,806
Hello?

47
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:41,681
Yes, Harry Solomon
lives here.

48
00:02:41,716 --> 00:02:43,946
Okay.
Hold on.

49
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:46,082
Harry has
a phone call.

50
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,704
A phone call.

51
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,184
My first phone call.

52
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,763
How do I look?
- You look fine.

53
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,617
Hello.

54
00:03:03,652 --> 00:03:06,186
Uh-huh.
Okay.

55
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:08,322
I'll have to talk it over with my family.

56
00:03:08,357 --> 00:03:10,856
Okay. Bye.

57
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:14,014
Who was that?
- It's a member from the independent party.

58
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,838
They saw me on TV. They want
me to run for city council.

59
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:19,738
What's city council?

60
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:21,680
I think it's
some sort of council

61
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,592
here in the city.

62
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,844
Council? According to my
civics class, that's government.

63
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,755
Oh, Oh, this is big.

64
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,363
This is big. We do not
want to get involved in this.

65
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:34,006
This will allow us to get on
the inside, see how it works.

66
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,615
What about our vow not to
alter the course of the planet?

67
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,756
Please. It's only politics.

68
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:42,625
We dive in, master it,

69
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,203
grab a few votes, get a
little action. Nobody gets hurt.

70
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:47,446
Harry, call those people
back and tell them you'll run.

71
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:50,211
Right you're the boss.
- Sally, Tommy,

72
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:51,967
you advise Harry
on his campaign.

73
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,416
I'm going to register to vote.
- Shouldn't we all vote?

74
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,831
No. We don't want
to arouse suspicion.

75
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:58,622
One in four
seems right.

76
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:04,583
Here's a list of candidates and referendums.

77
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:07,202
So you're all set. You come
back here in two weeks to vote.

78
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:10,629
Right. And how many times do I get to vote?

79
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,542
One time.

80
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:14,758
And it doesn't matter
that I'm brilliant?

81
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,472
No.

82
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:19,850
Have you noticed
how tall I am?

83
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,840
We all get
one vote.

84
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:25,488
So your opinion counts equally with mine?
- You got it.

85
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:28,701
You're awfully smug for a man
who works at a folding table.

86
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:34,766
Okay, let's see.

87
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:37,998
For mayor,
Heckie Mulligan.

88
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:41,811
Hmm, funny name.
I like that in a Mayor.

89
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,824
Heckie Mulligan?

90
00:04:43,798 --> 00:04:46,914
How can you vote for Heckie
Mulligan? Nina, can you believe that?

91
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,051
How do you know I'm not voting for Mulligan?

92
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:50,450
I thought you
were a democrat.

93
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:52,870
Why do you think I'm a
democrat? Because I'm black?

94
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,932
Go ahead, vote for Mulligan.
- I'm not voting for Mulligan.

95
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,742
Wait,
I don't understand.

96
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:00,265
Why are you getting
so worked up over politics?

97
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,851
It's simple. You vote for the
best, the best man wins.

98
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:03,923
Or woman.

99
00:05:07,804 --> 00:05:09,593
Oh that's priceless.

100
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,470
What, Heckie's
a woman?

101
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:23,381
Frank Gansmiller.
Glad to know you.

102
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:27,117
Hey, Betty, the new speed bump
keeping the teenagers away?

103
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,302
Great, good.

104
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,341
Norma, Tom, Patty,

105
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,237
Cathy, Carl.

106
00:05:33,272 --> 00:05:35,769
Too bad about
that warehouse fire.

107
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:39,076
I'm glad to hear
"the insurance" came through.

108
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:43,152
Harry Solomon.

109
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,762
I've never seen you
before in my life.

110
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,011
Hi, I'm
Harry Solomon,

111
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:53,044
a simple mind
for a simple people.

112
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:57,253
I can't believe
Dr. Solomon

113
00:05:57,288 --> 00:05:59,392
is letting his brother
run against Gansmiller.

114
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:02,387
No one can dig up the dirt like Gansmiller.
- The man's a backhoe.

115
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:08,267
It's a piece
of equipment.

116
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:22,748
Don?
- Sally, what brings you here?

117
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,934
My brother threw his head into the ring.

118
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:29,383
You mean his hat?
- Yeah, sure, his hat.

119
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:31,818
What brings you here?
- Oh, the usual.

120
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:35,262
Looking for trouble,
making sure it doesn't happen.

121
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:37,870
Punch?
- Take your best shot.

122
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,878
Frank Gansmiller.
- Dick Solomon.

123
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,368
Nice to know you, Dick.
- I feel it only fair to warn you

124
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:50,795
that your challenger is my brother
Harry, and I am not easily swayed.

125
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,709
I'll keep that in mind.
- Mary, this is Frank Gansmiller.

126
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:55,884
This must be the little lady?

127
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,425
This must be the little man.

128
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,060
Mary.

129
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:03,140
Dick, it's all right,

130
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:05,242
as long as Mary
turns out to vote.

131
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:08,411
Although I don't know if you're old enough to vote.
- Yes, she is.

132
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,280
She's 44.

133
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:13,865
Mr. Gansmiller-

134
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,598
Frank, when I do vote,
it won't be for you.

135
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,288
Mary, Dick,

136
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:22,519
let me get serious
for just a moment.

137
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:26,214
"Why should I vote for
Frank Gansmiller?" You ask.

138
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:28,125
I didn't ask.

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,213
Mary won't let me get away
with anything, will she, Dick?

140
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:32,719
Not a thing, Frank.

141
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:34,907
Why should I vote for
Frank Gansmiller, Frank?

142
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:36,540
Good question, Dick.

143
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,919
Because I want
to take money

144
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:40,831
out of the drug
dealers' pockets

145
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:43,074
and give it back
to the people.

146
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,796
Oh, Frank's right. I want
some of that drug money.

147
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:51,090
All right, everybody. It's
time to hear from our candidates.

148
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,088
First up, our incumbent,
Frank Gansmiller.

149
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:56,723
Thank you.
No, no.

150
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:59,465
You know what?
You all know me.

151
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,747
Let's give the new kid a chance.
- Yes, yes.

152
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,962
This is a great man.
- Dick, sit.

153
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:16,642
Thank you,
fellow...

154
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:19,057
Rutherfordonianites.

155
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:23,483
Anyway, I'm here

156
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:25,048
because of
all you people,

157
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:27,819
Men, Women.

158
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,036
Of course,
if I had my way,

159
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:32,184
there'd be
like a lot more women.

160
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,607
You know, on any given day, I
see maybe one, two women, tops.

161
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:38,240
I want to see
more women.

162
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,597
Everywhere I go,
more women.

163
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:42,545
More women in the workplace, yes!

164
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,724
Okay.

165
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,054
Vote Harry S. Solomon.

166
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,303
The "S" stands
for know-how.

167
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,869
I'm sorry,

168
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,699
Snow-How.

169
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:07,925
Turn it off.
I've seen enough.

170
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,479
All right, whatta you got on him?

171
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:16,752
Nothing, he's clean.

172
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:19,516
Nothing, must have
something rotten in his past?

173
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:22,159
He's human, isn't he?
- I've done every background check personally.

174
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,144
There's nothing.
It's like he...

175
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,328
fell out of the sky.

176
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:27,936
What about drinking?
- No.

177
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:29,436
Gambling?
- No.

178
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:31,660
Bad checks? Tax evasion?
- No.

179
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:35,055
Pornography, drug addiction, bad hairpiece?

180
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,999
No!

181
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,931
Zero divided by zero,
zip, nada, bubkiss.

182
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:42,220
Bubkiss huh?

183
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:44,879
What does
"bubkiss" mean?

184
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,756
Nothing.
- Yeah, I thought so.

185
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,820
You know,
it's almost

186
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,767
as if he were...

187
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,275
Amish.

188
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:58,040
Damn!

189
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:01,501
No past, no experience, no record,

190
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:02,748
the perfect
candidate.

191
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,911
Wait a minute.

192
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:09,057
What about that sister of his?
- You leave her out of it!

193
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,424
Ooh!

194
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,680
Copper's got
a girlfriend.

195
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,004
Should there be a toll on
the Cherry street bridge?

196
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,352
Well, I never use it.

197
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:26,995
Yes.
- Yes.

198
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,695
But what if I
start using it?

199
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:31,126
No.
- Smart money on No.

200
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:33,449
What am I thinking? There's
nothing good on cherry street.

201
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,464
Yes.

202
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,610
No!

203
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:39,481
No-
Yes!

204
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:41,426
A resounding No-Yes.

205
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,868
Okay, let's move on
to the candidates.

206
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:46,287
This should be
a no-brainer.

207
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:50,080
City council, district nine? Harry Solomon.

208
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:53,579
Yaaaa?

209
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:56,620
What? Don't tell me
you're voting for Gansmiller.

210
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,140
Don't tell me you're voting for Harry.
- Yes, I'm voting for Harry.

211
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:02,426
Then you're voting wrong.
- There's no such thing as voting wrong.

212
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,315
Yes, there is.
You're doing it.

213
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,275
You're making a mockery of this
whole election by voting wrong.

214
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,585
It's my vote I get to use it any way I want.

215
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,579
What's the point of having a
democracy if people go around voting wrong?

216
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:14,942
In my opinion,

217
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:17,951
democracy is doing just fine the way it is.

218
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:20,022
Well, your opinion
is wrong!

219
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:22,649
I can't believe you're
voting against your own brother.

220
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,301
Ha, just watch me.
- Dick!

221
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:27,918
You're not going
to vote for me?

222
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,025
Well, that hurts.

223
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,981
And I know

224
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:34,045
because I feel
your pain.

225
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:39,665
But Harry Solomon
is not worried...

226
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:43,924
because Harry
Solomon knows

227
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,731
that Harry Solomon
can win.

228
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,402
How can you
possibly win?

229
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,937
Because Harry
Solomon appeals

230
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:54,458
to both sides.

231
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:03,277
Vote for Harry Solomon.
- Ow!

232
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,476
Hi!
- Hey, Mrs. Dubcek. You want a button?

233
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:11,718
Yeah! I'm glad Harry is standing up

234
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:14,134
for good old-fashioned
family values.

235
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:16,481
You could learn from
this lesson, Sally.

236
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:20,028
Never date a guy if he's
not good to his wife and kids.

237
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:32,339
Don.
- Sally.

238
00:12:32,674 --> 00:12:34,622
We have to talk.

239
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,166
Your brother is playing with
matches, and that's how fires start.

240
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,690
I know my way
around a hose.

241
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,085
This election
could turn ugly,

242
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,482
very ugly.

243
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:58,448
I shouldn't be telling you
this, but I had to warn you.

244
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:01,279
You're the only thing in
my life that isn't dirty.

245
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,075
A girl can't stay clean
forever in a town like this.

246
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,267
Don't talk
like that, Sally.

247
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:09,819
You've got a great pair of
getaway sticks. Now use 'em.

248
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,164
Come on, Don.
Be straight with me.

249
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,161
You owe me
that much.

250
00:13:13,978 --> 00:13:15,632
Follow the money, Sally,

251
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,514
follow the money.

252
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:24,634
Solomon.

253
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:29,856
Gansmiller.

254
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,714
Glad you came.
- Wow.

255
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,867
That's something I don't hear very often.

256
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,309
Solomon, this election
means a lot.

257
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:44,630
What do you say
we cut a deal?

258
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:46,821
Well, what sort
of deal?

259
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:51,124
You drop out of the race,
I'll make you building inspector.

260
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,684
Why do I want to be
building inspector?

261
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,618
Because when the building
inspector looks the other way,

262
00:13:56,908 --> 00:13:58,739
he gets an envelope.

263
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:02,240
Well, what if the building
inspector doesn't look the other way?

264
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,232
He always looks
the other way.

265
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,842
Well, what's so special
the other way?

266
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:10,788
The envelope.
- Well, what's in the envelope?

267
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,131
I don't have to tell you
what's in the envelope.

268
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,883
Well you don't have to, but I
sure would appreciate it.

269
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:19,166
Look, what will it take
you to drop out of this race?

270
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:23,314
Well, don't ask me. I'm not
the one who makes the decisions.

271
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,532
You aren't?
- No, never have, never will.

272
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:28,346
I just sort of
follow orders.

273
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:32,166
Whose?
- Well, we sort of have a leader.

274
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:35,608
"We"?
- The Family.

275
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:37,172
The "Family".

276
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,243
Thank you, Solomon.

277
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:41,945
Thank you very much.

278
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:45,589
Harry Solomon?

279
00:14:45,824 --> 00:14:48,132
How much do we
really know about him?

280
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,128
He claims to be
a family man,

281
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:51,793
but what kind
of family?

282
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,106
There's no hard proof
that the Solomons are linked

283
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:57,384
to the Gambinis, the Genoveses,
and the Corleones,

284
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,242
but is that a risk
you're willing to take?

285
00:15:00,277 --> 00:15:03,530
Harry Solomon-
an offer you can refuse.

286
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:07,170
Paid for by decent, God-
fearing citizens for Gansmiller.

287
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:09,095
Don't say that.

288
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,520
We can't be in the mob,
we're from Ohio.

289
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:12,744
That's terrible.

290
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,973
Oh, Dick, Dick, Dick,
Dick, Dick, Dick, Dick.

291
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:19,369
Dick, Dick.

292
00:15:19,404 --> 00:15:22,014
You are so out of the game.
That was a gimme.

293
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,631
He mentioned my name like 20
times. That was great publicity.

294
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,261
But he's a liar.

295
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:30,609
Dick, let me talk to you
like you're a two-year-old.

296
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:33,923
You know how when you see
a commercial for Cheerios,

297
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,173
and they keep
showing you Cheerios,

298
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,089
and you really
want Cheerios...

299
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:42,448
do we have
any cheerios?

300
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,085
Right next to the
embarassing defeatios.

301
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,730
What?
- Nothing, sir.

302
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,664
I'm sorry
I'm late, sir.

303
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,063
What are you doing?
- I'm kissing your ring.

304
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,236
I'm not wearing a ring.
- I'm sorry.

305
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,904
Please don't
have me whacked.

306
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:12,065
Whacked? What kind of nonsense is this?

307
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,956
Well, sir, we just want to
pay you the proper respects.

308
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,696
We didn't know.
- Know what?

309
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,549
About your family connections, Don Solomon.

310
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:24,450
It's that stupid ad. It's
a complete and utter lie.

311
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:27,000
I would hope you people
would know better.

312
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:30,200
Good, because I've had all I can
take of this election foolishness.

313
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:32,789
Aaaaaaah!

314
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,781
This is ridiculous!

315
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:37,057
Your political system
is a sham!

316
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:39,136
It's nothing but lies
and propaganda.

317
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:40,068
Look what it's
done to you.

318
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:43,049
You can't even tell who's
good or bad or right or wrong.

319
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,544
Give me science.
At least with physics,

320
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:49,011
you know when you have the right answer.
- I never do.

321
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,909
Cannoli?

322
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:02,820
Oh, I'll be so glad
when this election is over.

323
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,922
Here. Do something with this.

324
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,374
I'm so confused. I hardly
even know what I'm doing.

325
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:13,389
You're sitting
on your cannoli.

326
00:17:13,424 --> 00:17:15,577
Look! Who did this!

327
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:17,898
Everything's
out of control!

328
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:20,562
What's wrong?
- What's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong.

329
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:22,493
I'm trying to vote
my conscience,

330
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,355
and I can't even
hear it anymore.

331
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,916
I have only two choices
for city council,

332
00:17:25,951 --> 00:17:28,608
a professional liar
and my brother, the joke.

333
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,779
Neither of them should
even be running for office.

334
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:34,366
There is no choice. My only
choice is not to vote at all.

335
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:37,729
Democracy is horrible,
absolutely horrible!

336
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,257
You're so right.

337
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:45,037
Democracy is the worst form
of government there is,

338
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:46,935
except for all
of the others...

339
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,329
and that is exactly
why you have to vote.

340
00:17:49,364 --> 00:17:52,854
No!
- Yes!

341
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,783
If you don't vote,
you can't complain.

342
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:56,715
Complaining is
all I have left.

343
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,004
The system
isn't perfect,

344
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,972
but it's important
to participate,

345
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:03,869
even if you
get it wrong.

346
00:18:03,904 --> 00:18:06,493
Just go to the polls and
do what you think is right.

347
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,131
Things were so much
simpler where I come from.

348
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,193
There's only one
big giant office,

349
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:15,621
and whoever outruns
the fireball wins.

350
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:43,577
Oh, god, I hope
I did the right thing.

351
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:51,007
And the
results for city council are in.

352
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:54,038
The incumbent, Frank
Gansmiller, is the winner.

353
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:59,685
So I would be...

354
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,217
The loser.

355
00:19:02,252 --> 00:19:04,679
Okay, okay.

356
00:19:04,714 --> 00:19:06,841
I'd like to thank you all for supporting..

357
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:08,698
all righty.

358
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,875
Harry, I want you to
know that I voted for you.

359
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,244
And to top
off this night of firsts,

360
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,978
there was also
one write-in vote

361
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:19,567
for a Dr. Mary Albright.

362
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,529
That self-serving Bitch.

363
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:34,517
I just had to come over
and say great job, kid.

364
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:36,607
It was a tough
campaign all around.

365
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,662
Glad to see no one
went negative.

366
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:42,508
Is that envelope job
still available?

367
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,191
No.

368
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:50,043
Tough luck, kiddo,

369
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:52,359
but your family's
better off.

370
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:55,118
You spend your life around
garbage, you start to stink.

371
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:57,289
I don't like the taste
of losing, Don.

372
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,170
It tastes
like a bad egg.

373
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:02,008
You know, the kind that gives you the burps.

374
00:20:03,673 --> 00:20:06,227
During this election,
I've done some things, Sally,

375
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:08,170
some things I'm
not so proud of.

376
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:09,867
Did I know better?
Sure.

377
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:12,329
But it's this...
this town,

378
00:20:12,364 --> 00:20:14,276
this crazy town.

379
00:20:14,411 --> 00:20:17,320
Makes you want
to brush your teeth.

380
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:20,191
You're in luck.
I'm packing.

381
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:26,644
So, Dr. Solomon, did you
hear someone voted for me?

382
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:29,200
Yes, I think I did
hear that somewhere.

383
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:31,904
I wonder where that vote could have come from.
- Who knows?

384
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,803
It is a secret
ballot.

385
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:36,159
It was me, Dr. Albright.
I voted for you.

386
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,980
No, you didn't!

387
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,645
How do you know?
It was a secret ballot.

388
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,701
Damn!

389
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,374
I think we should vote
for who's high commander.

390
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:54,844
Sure. We're in a democracy.
- Can we vote for ourselves?

391
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,522
Of course. I vote for me.
- I vote for me.

392
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,523
I vote for me.
- I vote for me.

393
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:59,638
High commander breaks the tie, I win.

394
00:20:59,773 --> 00:21:02,209
Wait, wait, Let's vote again.
This time I vote for Harry.

395
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:04,245
This is America, you've
got to wait four years.

396
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,062
That's not fair.
- Whoa!

397
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,117
God bless America.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
