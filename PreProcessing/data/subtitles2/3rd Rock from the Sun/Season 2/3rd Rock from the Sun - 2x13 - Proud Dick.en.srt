1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,140
Hmm. I made the front page
of the daily Badgerian again.

2
00:00:06,141 --> 00:00:07,572
What's it say?

3
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:11,296
"Physics Professor
calls Einstein "idiot"...

4
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:16,594
proclaims self
much smarter".

5
00:00:17,604 --> 00:00:19,234
Something smells divine.

6
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:22,643
It's me.  I just know
it's me.

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,264
Ooh, look at those clouds.
- That one looks like me.

8
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:32,630
So does that one.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,841
That one makes me
look fat.

10
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:38,825
That one looks
like a poodle..

11
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:41,089
a dark,
menacing poodle.

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,284
Yeah, it's wheezing
lightning.

13
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,485
I think we should go in.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,797
Harry?
You coming?

15
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,957
Yeah, just a sec.
- Don't be long.

16
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,016
Hey! That cloud looks
like a giant funnel,

17
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:57,187
with mobile homes
stuck in it.

18
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,872
Ohhh, look!
A flying cow!

19
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:09,411
Whoa!

20
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:13,351
Dick!

21
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,240
Where am I?

22
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,639
Who am I?

23
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,873
Mary! You're here.
I didn't see your car.

24
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:10,202
I have a new parking space.
- Really? Where?

25
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:12,108
There.
- Where?

26
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:15,171
There.
- Whoo!

27
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,936
What's the matter?
- It's right there.

28
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:21,388
In front of the building. I can
almost smell your little pine tree.

29
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:24,887
It's a great space, isn't it?
- I don't understand.

30
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,475
The university should
have offered it to me first.

31
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:29,053
I'm the star
of the faculty.

32
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:32,103
I'm the one whose brain
everyone wants to dissect for science.

33
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:34,533
Right, for science.

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,354
I deserve it!
- I have tenure!

35
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,815
Oh, tenure!

36
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,379
I suppose if someone sticks around
a third-rate university long enough,

37
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,801
they'd have to recognize
her lack of drive somehow.

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,477
Dick, you're overreacting.
- I'm not overreacting.

39
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:51,051
Overreacting would be going
straight to the president of the university

40
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:52,896
and telling him
exactly how I feel.

41
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:55,026
Where are you going?
- Straight to the president of the university

42
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,547
and telling him exactly how I feel!

43
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:59,378
Dick, it's a parking space!
You're acting like a child.

44
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:10,150
Sit down. Tell me what's on your mind.

45
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,879
President Dewey, a great
injustice has been committed.

46
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,431
Oh? Have I been
indicted?

47
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:18,079
Worse. I don't like
my parking space.

48
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,384
Yes, that is troublesome.

49
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:22,548
I was thinking of something
along the lines of g-34.

50
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,809
Now, that's a good spot.
I like that spot.

51
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,338
And you're a good man.
I like you.

52
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,195
What's on your mind?

53
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:30,841
Well..the space.

54
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:33,522
Oh, sorry. That's for tenured
personnel only.

55
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:35,846
Then I order you to give me
an even closer spot.

56
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,226
Dick, I'm gonna do you a favour.
- You're giving me the space?

57
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:41,501
No, I'm gonna tell you a story.
- Can't you see I'm upset?

58
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:43,988
You're right, I'm going to let
you do whatever you think is right.

59
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,798
Well, then, I..I'm going to take the space.

60
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,942
Sorry, no can do.
Cigar?

61
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:52,665
I'm warning you, either you
give me that space or I quit!

62
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:54,555
Ah, I understand.

63
00:03:54,556 --> 00:03:56,962
What space are you in now?
- X-17. Why?

64
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,801
'Cause I'm giving that to
my secretary. Bye, Dick.

65
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:07,626
All right, for starters, looks like
the storm knocked off some shingles.

66
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,483
You lose anything else?
- I don't know. Like what?

67
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,794
I'll run down the list.

68
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,427
Did you have any gutters?
- No.

69
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:14,324
Screens?
- No.

70
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,472
Antennas?
- No.

71
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:16,963
Direct satellite TV?

72
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:21,566
Yes.

73
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:24,523
Um, excuse me.

74
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:28,964
Um, is this
417 Pensdale road?

75
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:32,888
Yeah.
- Are you my wife?

76
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,835
No.
- Ah. Good.

77
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,725
Harry, you're back!

78
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,618
Oh, we were so
worried about you!

79
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:46,090
Whoa!
Are you my wife?

80
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:48,875
Yeah, right.

81
00:04:51,975 --> 00:04:54,213
Harry, we have been
looking all over for you.

82
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,325
Geez, Harry, you're a mess.
- Where have you been?

83
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:58,047
Well, I'm not sure.

84
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,640
My mind's
a complete blank.

85
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,959
So then you're fine.
- Yeah.

86
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,539
That's a relief, honey.
You go watch your stories.

87
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,941
I'll make you
some toast.

88
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,225
No sofa?
That's weird.

89
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,579
Mmm. High Commander's
log book.

90
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,537
Well, this sounds
interesting.

91
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,796
January 9th.

92
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:26,287
We have successfully
assumed human form,

93
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:28,035
and have tricked the earthlings into thinking,

94
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,068
that we are
of their species.

95
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:40,057
Oh, my god!

96
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,594
They're Aliens!

97
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,349
La la la.

98
00:05:49,134 --> 00:05:51,226
You've got to be kidding.
- Nope. I did it.

99
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:54,128
Walked off the job,
stuck it to the man,

100
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,538
told him to kiss
my hairy polenta.

101
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,778
Bye now!
- You can't be serious.

102
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:02,936
I couldn't be more serious.
Please, pass me Mr. Potato man.

103
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:07,267
Why are you doing this?
- Because it's not fair.

104
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:08,669
Well, life isn't fair.

105
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,021
Well you could remedy that Mary,
by giving me the space.

106
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:12,077
That wouldn't be fair to me.

107
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,752
Well life isn't fair, you said so yourself.

108
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,388
Let it go Dick.
- Fine!

109
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,899
Uh, that's
university property.

110
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,733
Well they should have thought of
that before giving away my parking space.

111
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:25,900
Well what are you gonna do now?
- Oh don't worry about me.

112
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:30,042
I give Dewey about 10 minutes
before he comes crawling back to me.

113
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,231
Nina, can you help me
with the water cooler?

114
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:54,914
Dick. Dick!

115
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,378
You have been sitting there for 10 days.

116
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:00,285
For the last time, the
university's not gonna call.

117
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,446
Oh, they'll call.

118
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:05,073
They'll call.
And when they do,

119
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:08,666
this phone is gonna
really, really ring.

120
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,486
I just wonder whether it's worth
getting all meshuga over a parking space.

121
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,055
Dick, I hate to interrupt
the creep-fest,

122
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:19,495
but would you stop thinking of yourself
for a minute and think of the mission?

123
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:22,211
Oh, my god,
they're on a mission.

124
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:24,106
I am the mission!

125
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:27,751
We came to this pitiful planet
to experience the human condition,

126
00:07:27,752 --> 00:07:30,460
but from all that I can
ascertain, the human condition requires

127
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:34,612
nothing more than complete and
utter solipsistic self-absorption!

128
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:37,384
And you can include that in your
next transmission to the you-know-who.

129
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:38,647
Uh, who?

130
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,347
The big, giant head!
Haven't you been listening?

131
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:46,600
Oh, the big,
giant, head...

132
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:54,958
Thank you for
seeing me, father, I..

133
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,511
didn't know
where else to turn.

134
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:59,064
Well, that's...

135
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:01,520
why they pay me
the big bucks, you know?

136
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,988
Father, if someone..

137
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:08,588
say, a family member..
had helped you,

138
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,539
cared for you,
given you shelter.

139
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,688
And you knew something
terrible about them,

140
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:15,610
it'd be okay to turn them
over to the authorities

141
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,414
for dissection,
wouldn't it?

142
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:25,784
Are they dangerous?
- Yes, No, I don't know!

143
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:29,766
I'm so alone
and confused!

144
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,477
You are not alone.

145
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,954
There's someone up there who's
watching over everything you do...

146
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:39,728
at all times.

147
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,221
There is?
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:45,639
Is this person called
"the big, giant head"?

149
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:50,703
He goes by many names.
- And you know him?

150
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,521
Know him? I work for him.

151
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,369
I see.

152
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,289
Well, thank you for your time.
- That's fine.

153
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,729
Oh, my god!

154
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,177
They're everywhere!

155
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,067
We're out of cereal.

156
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,508
We're out of milk.

157
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,045
We're out of money.

158
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:29,455
No milk? What am I gonna use in my coffee?

159
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,918
No problem.
We're out of coffee too.

160
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,628
Harry keeps drinking it. It's
like he's afraid to go to sleep.

161
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:38,369
Harry?
Harry, come in here.

162
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:42,058
Are you feeling all right?
- Yeah, oh yeah, fine, I'm fine.

163
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,405
When I'm fine, I'm fine.
How are you? 'Cause I'm fine.

164
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:49,503
Tommy, go tuck Harry in bed.
See that he gets some sleep.

165
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,072
No! no no.

166
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,014
No, I'm fine.

167
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:59,769
Well, I guess this has been
kind of tough on all of us.

168
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,627
Dick, why don't you just
apologise and get your job back?

169
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,452
Apologise?
Should the Venus De Milo

170
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,584
apologise to the thug
who broke its arms off? No!

171
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,120
Should the sphinx apologise
to the desert winds

172
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,343
for eroding its nose?
No!

173
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,402
Should Jim Carey
apologise to America

174
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:16,840
for the cable guy?

175
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,779
Perhaps.

176
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,044
No, I'm not gonna apologise.
I can play their waiting game.

177
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,775
Yeah, well, if you want to play the
eating game, you've got to do something.

178
00:10:31,776 --> 00:10:34,606
Oh, I plan to. I'm
gonna get myself a new job,

179
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,182
a job worthy of me!

180
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,384
Oh, really?
And where would that be?

181
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:40,542
In America,
land of opportunity!

182
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,381
Welcome to Rusty's.
How may I serve you?

183
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:49,114
How do you make your burgers?
- Excellent question.

184
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,612
First a clamp comes down
onto the cow's head,

185
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:53,734
forcing it onto
a conveyor belt,

186
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:56,525
where a prod is inserted
into the cow's rectum,

187
00:10:56,526 --> 00:10:57,849
electrocuting it.

188
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,484
Give me two.
- Thank you.

189
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,631
And remember,
at Rusty's,

190
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:06,732
E. Coli is not
on the menu.

191
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,151
Stop saying that!

192
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:12,435
Welcome to Rusty's.
- Rusty burger and a monster fries.

193
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:16,056
Very well.
- Solomon,

194
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:19,302
you're supposed to ask him if he
wants a fried apple pie with that.

195
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,276
But Dougy, I can't.
I mean, just look at him.

196
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:24,187
The rusty burger alone is
enough to give him a coronary.

197
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,798
The fried pie will be
the death blow!

198
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:30,353
Look, I didn't go to hamburger
college to take crap from you.

199
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,816
Hamburger college.

200
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,244
They're not by chance looking
for a physics professor, are they?

201
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,780
It's a hamburger school!

202
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,798
Once again, I find
myself at the mercy

203
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,253
of someone I wouldn't
let pick my nose.

204
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:47,020
I'm the most qualified. I'm the
smartest. I should be running Rusty's!

205
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,192
That's it.
You're off register.

206
00:11:49,193 --> 00:11:51,220
Report immediately
to the drive-thru window.

207
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,770
Demoted?
Dougy, no!

208
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,159
Well, I don't know if I could
come back to the university.

209
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,304
No.
Well, I am deeply hurt.

210
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:09,929
I don't care how much you
beg. I am not coming back.

211
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,761
No. No.

212
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,405
Well, to be honest,
I'm entertaining

213
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:18,999
some very interesting offers
even as we speak.

214
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:24,594
Well, you'd better get going, Dick. You
know how Dougy hates it when you're late.

215
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:27,175
I'll go, as soon
as I find my hat.

216
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,930
Uh, you're wearing
your hat.

217
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,655
Don't... be
ridiculous.

218
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:34,033
Don't you think I'd know if
I were wearing my own hat?

219
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,541
Ah!
There it is.

220
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,325
Yes, operator,

221
00:12:38,626 --> 00:12:40,941
you have to listen
very carefully.

222
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:44,792
I'm at 417 Pensdale road,

223
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:48,037
and I'm surrounded
by aliens.

224
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,536
I need to talk to the
president of the United States.

225
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:58,088
Yeah, I know I need help.
That's why I'm calling, Hallo?

226
00:12:58,774 --> 00:12:59,782
Hello?

227
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:01,951
Hello?

228
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:07,496
They've gotten to
the phone company too.

229
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:16,310
Thank you for making
Rusty's a part of your day.

230
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:26,186
Hello, Bug, Pitman.

231
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,598
Welcome to Rusty's.
How may I serve you?

232
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,475
We're not hungry Dr Solomon.

233
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,467
We just wanted to come in
and see if you were really

234
00:13:32,468 --> 00:13:35,049
flippin' patties in the
hamburger freak-out ward.

235
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,252
You insolent little twerps! I should..

236
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:40,556
Well, what do we have here?
A customer satisfaction card.

237
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,346
"Rate the performance
of your server".

238
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,370
"F".

239
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:50,008
Thank you for making
Rusty's a part of your day.

240
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,527
So this is where the great minds of
Rutherford go

241
00:13:58,528 --> 00:13:59,948
when they're feeling underappreciated?

242
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,815
Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Dick.

243
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:03,870
I see they've got you back
behind the register.

244
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:07,142
No, I'm just covering for
Maurice.. he's out back having a smoke.

245
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:11,566
A man of your brilliance
quitting his job,

246
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:13,701
over a stupid
parking space!

247
00:14:13,702 --> 00:14:15,945
If it's so stupid, why don't you give it to me?
- Never.

248
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,638
Ah-ha! So you admit it's important.
- I admit nothing.

249
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,291
Give me a rusty dog,
no onions.

250
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,149
Would you like
a fried pie with that?

251
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,285
Yes.
- No, Mary, don't do it!

252
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,182
Give me the pie.

253
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,774
Mary, you have your
whole life ahead of you!

254
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:37,363
Oh, Dick, why are you doing this to
yourself? Can't you just come back?

255
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:39,947
No, Mary.
I have my pride!

256
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:45,627
So you're working
at Rusty's.

257
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:49,564
Yes, they have some wonderful
opportunities for advancement here.

258
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:52,818
Did you know that the fry man who used
to work here is now a multimillionaire?

259
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,881
What happened?

260
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:56,926
He lost his arm in the patty
press and got a great lawyer.

261
00:15:00,006 --> 00:15:03,799
All right, gentlemen,
prepare yourself for a fancy feast.

262
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,494
Fancy feast? Can we afford that?
- Yes, we can.

263
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,185
Before I was shopping
today, I found this aisle in the back

264
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,257
that had these
unbelievable savings..

265
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:14,998
tuna, liver, and new seafood
blend for you finicky types.

266
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:19,477
Wait a minute.
You're feeding us cat?

267
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:22,123
It's not cat, Tommy,
it's salmon.

268
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:24,008
There's just a picture
of a cat on the label.

269
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:27,749
The best part is, next to the food
they had these adorable little gifts.

270
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,163
Look.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

271
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,442
I've never been happier
in my life!

272
00:15:36,743 --> 00:15:39,779
I was playing with it today, and it
got stuck behind the refrigerator,

273
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,429
and I went nuts
trying to get it!

274
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:53,077
Hello? Hel...

275
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,745
I've been awake
for 16 days.

276
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,896
That must be
a record.

277
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,517
So, I've got to know,

278
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:07,152
are you one of them?

279
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,703
I'm just going to step
out of this closet now.

280
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,108
If you are who
you say you are,

281
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,368
then who won the world series in 1956?

282
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:20,351
Who? Who?

283
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,265
I don't know!
- I don't know either!

284
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:29,219
Ha!

285
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:34,004
Oh, I see what it's come to.
You're too good for a Rusty's man.

286
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:39,141
Dick, it's not what
you think it is.

287
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,196
I'm not sure
what it was.

288
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,802
I only came by to tell you
that I spoke with President Dewey,

289
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:48,979
and he's willing to meet with you.
- Never! I have my pride.

290
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:51,230
All right.
All right, keep your pride.

291
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:53,422
Suffer all you want.
But what about your family?

292
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:54,870
There's nothing wrong with my family.

293
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:57,157
Your son is eating cat food!

294
00:16:59,678 --> 00:17:01,177
Cat food?

295
00:17:10,311 --> 00:17:11,451
Maybe you're right.

296
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:14,041
I'm beginning to wonder
if I was rash,

297
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,059
quitting my job
over a parking space.

298
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,525
Stop wondering.

299
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:21,095
I can't help thinking
that it was my pride

300
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,838
that clouded
my judgment.

301
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,678
Stop thinking.
It did.

302
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:28,308
Was it folly or sheer
idiocy that led to my downfall?

303
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:29,350
Folly.
- Idiocy.

304
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:31,194
No, I change my vote
to "idiocy".

305
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,310
Hello, President Dewey.
- Hello, Mary.

306
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,150
Dr. Solomon and I..
Dick!

307
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:44,933
Hello, President Dewey.

308
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:47,290
And thank you, Dr.
Albright, for announcing me.

309
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:51,519
I believe you have
something to say to President Dewey.

310
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,603
I would like to discuss the terms
under which I will return to Pendleton.

311
00:17:55,804 --> 00:17:59,091
He wants to drop the parking thing.
- That's good to hear.

312
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:01,632
And in return, you will
admit that you were wrong,

313
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,109
and that this university
was falling apart without me.

314
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,957
Or not.
- We're getting along very well without you.

315
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,145
Thank you and good-bye.

316
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,270
On no, but President Dewey, Dr. Solomon is aware
of how pathetic he's been over the..

317
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:17,000
Mary.. Mary, Mary, Mary,
Mary. This is beneath you

318
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,250
Why don't you wait outside,

319
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:21,612
and I'll settle this
on my own terms, all right?

320
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:24,865
Please!

321
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:27,883
Please take me back!

322
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:30,235
Sorry, can't do it.
- Please! Please!

323
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,461
I'll do anything!
Just name it!

324
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:35,197
You can apologise.
- You want me to apologise?

325
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:38,896
Yes.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

326
00:18:39,197 --> 00:18:41,320
That's fine, you can
begin tomorrow.

327
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,902
In my new
parking spot?

328
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,053
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

329
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,328
So, Dick, any problems
getting your job back?

330
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:58,812
Are you kidding?
He begged me.

331
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,696
Well, he didn't
"Beg", beg,

332
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:04,331
but it was
clear enough.

333
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,212
I take it you didn't get the space either.

334
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,579
Not the "Space"
space.

335
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,528
But you know, I learned something very important.
- What?

336
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,397
That even if you're the
high commander and brilliant,

337
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,631
there's still time
for a little humility.

338
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:20,125
Thankfully, that time
is now over.

339
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,526
Ah, dinner!

340
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,939
Let's eat, Harry.

341
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,835
Oh, did you just say,
"let's eat Harry"?

342
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:32,114
Yeah, we're hungry,
so it's time to eat, Harry.

343
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:33,861
"Eat Harry".

344
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,830
I see.

345
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:39,110
Could I just have
a moment, please?

346
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:40,565
Whatever.

347
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,788
Would you hurry it up?
I'm starving.

348
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:52,152
Whoa!

349
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:54,360
That was a close one.

350
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:11,865
Mmm, my favourite!

351
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,819
Meat loaf deluxe-O.

352
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,851
Well, Harry,
we haven't had that

353
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:18,693
since Dick quit his job
three weeks ago.

354
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,397
Dick quit his job?

355
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,374
Yeah, why do you think
he was working at Rusty's?

356
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,172
Dick was working
at Rusty's?

357
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,133
Geez, Harry, don't you know anything?

358
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:30,924
No.
All I know is,

359
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,998
I got a transmitter in my head,

360
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,993
and Charlie's angels
is on weeknights at 7:00.

361
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:40,458
Oh, my god!
It's 7:00 now!

362
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:51,279
Mmm, thanks for
the ride this morning.

363
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,822
Oh, I couldn't let you walk. It's pouring.

364
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:01,496
How's your new parking spot?
- Awful!

365
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:04,525
My house is closer. Dewey
is gonna hear about this.

366
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:05,989
And after that,
for lunch,

367
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,155
I'll have a rusty burger
with fries.

368
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:12,817
Actually, it's not
so bad.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
