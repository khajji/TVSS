1
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:05,155
I have got..

2
00:00:05,156 --> 00:00:07,696
the perfect
present for you.

3
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:10,565
A present? What for?
- Christmas.

4
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:15,334
What, you didn't
get me anything?

5
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:19,140
No, are you kidding? No.

6
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:22,011
Not get you anything, of course
I got you something. I, uh...

7
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:24,780
I got you the perfect
something, it's perfect,

8
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,556
and it's, uh,
it's really something.

9
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:29,886
You're so sweet.

10
00:00:35,412 --> 00:00:37,437
All right,
we are wired.

11
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,923
Can I plug it in? Can I plug it in?
- Knock yourself out.

12
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,584
It's magnificent!
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

13
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,146
By the time I'm through
with this joint,

14
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,662
they're gonna be able to
see it from the shuttle.

15
00:00:52,116 --> 00:00:53,062
Tommy!

16
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:58,982
Look what I got.
- A stick?

17
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:00,648
No!

18
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:03,288
It's a Christmas tree!

19
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:06,432
You'll see. All it needs is a little love.

20
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,702
Dick! Dick!

21
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:11,703
Dick you are not gonna believe
what we got at the mall. - A stick?

22
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:15,076
It's a Christmas tree!

23
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:18,240
That thing?
We are Solomons Harry.

24
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,864
We should have the biggest,
noblest tree in all of Ohio.

25
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:23,901
Forget the stick, Dick.
We found jobs.

26
00:01:24,775 --> 00:01:27,629
The mall is full of them..
Christmas jobs.

27
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,018
You are lookin' at a
professional gift-wrapper.

28
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:34,468
And I am the executive
assistant to Mr. Santa Claus.

29
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,534
I've heard of him. He's the muckedy-
muck in charge of the whole shebang.

30
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:41,146
Yeah, well, I'm kind of
his right-hand elf.

31
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:44,126
This is wonderful.
It's a celebration.

32
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:45,925
Tommy, when did we
first land on this planet?

33
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:48,604
January 9th. It was a Tuesday,
exactly 8:30 P.M.

34
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:49,944
7:30 central.

35
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:54,982
Do you realize we're
coming up on our anniversary?

36
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:58,976
An earth year on earth, and
everything is finally coming together.

37
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:01,597
It's as if all of the
earth were throwing us a party.

38
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:04,069
Suddenly I feel
so... so...

39
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:05,838
human.

40
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,763
Same here. - Me too.
- I'm feeling kinda human here myself.

41
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:10,946
Oh guys.

42
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:14,376
"Snap"!

43
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,435
Oh great...now it's a stick.

44
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:04,973
Weeds.

45
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,867
Okay, Dick, it's time
to pick your secret Santa.

46
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,383
It's time to who
for wha-wha?

47
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:13,106
Pick a name,
that's who you buy a present for.

48
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:14,655
Presents? for Christmas?

49
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:16,728
The bowl is heavy.

50
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,088
Let's see who this is.

51
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,530
Let's play
secret Santa.

52
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:26,490
Dr. Anthony?
I barely know him.

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,100
Glansberg, Chilton,
lanell

54
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:35,567
Dick, you don't get to
choose your person. It's random.

55
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:38,046
You pick one name, and
it's a secret until the party.

56
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:39,233
Ohhh.

57
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,472
Well I picked
my name,

58
00:03:58,264 --> 00:04:01,595
and whoever it is
hasn't the foggiest idea.

59
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:05,277
For now until the party,
their life will be a

60
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,625
topsy-turvy
labyrinth of mystery,

61
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:09,436
and intrigue.

62
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:14,554
For the love of god,
let him draw again.

63
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:23,501
Well, hello-ho-ho,
everybody,

64
00:04:23,502 --> 00:04:26,161
and welcome to
Santa's toyland.

65
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:29,044
Presents, toys and fun
for children one to ninety one.

66
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:35,438
Oh, uh, please note that children
sixteen to ninety one,

67
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,247
should not sit
on Santa's lap.

68
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:39,639
Damn!

69
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:44,922
Thank you, and have
a happy and safe holiday,

70
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:47,787
from all of us here
at the Rutherford galleria.

71
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,694
Wow, you've been
shopping your butt off.

72
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:53,910
Yeah.
It's Christmas, right?

73
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:56,598
Oh, it's great, isn't it?
People buying stuff,

74
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:59,954
lugging bags around,
maxing out their credit cards.

75
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:02,354
It's like everyone in the
whole world is joined together

76
00:05:02,355 --> 00:05:04,464
to embrace
financial ruin.

77
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:08,758
Merry Christmas.
- Thank you,

78
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,013
and have a happy and safe
holiday from all of us here

79
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:13,071
at the Rutherford
galleria!

80
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:16,984
Merry Christmas.

81
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,407
Merry Christmas.

82
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,341
Merry Christmas.

83
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,813
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

84
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:36,169
Merry Christmas.

85
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,218
She's coin-operated.

86
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:42,316
She says she has
the perfect gift for me,

87
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,434
and I have no idea
what to get her.

88
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:46,587
Her name is
August Lefler.

89
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,996
Well, I don't
know August..

90
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:52,909
well, aren't you supposed to
have some kind of list or something?

91
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:58,642
Well, I'm afraid I left my
list up in the north pole.

92
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:01,579
Oh, great! Can't you have your
wife fax it to you or something?

93
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,459
I can't screw this up!

94
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:06,479
Well, Tommy..

95
00:06:07,187 --> 00:06:08,124
look,

96
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,534
you want to make
this August chick happy,

97
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:14,652
you're gonna have to drop some cold,
hard cash, you know what I'm Sayin'?

98
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:19,227
On what? Listen, pork butt,
I need model numbers here.

99
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,424
Get a haircut.
You look like a girl.

100
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:32,488
What again?

101
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,019
The root must be
somewhere upstairs.

102
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,933
Ooh, is that the gift
you got for Judith?

103
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,859
Or... whoever it was
you happened to pick?

104
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:46,826
Yes.
- There's a $20 limit.

105
00:06:46,827 --> 00:06:48,473
I know.
I went a little over.

106
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,455
A hundred and twenty
dollars over.

107
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:54,197
It's easy to get
carried away, isn't it?

108
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:56,923
You know, a few years ago,
I made a batch

109
00:06:56,924 --> 00:07:00,014
of my famous rum balls
for Christmas.

110
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:03,332
They were so popular that
this year, just on a whim,

111
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,967
I made 20 batches, enough
for the whole department.

112
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,722
Mmm. It's funny that you
would have that much rum around.

113
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,641
It's the holidays, Nina.
- Yes, Nina, it's the holidays.

114
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,003
My dad would go out and get the
biggest Christmas tree he could find.

115
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:22,777
We'd go caroling, open our house
to the neighborhood.

116
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,201
All that sharing
and generosity..

117
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,191
It's so beautiful.

118
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,766
Look how generous I am.

119
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,918
I am Christmas!

120
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,038
Hello, and happy holidays from all of us here..
- Where's my package?

121
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,680
I'm supposed to say the whole
thing. Hello, and happy holidays..

122
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:44,734
Excuse me. I was.. I was.. I was here first.

123
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:46,867
Excuse me.
I'm just picking up.

124
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:50,070
Wo wo wo, come on, people. You're
supposed to be happy. This is shopping.

125
00:07:50,612 --> 00:07:53,603
Yeah, well, I'm fed up.
Where the hell's January already?

126
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:57,922
What is wrong
with you people?

127
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,912
This isn't about
buying gifts at all.

128
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:04,593
This is about viciousness and
ruthlessness and aggression, and...

129
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,634
usually I like
all those things, but...

130
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,307
but now, it's just
really ruining Christmas.

131
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:16,727
Just wrap!

132
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,388
awww.

133
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,524
Oh, don't worry,
boys and girls.

134
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,223
Santa will be
right back

135
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:30,455
after he takes care
of some personal business.

136
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,756
On the toilet.

137
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:42,278
Oh, what are they feeding
these kids? They weigh a ton!

138
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:45,908
Well, you know, I think part of the
problem is we're feeding 'em candy.

139
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:49,414
Maybe if we could give
them celery or some kinda...

140
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:53,284
Oh... Santa.

141
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,565
What are you..I mean..

142
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:59,460
it's.. you..

143
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,703
Noooo!

144
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:09,289
"Oh Tannenbaum, Oh Tannenbaum..

145
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,064
..that's "Christmas tree"
in German"

146
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,674
Now this is a Christmas tree.

147
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:17,072
Hey, hey, buddy, can I help you?

148
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:20,523
Merry Christmas.

149
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:30,145
Merry Christmas, officer!

150
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,437
"Peace on earth, goodwill
toward men".. what a crock!

151
00:09:39,641 --> 00:09:40,987
Nine hundred dollars
in fines,

152
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:43,074
and they confiscated
your chain saw?

153
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:45,708
And have you ever
felt a taser?

154
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,182
It's not nearly as much fun as it looks.

155
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,285
What a bunch
of hypocrites!

156
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:58,776
Apparently, the
Christmas spirit doesn't apply

157
00:09:58,777 --> 00:10:01,640
when you're trespassing and vandalising.

158
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:06,339
Oh, let's face it,
Christmas is a sham.

159
00:10:06,545 --> 00:10:08,700
How can humans take
something like shopping,

160
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,458
something pure
and natural and good,

161
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,613
and turn it into
something so ugly?

162
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,815
This is not a holiday,
this is torture.

163
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,239
They know exactly what they
want, but they won't tell you.

164
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,141
No-o...they make you guess.

165
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:22,735
This is just
so "Earth".

166
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:26,365
Humans.. I don't want to play
any of their reindeer games.

167
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,494
"fa, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la"

168
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,965
'tis the season to be jolly...

169
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,356
Oh, listen to them.

170
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:37,436
Singing like idiots. Why did we
want to be like humans anyway?

171
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,649
That's better.

172
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,260
And so we see that
that B equals,

173
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:05,211
2a over delta,

174
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:09,613
which equals k times mass over 2 pi delta,

175
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:10,659
and therefore..

176
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:12,808
Leon?

177
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:16,552
What are you passing around?
- Oh, Caryn made them.

178
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:19,363
Yeah, they're Christmas cookies.
- Oh, how christmasy.

179
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:22,373
All sparkly,
red and green.

180
00:11:22,912 --> 00:11:25,618
Oh, look.
One of Santa's reindeer.

181
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,322
Watch him fly.

182
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,669
And look,
a little Christmas bell.

183
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,135
"Ding, dong"

184
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:35,289
I don't even know
what this is.

185
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,025
It was a snowman.

186
00:11:39,652 --> 00:11:42,093
No, it was butter
and sugar and sprinkles,

187
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:45,451
all wrapped up in empty
sentiment and holiday hypocrisy.

188
00:11:47,926 --> 00:11:50,609
Ho! Ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho, ho, ho!

189
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,182
Where do you think you're going?
- It's Christmas break.

190
00:11:53,183 --> 00:11:55,854
It is not "Christmas break" until I say it is.

191
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:59,323
Not until you've completed the
following remedial assignment.

192
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,950
You will write
a 15-page dissertation

193
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:05,125
on wave physics and its
relation to electromagnetic radiation.

194
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:07,902
Oh, and a five-point bonus
if you can tell me

195
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:11,030
how the hell Santa delivers
all those toys in one night.

196
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:16,266
It's to be typewritten and on
my desk no later than 6:00.

197
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,850
Tonight?
- But it's December 23rd.

198
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,700
Yeah, it's
Christmas eve eve.

199
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:23,801
Ohh, it is?

200
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:25,426
Well, tough tinsel.

201
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:32,181
Thank you and have a happy, safe holiday
from all of us here at the Rutherford galleria.

202
00:12:34,404 --> 00:12:35,565
Bye-bye, now.

203
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:40,757
Hey, Tommy.
- I finally found something for August.

204
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:42,912
Oh, perfume. Is this what she wants?
- I don't know.

205
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:45,235
So I also got her a portable Cd player.
- Oh, she likes CDs.

206
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,955
I don't know. So I got
her earrings...

207
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:49,476
oh, yeah, and a cellular phone
and a belt.

208
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,381
How did you afford
all this stuff?

209
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:53,658
You know that jar of pennies I have in my room?
- Yeah.

210
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,213
It's where I hide
Dick's credit card.

211
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:04,482
Bartender,
two fingers, no fat.

212
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,358
I believed in him.

213
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,649
I thought we were
bringing joy to the world.

214
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:13,126
I was gonna move
to the north pole

215
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,588
to work in his
toy factory.

216
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:21,337
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

217
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,472
You got a lot of guts
coming in here, fat boy.

218
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:28,072
Do I know you?

219
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:31,890
Oh, don't get cute
with me, Kringle.

220
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:34,667
If that is
your real name.

221
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,336
Hey, what's
your problem?

222
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,793
You're my problem!

223
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:40,659
So what are you
gonna do?

224
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,633
Get one of your reindeer
to kick me to death?

225
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:46,306
Hey, take it easy, take it easy.
- Oh, mind your..

226
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:49,223
Whoa!
Wait a second.

227
00:13:49,224 --> 00:13:51,614
But you.. he..

228
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:53,119
Is there a problem?

229
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,002
Jingle bell,
jingle bell jingle bell rock...

230
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:07,904
you know, this is the only
time of year I like white music.

231
00:14:11,273 --> 00:14:12,721
What do you think, Nina?

232
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,947
Mmm.
Too much egg

233
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:17,543
Needs more Nog?
- Yep.

234
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,835
Mmm, that is
good!

235
00:14:26,774 --> 00:14:29,229
Rum ball?
- Oh, spare me.

236
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:32,833
You better be nice to me if
you want your stocking stuffed.

237
00:14:37,098 --> 00:14:37,974
Hey!

238
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:40,760
There will be no holiday cheer,
Nina, while there's work to be done.

239
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:43,229
Work? On Christmas eve eve?

240
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,752
I'll need all the grades for my 10:00 class

241
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,846
broken down and re-
tabulated for the whole semester.

242
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:50,460
On Christmas eve eve?
- Yes.

243
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,432
Dick, we need somebody tall
to hang the boughs of holly.

244
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,036
Fa, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, no.

245
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:02,870
I guess I'd like the plaid..
- We're out of everything

246
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,359
but green foil
and happy snowmen.

247
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:09,122
Well, it's for my mom, so..
- You got your mom a dust miser?

248
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:12,919
How nice.. the gift
that keeps on sucking.

249
00:15:15,393 --> 00:15:18,487
I just didn't know what to get her.
- Yeah, apparently not.

250
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:21,484
Wait a second.
Where was that.. here you go.

251
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,757
A foot massager. The woman
needs a break, for crying out loud.

252
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:27,170
Gosh, thanks.
- You're welcome.

253
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:29,738
Hey, that's my foot massager.
- Oh, poor baby.

254
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,735
Who's it for?
- My wife.

255
00:15:31,736 --> 00:15:34,761
Wow, real romantic.
Here, wait a second.

256
00:15:34,762 --> 00:15:37,883
Ah! Some exotic
bath oils.

257
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:40,183
You can turn your wife
into a slip 'n' slide. - Thanks.

258
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,838
That.. that was for my boyfriend.

259
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,216
Unless you have
a better idea.

260
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,780
As a matter of fact,
I do. Here.

261
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,181
International beer basket
from the liquor locker.

262
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:55,080
Oh, yeah! Thank you.
- You're welcome.

263
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,170
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

264
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:58,910
This is fun.

265
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:02,239
Hey, uh, diamond tennis
bracelet. Who wants one?

266
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:11,345
All this laughing,

267
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,104
opening their
little presents..

268
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,186
who needs Christmas
anyway?

269
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,491
I say, "bug Humbar".

270
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:22,819
You mean,
"bah, humbug".

271
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:25,824
Bah" what?
- You said, "bug Humbar".

272
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,497
And?
- Well, what does "bug Humbar" mean?

273
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,297
Well, what does "bah, humbug" mean?
- Forget it.

274
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,400
Here,
Merry Christmas.

275
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,336
You bought me a gift?
- Yeah.

276
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,041
So you were my secret Santa?

277
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:45,737
I was not your secret Santa.

278
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,533
I just happen to love
Christmas. Now, open your damn present!

279
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,090
Well, what is it?
- It's a travel mug.

280
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:58,098
What's it for?

281
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:02,077
So you don't spill coffee
in your lap every morning.

282
00:17:03,795 --> 00:17:04,332
You noticed?

283
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:10,033
Uh, yeah.

284
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:13,328
I need this.
- You're welcome.

285
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:16,428
Nina...

286
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:20,017
forget the work.
Go to the party.

287
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,630
Are you sure?
- Yes. Have a good time.

288
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:27,257
And Nina,

289
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,693
M..merry Christmas.

290
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,212
Merry Christmas,
Dr. Solomon.

291
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:45,523
Where are those rum
dreidels I made for Dr. Schwartz?

292
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:49,078
Mary, look what
Nina gave me!

293
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,416
I'm not talking to you.
You're ruining my Christmas.

294
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,308
No, no, that was the old Dick. I
think I've actually got the spirit.

295
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,310
I want to be a part
of Christmas now.

296
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:59,090
Well, pah, dum,
a, dum, pum.

297
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,652
Here you go, Dr. Solomon.
- Dr. Solomon.

298
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,294
Your papers?
- Sorry we're late. Don't take points off.

299
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:12,587
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
- What are you doing? We worked on those!

300
00:18:12,588 --> 00:18:14,992
And in the spirit of Christmas
, I'm not even gonna read them.

301
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm gonna give you
all Cs!

302
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:18,629
"Cs"?
- Yes!

303
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,110
Oh, what the hell,
it's Christmas. C-pluses!

304
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,382
Go, go, all of you,

305
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,593
trim your stockings
and stuff your trees!

306
00:18:26,594 --> 00:18:28,735
Merry Christmas!

307
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,695
God bless us,
every one.

308
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:34,872
Judith! Judith!

309
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:39,001
Judith, come in here!
Judith, I'm your secret Santa.

310
00:18:39,002 --> 00:18:40,502
Get out.

311
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:44,664
Here. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

312
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,304
And happy new year.
- Same to you.

313
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,575
May your holiday be
filled with lords a-leaping,

314
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:50,451
ladies dancing,
pipers piping,

315
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:52,385
drummers drumming,
geese a-laying,

316
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:53,849
swans a-swimming.
- That will do.

317
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,927
Five golden rings!

318
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:02,145
I know I've had
a lot of rum balls,

319
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,055
but that was
really sweet.

320
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,848
It's just wonderful.

321
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:09,565
I thought Christmas was all
about stress and hostility

322
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,353
and handcuffs
and Miranda rights.

323
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:14,416
But no, it's more.
It's so much more!

324
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:16,000
It's about giving
and sharing

325
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:18,524
and just...
being human.

326
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,857
Come on, the party's
still going on,

327
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:24,382
and I've saved a special dance for you.

328
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:26,684
Ohh.

329
00:19:26,685 --> 00:19:28,550
That weed
grew back again.

330
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:31,581
It's mistletoe.
- Mistletoe?

331
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:33,092
Yeah.
- Well, what's it for?

332
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:34,247
I'll show you.

333
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:40,136
Merry Christmas.
- Oh, merry Christmas to you.

334
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,147
But what's
the mistletoe for?

335
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,070
Dick!

336
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,187
Ohh.

337
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,268
Ah, well I don't know
how the real Santa's

338
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:07,249
gonna slide down
this thing,

339
00:20:08,732 --> 00:20:09,749
but he will.

340
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,289
Ah, what a lovely way to mark
our first anniversary on earth,

341
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,509
our first anniversary
as humans.

342
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,737
Do you think we'll ever really
know everything there is to know

343
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:18,963
about being human?

344
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:50,032
Merry Christmas, Tommy.

345
00:20:54,092 --> 00:20:55,020
This?

346
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,418
I made it myself.
It's the two of us. See?

347
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:02,198
What I got for you

348
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,869
is so much better
than this!

349
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,430
I mean, it is a joke
how much better

350
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,900
my stuff is
than this!

351
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:12,752
Which I love.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
