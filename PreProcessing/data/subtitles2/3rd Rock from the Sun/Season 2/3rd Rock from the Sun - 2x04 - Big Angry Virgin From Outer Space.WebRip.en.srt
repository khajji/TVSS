1
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:04,513
You know, Mr. Randell,

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:08,002
we've only been out on six dates, but
already I feel comfortable with you.

3
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:10,276
You make me feel
so feminine,

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:13,773
which is ironic 'cause I
could snap your neck like a twig.

5
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:17,392
Thanks.

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:19,929
Oh, Mr. Randell.

7
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,647
Sally, do you want to
go back to my apartment?

8
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:35,725
Oh, I know what's
going to happen there,

9
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:40,345
We'll continue to kiss
and touch and kiss and touch

10
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:42,202
just like the movies, and
all of a sudden the scene ends,

11
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:44,734
and we're in the park
eating hot dogs and laughing.

12
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:50,731
That's such a Sally thing to say.

13
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:53,279
You're never
what I expect.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,305
Yeah, like that time you
didn't have to pay for dinner

15
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,518
'cause I got us thrown
out of the sizzler.

16
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,920
Like that, yeah.
- But that's what you like about me, right?

17
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:05,921
Right, right, right, right, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

18
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,757
But now it's
starting to, um...

19
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:08,748
I don't know..

20
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:10,494
irritate me.

21
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,689
I'm not the perfect woman?

22
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,862
This close, really.

23
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,327
Just a couple, three,
four things you could change.

24
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:25,059
Maybe let me be in control
sometimes, just a little.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,722
Well, you're going
to see a whole new me.

26
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,374
God, I hate that.

27
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,265
It's gone.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,906
Oh... I should have
let you do that.

29
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:47,969
Whoopsy doodle.

30
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:23,240
Good-bye, basket
of kittens.

31
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:25,964
I can only pray that
next month's photo

32
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:28,669
will bring us a fraction
of the joy and whimsy...

33
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,534
...that you did.

34
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,911
Thank you,
bank of Rutherford.

35
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:44,447
What? That's a monkey playing golf.

36
00:02:44,448 --> 00:02:46,587
I know, but he's
putting with a driver.

37
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,889
You never see
yourself clearly

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,358
until you see yourself
through your lover's eyes.

39
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,379
I am red freakin' hot!

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,927
Good for you.

41
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,541
And I'm a loud, destructive,
irritating pain in the butt.

42
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,904
Mr. Randell's not crazy
about me anymore, Dick.

43
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:07,750
Sally, don't tell me you're
failing at your relationship.

44
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,369
How could you?

45
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,178
I don't know.

46
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:12,202
I thought I had this
whole woman thing aced.

47
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:14,388
My performance has been
technically flawless.

48
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,564
He wants me
to change.

49
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,267
Well Sally, here on earth,
humans change for their lovers.

50
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:23,175
August and I always
accommodate each other's wants and needs.

51
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:25,159
For example, I stopped
wearing old spice,

52
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,602
and she's stopped telling
me to stop wearing old spice.

53
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:32,900
Oh...don't compare
my mature relationships

54
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:34,801
to your little
"tigerbeat" tryst.

55
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:36,519
Yeah, she's right.

56
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:39,425
Tommy, adults have far more
complicated problems.

57
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:42,612
Although, come to think of it,
Dr. Albright and I are adults,

58
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:43,976
and we have none.

59
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:47,055
I have struck gold with
her, grabbed the prize,

60
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:48,495
hit the jackpot.

61
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:50,878
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding!

62
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,095
You're a winner.

63
00:03:53,788 --> 00:03:55,782
You didn't win.
You lucked out.

64
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:57,766
Love doesn't just
drop into your lap.

65
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:59,256
You've got to
force it there.

66
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:03,851
I don't know, Dick. I'm beginning
to wonder if I've got what it takes.

67
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:06,560
Of course you've got what
it takes. You're a warrior lieutenant,

68
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,548
and this is the battle of the sexes.

69
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:10,076
You can win it!

70
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:12,019
You know, I envy you.

71
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,779
Everybody in this house
has got somebody except me.

72
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,666
But when I do make
my love connection,

73
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,491
lady beware.

74
00:04:19,283 --> 00:04:22,028
I change for no one.

75
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,927
Harry, you sound
like an idiot.

76
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:26,000
And that will
never change.

77
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:29,358
Tommy?

78
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,130
Let's say

79
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,120
I got into this
horrible car crash,

80
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:36,692
and I wasn't
really hurt,

81
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,572
but my hair fell out
from the shock.

82
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:40,607
Would you
still like me?

83
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:43,634
What about the eyebrows?
- Gone.

84
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:46,879
Yeah, sure, I'd still
like you, of course.

85
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,252
It would take a couple
of days to get used to.

86
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,482
Did you see the monkey?
- I saw the monkey.

87
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,153
What if my sight
went next?

88
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:56,555
I'm bald,
with no eyebrows,

89
00:04:56,556 --> 00:05:00,224
and I can't see. Would
you still go out with me?

90
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:01,770
I'd stand by you.

91
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,051
Of course, you
wouldn't know it.

92
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:10,592
Why don't you go out and
find your own girlfriend?

93
00:05:10,593 --> 00:05:14,271
With my schedule, where
would I find the time?

94
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:19,052
Oh, my god. I have got
the most brilliant idea.

95
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:22,442
You should contact
a video dating service.

96
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,515
You think?
- Yes! August, that's genius.

97
00:05:24,516 --> 00:05:27,182
In fact, I bet they're open right now.

98
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,691
Yes.

99
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:31,633
Yes, yes.

100
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:35,221
There is a woman out
there with my name on her.

101
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:38,416
I will find her,

102
00:05:38,417 --> 00:05:40,819
and nothing's
gonna to stop me,

103
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:44,323
unless I get distracted
by something shiny.

104
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,957
You look
lovely today.

105
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,050
Thank you.

106
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:55,557
And you like everything else about me, too?
- Yes.

107
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:58,270
Have I done anything to upset you?
- No.

108
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,294
Great, 'cause I'm really
trying to change for you, Kevin.

109
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,418
I have been so bad.

110
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,556
Have you decided
on a wine?

111
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:07,164
What do you feel like? Red or white?

112
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:08,940
I don't know. You decide.

113
00:06:09,638 --> 00:06:11,466
We'll have
a bottle of merlot.

114
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,339
We're out of bread.
You want more bread?

115
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,861
I don't know.
You decide.

116
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,155
Is it cold in here,
or is it just me?

117
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:21,350
I don't know.
You decide.

118
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:23,186
Sally what are you doing?

119
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,981
I don't know, you decide.

120
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:28,900
If there's a problem here,
just say so.

121
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,065
Oh, there's no problem. I'm
just trying to please you.

122
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:32,534
Would you just drop this Okay?

123
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:33,726
Something's wrong, isn't it?

124
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,506
You like to play naive, but you
know exactly what you're doing.

125
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:39,853
Back up. Is naive a good
thing in a woman or a bad thing?

126
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:42,795
Are you trying to drag me
into some neofeminist debate?

127
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,354
I don't know.
You decide!

128
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,272
Fine.
I've decided.

129
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:49,878
Lunch is over.

130
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,753
Aw, listen, hun, there
are other fish in the sea.

131
00:06:56,754 --> 00:07:00,359
I don't want to hear
about the specials, lady.

132
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:06,438
Hi, my name
is Harry Solomon.

133
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:10,238
My turn-ons are
sunshine, beach houses,

134
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,336
and baking bread
with my blouse off.

135
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:16,134
I wasn't rolling.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:17,953
All right, Harry.

137
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:20,593
This is all about just being yourself Okay.

138
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:22,864
I want you to just
relax, act natural,

139
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,205
and have fun, okay?
All right, here we go.

140
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,858
Okay.
I was brought up...

141
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,977
on the backstreets

142
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,514
learned to love
before I could eat

143
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:38,165
educated, ow-Ww!
At Woodstock

144
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,391
I'm a soul man!

145
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,923
Friday would be fine.
Yeah, I see no problem with..

146
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:48,755
I'll call you back.

147
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,700
Hello
- Heh-woh..

148
00:07:57,652 --> 00:08:00,054
This is
Mr. Poopie bear.

149
00:08:00,055 --> 00:08:02,516
Is this my wittle
bunny face doll?

150
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:10,213
Hi, Mr. Poopie bear.
Is wou happy?

151
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:15,249
I'd be happier if I was in a
big snuggle buggle with wou.

152
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,950
Snuggle, snuggle,
snuggle, snuggle,

153
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:19,296
snuggle, snuggle.

154
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:22,382
Oh.
- Heh-woh?

155
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:24,615
Heh-woh!

156
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:27,991
Oh, heh-woh.

157
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,333
Dick, I need to talk.

158
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:34,066
Well, sure.
- I just had a horrible lunch with Kevin.

159
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:34,851
Tell me what happened.

160
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:37,160
I tried to change for him,
and he still got mad at me.

161
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,250
I thought I'd done everything right.
- I'm sure you did.

162
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:42,487
What do you think he needs from me?
- Sally, sit down.

163
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,144
Honey, I'm a man,

164
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:47,377
and here's something
that I've learned.

165
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:49,430
How can I put this?

166
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:53,351
Men... are
completely incapable of..

167
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:56,008
talking about
relationships.

168
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,054
Here's two women.
Dump on them.

169
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,257
What does this
remind you of?

170
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,520
That time in Vienna.

171
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:14,521
That waiter,

172
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:18,640
those long walks.
- And this coffee.

173
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,387
Yeah.

174
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:23,994
What's going on?

175
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,924
Sally's tense, I'm taking her away
with flavored coffee.

176
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,251
Who am I kidding? I've
never even been to Vienna!

177
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,295
Well, this
is amaretto.

178
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:36,692
A broken heart
demands mocha mint!

179
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:39,433
I'm sorry.
You can't blame me...

180
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:40,980
Sally, what's wrong?

181
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:41,715
Look at these chairs.

182
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,863
I don't know if it's the
fabric, or the pattern,

183
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:46,685
or that Mr. Randell hates me,
or maybe we just need a couch.

184
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,490
The fabric is a bit loud.
- It's Mr. Randell.

185
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:51,099
Sally, please,
stop being so sad.

186
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,316
I'm not sad. I'm angry.
- Then why are you leaking?

187
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:56,759
I don't know!
It's a whole new leak.

188
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:00,556
My relationship with
Mr. Randell is broken.

189
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,987
No matter what I say to him, I can't fix it.

190
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,071
Stop saying,
and start doing.

191
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,972
You've got to
have more sex.

192
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:11,462
More? I've never had any, ever.

193
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,256
Ever?
Well...

194
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:16,211
there's the black fly
in your chardonnay.

195
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:22,661
You've got to start.
Sex fixes everything.

196
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:25,497
It's the neosporin
of Amore.

197
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,315
Uh... Dick, I don't
know about that.

198
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:30,579
August says it's very in
nowadays to save yourself for marriage.

199
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,699
Excuse me, could we please not
talk about marriage?

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,245
I can't even get through dinner with this guy.

201
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:35,667
Are you just going to give up?

202
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,810
He's just not happy
with me anymore Dick.

203
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,630
You think you can just walk
out of here and find another man?

204
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:43,468
I mean, really, just look at yourself.
- What?

205
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:46,415
Oh, those
comically long legs,

206
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,418
that blindingly shiny hair,
those unruly breasts.

207
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,720
All right!
I get the picture!

208
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,329
Sally, he seems
like a nice guy.

209
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,287
Maybe he'll do it
out of pity.

210
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:59,672
Are you sure?

211
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:00,673
Come here.

212
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:03,682
I know the thought of giving yourself
to someone is

213
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:07,845
at once frightening
and exciting, but embrace it.

214
00:11:07,846 --> 00:11:10,002
Let go of yourself.

215
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,581
I mean, Dr. Albright dove right
in, and it was her first time.

216
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,510
Um... ahem..
coffee, anyone?

217
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,473
Look, maybe you need
a little something to uh..

218
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,493
to get you
in the mood.

219
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:30,045
I have a movie
that you can borrow.

220
00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:33,963
"Homeward bound".

221
00:11:35,527 --> 00:11:37,305
Is this supposed to help?
- Couldn't hurt.

222
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:39,593
The scene where the cat
falls off the wet log...

223
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:45,529
you'll notice that part of
the tape is a little worn.

224
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,712
Here.
Mocha mint for you.

225
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,441
Thanks, Tommy.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:53,933
You know, personally, I think
Dick's going a little

227
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:55,375
overboard with the whole thing.

228
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:59,247
You have to realize making love
to Mr. Randell is your decision.

229
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:00,970
You're right.

230
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:03,032
I'll do it.

231
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:06,209
I mean, what do I have to lose
except my virginity?

232
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,929
Good-bye, Mr. Hymen.

233
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,970
You're firing
our accountant?

234
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:16,626
Oh!

235
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:24,700
What do you look for
in the opposite sex, Harry?

236
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,015
Big bosoms...

237
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:28,264
and teeth.

238
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:32,125
Harry, you're so natural and so sincere,

239
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,863
not to mention your
features are positively chiseled.

240
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:38,355
Yeah yeah, I had no idea that
you prefer one large meal a day,

241
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:40,917
or that your favorite color is clear.
- Clear.

242
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:44,676
Tommy...

243
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,735
we have to talk.
- August, are you okay?

244
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,660
I'll be all right.

245
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:57,131
Fortunately, the hamster
didn't have rabies.

246
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:02,526
The hamster?
- The hamster that bit my nose off.

247
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:04,895
Yes, that's right,
Tommy,

248
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:07,665
my nose is gone.

249
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:12,254
So, I suppose you
want your ring back.

250
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:14,965
Uh... well, no.

251
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:19,206
Uh... can't they, like, stick it
back on somehow?

252
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,763
And that would be the only
way you'd continue to see me?

253
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:24,988
With my nose back,
that is?

254
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,020
No, I didn't say that. Uh...

255
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,414
uh... I guess we'll
just work through this

256
00:13:31,415 --> 00:13:32,933
whole nose
thing together.

257
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,678
No!
- Surprise!

258
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:39,489
I never should have
doubted you, Tommy.

259
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:53,976
Yeah!

260
00:13:55,395 --> 00:13:56,398
Yeah.

261
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,604
Hi, Sally.
- Hi.

262
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:04,795
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

263
00:14:04,796 --> 00:14:06,771
Well, you know me,

264
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:09,913
little old
impulsive Sally.

265
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:13,360
I've decided we need to
take things to another level.

266
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:17,533
Sally, I think we have a lot of
issues that need to be resolved.

267
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:19,462
By another level,
I mean this.

268
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:25,357
We can put those issues on
the back burner for awhile.

269
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:31,937
I really want
to please you, Kevin.

270
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,091
You didn't have to stop
to tell me that.

271
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:38,521
This is going to fix
everything, right?

272
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,324
Well, it's going to fix
a couple of things.

273
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:44,760
If it's not going to fix
everything, why are we doing it?

274
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:52,481
Okay, this wasn't
my idea, Sally.

275
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:55,328
It wasn't mine, either.
It was my family's.

276
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,390
Your family convinced you
to sleep with me?

277
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:59,590
Yeah, we really think you're worth it.

278
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,347
What am I, some kind
of experiment?

279
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:04,087
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

280
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:06,091
Why does everything have
to be so difficult with you?

281
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:08,456
If I'm so damn difficult, why do
you want to have sex with me?

282
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:09,457
Because you're laying
on top of me.

283
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,051
That's your answer for everything.
- I give up.

284
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:15,042
You give up, good. That means I win.
- No, you don't win.

285
00:15:15,043 --> 00:15:17,199
You win?
- I don't win, either.

286
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,979
No one wins?
- No.

287
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:21,958
This really sucks.
- Yes, it does.

288
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,193
I don't want to play anymore.
- Neither do I.

289
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:25,843
I think one of us
should leave.

290
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,366
And since this is
your apartment,

291
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,367
I guess that would be me.

292
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:36,945
Good-bye.

293
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,106
You know, I've...

294
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:49,183
never lost before.

295
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,577
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,352
Tell me
what happened.

297
00:16:00,353 --> 00:16:04,231
I went over there to fix things,
and instead I ruined everything.

298
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:07,099
And the worst part is,
I'm still a virgin.

299
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:09,971
Oh, my god.
You're a virgin?

300
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:13,190
Yes, I know.
It's horrible.

301
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,961
No, no, no, no,
it's wonderful.

302
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:17,833
It is?

303
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,957
Yes. It's perfectly all right to
save yourself for the right man.

304
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,713
Like you did for Dick?

305
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,218
Yes.

306
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,908
The point is, breaking
up with Kevin was smart.

307
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,729
He wanted you to be
something you're not,

308
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,781
and you're fine
just the way you are.

309
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:43,773
I like you, Sally.

310
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:46,668
I didn't know
you liked me.

311
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:48,365
Well, I do.

312
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:50,452
You're a strong,
opinionated,

313
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:52,296
intelligent
young woman.

314
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:54,745
Unpredictable at times,
a little scary,

315
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,785
but, hell,
that's you.

316
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:58,183
That is me.

317
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:02,311
I like me, too, but why didn't Mr. Randell?

318
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,483
Well, he's just not the right guy
for you.

319
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:05,987
But you'll find someone.

320
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,425
I mean, just look at you.
Those legs, that hair..

321
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:11,927
Please! I've been dragged
through the muck enough today.

322
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,733
Just chalk this up
to experience.

323
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:20,513
Thanks, Dr. Albright.

324
00:17:21,117 --> 00:17:22,530
You're so nice.

325
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,249
I always thought
you were such a bitch.

326
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:29,739
Oh, I am,

327
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:32,062
but, hell,

328
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:33,851
that's me.

329
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:59,539
Well, hello.
- Hi.

330
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:02,077
I gotta say,
I'm shocked.

331
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:05,404
That videotape
did not do you justice.

332
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,413
What videotape?

333
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,273
Oh.

334
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,473
That must be Lydia.

335
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:17,094
A little more knuckle hair
than I had hoped for, but..

336
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:20,065
a guy has got
to start somewhere.

337
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,531
You know what this coffee reminds me of?

338
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:34,325
That little cafe
in Amsterdam?

339
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:37,192
No, that I used the
coffee pot to drain the freon

340
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:38,938
out of the air
conditioner.

341
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,134
yeah.

342
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:43,548
It's a beautiful
morning, isn't it?

343
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:46,049
The birds are chirping.
The sky is blue.

344
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,405
You're awfully cheery,
considering you just lost your boyfriend.

345
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:51,448
I'm okay.
- You know, I feel sorry for you.

346
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,230
I mean, this afternoon,
I'm going shopping for drapes

347
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,506
with Dr. Albright,
and you'll be alone.

348
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:59,476
And tomorrow I'm taking Dr.
Albright to the recycling center,

349
00:18:59,477 --> 00:19:00,681
and you'll be alone.

350
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,896
The way I look at it, Dick,
I'm embarking on an adventure.

351
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:06,806
The dating world is like
a huge food court for me,

352
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:09,819
and I can take my little
red tray anywhere I like.

353
00:19:10,785 --> 00:19:11,983
I don't follow.

354
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,583
Well, you see, Dick,
it's like, with you,

355
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,593
you know you're going to
have grilled cheese every day,

356
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:20,908
day after day

357
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,476
after day
after day.

358
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,200
But me, tonight
I might go Italian,

359
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:28,663
tomorrow, Greek.
Next week, who knows?

360
00:19:28,664 --> 00:19:30,032
Mexican, Chinese..

361
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,652
hot dog on a stick.

362
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,151
Hey, Harry,

363
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:38,917
come on, it's singles day at the mall.

364
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:41,239
Lock and load.

365
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:45,746
Grilled cheese.

366
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,081
Tommy,

367
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:49,389
We're late.

368
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:51,832
Enjoy your lunch.

369
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,066
Yeah, you, too.

370
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,034
God, I love
grilled cheese.

371
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:09,707
Yeah.

372
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,512
I could eat it
every day.

373
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:19,259
Day after day after day after day.

374
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:23,404
Hey, do you have
any sliced tomatoes?

375
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:26,279
Yes!
Yes, we do!

376
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,667
Perfect mate has hundreds
of compatible people for you.

377
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:40,615
Let's go.

378
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,283
My name is Sally,

379
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,477
and I'm strong, loud,
opinionated, and aggresive.

380
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:49,002
I'm a big, angry virgin,
and I'm happy about it.

381
00:20:50,408 --> 00:20:52,531
Oh, and I also enjoy walking
barefoot in the sand,

382
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:54,356
and the poems
of Rod McKuen.

383
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,253
So, if you're
man enough for me,

384
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:58,750
let's make a date.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
