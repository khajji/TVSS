1
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:08,059
So I said to her,
"hey mom your birthday

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,742
was last month,
hoist it up yourself".

3
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:13,551
I don't get it,
what are they laughing at?

4
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:16,186
Anyway, I'm not saying
my mom is overweight,

5
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:18,078
she's got that
flabby skin under her arm.

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,464
You know what I'm talking about.
Well, the other day this wind picks up,

7
00:00:20,465 --> 00:00:22,104
this stuff starts jiggling

8
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,386
out dropped a tricycle
I lost when I was seven.

9
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,420
Excuse me.

10
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:31,498
Perhaps you can help me out. Those
things you said about your mother,

11
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,908
I don't understand
why they're considered funny.

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,786
Well, um..
- Is it because

13
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:38,682
the toned arms that once
cradled you securely

14
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:41,916
now have large deposits
of cellulite hanging from them?

15
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,466
Is aging funny?
- If you think about it..

16
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:47,503
And you, is it all the
alcohol you're consuming

17
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:50,449
that makes it okay to laugh at
the expense of your loved ones?

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,366
He's right!
I love my fat mama!

19
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:56,624
And you're
a bad man!

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,662
Dr. Albright,

21
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,600
have you ever lost
a tricycle in your mother?

22
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,007
Please Dick,
I am in a cruddy mood.

23
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,629
This fundraiser is turning out
to be a nightmare.

24
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:25,291
Well, why are you laughing? You
just said you were in a cruddy mood.

25
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,173
Oh, it's these jokes
Ben Littmeyer gave me at lunch.

26
00:01:29,174 --> 00:01:31,571
Ben Littmeyer,
from the sociology department?

27
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:34,525
Yes, oh he has
the best sense of humour.

28
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:36,907
I finally convinced him
to host the fundraiser.

29
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:38,908
Well, why didn't you
ask me to do it?

30
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,767
I have a wonderful
sense of humour.

31
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:43,244
Nina, come in here.

32
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,700
I have a wonderful
sense of humour, don't I?

33
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:49,310
Ohhh.

34
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,601
See?
- Oh!

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,113
This is an important
fundraiser for Pendleton,

36
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:59,109
and Ben can get those fat
cats to cough up some cash.

37
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,977
Well I can make
a fat cat cough.

38
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:04,327
I can even
make him vomit.

39
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:07,626
Thanks Dick, but Ben
already said yes.

40
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,846
You don't think I'm funny?

41
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:14,559
Oh Dick, you're loving,
and intelligent, and sexy..

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,883
and funny?
- Oh! I have a class!

43
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:22,126
I am funny! I am funny!
I am!

44
00:03:01,173 --> 00:03:02,629
What happened
to your coat?

45
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,193
I don't know
what happened to it,

46
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:08,669
so Mrs. Dubcek let me
borrow this one.

47
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,258
Sweet woman.

48
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,421
So you lost your coat?
Oh tough break.

49
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:17,409
I lost more
than a coat, Tommy!

50
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:20,665
I lost a friend,

51
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,736
a buddy,

52
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:25,540
a companion, who kept me
warm when it was cold

53
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,743
and warmer
when it was really

54
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:30,449
sort of too hot
to be wearing a coat.

55
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:33,367
Tommy,

56
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:37,390
look, you're
the information officer.

57
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:40,435
What do you know about this
thing they call a sense of humour?

58
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:42,621
All I know is,
that's not it.

59
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,108
Lieutenant,
I need your help.

60
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,743
I need you to find out
what's funny.

61
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,158
Oh I can't,
I've got to build this..

62
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,449
I ran out of room
for my shoes.

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,696
Well this is more important,
it's about me!

64
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,589
Well how am I supposed
to know what's funny?

65
00:03:57,457 --> 00:04:00,070
What's so important about
a sense of humour anyway?

66
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,377
Oh come on Tommy.

67
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:03,619
Having a sense of humor
is having the power,

68
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,778
to transform someone's mood,

69
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,439
to lift his spirit.

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,271
You give it to someone you
love when she really needs it.

71
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:15,257
And I just found out today, that
Marys been getting it from another man.

72
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:20,411
Dick, I think this whole
being funny thing is just innate.

73
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:22,755
What do you think, lieutenant?
- What do I think?

74
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:26,538
I think either you got it or you don't.

75
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:27,903
Look what you just did!

76
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:33,092
What's wrong
with you guys?

77
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,235
Come on! Wake up you two, come on!

78
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:41,652
How am I ever gonna
find out what's funny?

79
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:48,309
No I don't get it. Give me
an example of what's funny.

80
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,590
Okay let's see.

81
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:52,145
I thought the movie
Emma was really funny.

82
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:57,066
What was funny about it?

83
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,886
Didn't you get it?
It was full of irony.

84
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:01,932
Okay, so irony's funny.

85
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:05,319
Sure, because someone says something,
and the opposite is actually true.

86
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,641
Oh okay, like when you
told me Emma was gonna be

87
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,011
a really great movie, when
actually it sucked out loud?

88
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:15,763
Well, apparently, irony is a
little too sophisticated for you.

89
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,868
Either that or you don't know
what's funny either.

90
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:20,664
I... don't know
what's funny?

91
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:22,645
I'll have you know,
at camp,

92
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,674
I was voted
"Miss Whimsy".

93
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,310
Why, was Miss Irony killed
in a canoe accident?

94
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,122
Hi, Dick.
- Oh, uh, Mary.

95
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:41,048
Just doing some reading.

96
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,417
Some physics reading,
you know.

97
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:45,352
Okay.

98
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:47,063
Say, uh,

99
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:50,196
an amusing joke
just came to me

100
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:51,713
you know,
out of the blue.

101
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,592
Knock, knock.

102
00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:59,565
Okay.
Who's there?

103
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:06,248
Who's there you say?

104
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:11,763
Nina!

105
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:13,595
Nina who?

106
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:16,080
Ah Nina, she's right here!

107
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,884
Please let me host
that fundraiser!

108
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:23,616
No!
- Oh!

109
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:27,273
Ben Littmeyer just called, he's
gonna be a few minutes late for lunch.

110
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:29,157
Oh, another lunch
with Ben.

111
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:30,334
I see.

112
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:32,467
How funny for you.

113
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,912
Well, would you like to join us,
we could make it a threesome?

114
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:38,439
I don't go that way Mary.

115
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,561
Fine!

116
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:50,372
And last but not least,
garlic gum.

117
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:52,395
Oh, uh, Harry,

118
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:55,877
how would you like a nice
piece of perfectly ordinary gum?

119
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:56,997
Okay.

120
00:06:58,855 --> 00:07:00,827
Mmm, garlicky.

121
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,405
Well, I had
a great day.

122
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,972
I haven't learned a thing about
comedy, and August and I had a huge fight.

123
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:08,754
Oh well, how would you
like a nice doughnut?

124
00:07:08,755 --> 00:07:11,598
from this bag
labeled "donuts".

125
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,883
Ahh! You touched doggy doody!

126
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,937
Since when is doggy
doody made in Taiwan?

127
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:22,626
They have dogs
in Taiwan.. big ones.

128
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:24,678
Funny, right?
- I don't know. You know,

129
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:27,920
I don't think I'm ever
gonna see my coat again.

130
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:31,500
Okay, Harry, why don't you sit down,
you'll feel a lot better?

131
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:32,748
Right here.

132
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:35,753
Excuse me.

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,944
Damn!

134
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:44,445
You know, at least
I can take comfort

135
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:46,774
in knowing that
I treated my coat well.

136
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:49,893
Such as yesterday.
It was hot on the bus.

137
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:52,008
I took it off
and folded it neatly

138
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,633
and placed it
under the shade of my seat.

139
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:57,690
What?

140
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,129
You left it on the bus.

141
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,463
No-o-o!

142
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:03,230
You know they have a lost and found Harry.

143
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:06,138
Oh you mean I might
see my coat again?

144
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,670
Oh I am so happy.

145
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,462
Dick, I've been thinking
about this "humour" thing.

146
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:14,786
Why don't you try what
those guys on TV do?

147
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,969
Everybody says they're funny?
- Oh, yeah, those guys!

148
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:18,645
You know..

149
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,477
The McLaughlin group?
No.

150
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,457
They're not funny
at all!

151
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,202
Oh, hello Dick.
- Hello Ben.

152
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,344
I'm waiting for Mary.

153
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,768
I'm sleeping with Mary.

154
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,750
Oh. Okay.

155
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:58,360
So from what I've heard, you're
quite the professor funnypants.

156
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,122
Well, I..
- It's seems that you have Mary

157
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,313
wrapped around
your little funny bone.

158
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:07,446
But I can assure you,
I am a far tougher...

159
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:09,611
bone wrapperer

160
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,057
I think I'll wait
outside.

161
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:14,821
Make me laugh funny man.

162
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,323
Well, I'm not
a comedian.

163
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,582
It's just that funny things,
just seem to happen to me.

164
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,950
Oh really, like what?

165
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:24,249
Well, like last week,
I was at a bus stop,

166
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,085
and it suddenly
started raining, pouring.

167
00:09:27,086 --> 00:09:29,036
And I look over
and I see this

168
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:31,402
gorgeous grad student,

169
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,631
and she's looking at me,

170
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,906
like a kid with braces,
looking at a candy apple.

171
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,781
Mmm, no, not funny.

172
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:39,677
Well, I'm about
to say hello,

173
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:43,372
when I suddenly realize, that
my hair has flipped forward.

174
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:46,963
Here I am standing in the
rain, with my very own awning.

175
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,629
Well, finally
the bus arrived,

176
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,742
and the door opened,

177
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:54,613
the compressor kicked in,

178
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,932
and this, this, European
weave of mine

179
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:00,262
got sucked
right into the bus!

180
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:02,554
Well,
there I was,

181
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,418
in front of
this beautiful girl,

182
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,926
and chasing that bus,

183
00:10:06,927 --> 00:10:08,845
and chasing my hair..

184
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:10,974
up and down,
chasing!

185
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,253
And I couldn't..I just.. oh!

186
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,528
Oh! Oh!

187
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,650
This is not good.

188
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,897
Yes, Yes, it is!
The bus stole your hair!

189
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:24,664
Call 911!

190
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,848
911!

191
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,928
Mary was so right
about you Ben!

192
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,542
What's going on?

193
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:34,282
Ben's been telling me the funniest story,

194
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:36,173
about the bus,
and the girl, and the..

195
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,346
Call 911!

196
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,770
You've heard this one before!

197
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:53,523
I'm telling you, Ben's
heart stopping temporarily

198
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:55,646
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

199
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:57,890
He's getting
some much-needed bed rest,

200
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,095
and I'm emceeing
the fundraiser tomorrow night.

201
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:01,024
How did you manage that?

202
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:03,369
I promised Dr. Albright
I'd stick to Ben's script.

203
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,924
Are you gonna?
- No.

204
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:09,226
All right, next up on open-
mike night, very funny man,

205
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:11,240
put your hands together
for Dick Solomon.

206
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:17,571
Thank you!
Thank you!

207
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:20,250
Thanks a lot!
Thank you so much!

208
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:21,316
Now,

209
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,134
I'm gonna
tell you some jokes.

210
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:26,039
Joke one:

211
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,690
I went fishing
last week.

212
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,438
My permit said
I could only catch five.

213
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:34,743
Oh, I caught five,
all right, as in 35.

214
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:41,895
Was that funny?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

215
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:44,055
But you know..

216
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,183
pot-stickers,
what are they all about?

217
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:51,013
Haa-haa!

218
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,580
Okay, joke number two:

219
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,378
Some termites..

220
00:11:56,514 --> 00:12:00,546
I mean, huge termites..
ate my house last night.

221
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:07,760
Uh, it's gone.
It's completely gone.

222
00:12:09,217 --> 00:12:10,345
That's it.
That's the joke.

223
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,611
Really suck.
- Really.

224
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:14,232
Where are you going? Wait.

225
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:16,403
Wait. Where are you going?

226
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:20,112
Hey, look! A bald guy. Am I right?

227
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:23,306
Haa-haa!

228
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:30,314
So, who do you think's
funny in our class?

229
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:33,347
Um, Alan Gimball.

230
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:37,143
Alan Gimball? Why?
- 'Cause he's 20.

231
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,029
Oh, so.. so you think
dumb people are funny?

232
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,129
If they're
that dumb, yeah.

233
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,644
You know who I think is funny?
David Barrett.

234
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:51,129
Oh, yeah, he's hysterical.
- He is so clever.

235
00:12:51,277 --> 00:12:53,416
I meant because
he looks like a big dork.

236
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:56,787
What?

237
00:12:56,987 --> 00:12:59,575
All right, let's install this baby.
- Sweet!

238
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:11,097
Did you measure the shelves?
- Yes.

239
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:12,430
Did you measure the closet?
- Yes.

240
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,942
Did you measure the door?
- Damn!

241
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:18,207
Listen, if it's
storage you're after,

242
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,689
you can put it in the
hall closet downstairs.

243
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,541
Let me go and get
the door for you.

244
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:24,534
All right,here,
keep it sideways.

245
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:31,055
Uh, Dubcek, hold it.
- What?

246
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:35,005
I got it, I got it,
no problem, no problem

247
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:40,417
Hello? Yeah just a second.
Harry, for you.

248
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:46,764
Hello.

249
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:49,385
Wrong number.

250
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,487
She took it down
herself.

251
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,200
Ah, it's all right.

252
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:00,589
You had the guts to get up
there, you know? It takes time.

253
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,706
I have to be funny
by tomorrow night!

254
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,219
You're not
gonna make it.

255
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:07,120
I don't know
what to do!

256
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:09,170
Well, don't over-think it,

257
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:10,331
you know, just,

258
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:12,651
talk about things
you know. That's what I do.

259
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:16,400
Yeah. You make fun of
your poor mother's flabby arms.

260
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:18,879
Hey, those flabby-arm
jokes made her the most

261
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,211
popular senior
in Fort Meyers, Florida.

262
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,630
You.. you mean,
she doesn't hate you for it?

263
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:28,412
Hate me? No.

264
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:32,128
She loves me for it.
It's a joke.

265
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:33,250
You mean,

266
00:14:34,071 --> 00:14:37,185
tricycles don't really
fall out of her arms?

267
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:39,356
Uh, no.

268
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:43,623
Oh my god!
Of course they don't!

269
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:46,846
I mean, just think how
flabby her arms would have to be

270
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:50,388
for a tricycle to be up in
there, and for so many years.

271
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,103
And she didn't even notice it,
not even when she took a shower.

272
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:57,438
That's hysterical.
I get it.

273
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,695
I get the joke!

274
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:03,617
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

275
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:08,277
This should be fun.

276
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:14,052
Um, I'd like to welcome
you all here tonight.

277
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,840
Before we go
any further,

278
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:19,592
I think that we should all
acknowledge the sensational job,

279
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:22,918
that my esteemed colleague,
Dr. Mary Albright has done

280
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,906
in organizing this truly
worthwhile event. Dr. Albright.

281
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:34,152
Don't you love Dr. Albright?
I know I do.

282
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:37,082
Now, I know many
of you are wondering,

283
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:39,665
what's with her
long sleeves?

284
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,848
Well, I'll tell you.

285
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:43,884
It's to cover up
her flabby arms.

286
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:50,773
She shook them the other day,
and the dead sea scrolls fell out.

287
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:56,734
She's, uh.. she's quite old also, you see.

288
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,989
But you know,
as sweet and wonderful,

289
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,941
as Dr. Albright is,

290
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,051
she can also be
somewhat domineering,

291
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,998
power-hungry
and hostile,

292
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,062
and I think I finally
figured out why.

293
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:11,275
Dr. Albright,
while you may not have

294
00:16:11,276 --> 00:16:13,047
a man's genitalia,

295
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,932
at least you have
his razor stubble.

296
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:25,813
Oh, oh, oh! Oh!
And there's Nina.

297
00:16:25,814 --> 00:16:28,676
Nina is Dr. Albright's
assistant.

298
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:31,013
Nina, stand up, stand up.
Come on, stand up.

299
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:33,349
Show everybody
how you put the "Ass"

300
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,659
in "Assistant".

301
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,231
I left my coat on the bus.
- Can you describe it?

302
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:44,481
Yes, it had eight wheels,
hard plastic seats,

303
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:47,214
and when it stopped,
it went, "sh-h-h-h"

304
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,001
Harry, he means the coat.
- Oh, oh!

305
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:52,694
Um, well, it kind of looked
like this one, only it was furry..

306
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,291
don't have it.
Next.

307
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:57,078
Night Eddie.
- See you Monday.

308
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:02,436
He's got my coat.
- Harry, be a man.

309
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,739
Hey, Mister,

310
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:13,292
that's my coat.

311
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,175
No it isn't.
- Yeah, that's his coat.

312
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,741
If it's his coat,
how come I'm wearing it?

313
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:21,738
Good point.

314
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:28,171
Hey babes.

315
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:31,662
Good morning Dick, did you sleep well?

316
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:34,190
Once the adrenaline wore off,
like a baby.

317
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:37,790
You know when you've been riding
the bullet train to "yuk-ville",

318
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,254
it's kind of hard to slow down.

319
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:41,833
I've been up all night
faxing jokes to Leno.

320
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:45,260
What have we here?

321
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:48,376
Eleven
banana cream pies!

322
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,718
One for every letter in my name. Am I right?

323
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:51,755
Right.

324
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:55,410
Oh girls. You shouldn't have.

325
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:57,874
Oh, we had to.

326
00:17:58,847 --> 00:17:59,861
Really.

327
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,467
You were so funny last night.
- Ohh.

328
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:05,379
I was wondering
if you could help us out?

329
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,362
Oh I'd be delighted
to share my...

330
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:09,234
comedic expertise.

331
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,543
We who are clowns are
known for our generosity.

332
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:14,673
Maybe you can help us settle
an argument we were having.

333
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,663
Shoot.

334
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:17,516
What's funnier?

335
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:19,561
This...

336
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:24,178
or this?

337
00:18:26,327 --> 00:18:29,341
Or... is two
at once funny?

338
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:33,154
How about...

339
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,123
this?

340
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,594
Is this funny?

341
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:47,260
I think...

342
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,335
this.

343
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:52,373
You are so right!

344
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:58,952
That is funny!

345
00:19:15,818 --> 00:19:17,901
Thank you so much
for helping us.

346
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,917
I'm glad I could
be of service.

347
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,693
Now if you'll
excuse me,

348
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,139
I have a class
to teach.

349
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,594
You know, it's
a remarkable feeling

350
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,661
to be able to make
someone else laugh.

351
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,512
It's almost as if
you have the power

352
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:45,188
to get inside their brain,
and tickle it.

353
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:47,707
I can do that
with a chopstick.

354
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:50,314
Imagine how different
war would be,

355
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,694
if instead of trying
to kill each other,

356
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:53,811
people just showed up
armed with jokes.

357
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,949
But you could still
have guns, right?

358
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,493
Because, you know,
eventually you'd stop laughing,

359
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:00,098
and want to get on
with the killing.

360
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,804
You know what I found out?
Humour's subjective.

361
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:04,449
What do you mean?

362
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,570
Well, I thought the fact that
no one was laughing at you

363
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,266
at the comedy club
was hysterical.

364
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,141
Oh, I loved that.

365
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,778
No no.
No, that wasn't funny.

366
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,818
See?
- Which is also ironic.

367
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:16,704
You were at a comedy club,
and no one was laughing.

368
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:19,361
Hey shut up all of you!

369
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,582
Well I think I'm gonna take my
furry little friend for a walk.

370
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,696
He's been locked
in the basement all week.

371
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:28,918
You know, why do they
call it a "fur coat" anyway?

372
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,792
It's not made of fur,
and it's not a coat.

373
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:35,364
Uh, actually Harry,
it's both those things.

374
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,386
It was a joke.

375
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:39,553
Ohh!

376
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,741
Good night everybody.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
