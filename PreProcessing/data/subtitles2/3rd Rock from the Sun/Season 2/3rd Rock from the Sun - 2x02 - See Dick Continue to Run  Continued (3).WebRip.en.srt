1
00:00:00,921 --> 00:00:03,117
Last time on Third Rock From The Sun.

2
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:06,424
After
trapping me in an invisible box,

3
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:10,264
my evil replacement continued his
diabolical plot to rule the world.

4
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:11,806
Not knowing
his true identity,

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,573
my beloved Mary made a date
with the scoundrel.

6
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:17,337
But just as I thought my
plight was lost forever,

7
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:20,876
my entrapment was cleverly
discovered by my stellar crew.

8
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:25,024
Oh, you guys,

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,821
there's
an invisible box.

10
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,354
Ow! Wow,
that smarts!

11
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:34,071
You're going to look hideous tomorrow.
- You think?

12
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:36,327
Yeah. There's this girl
I knew. She hit her nose.

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,986
Dustin Hoffman.
- Mr. Randell's coming over.

14
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:40,704
Hello! I'm trapped in a box here.

15
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:42,123
Okay.

16
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:45,584
Well, let's see. Anybody know how
to open one of these things?

17
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,190
Well, we know we can't
smash it open with our heads.

18
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:52,568
Tommy, go get a hammer.
- Nobody's getting a hammer.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,009
Get a hammer. That's an order.
- I'm sorry, sir,

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,446
but you can't
give us orders.

21
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:59,536
Of all the insolent..

22
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,515
Dick you are no longer the high commander.

23
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:04,439
Sorry...

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,557
but if we let you out of
that box, well, that's mutiny.

25
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:09,480
Oh, mutiny shmutiny.

26
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,219
Big, fat dutiny.

27
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,741
Now, I'm sick of
the new Dick.

28
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,595
This Dick,
he's one of us.

29
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,871
So maybe he's
not perfect,

30
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:21,423
maybe his leadership
skills verge on the pathetic,

31
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:22,650
and maybe his incompetence

32
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:24,789
has made our mission the
laughingstock of the entire Galaxy.

33
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:25,690
I think you've made your point.

34
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,017
No, I haven't made my point.

35
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:29,336
The point is that he's always
been there for the three of us,

36
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,437
and it's time the three
of us take a stand for him.

37
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,656
Aha, sure sure. That's easy for you to say.

38
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:36,776
You don't have
the responsibility I do.

39
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:39,445
If we let him out and the
big giant head gets wind of it,

40
00:01:39,446 --> 00:01:42,239
who do you think's going to take
the fall? The information officer?

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,579
The transmitter?

42
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:47,310
I don't think so. It's going
to be me, the woman. Typical.

43
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,832
Sally!

44
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,235
Think of all we've been through together.

45
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,699
When brad dumped you,
who ordered you

46
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,764
to drink
yourself silly

47
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:04,339
until you had completely
drowned your feelings for him?

48
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,191
You did.

49
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,750
And when I ran over
your foot with the car,

50
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,690
who drove you
to the hospital

51
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,253
the very next day?

52
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,592
You did.

53
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,966
And when you were hungry
that day in the park,

54
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:22,672
who stole that little girl's ice cream cone.

55
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:25,902
Tommy did that.
- It was my idea.

56
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:27,442
It was.
- True.

57
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:28,710
Sir, you're right.

58
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,039
I can't let you
rot in this box.

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,979
I've got to get you out
of here. Come on, guys.

60
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,773
Blood is thicker than water.
- It is?

61
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:37,038
I think.
- It's not as thick as peanut butter.

62
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,876
It's a pretty thick substance.
- Chunky peanut butter?

63
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:40,730
Get me
out of here!

64
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:20,314
The lighting is romantic,

65
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:24,486
the champagne chilled.

66
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:27,938
And now for some...

67
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,012
erotic literature.

68
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:36,169
"Make sure the 2x4 studs are
cleated to the floor plates

69
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,242
before applying
the wallboard".

70
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:41,672
Perfect.

71
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:44,513
yoo-hoo!
- Come on up.

72
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:50,099
Oh! I like what you've done with the place.

73
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:53,596
Just wait
until you see..

74
00:03:53,597 --> 00:03:55,035
the bedroom.

75
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,983
Tonight...

76
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,530
is about pleasure,

77
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:04,127
a journey into the...

78
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:05,859
taboo.

79
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:08,392
I will let nothing..

80
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:10,036
destroy the mood.

81
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:18,201
Nothing.

82
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:55,049
I've seen these.

83
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,321
Lieutenant!

84
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,363
Ah, clap off, huh?

85
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,432
You made it!
- I'm free! I'm free!

86
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,872
Tommy, thank you!

87
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:13,912
I'm free! Freedom! Freedom!

88
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:20,755
There's so much
I've missed..

89
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,061
fresh air, the smell
of bacon frying,

90
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:26,002
watching talk shows
with Harry.

91
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:29,334
I didn't miss jerry
springer's biker chick makeover, did I?

92
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,621
It was Tuesday.
- Oh, damn!

93
00:05:35,423 --> 00:05:38,399
Sally, why are you wearing that
skirt? It makes you look frumpy.

94
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:40,978
I knew it!

95
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,626
That Dick upstairs said
this look worked for me.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,956
You know, I hate him.
- He crashed the rambler.

97
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,200
He changed
my name to Tommy.

98
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:52,630
Where does that leave you?
- He calls me Tommy, too.

99
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,146
Is that Tommy and the number, 2..?
- I don't know.

100
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,519
The guy's a major head case.
- I've heard enough.

101
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,241
No one dictates

102
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:01,680
humiliating and irrational edicts
to my family.

103
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:03,066
That's my job.

104
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:04,251
Now, come on.

105
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:06,767
Oh, oh, oh!

106
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:10,238
And nobody better have
touched my strawberries.

107
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:22,348
Mary.

108
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:24,899
What's she doing
with him?

109
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:27,222
Looks like he's plugging her pie hole.

110
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,932
I think she
likes it, Dick.

111
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,224
Dick?
- Dick?

112
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,642
Dick.
- Come on, Dick.

113
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:46,715
What does she
see in him? I mean..

114
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,132
Sure, he's gorgeous, but... it's
all part of his depraved scheme.

115
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:52,188
How dare he!
How dare she.

116
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:54,437
Did what we have
mean nothing to her?

117
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:56,379
Wait.
She thinks he's me.

118
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:58,469
But he's going to get her

119
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,404
Because he's deceiving her!

120
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:02,594
And she'll be his forever. In a way, mine.

121
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,826
But she likes..
but he.. I oughta..

122
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:07,725
but, she, I..
- Dick, hey, snap out of it!

123
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:12,638
You have to take action.
- You're right. I've got it!

124
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,036
We're moving to Florida.
- What?!

125
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:16,528
It's warm all the time. The
land is cheap. And the fishing..

126
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,945
bass as big
as your arm.

127
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:21,735
We're not going anywhere.
Now you listen to me.

128
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,029
This afternoon when I was with
Albright arranging this date..

129
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,318
you arranged this date?
- Yeah, but the point is..

130
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,247
you set this up? What are you, his pimp?

131
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,704
If you'd let me finish, I'll expl..
- You of all people..

132
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,737
Dick, get a grip and
listen to her for a second.

133
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:37,893
The point is Dick, that I tried
to talk her out of this date,

134
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:40,135
but she wouldn't listen to me because..

135
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,531
and don't
ask me why..

136
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:43,692
she has some sort of
emotional attachment to you.

137
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,430
She said that?

138
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:47,455
She cares about you so much,

139
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:50,524
she is upstairs about to
have sex with another man.

140
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,751
She would do that for me?

141
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,832
If you don't stop her.

142
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,498
You're right. That tyrant has gone too far.

143
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,518
I must defeat that man!
- All right!

144
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,940
I should have done
that earlier.

145
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,657
Okay, here's the plan.
Tommy, Harry, you stay here.

146
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,041
Sally, watch my back while I
make a run for the bathroom.

147
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:23,063
Okay, then what?
- I use the bathroom.

148
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:26,020
I've been stuck in a box for two days.

149
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,553
Hold on.
Enough.

150
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:40,483
I think my tongue
has a Charley horse.

151
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:45,180
Well, saddle up.
We're going for another ride.

152
00:09:46,942 --> 00:09:50,136
What is going on? Last
time, you were so fast.

153
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:51,963
Why don't we
just get to it?

154
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,115
"It"?
What?

155
00:09:57,716 --> 00:10:00,148
You know...it.

156
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,030
Oh, it.

157
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:06,942
You'll get it,
all right.

158
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:09,633
You'll get
all of it

159
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,140
that you want.

160
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:17,046
It is..on..it's way.

161
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:20,308
Come on, Dick.
He's taking forever.

162
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,169
Who's taking forever?

163
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:25,728
Toilet duck.

164
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:32,186
He's tackling
our stubborn buildup.

165
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:36,543
Lieutenant, you're the
woman. I need to know about "it".

166
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,418
It what?
- You know, it.

167
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,541
Oh, it.
Um...ahh...let's get some privacy.

168
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:44,763
Okay, well, um...

169
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,075
uh... it's, uh

170
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,935
it's kind of involved.
Um...

171
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,184
yeah?

172
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:58,572
Eww.
Really?

173
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,322
No.

174
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,876
Hmm. And women
like that?

175
00:11:02,877 --> 00:11:04,442
They love it.

176
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,973
And to think, all this time I
was just walking around on them.

177
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,250
Mary!
- Dick.

178
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:17,593
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.
- Oh, that's more like it.

179
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:20,619
I want you so bad.
You've got to escape.

180
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,334
You want me to try and get away?
- You must.

181
00:11:22,335 --> 00:11:25,105
Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

182
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:25,998
How's that?

183
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:30,034
Get out!
- What?

184
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:32,792
If you clear the hedge, you'll be fine.
- What is wrong with you?

185
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:36,167
Nothing. Everything. You
know I'll never leave you.

186
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:39,075
Dick.
- I've got to go now. You remember Tommy.

187
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:42,353
Tell her about the swim team.
- Swim team?

188
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:46,157
Well, well, well,

189
00:11:46,158 --> 00:11:48,600
if it isn't the former
high commander.

190
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:51,155
It seems that I've
underestimated your..

191
00:11:51,156 --> 00:11:52,728
stupidity.

192
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,107
That was your
first mistake.

193
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,546
Here's your second.

194
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,110
Look over there.
Where?

195
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:04,188
What's going on?
Dick is acting so strangely.

196
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:05,896
Listen, Dr. Albright.

197
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:09,515
Dick, he's got a lot of
baggage. It's an internal struggle.

198
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:10,702
Stop!

199
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,533
Ha!

200
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:21,203
Stop pulling my hair !
- I'll pull it if I want !

201
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,992
That poor thing.
I didn't know.

202
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,857
No, you couldn't know,
'cause he's been afraid.

203
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,621
See, he's been lonely

204
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:32,426
for such
a long time.

205
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,446
And as the years
went by,

206
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:38,078
he fell into despair
and lost all hope.

207
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,549
For what woman
could ever learn to love a beast.

208
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,967
Give me a second, okay?
I'll be right back.

209
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:54,905
Why aren't you helping him?
- Which one?

210
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,499
When I pull him up,
brain him with the gnome.

211
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,593
Gotcha.

212
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:12,916
I got him, Dick!
- Now help me get him into the chair.

213
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:17,703
Here. .

214
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:21,030
Tie him up good.
Tie him down tight

215
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:24,072
Which one is it?
Tie him up, or tie him down?

216
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:26,546
Both, Harry.

217
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,028
Hurry! We've got to get him
out of here before Mary sees him.

218
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:30,231
What are we going to do with him?

219
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:33,273
Let's take him to the
rambler and put him in the trunk,

220
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:36,503
like they do on that show, "homicide".

221
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:38,192
"homicide"?

222
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:40,291
"Life on the street."
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:43,873
Great idea. Tommy, Harry, run
down and clean out the trunk.

224
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:45,378
You got it.
- All right.

225
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,712
We'll be
right back, sir.

226
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,768
Don't be long...

227
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:56,837
Tommy.

228
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:04,835
Don't tire yourself
out, commander.

229
00:14:04,836 --> 00:14:07,618
I want you to witness
the destruction my little device

230
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:10,950
wreaks on
the world you love so well.

231
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,289
What have you done
to our toaster?

232
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:18,462
It's not a toaster.
It's an incubator.

233
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:20,386
When I press
this button,

234
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:23,437
millions of spores will be
released into the atmosphere,

235
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:25,073
spawning
a whole new race,

236
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:28,123
a race
of groveling drones.

237
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,454
They will think alike

238
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:31,536
and talk alike.

239
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,105
At times, they'll
even walk alike.

240
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:38,494
And I will be father
to them all.

241
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:41,337
What will happen to Mary?
- Oh, don't worry.

242
00:14:41,722 --> 00:14:43,558
I'm not using
this on her.

243
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:46,599
I'm going to take care
of her personally.

244
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,166
I'm going in there

245
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,558
and putting my feet
in her purse

246
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:54,144
again and again
and again.

247
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:55,889
You're insane!

248
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,903
And not Gallagher insane, just insane!

249
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:01,637
We cleaned out
the rambler, Dick.

250
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:05,405
Oh! You were able to use the gray duct tape.

251
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:07,613
Run!

252
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,183
No!

253
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:13,878
Stay...stay and witness my moment of glory.

254
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,987
as I impregnate

255
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:17,164
the entire
population of Ohio

256
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:20,046
with my demon progeny.

257
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,749
Uh, even the men?

258
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:25,861
Okay, not the men.

259
00:15:26,953 --> 00:15:29,939
Not little girls?
- No, no, not them.

260
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,467
What about elderly women?
- I don't think so.

261
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:34,990
What about women who are already pregnant?

262
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,529
Oh shut up, all of you!

263
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,806
Okay, so, apparently,
I won't be impregnating

264
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,700
the entire
population of Ohio,

265
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,667
but all fertile women
of childbearing age

266
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:49,405
who are not currently
pregnant, and that's a lot.

267
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,576
We're talking
lots of women here

268
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:54,500
who will soon
find themselves

269
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:56,223
now pregnant

270
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:57,636
by me.

271
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,809
It's as easy as one...

272
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,678
two...

273
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,160
three.

274
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:09,957
Yes !

275
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,494
Yes, that
will show him.

276
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,205
Not that I care...but er..

277
00:16:16,806 --> 00:16:17,993
show who?

278
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:21,413
Your father, that unfeeling purple tube

279
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,573
who gave you life but wouldn't give you love.

280
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,999
You know nothing
of my father.

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,984
So why don't you
just shut up?

282
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,604
'Cause you
don't know him.

283
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,932
You don't have
to defend him.

284
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:35,203
You can't change the past.
You have to live in the now.

285
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:37,180
This is the '90s,
girlfriend.

286
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:42,155
All I ever wanted
was approval.

287
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:44,981
Is it any wonder
I wet my bed?

288
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:49,548
I'm with you.

289
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:53,513
Your father's got you all caught up
in his emotional red tape,

290
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,094
and you need to cut yourself free.

291
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:56,617
What would you say

292
00:16:56,964 --> 00:16:58,683
if I told you

293
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,457
that your father
was here tonight?

294
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,070
Come on out!

295
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:04,505
What?

296
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,832
I'm just kidding.
He's not really here.

297
00:17:11,418 --> 00:17:13,897
I think you need to go
home and face him.

298
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:16,632
Let the cycle
of pain end here.

299
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:18,798
You're so right!

300
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,102
That's it.
Let it out.

301
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,470
Let it all out.

302
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,901
Hey, guys.
- Dennis, what are you doing here?

303
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,038
Long story.

304
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,457
I got a weird vibe from you guys yesterday.

305
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,000
Something wrong?

306
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:32,731
We could have used you about an hour ago.
What happened?

307
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:35,310
I got mobbed by all these people.

308
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,033
I gotta find a better disguise.

309
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,694
Why don't you try women's clothing?

310
00:17:38,695 --> 00:17:40,359
Tried it.
Doesn't work.

311
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,604
Dennis, could you
do us a favour?

312
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:47,263
Could you escort that
guy back to the home world?

313
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,242
Why not? I'm going that way anyway.

314
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:51,428
I've got a present for the big giant head.

315
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:52,143
What is it?

316
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:53,784
Big giant nose ring.

317
00:17:54,392 --> 00:17:56,088
Come on, come on.

318
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:57,470
Thank you, all.

319
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,194
I feel that I've made
a big breakthrough here.

320
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,215
Well, remember...

321
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,004
nobody's going
to respect you,

322
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:07,175
until you learn
to respect yourself.

323
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,098
Bed wetter.

324
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:14,182
And, Dennis, could you dispose of this
while you're at it?

325
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:15,772
You did it!

326
00:18:26,343 --> 00:18:27,256
You did it!

327
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:29,403
Oh, no, not just me,
lieutenant.

328
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:32,326
I had a little help from my friends.
- Oh, stop.

329
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:35,160
Ricki lake, jerry springer, and Sally Jessy.

330
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:37,609
Now listen up,
everyone.

331
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,285
I know that in the past I worried
that we watch too much television.

332
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,303
Well, all
I can say is,

333
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:45,867
god bless television

334
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:48,343
and the many ways
in which television

335
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,342
enriches our lives.

336
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:52,585
From now on,
I order you

337
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:54,309
to watch
more television

338
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,085
than ever before.

339
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,865
aye, aye, sir!

340
00:18:57,924 --> 00:19:00,460
What are we waiting for?
Tommy call the hut and get a pizza

341
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,779
Harry, warm up that television.
You got it.

342
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:04,162
....and, Sally,

343
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,808
go get yourself a decent pair of pants.

344
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,060
Oh thank you, sir.

345
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:25,653
Dr. Albright, the last time we were out here,

346
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:27,865
you said
something to me didn't you?.

347
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:29,976
You cared about me.

348
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:32,185
Is that still true?

349
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:33,777
Of course it's true.

350
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:37,146
Because over the last couple of
days, you've seen me at my worst.

351
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:39,606
That's what being
together is about.

352
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,387
If we're going to
have a relationship,

353
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,058
I want to have it
with all of you,

354
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:46,234
and that includes
the dark side.

355
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:50,023
You know, I care
about you, too.

356
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,308
You've made that
very clear.

357
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,659
So what do
we do now?

358
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,854
Well, it's been
a long night, but

359
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:58,967
why don't you just put
your arm around me,

360
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:00,999
and we'll look up
at the stars?

361
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:05,803
The stars, yes.

362
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,276
They look like lovers
locked in a celestial embrace.

363
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,302
Why don't you just
look at those trees?

364
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:16,848
The trees,
they look like lovers,

365
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,739
their limbs exploring
and fondling each other.

366
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,302
How about we look at
that couple in the window?

367
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:28,063
Wow! They're going
at it like trees.

368
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:03,158
Harry, is there
something different about you?

369
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,086
You've lost weight.
- Nope.

370
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,024
Is that a new shirt?
- Nope.

371
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:10,774
Oh, wait! You shaved off your beard.
- Nope. I never had one.

372
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:12,693
It's something.

373
00:21:12,694 --> 00:21:14,580
You got
a haircut.

374
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:16,305
You're getting warmer.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
