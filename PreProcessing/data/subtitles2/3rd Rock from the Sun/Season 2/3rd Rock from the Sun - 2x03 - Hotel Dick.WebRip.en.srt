1
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:04,596
Oh, my god!

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,770
Aliens are not
like that.

3
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,879
Oh, the senseless
violence.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,080
The mindless gore.

5
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,381
The incredible sound system.

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,548
There must have been 30 speakers in
that place. That movie kicked butt.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,474
How can you say that?

8
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,371
They portrayed aliens
as vicious monsters.

9
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:24,501
They blew up the
department of transportation.

10
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,715
Do you mind? We haven't seen the movie yet.

11
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:28,112
What do I care? I don't even know you.

12
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:30,610
Don't you think
it was cool

13
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:34,265
when that thing's tongue split open
and strangled those eight army guys?

14
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, that was cool...
- Yeah.

15
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,447
But only that, and only
because it made me scream

16
00:00:38,448 --> 00:00:39,847
like a little girl.

17
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,834
They have to make the aliens
scary. That's entertainment.

18
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,579
Sucking the brains out of all
those zoo animals is not entertainment.

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,016
Hey, up there, shut up!

20
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:52,076
Hey, quiet.

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,405
It's how these people
think of us.

22
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:57,614
They didn't care whether the aliens
were good or bad. They wanted them dead.

23
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:01,065
What am I going to do? Mary..
she's already seen this movie.

24
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:04,478
So? She doesn't know
you're an alien. Does she?

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,382
Oh, please.

26
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:06,360
Does she?

27
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,783
I said, "oh, please."
Isn't that enough?

28
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:09,607
Does she?

29
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:10,889
No!

30
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,689
Attention,
ticket holders!

31
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,638
Listen up. At the end of the movie,

32
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,281
when the president
turns out to be an alien..

33
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:23,789
and he barbecues
all the congressmen,

34
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,552
don't believe it
because aliens hate barbecue.

35
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:30,723
If you don't shut up, I'm going to kill you.
- All Righty.

36
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,383
And that goes for all of you.
- Did you hear that guy?

37
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,212
He hasn't seen the movie, and he already wants to kill us.

38
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:36,808
We are in big trouble here.

39
00:01:36,809 --> 00:01:39,354
We've got to lay low
until this mania passes over.

40
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:40,753
Maybe build a bunker.

41
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:42,804
No! We can't hide.

42
00:01:42,805 --> 00:01:45,078
I say we come out of the
bunker and into the street.

43
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,986
I say we hold
an alien pride parade.

44
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:51,119
We'll all
get together,

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,472
and we'll prove
that we're all..

46
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,790
humans.

47
00:02:30,872 --> 00:02:32,437
Hello.
"Rutherford bugle"?

48
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,710
I'd like to speak to
your film critic, please.

49
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:38,742
Oh. Well, then, will you tell him
that I just saw "Dawn of the Aliens,

50
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:40,170
and it was not wham-bam?

51
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:43,049
It was not a slam dunk. I was
never on the edge of my seat.

52
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,329
And the special effects
did not make my eyes pop out.

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,404
There's no cream in here!

54
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:50,733
Well, you don't have to bite my head off.

55
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,960
Nina, we don't
do that.

56
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,851
Hello, Dick.

57
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:58,169
Oh, Mary.

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,361
You notice how
I'm being gentle and not

59
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:04,506
squeezing your body until
your spleen shoots out of your mouth?

60
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:08,301
Yes, I noticed that.
Thank You.

61
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,674
Oh! Speaking of spleens,

62
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:12,530
did you see
"Dawn of the Aliens"?

63
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,093
Wasn't that movie great?

64
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:18,440
It was two hours and four minutes
of horrible, horrible lies.

65
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:21,627
I liked it.
- Me, too. I was on the edge of my seat.

66
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:25,524
They portray aliens as
hideous, evil mutants.

67
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,204
Why can't they be sweet
and well-mannered?

68
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:31,092
I don't pay seven bucks to
see an alien play with a puppy.

69
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,532
At that price
he better eat it.

70
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,830
Tommy?
Tommy,

71
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:43,540
They're having a sci-fi
convention in Cleveland.

72
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,981
"Meet all the aliens from your
favourite Tv shows and movies.

73
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:49,484
And 'Star Trek's'
Mr. Sulu, George Takei,

74
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,380
will be signing copies
of his new book,

75
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:55,326
'Warp Speed, Damn It: The
complete rants of William Shatner".

76
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:59,426
This would be a perfect
place to help people understand

77
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:01,920
how wrong their impressions of us aliens are.

78
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,738
Or we could just blow
the whole damn place up.

79
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,788
Would you guys lift
your feet, please?

80
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:11,619
Lift your feet.
Lift feet!

81
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:14,373
What's your problem?

82
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,051
Sally, turn off
your sucking device.

83
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,029
What is it?

84
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,412
I need your support. I've
made the most difficult decision

85
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:26,899
I've had to make since
coming to this planet.

86
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,827
You're giving up
tighty whities

87
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:32,569
and switching to boxers?
Nooooooo!

88
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,557
It's not about
underwear, Harry,

89
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:37,761
although I have switched.

90
00:04:41,078 --> 00:04:42,419
I've decided
to tell Mary

91
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,276
that I am what
humans would call,

92
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:46,609
in their
galactocentric way,

93
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:48,396
an alien.

94
00:04:48,397 --> 00:04:51,007
No..are you crazy? Why are you doing this?

95
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,162
You've never blown your
cover on any other mission.

96
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:54,450
I've never felt
the need to.

97
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,635
I keep having these feelings.

98
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:02,584
It's this fleshy
human slipcover.

99
00:05:02,585 --> 00:05:05,043
Oh, sure, it's
dashing, tall,

100
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,252
manly,

101
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,742
washable,

102
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:12,482
but somehow it just
makes me feel so awful

103
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:14,091
about deceiving
the woman I love.

104
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:17,364
All right, look. Let's just
think this thing through, okay?

105
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:20,036
I'll be her. Here I am.
I'm Mary,

106
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:21,174
sitting at my desk.

107
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,483
Now, you come in
and tell me.

108
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:30,878
Hello, Mary.

109
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:32,917
Dick.

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,840
You look
handsome today.

111
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:38,265
And you look more beautiful than ever.

112
00:05:43,084 --> 00:05:46,260
All right. Let's just start over.

113
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,110
Hello, Mary.
- Dick!

114
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:00,085
I can't kiss you today
because I've got the flu.

115
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:03,132
As do I.

116
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:06,216
Mary, I am
an alien.

117
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:11,893
She's dead!

118
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:18,254
You killed her,
you alien bastard!

119
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,847
Why?

120
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:21,662
Why?

121
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,428
This is nonsense! I'm going to tell her.

122
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:24,711
You're going to get us all killed.

123
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:25,894
I'm only telling one person.

124
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:27,781
Sir, as security officer,
I forbid.

125
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:30,957
And, as high commander, I have
to say tough toenails, lieutenant.

126
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,023
Fine. Let it be on your head.

127
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:35,928
Which is going to be sitting next to
ours on a tray somewhere in new Mexico.

128
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:39,661
I am telling you, humans cannot
handle this kind of information.

129
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:41,779
Mary can.

130
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,080
I just have to find the right
setting, the right atmosphere

131
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,981
where the elegant beauty of
our magnificent surroundings

132
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:51,044
help her to embrace
the truth and me.

133
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,211
They're having a sci-fi
convention in Cleveland.

134
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:55,210
Perfect!

135
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:58,006
Pack your bags, kids.
We're going on a road trip.

136
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,007
Sweet.

137
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:10,701
Ooh! - Oh! - Ahh!

138
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:12,600
Look at this place.

139
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:15,267
Our first hotel room.

140
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,662
Wow! Why do I suddenly have the urge

141
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:18,991
to trash it?

142
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:24,281
Hey, you guys, look at this tiny bottle
I found in the bathroom.

143
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:29,035
Evidence of a superior race
of tiny people.

144
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:31,661
How can you tell
they're superior?

145
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:35,683
Because it's a shampoo
and conditioner in one.

146
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,611
A tiny fridge.

147
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,995
Filled with tiny
bottles of alcohol,

148
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:45,029
and tiny bags of macadamia nuts!

149
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:47,645
These people might be tiny,
but they know how to party.

150
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:49,497
How do they get up
on the bed,

151
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:53,509
especially when they're
all drunk and fat on nuts?

152
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:01,488
Just tell me when.

153
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:03,139
When.

154
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,482
When I've poured enough to
slake your thirst for champagne.

155
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:07,732
When.

156
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,655
Whenever your heart desires.

157
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:11,136
When, stop, now.

158
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,050
Now?
Yeah, yes, now, now!

159
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:17,799
Half a bottle
for one glass.

160
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,768
You are a wild woman,

161
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:22,368
but then
I accept that.

162
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,334
I may be wild, but I'm not going to bite.

163
00:08:25,335 --> 00:08:28,344
And neither will I,
and that's the whole point.

164
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:30,507
There will be no biting,
no bloodletting,

165
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:32,444
no cranial explosions.

166
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,879
What's with you?

167
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,104
All right, Mary,
you've sniffed me out.

168
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:40,876
I brought you here under the
guise of a romantic holiday

169
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:42,786
to tell you something
about myself.

170
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:44,989
This is very difficult.

171
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,731
I don't want
you to judge me.

172
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:49,585
I never judge you.

173
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:53,932
Sometimes I do.
Often.

174
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,936
Always. I'll try not to this time.

175
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,545
Mary, before
I met you,

176
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:01,744
I was completely different.
I was far,

177
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,218
far away from here.

178
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:04,985
And ever since
I left that place,

179
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,842
I've been fighting
so hard to fit in.

180
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:10,533
And if ever anyone found
out, I'd have to go back

181
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:13,888
because I could never live
in this world any longer.

182
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,371
Oh, Dick,

183
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,169
were you
in a... "Clinic"?

184
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,717
Clinic?
- It's okay.

185
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:26,126
So was I.

186
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,369
Oh!

187
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,220
Wake up, everybody!

188
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:50,812
We're going to
the sci-fi convention.

189
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,356
What's so important about
this sci-fi convention?

190
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,357
Don't you see?

191
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,660
It's a perfect opportunity
to take a stand,

192
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:07,233
to protest how the rest of
the world is treating our kind.

193
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,613
You want to be some kind
of alien Martin Luther king?

194
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:10,915
Exactly,

195
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:14,113
because I, too,
have a dream,

196
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,288
and in that dream
I'm naked on a ferris wheel.

197
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:22,618
I'll meet you guys
in the lobby.

198
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:25,052
I'm going to go make sure
Dick hasn't blown our cover.

199
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:27,297
Sally, there's a note
for you on the door.

200
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:30,574
"Please make up room".

201
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:37,774
All right, I'll do it when we get back.

202
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:41,229
We're going to the sci-fi convention!

203
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:48,604
I've never told
anyone this before,

204
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:51,891
but when I was a little girl.. nine, 10...

205
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,202
17..

206
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,302
I was fat.

207
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:56,803
How fat?

208
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,588
Fat enough that everybody made fun of me.

209
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:01,755
Fat as a cow?
Is that how fat?

210
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:04,766
That's not important.
- Right, sorry. You go on.

211
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,177
Anyway, instead of
reaching out for help, I..

212
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:09,418
I turned inward
and became bitter

213
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,111
and disillusioned with the world around me.

214
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:13,812
300 pounds? 400..
- Dick!

215
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:15,089
Sorry.

216
00:11:16,064 --> 00:11:18,030
My parents just
made it worse.

217
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:20,577
They had this notion
that I was going to be

218
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,080
an Olympic
figure skater.

219
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:24,744
They forced me
into a leotard.

220
00:11:25,843 --> 00:11:28,863
I looked like a sausage
in purple velour casing.

221
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:32,852
And when I skated, they
called me the Zamboni.

222
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:37,261
Then one day I..
I cracked.

223
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,797
The ice?
- Mentally!

224
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:43,144
I cracked mentally.
- Mentally, yes.

225
00:11:44,061 --> 00:11:46,587
My parents sent me
to a special place..

226
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:49,188
camp knock-a-lot-
of-Weight-off.

227
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:52,252
Mary, that is just terrible.
I'm so sorry.

228
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,787
Oh no, it's fine, really.

229
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,789
Thanks for letting me
confide in you.

230
00:11:57,287 --> 00:12:01,137
Now, why were you
in a clinic?

231
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:03,809
Oh, uh, well,
funny story.

232
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,939
I was, uh...
how can I put this...Not.

233
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:08,645
What?!

234
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,646
Here goes. I am..

235
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:12,731
just hold that thought.

236
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:14,684
Sally!

237
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,814
I need to talk
to Dick for a second, in private.

238
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:18,790
Don't you have some little girly thing
you need to do in the bathroom?

239
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,923
No.
- Then just go sit in there.

240
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:22,929
Excuse me?
- You're excused.

241
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,679
What, uh..
well!

242
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:28,388
This had better be good!

243
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,930
I was this close
to pouring my heart out.

244
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:30,974
Then I arrived in time.

245
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:32,825
She just told me one of her deepest secrets.

246
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,322
She used to be fat.
- Fat as a cow?

247
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:36,810
That's not the point.

248
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:39,002
The point is, she can't keep a secret.

249
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:41,732
And you tell her, the next thing you know, the
air force has sealed off the neighborhood.

250
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,367
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

251
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:46,739
Okay, how about this one? You
tell her you're an alien,

252
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,767
and she freaks out,
runs away,

253
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,095
and you never see
her again, ever.

254
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:53,998
Oh...

255
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:57,276
Well..in my scenario, she
comes running into my arms.

256
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,063
Well,

257
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:01,386
just a risk you're
going to have to take...

258
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,144
Alien.

259
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:24,694
But it's fascinating, though, isn't it?
- What?

260
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:27,941
How these people fulfill
their lives through fantasy.

261
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,323
It's like those guys
that spend all of their time

262
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:32,501
reading those fake letters in "penthouse".

263
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,259
They're fake?

264
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,604
Can you imagine what
these people would do

265
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:40,707
if they met
an actual alien?

266
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,952
They would
completely freak out.

267
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:46,173
I don't know. In a way, aren't we all aliens?

268
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,232
I mean, we emerge from
weightless environments,

269
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:51,237
seeing everything
for the first time with

270
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:52,238
curious
new eyes,

271
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,430
every emotion brand-new,
always discovering,

272
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:57,188
always learning.

273
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,225
Yeah, you keep
overthinking life.

274
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:02,109
I'm going to get a couple of space churros.

275
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:05,924
See? Somebody broke into the room.

276
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,277
Look at this place.

277
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:11,357
Looks clean to me.

278
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:12,249
Exactly!

279
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:15,130
They cleaned everything, made
the beds, rewrapped the soap,

280
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:17,345
sanitized the toilet
for my protection.

281
00:14:17,346 --> 00:14:19,412
Look, look,
look, look!

282
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,947
The maid was here.

283
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,436
The maid?
There's a maid?

284
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,674
Housekeeping.

285
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:31,125
Here. It's a whole book of services
the hotel has to offer.

286
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:35,947
Dry cleaning, wake-Up calls,
in-room dining?

287
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,988
Yes, ma'am,
room service.

288
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:40,991
Room service?

289
00:14:43,646 --> 00:14:45,303
Room...

290
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,270
service.

291
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:51,242
Do you know what this means?

292
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:52,538
No, ma'am.

293
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:54,085
We're in heaven.

294
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,346
You, my good man,

295
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:59,274
are the assistant manager
of heaven.

296
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,710
Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye-bye.

297
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:10,839
Hi. Yes, erm...

298
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,227
This is Sally Solomon
in room 605.

299
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:15,732
Can I get
a turkey sandwich?

300
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:18,063
I can?

301
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:21,838
Can I get 10?

302
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,894
Live long and prosper.

303
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:34,172
Hailing frequencies open,
everybody. I'm George Takei.

304
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:41,220
Seeing all of you here
makes me feel like a kid again,

305
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:44,402
almost as if,
as Mr. Sulu once said,

306
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:47,216
my chronometer's
running backwards.

307
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,625
Ha!

308
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,040
You people are
living a lie.

309
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,662
Look at yourselves,

310
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:56,456
embracing negative
alien stereotypes.

311
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,751
Did you ever stop to think
that maybe aliens are friendly,

312
00:15:59,752 --> 00:16:01,399
kind, attractive
people?

313
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,066
Uh, security?

314
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:06,178
Hath not
an Alien eyes

315
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:07,531
or buttocks?

316
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:12,040
If you prick an alien, does it not say
"Ow, ow, ow"?

317
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,149
We should not embrace

318
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,250
science fiction.

319
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,553
Screw sci-fi.

320
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:22,600
Instead, we
should embrace science facts..

321
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:25,617
"sci-fa".

322
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,323
Harry, let's go now.

323
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:29,539
Long live sci-fa.

324
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:31,978
You there,

325
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:33,474
forget the
windows and scrub that sink

326
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:35,542
until I see my face in it. Thanks.

327
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:37,977
Ooh, coming!

328
00:16:39,193 --> 00:16:40,630
Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Good afternoon.

329
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:41,882
I'm here to pick up your dry cleaning.

330
00:16:41,883 --> 00:16:45,023
Yeah that pile on the luggage.
Hell, do the luggage, too.

331
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:46,905
Sally, I just
feel terrible.

332
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,800
Well, you're doing the right
thing by not telling her, honey.

333
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,672
Darling, when you're done
with the bathroom,

334
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:54,630
dust the credenza and
fertilize the potted plants.

335
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,622
I'm want 'em blooming
and making me happy.

336
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:59,777
I came here with the sole
purpose of coming clean,

337
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,663
and now I feel so dirty.

338
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:03,488
Just take a bubble bath.
You know,

339
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,743
the tub's got
beautifully positioned jets,

340
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:07,307
and the shower
turns into a sauna.

341
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:09,069
"Dirty" was
a metaphor lieutenant.

342
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,116
I'm sure it was, honey.

343
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:11,715
Hi. Yes, uh..

344
00:17:11,716 --> 00:17:13,483
Could we get some eucalyptus oil up here,

345
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:16,094
and a couple of big, fat loofahs? Thanks.

346
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,870
Sally?
- Hello, boys.

347
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,437
What's all this stuff?

348
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:24,665
Room... service.

349
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:28,704
Room Service.

350
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,850
If I want a towel,
they send it up.

351
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:32,325
If I want a radish,
they send it up.

352
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:35,206
They set up a laptop, a fax, a Vcr. And why?

353
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:39,012
Because until checkout time tomorrow,
I'm their Queen.

354
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:42,380
I'm glad you're having a good time.
- I am.

355
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:45,705
I'll be down in my room.
Are these chocolate truffles?

356
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:47,452
Hey! Get your own
French sampler.

357
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:55,009
How can you look
at yourself?

358
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:58,251
Deceiving the person you
love for the sake of a mission.

359
00:17:58,252 --> 00:17:59,349
Look at you.

360
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,306
You're gorgeous!

361
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,055
Did you say something?
- Oh, no, nothing.

362
00:18:07,056 --> 00:18:09,750
Tell her, tell her, but how?

363
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:15,953
Stand back,
Earth man,

364
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:19,127
and prepare to be
demolecularized

365
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:21,059
in ways you've
never imagined.

366
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,181
Mary?
- I'm not Mary.

367
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:28,018
I am uma from the planet Thurman.

368
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,789
Remove your
earth pants.

369
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:35,076
Any resistance will
be futile, human.

370
00:18:35,077 --> 00:18:35,854
Human.

371
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:39,024
But I'm not human.

372
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,982
I've been
deceiving you.

373
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:44,635
I'm an alien
from a planet

374
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:48,405
in the bard spiral galaxy
on the Cepheus Draco border.

375
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:51,019
I was sent here
by our leader,

376
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,973
the big giant head,
to explore this planet.

377
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:57,182
Dick Solomon is
just a facade,

378
00:18:57,383 --> 00:18:59,930
hiding a quivering
purple tube.

379
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:02,062
I am the high
commander,

380
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:05,691
and this...
is my salute.

381
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:14,431
Oh, really?

382
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,699
I have seen
your planet.

383
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,673
It is a savage place
and must be conquered.

384
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh, Mary.

385
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:27,699
Ow!
- Ow! Oh.

386
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:36,288
This is Harry Solomon. I'd
like to get another massage

387
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:38,539
cause I'm starting to
feel a little tense again.

388
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:42,305
Hey, look
what I found.

389
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,571
Oh, what is it?

390
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:46,373
It looks like a list of
everything we got while we were here.

391
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:49,953
Lobster, lobster,
lobster, lobster.

392
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:51,812
Hey, what's that number
there at the bottom?

393
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:54,209
It's probably the
population of Cleveland or something.

394
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,077
That's your bill.

395
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:03,517
Oh, my god.
- No way.

396
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,861
What are we
going to do?

397
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:07,647
Harry, get me the laptop, the modem,

398
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:09,873
the magnetic strip key
that got us into this room,

399
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:12,053
and a shower cap.

400
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:15,364
Good morning,
Mr. Takei.

401
00:20:15,365 --> 00:20:17,599
Good morning.
I'm checking out.

402
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,907
Of course.
Here's your bill, sir.

403
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,832
Three thousand dollars

404
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:26,833
Well, that's all right.

405
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,981
I can afford it,
I'm a famous actor.

406
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,096
I'm sorry.
That's thirty thousand dollars Mr. Takei.

407
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,237
Oh, my.

408
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,997
14 bottles of champagne,
shrimp cocktails,

409
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,069
hummus on pita tips?

410
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,761
Look, I had a toblerone
and two ginger ales.

411
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:54,915
That's it!

412
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,222
Seven massages? How
could I get seven massages?

413
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,374
Do I look relaxed?
Do I?

414
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:02,864
What's this?

415
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,508
All right,
so I took one towel.

416
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,509
One towel!

417
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,464
I'm George Takei,
damn it!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
