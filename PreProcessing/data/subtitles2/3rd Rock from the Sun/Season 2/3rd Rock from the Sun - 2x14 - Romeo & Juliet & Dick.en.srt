1
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:14,985
Dick, I need a favour.
- Uh, not now, Tommy.

2
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,002
I'm doing research. I'm finding out
what happens when the spit hits the fan.

3
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:21,781
No, Dick, look,

4
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:23,019
this is important.

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,834
Take a look at this.
- Actors on acting?

6
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,193
Yeah. You know how you're
always trying to find new ways

7
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:30,739
to explore
the human feelings?

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,898
Ah, "Using Your Emotional Memory",
"The search for emotional truth

9
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,451
will stimulate
your emotional juices".

10
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:38,400
"Emotional juices"?

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,851
I love my juices.
This is exciting!

12
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:44,410
Yeah, I knew you'd like it, that's why I
volunteered you to direct our school play.

13
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,426
Me, direct? As in, control?
- Yeah, it's Romeo and Juliet.

14
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:50,494
August wants to play Juliet, and if
you direct, you can cast me as Romeo.

15
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:52,126
I'll do it!

16
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,870
That's so great, 'cause there
are some major make-out scenes.

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,190
And also some really
powerful emotional stuff.

18
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,244
I get to die.

19
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,536
I can just see it now
on the Marquee..

20
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:07,597
"Dick Solomon directs
a Dick Solomon production

21
00:01:07,598 --> 00:01:09,901
of Dick Solomon's
Romeo and Juliet."

22
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,620
Yeah, whatever.
- Hmm.

23
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:16,135
"Naturally, an actor must
play the truth of the scene,

24
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:18,943
and not indulge
in emotion for its own sake."

25
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:20,640
Well, anyone knows that.

26
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,489
I didn't know you were interested in acting.

27
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,383
Well, yes I am, but what I
really want to do is direct.

28
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:28,670
I'm not saying
that I couldn't act.

29
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,964
I could be very convincing.
Light comedy..

30
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:34,454
horror..

31
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:36,972
tragedy.

32
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:41,502
Morning.
- Look, Mary!

33
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,348
I'm distraught!

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,216
Or am I?

35
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:50,278
Okay. You have a registered letter.
- Oh, what is it?

36
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,712
Damn, damn, damn, damn!

37
00:01:56,713 --> 00:02:00,058
I owe fifteen hundred
dollars in parking tickets.

38
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:01,935
So they finally
caught up with you.

39
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:04,345
Guess I'll have
to dip into my savings.

40
00:02:04,346 --> 00:02:07,664
Oh, no, no, I couldn't bear to
let you do that. I'll pay them.

41
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:10,980
You will?
- No. I'm acting!

42
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,859
Lo, and resolve itself

43
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:56,228
Dick!
Dick, guess what?

44
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:58,443
Ms. Dubcek's give me
all her old junk.

45
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:03,184
Yeah, I've got some friends
dropping by I haven't seen in 10 years,

46
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:04,656
and I'm cleaning out
the place.

47
00:03:04,657 --> 00:03:07,197
There's some really great stuff in here.

48
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:10,804
Dr. Solomon,
if you want to come down,

49
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:13,304
I'll let you rummage through my tchotchkes.
- Oh, I'm..

50
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:16,829
I'm flattered Mrs. Dubcek, but
I think of you more as a friend.

51
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:22,659
What are you watching?
- Oh, it's Hamlet with Lawrence Oliver.

52
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,776
I've watched it
three times already.

53
00:03:25,177 --> 00:03:27,319
Huh.. I like the way
he makes his voice

54
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,571
go up and down like that.
- I know.

55
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:31,486
It makes everything
he says sound so...

56
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:33,137
fruity?

57
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:36,460
No, important!
- Oh.

58
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:40,340
Hey, guys. You still
watching that stuff?

59
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:42,204
It's not "stuff,"
it's Hamlet.

60
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,036
Yeah, but why do they have to talk
that way? I can't follow the story.

61
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:47,526
Hamlet? The story is as old as time.

62
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,579
Pretty-boy son has a rich
daddy and a good-looking mommy.

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,268
The uncle knocks off daddy, marries mommy,

64
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,652
and he cuts pretty boy
out of the action.

65
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:59,562
So junior goes crazy
and he kills them all.

66
00:04:00,102 --> 00:04:02,907
Not a pretty story,
but there it is.

67
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,710
Isn't that the plot
to the lion king?

68
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,162
Oh, please!

69
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:17,764
I need your help, Don. I'm in a bit of a scrape.
- Figures.

70
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,930
Dames like you
always attract trouble.

71
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:23,896
I got another parking ticket.
Can you fix it, Don, or...

72
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,256
am I leaning
too hard?

73
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:29,972
Go ahead
and lean, baby.

74
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:32,375
Don'll make
the ticket go away.

75
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:35,190
What?
You can make parking tickets disappear?

76
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,641
Of course he can. Don
has connections downtown.

77
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:40,080
Why..I have a friend who has
some parking tickets.

78
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:42,629
I can't always..
- Don can fix it, right?

79
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,617
Well, uh..
- Right?

80
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,752
Sure.
- Oh, this is just great!

81
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,550
Oh, I can't wait
to tell Mary.

82
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,752
Some of you
will not be cast.

83
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,607
Those will be
the lucky ones.

84
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,382
Over the long and grueling
rehearsal period,

85
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,767
I will be your director,
your teacher, your mentor,

86
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,407
your mother, your father,
your lover!

87
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:26,351
My assistant, Nina,
will read your names.

88
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,283
Nina?
- Okay, um,

89
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,712
Timothy Mafferty..
he's reading Mercutio.

90
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,592
"True, I talk
of dreams, which..

91
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:36,172
yes, yes, yes,
of course.

92
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:38,942
But have you
tried it like this?

93
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,158
Make your voice go high,
and then suddenly

94
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,024
bring it down.

95
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:46,412
Here. "True, I speak of
dreams which are but children

96
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,006
of an idle
brain,

97
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:50,980
begot of nothing
but vain fan...

98
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:53,111
...tasies.

99
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,164
From now on, I want
everyone to try to speak that way.

100
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,901
Oh, and use
your hands a lot.

101
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:58,456
We're acting.
Remember that.

102
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,472
He was touched by an anvil.

103
00:06:09,797 --> 00:06:11,928
Remind me never to ask
you for another favour again.

104
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,603
You weren't right for the role.
- Hey, How'd the audition go?

105
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:18,174
I lost the part. The director
didn't think I was good enough.

106
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:21,141
You were good. You had
delivery, presence, timing.

107
00:06:21,142 --> 00:06:24,184
You just didn't have that
indefinable something extra.

108
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:28,187
I was just trying to score some points
with my girlfriend. Is that too much to ask?

109
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,548
Romeo and Juliet
is a Shakespearian tragedy,

110
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:33,346
and has nothing to do with a
horny teenager and his girlfriend.

111
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:39,945
Go ahead,
Dr. Albright.

112
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:44,190
Hello, Don. Dr. Solomon thought you
might be able to help me with this.

113
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:47,468
Well, I have been known
to bend a few..

114
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:50,915
You have fifteen hundred dollars in fines.

115
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,630
And, "Poof", they're gone.

116
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:54,785
I can't "Poof" this many tickets.

117
00:06:55,086 --> 00:06:57,020
One more, and she'd
be in handcuffs.

118
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,046
I was going to pay them.
- What happened?

119
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,595
I didn't.

120
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:03,988
Well, maybe if you got
a lenient judge,

121
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:05,982
he might reduce
the fine.

122
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,881
Your court date is
on the 27th.

123
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:11,427
Twenty-seventh.. oh.

124
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:12,815
Judge Debelko.

125
00:07:13,615 --> 00:07:15,609
Sounds bad. Is it bad?
- It's bad.

126
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,695
You'd be better off
with Judge Conti.

127
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:20,273
Now, when I go to court,
should I apologise

128
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:23,064
to Judge Conti
or just show some remorse?

129
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:26,515
Actually, it might be helpful
if you'd show some cleavage.

130
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:28,949
He can't be serious.
- Trust me.

131
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,792
We're gonna paint your face and hike
your puppies.

132
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,037
I know what I'm doing, right Don?

133
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:38,807
"O Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou"

134
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,629
yes, yes.
Very lovely.

135
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,878
Darling, what are you playing?
Fear, love, lust?

136
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,710
Because the audience
is playing boredom.

137
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,997
I'm playing Juliet,

138
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:55,876
and it's really hard for me
to concentrate when you..

139
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:57,503
Props? Where's props?

140
00:07:57,773 --> 00:07:58,373
What?

141
00:07:58,374 --> 00:08:01,687
This candlestick is
18th-century English.

142
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:05,268
Shakespeare was English.
- True.

143
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,411
But the play
is set in Verona.

144
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,804
Please, Tommy, I'm struggling to
wring a performance out of this

145
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:12,702
ragtag company of mannequins
from the junior miss department.

146
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:15,875
I can't do your job too. In the
future I suggest you leave it lay.

147
00:08:15,876 --> 00:08:19,052
Now, everyone watch once
again as I act out the play

148
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,090
in its entirety.

149
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:25,501
Nina, Nina,
read me in.

150
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,235
Curtain rises.
A big, pompous blowhard

151
00:08:30,236 --> 00:08:31,835
flounces
on to the stage.

152
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:45,216
Listen, I'm really sorry
you had to be the prop guy,

153
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:48,262
'cause, you know, if you were cast
as romeo,

154
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:51,262
we could have done
some serious making out.

155
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,315
We.. we could make out
right now.

156
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:59,024
With the prop guy?
Ha! Sorry.

157
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:03,127
Hey, what you making?

158
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:05,990
An authentic renaissance sleeping potion.

159
00:09:05,991 --> 00:09:08,829
Now I just have to find an
15th-Century Italian vial.

160
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:13,107
Oh, Well, I find
Galileo "Vile".

161
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:21,001
Well, this is
the final box.

162
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:23,734
I am beat.
- Oh, thank you. You want some juice?

163
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:27,802
Oh, please. I'll have to introduce
you to my friends when they drop by.

164
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:29,686
They're lovely,
very nice.

165
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:34,100
There's Diane
and her husband..and Jimmy.

166
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:41,206
Jimmy's an old flame. I
knew he'd come back for more.

167
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,827
Come back
for more what?

168
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:48,007
I said, "come back
for more what"?

169
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:52,718
What happened?

170
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,268
Oh, great! You let her drink the prop?

171
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,872
Well, at least
we know it works.

172
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:09,814
I beg for justice, which
thou, prince, must give.

173
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:12,398
Romeo slew Tybalt,
Romeo must not live.

174
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,530
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

175
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,704
no, no, no!

176
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,770
You are Lady Capulet.

177
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,757
Your kinsman Tybalt has
been killed! He's dead!

178
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:30,787
You're asking for justice, not extra
pickles on your happy burger. Justice!

179
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:34,636
You're supposed to act!
Now bleed! Just act! Now act!

180
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,775
I can't act, Dr. Solomon.
- Yes, you can!

181
00:10:39,295 --> 00:10:42,319
I can't..
I can't act.

182
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,511
Do your lines.
Now, now!

183
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,445
I beg for justice,

184
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,205
which thou, prince,
must give.

185
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:52,313
Romeo slew Tybalt,

186
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:55,125
Romeo must not live.

187
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:05,105
I want everyone to take
a good look at Cheryl,

188
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:08,384
because Cheryl,

189
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:10,581
is an actor.

190
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:16,393
Hello?
Damn it, voice mail.

191
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,357
Hello, Dr. Albright?

192
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:20,830
This is sergeant..

193
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:26,813
this is a friend..
with a message.

194
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:30,789
Don't come to court today.
There's been a change in plans.

195
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:35,396
Next,
Dr. Mary Albright?

196
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:37,919
Here your honour.

197
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,277
Sally, didn't you
get my messages?

198
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:50,031
What messages?

199
00:11:50,032 --> 00:11:53,015
They switched judges.
I've been calling all morning.

200
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:56,586
You're charged with fifteen hundred
dollars in outstanding fines.

201
00:11:56,587 --> 00:11:57,529
How do you plead?

202
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,671
All I can say
is I'm so sorry,

203
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,957
and I throw myself
on the mercy of the court.

204
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,353
Really.

205
00:12:07,654 --> 00:12:10,010
Dr. Albright, will you
please approach this bench?

206
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,349
You have a very big bench.

207
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,263
I don't know what this
little charade is about.

208
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:25,368
We're trying to influence you.
- Sergeant, please remove that woman.

209
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,872
Doesn't he know who you are?
You have a gun, Don! Use it!

210
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,467
Dr. Albright, you "have"
influenced this court.

211
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:35,973
Really?
I am fining you the full amount,

212
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:37,263
plus court costs,

213
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:41,361
plus five hundred dollars for contempt.
Next.

214
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,115
But your honour..
- Next.

215
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,691
Thank you so much!

216
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:51,141
The one time that I can help the woman I
love, and your friend Don falls through!

217
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,324
It was just an ironic
twist of fate. Don't blame Don.

218
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,798
I don't want you hanging around that
police station any more, you hear me?

219
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,416
Fine, I'll go to his place.
- Oh, no, you won't.

220
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,658
Oh, yes, I will!

221
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,023
You hold it right there,
I'm not finished with you yet.

222
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:05,012
Oh, uh, hey, Mrs. Dubcek,
would you mind..

223
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,917
My god, she's dead!

224
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:14,234
Oh, what is it?
Oh, her.

225
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:18,382
She's not dead.
- But she's cold. She's not breathing.

226
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,278
Oh, you guys.
She's fine.

227
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,247
She drank the potion.

228
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:25,518
The sleeping potion?
From Romeo and Juliet?

229
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,269
Well, guess we can take her
downstairs until she comes to.

230
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,226
Here, Harry, get her feet.
Sally, help with the door.

231
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:36,108
Hi, baby, it's us!

232
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,918
Hi!
- Get her inside! Get her inside!

233
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,595
Who are those people?

234
00:13:40,596 --> 00:13:43,845
Oh, well, um, it's Diane,
and her husband and Jimmy,

235
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:45,954
an old flame
coming back for more.

236
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,855
This is just great!
Didn't you make an antidote?

237
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,686
Hmm, is there one
in the play?

238
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:55,270
If they see her like this, the
spit is really gonna hit the fan.

239
00:13:55,823 --> 00:13:58,640
What are we gonna do?
- Wait! I have a brilliant idea.

240
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:01,994
Harry, did you know that in a
theater of Shakespeare's day

241
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,788
the women's roles were played by men?
- Really?

242
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:06,206
Yeah, and they also tied up
bears and threw rocks at 'em.

243
00:14:08,837 --> 00:14:11,351
It's the role of a
lifetime Harry, an actor's dream.

244
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:14,560
Come on, let's get her in the bathroom.
- I don't want to!

245
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:18,382
Dick, you can't pass Harry off
as Mrs. Dubcek! They'll know!

246
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:21,219
Ah! You forget, they
haven't seen her in over 10 years.

247
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,675
Besides, Harry has a secret weapon.
- What?

248
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,405
A great director!

249
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,402
Hello?
Anybody home?

250
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:31,984
Uh, no, nobody's here. Why don't
we go into the living room, okay?

251
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:34,232
Yeah, this way. Right,
move along. Faster.

252
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:35,988
Okay, right there.

253
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:38,532
Why don't you take a seat,
make yourself comfortable?

254
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,690
I can't believe
she got somebody

255
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,902
to pay rent
for this crap-hole.

256
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:45,392
Yeah, every month.
- Yeah,

257
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:47,938
and we just love Mrs. Dubcek.
- Ohh.

258
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:50,183
Even more
since the accident.

259
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:52,901
"Accident"?

260
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:56,529
Yes. Changed her, considerably.

261
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,750
Uh, and, uh, she refused
the estrogen therapy, yeah.

262
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:04,158
But don't mention it to her.
She's very sensitive.

263
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,422
Is there a bathroom around..
- No!

264
00:15:06,623 --> 00:15:08,961
We use the one at the gas station.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:10,362 --> 00:15:12,436
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Talk to them.

266
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:16,420
What is taking so long?
Whoa, mama!

267
00:15:16,421 --> 00:15:18,784
Do you mind? An
actor needs time to prepare.

268
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,830
Dick, I don't think I can do this.

269
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:23,485
It's show time! Now, let's go.

270
00:15:23,486 --> 00:15:24,764
Oh, and Harry,
remember,

271
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,830
you're going out there a
youngster, but you're coming back a star

272
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:28,887
Now let's go.

273
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,378
Mamie honey!

274
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,059
Well,

275
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:55,284
I see you've met
my tenants.

276
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:58,022
Oh, uh, we love
Mrs. Dubcek.

277
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:03,027
Hi, Mamie.
- Lovely tattoo. Very nice.

278
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,883
I don't blame you
for being distant,

279
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,879
not after what
we went through.

280
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,637
She and Jimmy
used to be engaged.

281
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,726
Oh, you're Jimmy!

282
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:15,825
She mentioned you
just the other evening.

283
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:19,292
I just wanted
to say thanks,

284
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:22,026
for kicking me out
all those years ago.

285
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:25,004
That was the wake-up call that
finally got me off the sauce.

286
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,991
Aww!
- That's so sweet.

287
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:28,202
Forgive me?

288
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,964
Sure.

289
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,467
Stop it, stop it,
stop it!

290
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,423
I'm sorry. She had
something crawling up her chin.

291
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:50,206
Why don't you all
go downstairs,

292
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,714
and, uh, get
reacquainted?

293
00:16:51,715 --> 00:16:54,782
Mrs. Dubcek,
there we are.

294
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,678
Bye, bye, now. Bye, bye. Bye, bye, now.

295
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:02,029
Manhandle me again,
and you'll answer to Jimmy.

296
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:11,400
We are breathing.
We are breathing.

297
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:13,484
All right!

298
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,809
Which one of you
jamokes is Solomon?

299
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:20,478
That would be I.
- You're out.

300
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,309
Out? Who are you?
- I'm coach Mafferty.

301
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,181
My wife's with the P.T.A.

302
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:27,172
And there's a lot of complaints
that these kids are coming home

303
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:30,473
with low self-esteem, and they're
wetting their beds and stuff like that.

304
00:17:30,474 --> 00:17:33,904
So you're looking at the new director!
- This is unacceptable.

305
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:35,674
Sorry, Spielberg,
you're out.

306
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,125
No, no.
Do not weep for me.

307
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,131
I humbly quit the stage.

308
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:43,709
No, no,
no tears.

309
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,644
The theater is
a cruel Mistress.

310
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:49,657
Adieu, adieu.
Remember me.

311
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:53,524
Okay kids,
let's huddle up.

312
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:58,894
Alright let's back it up to, "I pray
you good Mercutio, let's retire".

313
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:00,558
Okay, now, who's
playing Mercutio?

314
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,946
Uh, coach Mafferty,
if I may,

315
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:06,550
I think there is someone
here who can play Mercutio.

316
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,303
Aah!
I am hurt!

317
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:15,641
Aye, aye,
a scratch, a scratch.

318
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:18,651
Marriage is enough.
'Twill serve.

319
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:21,235
Ask for me tomorrow
and you will find me

320
00:18:21,236 --> 00:18:24,298
a grave
man.

321
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,073
Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.

322
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,930
A plague o'
both your houses,

323
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,085
for they have made
worms' meat...

324
00:18:33,086 --> 00:18:35,333
of me-e-e!

325
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:39,301
Romeo..
- I have it,

326
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:41,380
and soundly too.

327
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:45,356
Your... houses!

328
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:52,192
I'm dead now.

329
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,046
Well, here it is.. the
review in my high school paper.

330
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,206
You've got a review?

331
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:13,401
Ah, ha, ha ha!

332
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,665
"Dick Solomon's
over-the-top performance,

333
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:21,664
gave new meaning
to the word 'Tragedy".

334
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,254
I have redefined
my art,

335
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:29,201
and so I retire.
- No!

336
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:31,961
No, no, please, please. To go any
further would jeopardize the mission.

337
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,692
Tommy, hang up
my codpiece.

338
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:38,214
Dick, I'm not your
prop lackey anymore.

339
00:19:38,215 --> 00:19:42,023
Besides, as of next month, your
codpiece turns into Sancho Panza's hat.

340
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,189
I wonder
what Don's doing?

341
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,372
"Don". I never want to hear the name
"Don" mentioned in this house again.

342
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:50,602
Now, that's
an order!

343
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,142
Hi, there.

344
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,780
What am I doing
on the roof?

345
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:59,573
Don't you know, we were about
to ask you the same thing.

346
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,216
You should be inside,
Mrs. Dubcek, let us help you.

347
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:07,481
Oh, Don. Don?

348
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:10,832
Why should the name "Don"
make Dick so angry?

349
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,500
Sally?
- Who's there?

350
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:18,523
I would tell you, but my name
is so offensive to your family,

351
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:20,193
I dare not
speak it aloud.

352
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,355
Don, if they found you,

353
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,981
there's no telling
what they'd do to you.

354
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:26,478
I'm okay.
I have night's cloak

355
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,271
to hide me
from their eyes.

356
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:31,619
And if thou love me,
let them find me here.

357
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,040
My life were better
ended by their hate,

358
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,011
than death prolonged

359
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:39,066
wanting of thy love.

360
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:41,903
Wow, that's
so romantic.

361
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,407
Ah, well,

362
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:45,430
I wrote it myself.

363
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:55,234
I've asked you back here
for a reason.

364
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:58,378
You seem like an intelligent woman,
so I'm going to make you an offer.

365
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,782
I will lower the fines,
remove the contempt charge,

366
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:05,098
and eliminate the court
costs on one condition.

367
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:07,825
You have to promise me
that you will spend

368
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:10,615
the weekend with me
at a hotel in Chicago.

369
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:15,595
The Ambassador East?
- The Sheraton.

370
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:18,948
No.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
