1
00:00:03,986 --> 00:00:08,270
And one, and two, and there you go,
that's it!

2
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:14,369
Feel the burn.

3
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,218
Well, hello,
strange baby.

4
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:26,867
Who's that?

5
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:29,734
Well I don't know, some baby.

6
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,457
That's no baby.
Babies are pink, and wrinkly,

7
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:35,359
and wear blankets. Dick,
you better come in here.

8
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:37,602
Who's this?

9
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,436
I don't know. Some baby.

10
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,352
What does it want?

11
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:43,396
Here, I'll find out.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,322
What do you want?!

13
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,290
Hello, has anybody seen my..

14
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:55,773
there's
my little rug rat.

15
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:58,185
Mrs. Dubcek,
you had a baby.

16
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:02,145
He's my grandson,
I'm babysitting him.

17
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,929
My son and his wife are
spending the week at Caesar's palace.

18
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,703
Ah, Rome.
- Mmm.

19
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,045
Could I ask you folks
to do me a favour?

20
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:15,943
Could you watch the little guy
while I run out to the doctor's?

21
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:18,101
No.
- Yes, we'd be happy to.

22
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:20,244
Oh, great, great.

23
00:01:20,245 --> 00:01:23,125
He's had his nap,
and he's just been changed.

24
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,731
What was he before?

25
00:01:25,384 --> 00:01:27,327
Mrs. Dubcek,
why do you assume

26
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:29,450
that Sally will be taking
care of the baby?

27
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:30,953
Well, she's a woman.

28
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:32,719
Yet another perk.

29
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:35,697
I'll go get
his stuff.

30
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:38,730
Now he may be a little bit cranky,
he's got teeth coming in.

31
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,702
Well, don't worry,
we'll sign for them.

32
00:01:45,894 --> 00:01:47,636
Permission to ask what the hell you just did.

33
00:01:47,637 --> 00:01:50,977
It's an opportunity to observe
a brand-new human.

34
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,616
Besides, you always said
you wanted a baby.

35
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,561
Not this baby,
I want one of my own,

36
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:56,321
one I made
from scratch.

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,266
What's that smell?

38
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:05,763
Hey, I've been
working out.

39
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,173
Turn it off!

40
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,681
I can't.
- Then turn it down.

41
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,804
What?!
What do you want?

42
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:50,606
Are you hungry? Tommy,
entertain him till I get back.

43
00:02:50,607 --> 00:02:52,023
Wait, what, I don't know what..

44
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:55,477
All right, kid,
I'll read you a story.

45
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:58,078
Um... "dingo boy
released from pound.

46
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,612
Burt Reynolds up in arms".

47
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,585
Look. It's a little dingo boy. See?

48
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,976
Move it.
- Hey, those are my croutons!

49
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,402
Let him buy
his own croutons.

50
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,816
Look, he's eating.

51
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:15,158
He likes the croutons, Harry.

52
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:18,218
They're
nummy num, yeah!

53
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:20,742
Why are you talking
like that to the baby?

54
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:24,515
I have my reasons.

55
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:25,989
Well, I'm off.

56
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,973
Dick, look. Mrs. Dubcek was right,
I am great with this kid.

57
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:32,220
Well, how hard could it
be? Look how cute he is.

58
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,019
He's screaming?
Why is he screaming?

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,923
Somebody make him stop.

60
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,005
Hey, he stopped.

61
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:47,317
See, I'm great with this kid,
and he hates you.

62
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,611
Give me that baby.

63
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:02,499
Damn!

64
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:09,882
See? You make him cry.

65
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:12,243
Nonsense, haven't you
ever heard of tears of joy?

66
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,792
Yeah.

67
00:04:20,558 --> 00:04:22,954
Come on now. Wear the hat..
- No, no, no.

68
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,048
Come on.
It's Mary's going-away party.

69
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:27,092
She's only going to be
gone for three days.

70
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:30,618
Please wear the hat. Hat, hat, hat!
- No, no, no, no!

71
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:32,073
Hello.

72
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:35,187
Surprise!
- Surprise.

73
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,932
Mary, I miss you
already.

74
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:43,115
Now, Dick, you don't have
to throw me a surprise party

75
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,135
every time I go
to a conference.

76
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:48,100
You wouldn't be saying
that if Nina had worn her hat.

77
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,095
Oh, Nina...

78
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:52,068
here are my keys.

79
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:53,828
You know where I keep the fish food.
- Yes.

80
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,024
Nina's taking care of your fish?
- Yes.

81
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:58,742
Mary, shouldn't I be doing that?

82
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:03,997
a-ha...uh... Nina already
knows where I keep the food.

83
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:05,753
I see.

84
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:07,822
She already knows.
- Uh-huh.

85
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,313
It must make it a lot easier for you, then.

86
00:05:10,314 --> 00:05:13,306
Well if you really want to do it..
- Oh Yes I do, I do!

87
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:16,284
Mary, I want to take care
of your fish desperately.

88
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,981
Really, Nina,
thank you so much.

89
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:23,973
Just doing my job.

90
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,541
I have fish, you know.

91
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:29,269
Do you?
- Mm-hmm, they're in my freezer.

92
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,707
Here you go, baby.

93
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:39,292
Well, he hated that.

94
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,012
When is Sally going to
get back with those diapers?

95
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:49,587
Oh, look! Some coming out
of his nose again.

96
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:51,538
It's like
he's got wetness

97
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,644
coming out of every hole in his body.

98
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,033
Dumb, wet baby.

99
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,962
Hey, he likes it.

100
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:11,715
Maybe not.

101
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,673
Suddenly it's not quite
so funny when I do it,

102
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:29,788
now, is it?

103
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,718
What? - It's a baby.
- Oh.

104
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:39,056
Oh, Mary, this means so much to me.

105
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:42,001
Yeah. Okay,
now let's go over this one more time.

106
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,959
The filter and the heater are automatic.

107
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,264
Don't touch them.
- Well, what if I need to touch them?

108
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,045
Why should you need
to touch them?

109
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,745
Well what if I want
to touch them?

110
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,305
Just don't
touch them.

111
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,171
Now, here's something
I like to do.

112
00:06:57,172 --> 00:06:58,999
If the fish
have been good,

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,867
I like to reward them
with a little brine shrimp.

114
00:07:02,401 --> 00:07:03,496
And if they're bad.

115
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:06,113
I'll make them watch while
I eat the brine shrimp.

116
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,482
Now, this might
sound silly,

117
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,473
but I'm very attached
to these fish.

118
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:11,608
Please don't
kill them.

119
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:14,689
You love your fish,
and I love you.

120
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,710
That's why I'm going
to love your fish.

121
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:18,148
Just feed them.

122
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,315
Don't touch
the filter!

123
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,369
Okay.

124
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:35,370
Hello?

125
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,021
What is the matter
with you two?

126
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:40,383
How many times do I have to go
over this? When that baby is asleep,

127
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,637
the phone is not to ring more than once.

128
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,188
Right. The one-ring rule.

129
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:48,163
That's right.

130
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:51,841
Harry, did you throw
applesauce all over the floor?

131
00:07:51,942 --> 00:07:54,016
No, it was
the baby.

132
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:57,521
He made a cute
little design.

133
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,606
Mrs. Dubcek..
- Shh!

134
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:05,639
She won't be back until tomorrow.
- What?!

135
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:07,846
She said she was still woozy
from the medication,

136
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:10,773
that she got on the wrong bus and
woke up in a petting zoo in Cleveland.

137
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,915
Oh, that old excuse.

138
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,202
We get to keep the baby another day.

139
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,823
Oh, great.
And by the way,

140
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:22,337
it was me that spilled applesauce.
- It was?

141
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,352
No, it was
the baby.

142
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,405
I've been meaning to talk to you about that..

143
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:30,341
- Shh! I think I hear him
turning over.

144
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:34,260
I don't hear anything.

145
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,164
Of course you don't. You're a man.

146
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:40,496
How could
this happen?

147
00:08:40,497 --> 00:08:42,702
That baby has taken
control of us.

148
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:45,142
The one with the least
intelligence is running the show.

149
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:49,348
This is getting old fast. There
are three of us and only one of him.

150
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,173
We're bigger than him
and way smarter.

151
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,171
We could take this baby.
Who's with me?

152
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,779
Come on, men.

153
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:03,089
One ring.

154
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,780
Hello, fish.

155
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:13,079
Look at you
in there.

156
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:16,506
What are you thinking? I
know what you're thinking.

157
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:18,754
Are you in the tank,
or am I?

158
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:21,288
Well, it's you,
stupid fish.

159
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,584
Here, I brought you
some presents..

160
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:27,675
a treasure chest filled
with gold doubloons,

161
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:31,193
a topless mermaid.
Try not to stare.

162
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:35,415
And, best of all,
I brought you

163
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:37,096
a new friend.

164
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,300
I call her snowflake

165
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,154
because she's soft
and delicate.

166
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:46,807
I thought you
might like it

167
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:49,250
if I read you
a night-night story.

168
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,776
It's called
"Tales of the Calypso:

169
00:09:52,077 --> 00:09:54,838
secrets of
the ocean deep".

170
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,540
"Slowly, so slowly,

171
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,792
the day turned
to night.

172
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,786
The darkness
taunts the light

173
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:09,086
that dances
in the depths below.

174
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,651
Suddenly
and without warning,

175
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:14,105
danger strikes.

176
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,963
Octopus, octopus,

177
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:20,778
your children
are dying."

178
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:26,096
I want that. I want that.
I want that.

179
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,056
I want that. I want that. I want..

180
00:10:29,248 --> 00:10:30,873
Harry, we're here to get
something for the baby.

181
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:33,513
We're not here to get something for you.
- Nuts.

182
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:39,687
Here, baby.
What about this one?

183
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,710
Where'd he go?

184
00:10:44,066 --> 00:10:45,224
Oh, no!

185
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:50,540
Hold on, baby!
- No, Sally, you can't!

186
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,636
Let me go! I've got to save him.

187
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:56,089
Get a hold of yourself! It's a
bottomless ball pit of death!

188
00:10:57,795 --> 00:10:59,931
I don't care!
That's my baby!

189
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:01,731
No!

190
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,391
Ohh, I've got him!

191
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,823
I've got him!

192
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,032
Hey, lady,

193
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:14,791
we only let children climb in the ball pit.

194
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,744
That is so sick.

195
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:37,063
Lieutenant,
you look like hell.

196
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:40,260
I mean the "locked in a car
wash overnight" kind of hell.

197
00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:43,137
Yeah, it's this baby.

198
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:45,091
He ran me ragged
all day.

199
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:47,313
That insolent
little twerp.

200
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,252
He's gone too far. Tomorrow I'm
granting you a one-day furlough.

201
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:54,376
Go into town.
Get yourself a tattoo.

202
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:57,574
I can't. Tomorrow I'm
taking the baby to the park,

203
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:59,574
and then the zoo, and
then I'm taking him golfing.

204
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,292
I think he has
real talent.

205
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:04,812
I don't understand. You sound
like you're actually enjoying this.

206
00:12:05,013 --> 00:12:06,693
I am.

207
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,862
I know I complained
at the start,

208
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:11,520
but this is the first
assignment I've had

209
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:14,152
where I really feel like
I'm using all of me.

210
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:17,620
It sounds crazy, but I
cannot do enough for him.

211
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,069
The more he needs me,
the more I need him.

212
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,066
I have a great idea.

213
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,612
Let's wake him up, then rock him back to sleep.
- No!

214
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,360
Why not?
- What's the matter with you?

215
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:29,754
It's as if this baby
has made you go all soft.

216
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,353
He's broken down your defenses.

217
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:34,299
I know.
He's my wittle bunny wabbit.

218
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:37,002
God, what kind of talk is
that? You're a weapons expert.

219
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,456
I'm still a warrior.

220
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:40,633
It's just now I'm the
protector, not the aggressor.

221
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,606
I've heard enough.
I'm going to sleep.

222
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,662
You can't. I've tucked him in your bed.

223
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:49,118
As high commander, I order
you to untuck him at once.

224
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,533
Dick, I'm not taking
orders from you anymore.

225
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:53,543
I'm taking orders
from a higher commander.

226
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,138
His rank: baby.

227
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,690
But wait!
Where am I going to sleep?

228
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:59,525
Use his room.

229
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,196
Fine.

230
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:14,660
Morning, children.

231
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:17,042
Hello, snowflake.

232
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,398
Where's everybody else?

233
00:13:22,424 --> 00:13:24,801
Come out, come out!

234
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:28,546
Why, snowflake, you're
looking a little bloated.

235
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:32,509
Oh, my god!

236
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,591
You bad fish!
Bad, bad fish!

237
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,186
Where's that
brine shrimp?

238
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,076
See?
None for you!

239
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,795
Dick!

240
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:47,171
Mary, you've
come back early.

241
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:50,327
The conference was a
disaster. I had to get out of there.

242
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,983
Are you sure that was a good
idea? Maybe you should go back.

243
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:57,491
No. Besides,
I missed you.

244
00:13:57,492 --> 00:13:59,116
Oh, I was so lone..

245
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:02,460
where's my fish?

246
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,121
Oh... there's your fish.

247
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,033
That's not my fish.

248
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:06,135
Sure, it is.

249
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,396
You killed my fish!

250
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:09,223
No, I didn't!
He did.

251
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,491
You jackass!
- Yeah, you jackass!

252
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,451
Hello, sweetheart.

253
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:19,366
Can you say
my name?

254
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,812
Sally.
- No.

255
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,575
Sal-ly.
No.

256
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,997
Sal-ly.
No.

257
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,978
Sal-ly.

258
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,660
You know, you shouldn't try so hard.

259
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,239
Kids develop
at different rates.

260
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,362
And resistance is the
sign of an analytical mind.

261
00:14:42,363 --> 00:14:44,060
Really?
- No.

262
00:14:45,116 --> 00:14:47,319
Don't listen to him. You
know what I'm going to do?

263
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,790
I'm going to find
Mr. Sock monkey.

264
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,552
You like Mr. Sock monkey, right?
Sally!

265
00:14:51,553 --> 00:14:53,840
Sally, I feel
just awful.

266
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:56,614
I've killed the fish of the woman I love.
- Uh-huh.

267
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,254
Mr. Sock monkey,
where are you?

268
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:00,037
Those fish were
everything to her.

269
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:01,873
I've got to find something to replace them.

270
00:15:01,874 --> 00:15:05,818
Come on out, you argyle piece of crap!
- Sally? Hello?

271
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,101
She can't hear you. She
can only hear the baby.

272
00:15:08,102 --> 00:15:09,984
Harry, have you seen
Mr. Sock monkey?

273
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:11,136
Why, no.

274
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,649
Why would
you ask me?

275
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,550
I haven't seen
him all day.

276
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:19,460
La, la-la,
la, la, la-la

277
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:21,730
It's probably
in the bedroom.

278
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,813
Call me if he
needs anything.

279
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,114
What am I
going to do?

280
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:35,043
Well, hello.

281
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,691
Sock monkey!

282
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:41,465
Give that to me!

283
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,394
Yes, yes,

284
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:47,115
you should do
just fine.

285
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,154
You might even fit
in the tank.

286
00:15:52,893 --> 00:15:56,807
Mary? Mary, do you
remember how I killed your fish?

287
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:00,784
No.
- Well, I did,

288
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:04,053
but I brought you something to
make you feel better. Come on in!

289
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,001
Whose baby is that?
Mine.

290
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,307
Well, not for keeps.
It's really Sally's.

291
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:15,273
I mean, she got it
from Mrs. Dubcek.

292
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,278
Let's just call it
a rental.

293
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:19,138
Come on.
Play with it.

294
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,906
Dick you've got to take that
child back to its mother.

295
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,302
Come on.
Just hold him.

296
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:24,841
I guarantee you'll like it.

297
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:26,542
I'm serious.

298
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:29,393
Just take him for a spin around
the block, and then we'll talk.

299
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:31,195
There you are!

300
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:33,101
There "you" are.

301
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:36,901
I'll deal with you, as soon
as I deal with you, sweetie.

302
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:39,137
Come on, honey.
Come on, Dick!

303
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:40,106
Oh...

304
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:48,939
Why are you so angry?
- I'm not talking to you.

305
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:49,945
Oh, you found him.

306
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,180
Oh, good, now we can
stop looking.

307
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,576
I was going to bring
him right back lieutenant.

308
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:58,240
If I were a good mother, I'd
push you down those stairs.

309
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:59,235
You're not a mother.

310
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:00,952
Well technically, no, but that's going to change.

311
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,716
How?
- I've decided to keep the baby.

312
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:06,230
What?! - No!
You can't. He's not yours.

313
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,765
I'm willing to overlook that.

314
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:09,791
He needs me.
He's helpless.

315
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:12,774
And what am I!

316
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,940
You can't keep him. They
have rules about these things.

317
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:16,949
They have laws
about these things.

318
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,425
They have TV movies
about these things.

319
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:22,140
Dick, I'm keeping him.
That's final.

320
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,291
Hello?  Anybody home?
- Oh, my god!

321
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,845
I have to hide him.
- What?

322
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,843
You're coming right back
in here this instant! Sally!

323
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:31,820
Thanks so much for watching my grandson.

324
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,253
I have been
to hell and back.

325
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,252
I won't bore you.
- You're too late.

326
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:40,810
Well, where is
my little fella?

327
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,550
Mrs. Dubcek, I'm
so glad you're here.

328
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:44,899
We're having a problem with our oven.
- What kind of problem?

329
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,913
How should I know? You're
a landlady. You tell us.

330
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:50,152
Harry, Show Mrs. Dubcek to the oven.
Stuff her in it if you have to.

331
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,377
Sally!
- Is she gone yet? - No!

332
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:53,469
Then we're not coming out.

333
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,860
I order you to think this through.
- Okay. Hmm, no!

334
00:17:56,861 --> 00:17:58,116
Sally, no..

335
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,999
Your oven seems fine.

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,321
I'll just get my little
boy, and I'll be on my way.

337
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:06,889
So soon,
Mrs. Dubcek?

338
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,987
We've been living in this
attic for almost a year now,

339
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,155
and we know very little about you. Sit down.

340
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,343
Tell us everything about
yourself. Leave nothing out.

341
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:16,341
Please everything. Travel?
- Marriages. - Medical history.

342
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:20,225
Well, there's
a doctor in Mexico

343
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:23,017
that once said I had
the exact DNA of a lemur.

344
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,837
Ohh, that's fascinating.
I'll be right back.

345
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,132
Sally!

346
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:30,372
Well, here he is.

347
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,845
You have to go
home now, baby.

348
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,500
There's
my little man.

349
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:40,196
Bye, baby.
- Bye, Sally.

350
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:42,421
Aw! Come on,
sweetheart.

351
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:44,766
Oh, what a big boy
you are.

352
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,230
Were you a good boy? Yes!

353
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,042
Well,

354
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:54,115
thank god
he's gone.

355
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:58,113
I'm going
to miss him.

356
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,155
Excuse me. I'm going to go
take care of the other baby.

357
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:08,444
What was that
all about?

358
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:11,014
I thought you loved him.
- I do.

359
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:13,259
Then why did you suddenly give him back?

360
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,558
I guess I love him
enough to know that his

361
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,889
real mom needs him more than I do.

362
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,600
You know, when I
couldn't find him, I went crazy.

363
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:24,379
I couldn't put
his mother through that.

364
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,115
Why don't you have one of your own?
- That would be great.

365
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,403
Why don't you
go for it?

366
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,925
Yeah, right. And let this body go to hell?

367
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:45,112
Mary, we have
to talk.

368
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:47,511
You have a dog.
- Yes.

369
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,194
Mary I want everything to go
back to the way it was

370
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:51,953
before I killed
your fish.

371
00:19:52,702 --> 00:19:54,842
I'm afraid that's going
to take some time.

372
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:57,180
I know what it means to lose
something that you care about,

373
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:59,886
and what I did was
very, very wrong.

374
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:01,898
Why do you have a dog?

375
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,846
Well, I went to the pet store
to buy you some new fish,

376
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:07,688
and I saw this cute little guy.

377
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,984
Oh, Dick, I can't
take care of a dog.

378
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:12,493
If you can love a fish,
you can love a dog.

379
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:14,795
Well, he is kind of cute.

380
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:17,935
Come here, boy.

381
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:21,519
Oh, look at him.
He loves you, Mary.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
