1
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:05,818
She's the child of darkness.
She's under his protection now.

2
00:00:05,928 --> 00:00:07,725
I won't let you destroy these people.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,297
I was sent to be an influence.

4
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:11,923
I can't just crawl inside that
head of yours and make you do things.

5
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:14,002
Her powers are starting to manifest.

6
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:16,400
She'll never be what you want her to be.

7
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,099
She's also the daughter of a woman.
That means she has a choice.

8
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,768
Let the world have its way with her.
Once it does-

9
00:00:21,877 --> 00:00:24,175
I guarantee you-

10
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,270
she will bring it to its knees.

11
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:28,281
Previously on Point Pleasant.

12
00:00:28,383 --> 00:00:31,443
- How long was I dead?
- Seven hours.
- How the hell can that be?

13
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:35,284
We're still feeling guilty because we fell
for each other while you were with someone.

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,587
No, no, not someone!
We stepped out on your sister!

15
00:00:38,694 --> 00:00:41,060
The fatal flaw- every marriage has one.

16
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:43,256
Just a matter of time
till it presents itself.

17
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:45,299
I can't do this anymore.
I won't wreck that woman.

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,428
She's getting worse. He thinks she's
having some kind of bad reaction to the medicine.

19
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:54,566
- Boyd did this.
- Christina has decided to let someone else in...

20
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:56,974
on Point Pleasant's
dirty little secret-Judy Kramer.

21
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,480
Only you can save your family, Judy.
All you have to do is listen to me.

22
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:04,074
Judy's with me now.
She knows the truth.

23
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:11,519
- I can't exactly move my legs.
- Yeah, well, there's sodium
pentothal in there too.

24
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:14,152
So that's what this is-
a fact-finding mission.

25
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:16,925
What did you do to her?

26
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:19,364
She's tapped in,
and it's gonna burst her pretty skull.

27
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:21,436
That's why I had to shut her down.

28
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:23,697
- Now what do we do?
- I'll tell you what.

29
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:26,501
Tell me she's the one you want.

30
00:01:26,608 --> 00:01:28,974
- You only get one.
- Yes.!

31
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:30,704
- Say it.!
- She's the one I want.!

32
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:40,687
Freeze.!

33
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,164
Shall I gut her, boss? Huh?

34
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:53,462
- Shall I wear her?
- Judy.

35
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:56,298
Judy? Judy.!

36
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:02,742
Judy.!
Maybe you should stay home.

37
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:05,904
No. No, I have to go.

38
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:09,876
This is our fault. Father Tomas-

39
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:11,714
This wasn't your fault.

40
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,950
Father Tomas is dead, and I'm alive
because you chose me.

41
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:19,255
- He knew this was a war.
- He didn't want to die.

42
00:02:22,698 --> 00:02:24,598
Judy.

43
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,571
You are not going to die.

44
00:02:32,507 --> 00:02:35,271
I won't let you.

45
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:48,722
Terry.!

46
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:54,027
Terry.!

47
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,792
- Arrived, found this young man-
- Terry!

48
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:01,892
Terry.! Terry.!

49
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:04,939
Let me get that for you.

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,600
I forgot the Yanks
were on the West Coast today.

51
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,303
- Big day here in Los Angeles.
- There.

52
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:12,505
Just in time for the first pitch.

53
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:16,380
It's good to have another kid around.
Seems like Terry's never here anymore.

54
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:20,148
- He's been working.
- Doing what, exactly?

55
00:03:20,255 --> 00:03:22,746
Uh, Mr. Burke, I think you should
probably ask him that.

56
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,385
You're right.

57
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:30,090
It doesn't really matter, does it?

58
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:32,996
We all got our jobs to do.

59
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:37,767
Figured out what yours is yet?

60
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:40,671
Well, I know it's not playing baseball.

61
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:42,573
You're starting to understand.

62
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:47,947
- Understand what?
- You weren't put here to play games.

63
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,508
This ball has a chance.!

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,850
Dude, we're gonna be late.

65
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:59,983
- He'll round into home-
...all possibilities.

66
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:06,360
'Cause the devil
was almost dragging him home.

67
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:12,406
Father Matthew, I'm so sorry.

68
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,873
Such a terrible accident.

69
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,969
- And Father David gone too.
- Not gone. Missing.

70
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:23,211
I pray every day
that he'll return to us.

71
00:04:23,318 --> 00:04:25,878
It's a trial, Sarah.

72
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:29,115
Faith means nothing
until it's tested.

73
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,029
I just want to tell you I'm sorry.

74
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:42,103
Father Tomas was good to you,
I know.

75
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,999
Thank you, Jesse.

76
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,043
Oh! I miss you.

77
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:53,046
Come home. Look, I'm sorry.

78
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:57,881
I didn't mean to scare you.
I need you to understand why I didn't tell you.

79
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:01,183
I do. I do, Mom, but, look...

80
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:05,225
the stuff you believe about me-
let's say it's true...

81
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,659
that I have some sort
of higher purpose.

82
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:10,526
You have to let me find it myself.

83
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:12,429
Of course.

84
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:53,773
This is where I found him.

85
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,509
God, I'm sorry.

86
00:05:58,613 --> 00:06:02,140
I can't imagine
what you're feeling right now.

87
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,417
Try rage.

88
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:10,389
Hey. Hey, you okay?

89
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:29,276
Father Tomas had no family.

90
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:32,346
He was taken in as a ward of the church
in Oaxaca, Mexico...

91
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,816
and when he was of age,
he chose to take vows.

92
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,945
He came to Point Pleasant
full of hope and purpose.

93
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:43,524
He felt the Lord wanted him to-

94
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,501
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:54,869 --> 00:06:57,804
He was a fine young man.

96
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:01,774
And while I try to trust
in God's divine plan...

97
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,174
I can't hide the...

98
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,180
anger-

99
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:10,843
anger that he was unable to fulfill
the destiny he was given.

100
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:16,447
Anger at the forces of adversity
which seek, cruelly, our undoing.

101
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,355
I rage at God...

102
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:23,396
who created hope
just so he could kill it...

103
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:26,558
over and over
to the end of time.

104
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:29,694
At him, I am angry.

105
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:33,570
Amen!

106
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:38,043
Christina. Christina. Look at me.

107
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:39,738
Chris.

108
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:42,646
Let him see my rage.

109
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,480
Stop.

110
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:47,180
Stop. You can't do this.

111
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:52,148
This is a story of betrayal!

112
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:30,729
What kind of God...

113
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:34,097
lets evil walk among us like this?

114
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:37,203
Christina, please.

115
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:41,475
Let my fury tear his house apart!

116
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,220
But-

117
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:03,955
we must...

118
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:08,934
find the way of the lamb
and not the lion.

119
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:15,235
The doubts we harbor
that dark night I just described...

120
00:09:15,343 --> 00:09:18,642
that is what
we must guard against.

121
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:25,647
Let us pray.

122
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,721
Christina.

123
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:32,793
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

124
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:36,523
- It's just been a tough couple of days.
- Chris, that's not it.

125
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:39,964
This is gonna sound crazy.

126
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:43,196
Something's happening
in Point Pleasant.

127
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:46,603
Powerful eulogy.
The priest was on fire.

128
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,472
A little too much brimstone for me.

129
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:53,479
So, your friend-
We've never been formally introduced.

130
00:09:56,184 --> 00:09:59,210
- Jesse.
- Parker.

131
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,153
- You're the lifeguard.
- Who is this guy?

132
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:05,954
He works for my father.
Jess, can you give us a minute?

133
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,551
It's okay, really.
I- I'll come find you.

134
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,026
How dare you come here?

135
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:18,367
Please, that was my kind of party...

136
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:21,408
till the lifeguard calmed you down.

137
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:23,977
It was just getting amusing.

138
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,174
- What? I don't get to meet the boys you're seeing?
- You stay away from him.

139
00:10:28,283 --> 00:10:31,377
You're not in a position to give me orders.
You tried that once and lost.

140
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,852
Remember?

141
00:10:33,955 --> 00:10:36,549
I'm gonna stop you,
I swear to God.

142
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:41,755
How? You can't control me any more
than you can control yourself.

143
00:10:41,863 --> 00:10:44,229
You're losing it, Christina.

144
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:57,374
- That was weird, huh?
- Yeah, you could say that.

145
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:01,245
I mean, I haven't been in there
since Isabelle's-

146
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:04,147
Oh. Right. Me either.

147
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:09,285
The last time I wore this dress.

148
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,848
That's way too much death for something
I bought in the juniors' department.

149
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:14,861
What are you doing later?

150
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:17,431
I was thinking
you could take me out.

151
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:21,298
Spring for some classy grub,
like a place with lots of forks.

152
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:25,839
Our first date in public, huh?

153
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,502
Okay. But honestly,
I'm more of a dollar-menu girl.

154
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:34,048
- You are the perfect woman.
- I know.

155
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:36,548
So, Boyd's in town to watch you?

156
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:38,744
Yeah, I think so.

157
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:41,583
But he's doing more than that,
isn't he?

158
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,283
- Chris-
- Jesse, please just stay away from him, okay?

159
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:47,156
- Please.
- Chris, can I talk to you?

160
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:49,856
Hey, Chris. Wait.

161
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:52,592
What happened in there-
I- I'm sorry.

162
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,000
That was you, right?
Making Father Matthew your rage puppet.

163
00:11:57,105 --> 00:11:59,005
I think so, yeah.

164
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:02,304
Hey, Mark said a bunch of people are gonna
haul a keg up to the meadow tonight.

165
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,401
I'm gonna tell him I'm in.

166
00:12:04,512 --> 00:12:06,776
You can't be serious. A party?

167
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:10,749
It's more like a wake.
I just think everyone's sensing the weird.

168
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:14,151
Judy, Boyd is circling,
and I'm not exactly at my best.

169
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:18,851
I need to pretend everything's normal
for one night, or I'm gonna lose it, seriously.

170
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,827
No, I get it.

171
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,592
- But I'm going with you.
- Damn right you are.

172
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:37,202
Oh, Dr. Kramer.
I didn't expect you to be back so soon.

173
00:12:37,312 --> 00:12:39,212
I forgot some paperwork.

174
00:12:39,314 --> 00:12:41,839
I was just about to order some office supplies.
How many boxes should I get?

175
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,713
- For-
- For the move.

176
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:47,720
- What move?
- Amber Hargrove came by the other day.

177
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:51,121
She said she needed to get into your office.
Something about an appraisal.

178
00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:53,557
Amber Hargrove was in my office?

179
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:57,964
Well, okay. Thank you.

180
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:40,171
You've been getting your hands dirty
pulling weeds.

181
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,504
- Well, it builds character.
- Yeah.

182
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,239
Wax on, wax off. I get it.

183
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:51,114
Look, no disrespect, Mr. Boyd,
but I can do more here.

184
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,449
That so?

185
00:13:53,554 --> 00:13:56,079
What is it you think I do exactly, Terry?
Speak freely.

186
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:59,785
I don't know.

187
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:03,421
Between construction jobs,
my dad did...

188
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,795
other kind of work.

189
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,859
No-Nothing too heavy,
but... he knew some people.

190
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:14,402
You think I'm a criminal?

191
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:18,737
And you still want to work for me.

192
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:22,111
No. I want to learn from you.

193
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:28,819
Well, there's one project you can help me
out with. It involves Christina Nickson.

194
00:14:28,923 --> 00:14:31,949
- You know her, right?
- Yeah, a little.

195
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,790
- Her father and I are in business together.
- Seriously?

196
00:14:34,896 --> 00:14:36,761
Had her pegged
for a Fortune 500 girl.

197
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:39,924
What makes you think she's not?

198
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:44,471
He'd like to know who she's spending time
with- boys, that kind of thing.

199
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:48,440
And I'd like you to be
my eyes and ears on this.

200
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:51,907
Sure. Yeah.

201
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:55,779
I, uh, think she's going
to some party tonight.

202
00:14:55,883 --> 00:14:57,976
Good. Then so are you.

203
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:59,986
Right.

204
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:04,320
There are people that could profit
from hurting a girl like her.

205
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,758
We need to make sure she's not
running with the wrong crowd.

206
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,126
No problem. I'm on it.

207
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:14,326
Sir. We found her.

208
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:25,574
Atlantic City.

209
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,580
South side.

210
00:15:28,716 --> 00:15:30,877
Mr. Boyd's got me working tonight.

211
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:32,953
You seriously can't get out of it?

212
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:35,955
- Nah. It's important.
- Whatever.

213
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:38,924
I wasn't sure I wanted people
seeing me out with you anyway.

214
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:41,460
Look, if I finish early,
maybe I could come by later.

215
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:44,122
If you're lucky,
maybe I'll still be here.

216
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:01,141
So, I know you didn't really
want to be here tonight.

217
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:04,047
- So, thanks.
- You're welcome.

218
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:07,519
And, uh, in the spirit
of full disclosure...

219
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:10,386
I think you should admit
I'm not the only reason you're here.

220
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,983
Look, I- I came tonight
to look out for you both...

221
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:16,222
not play.

222
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,788
Boyd has made it clear that he's
got his eye on Jesse now too.

223
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,801
What?

224
00:16:21,903 --> 00:16:24,371
Why didn't you say anything?

225
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:27,270
I just found out.
I'm trying to figure out, okay?

226
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,310
- Don't worry.
- "Don't worry"?

227
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:34,370
The last guy Boyd had his eye on
ended up in a box.

228
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:38,248
- You can't protect everyone all of the time!
- I can try.

229
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:40,547
Yeah, and you can fail. It's happened.

230
00:16:40,655 --> 00:16:43,681
You have got to tell him
he's in danger.

231
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,249
- How do I do that without telling him
exactly what's going on?
- Maybe you should.

232
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,693
Okay, he'll think you're crazy at first...

233
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:53,631
but take it from me, it's better to know because
knowing might be enough to keep us alive.

234
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:57,693
Or it might be the thing
that gets him killed.

235
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:00,535
You've got to cut him loose.

236
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:03,610
Chris. Christina!

237
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:23,920
A friend told me...

238
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,999
I should pray.

239
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:30,033
I should stay open to you.

240
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:34,141
So tell me why!

241
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,138
What did I do?

242
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:43,317
Do I need to die?

243
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,612
Is that what has to happen?

244
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,688
I should, God.

245
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:58,966
I don't think I'm strong enough.

246
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,837
I wish I was.

247
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:47,406
- Hey.
- Nice shriek.

248
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:52,145
I was going for more of a cry-for-help thing.

249
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:56,713
Nice.
Fell on seriously deaf ears, I'd say.

250
00:18:56,824 --> 00:19:00,760
You pickin' up sort of a end-of-the-world
signal from this crowd?

251
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:02,658
Funeral fallout.

252
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:06,664
But very astute for a summer kid.

253
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,861
- It's winter in my heart.
- Another fine response.

254
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:16,209
Rock]

255
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,608
- I'm- I'm Judy.
- Nick.

256
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:29,051
Hey, I gotta talk to my friend, so-

257
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:31,590
Say no more.

258
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,526
- Hey.
- Hey.

259
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:38,394
- I was starting to think you ditched me.
- I go where you go, remember?

260
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:42,492
- New friend?
- Uh, he's, like, a little too cool.

261
00:19:42,603 --> 00:19:45,697
I was getting banter anxiety.

262
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:47,706
Look.

263
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:52,006
Now's a perfect time
to tell a guy he's in mortal danger.

264
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:55,274
You know what I think?

265
00:19:55,383 --> 00:19:58,250
I think you're not afraid
he won't believe you.

266
00:19:58,352 --> 00:20:00,752
You're afraid he will...

267
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:03,619
and when he finds out
who you are, he'll run.

268
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:20,830
What's up, Chris?
You avoiding me?

269
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:23,967
That's not it.

270
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:27,309
I just-
I need to be alone, okay?

271
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:30,748
- Whatever's wrong, I wanna help.
- You can't.

272
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:36,022
- Look, you just-you need to back off, okay, Jess?
- Why? What's going-

273
00:20:36,123 --> 00:20:38,182
I mean it!

274
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,351
Just stay away from me.

275
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:04,279
Hello, Amber.

276
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:08,048
You know,
you really should lock your doors.

277
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:12,824
I'll catch up with you guys later.

278
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:40,680
What's going on with Chris? All of a sudden
she's telling me to keep my distance.

279
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,416
She's having a hard time,
with Father Tomas and everything.

280
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:45,492
Maybe you should just leave her alone.

281
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:48,562
You and I followed her that day, and then you
kicked her out. What's changed since then?

282
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,960
I was just wrong about her.
That's all.

283
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:54,125
And that guy who came up to her
outside the funeral today- Boyd.

284
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:56,135
Who is he?

285
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:59,968
Look, he works for her dad.
Jesse, just stay out of it. Trust me.

286
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:04,033
- Her dad is a bad guy.
- She told me. Organized crime.
I'm not buying it, Jude.

287
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:07,342
That's not what I felt off that Boyd guy.

288
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:10,042
There's- I felt something bigger.

289
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:13,587
- What do you mean?
- There's more. Something
between Chris and that guy.

290
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:15,587
That's why she doesn't want me around.

291
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:17,884
Jesse, just don't get involved, please.

292
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:20,756
I am involved, Jude.

293
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:23,762
I'm gonna find out
what the hell's going on.

294
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:03,730
He's crazy about you.

295
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,508
You know that, right?

296
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,147
Then what's the problem?

297
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:17,150
I have daddy issues.

298
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,487
Yeah. I feel you.

299
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:26,285
My dad, before he got sick...

300
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:28,987
he did a little time.

301
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:32,862
Jesse, his folks, they-

302
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:37,267
they kept me from sliding,
you know?

303
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:41,866
When-
When things get like that...

304
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:44,968
it's- it's good to keep
decent people around.

305
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,979
You get in less trouble.

306
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,479
Yeah.

307
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:56,181
I don't think "less trouble"
is in my vocabulary.

308
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:03,226
Thanks for the beer.

309
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:11,562
I gotta say...

310
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:13,663
I almost bought it.

311
00:24:13,774 --> 00:24:16,868
The new leaf,
your friendship with Meg.

312
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:20,071
The bout of chastity.

313
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,478
I should have seen it coming.

314
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:27,477
- What is it you want, Amber?
- Nothing.

315
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:29,988
Is it still me, or have you
moved on to a bigger prize?

316
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,548
- No, I just-
- Then what were you doing
in my office the other day?

317
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:36,926
- I forgot to-
- You find anything interesting?

318
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:42,997
Where is it?

319
00:24:46,874 --> 00:24:49,172
Please. Please. Stop it.

320
00:24:49,276 --> 00:24:52,177
- Where is it?
- It's over there. It's over there.

321
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,179
I'm so sorry.

322
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:59,611
You, uh-You watched it.

323
00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:20,533
-
- Have you seen Judy Kramer?

324
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:26,202
Pretty good, uh-
Pretty good party, huh?

325
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:30,346
Come on, Nick.

326
00:25:30,451 --> 00:25:32,282
Yes, you do.

327
00:25:32,386 --> 00:25:36,117
- Come on.
- So are you gonna sleep with him?

328
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:40,789
Because I don't think
you should sleep with him.

329
00:25:44,698 --> 00:25:47,223
Nice.

330
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:49,894
Folk Rock]

331
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,773
I've been watching his face.

332
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,247
I don't like what it does
between conversations.

333
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,080
What?

334
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:09,314
- What do you care?
- I get to care.

335
00:26:09,423 --> 00:26:12,984
No, Mark... my buddy...

336
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,893
not anymore you don't.

337
00:26:35,516 --> 00:26:38,713
Hello. Partiers?

338
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:44,515
Hello!

339
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:07,246
- What-
- She will destroy you.

340
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:09,542
Who? Let go of me!

341
00:27:12,486 --> 00:27:15,717
- Father David.
- I didn't mean to scare you.

342
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:19,088
Then you should have written me
a letter from wherever you were.

343
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:23,259
She put the life in me.
You have to help me.

344
00:27:23,363 --> 00:27:25,263
- I- I can't.
- You can't?

345
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:28,766
- Hey, hold up.
- Hey! Help!

346
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:47,613
- Judy.
- We need to, uh-We need to-

347
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:49,621
What? Are you okay?

348
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,248
- Th-Th-The father.
- Father Tomas.

349
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,351
No. David. Father David.
He's walking. He's talking.

350
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:58,693
But he's, like, 99.9% less alive
than he used to be.

351
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,734
Father David. I saw him on your boat.
He was burning.

352
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:04,963
Yeah, but he's found the mortality loophole,
and he's coming for you.

353
00:28:05,072 --> 00:28:07,802
- What?
- I don't know. He said he was fueled by you.

354
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:10,468
Or something. Whatever.

355
00:28:10,577 --> 00:28:12,943
He wants to kill you bad.

356
00:28:13,046 --> 00:28:15,207
Okay, uh,
you need to get out of here.

357
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:17,977
- You need to find Jesse, and you both need to go.
- We're not the ones it wants.

358
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:20,645
- That doesn't mean
he won't hurt you to get to me.
- Yeah, but I-

359
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:23,188
I said, get out of here!

360
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:36,162
Rock]

361
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:06,532
Hands off, man.
I found her. She's mine.

362
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:33,152
Hey. Have you seen Christina?

363
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,694
Yeah, with Judy a few minutes ago.

364
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:38,890
- Everything all right?
- Later, man.

365
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:41,900
- Jesse? Jesse.!
- Something's wrong.

366
00:29:42,002 --> 00:29:45,631
I know. There's this girl. She's out on the
main road. She's passed out or something.

367
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:48,731
- What about Chris?
- She doesn't know C.P.R., Jesse, but you do.

368
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:50,742
Come on. It's this way. Please.

369
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:54,507
Look, do what you want to me, but spare Meg.

370
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:57,914
Seeing what's on this tape
is more than she can handle.

371
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:02,978
Ben, if I had any intention of using it,
don't you think I'd have done it already?

372
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:08,294
You have to believe me.

373
00:30:10,664 --> 00:30:12,632
How long have you had it?

374
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:16,597
This one came about a week ago.

375
00:30:16,703 --> 00:30:18,603
What do you mean, "this one"?

376
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:22,835
I destroy it, and it comes back...

377
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:26,378
ever since Isabelle died.

378
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,711
You make it sound like
it's the same tape.

379
00:30:31,251 --> 00:30:36,188
After a while, I-I made a mark
on the side of it just to see.

380
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:43,788
Okay, so someone's messing with you.

381
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:46,866
You have any idea who it might be
or what they might want?

382
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:50,869
There's no note,
no request for money.

383
00:30:50,971 --> 00:30:54,873
It's like the only thing
they want is the pain.

384
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:02,782
And...

385
00:31:02,883 --> 00:31:06,284
you've been holding on to
all of this for two years?

386
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:11,089
Alone.

387
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,760
God, I-

388
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:19,065
It's been, um-

389
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:23,065
- I-I'm sorry. I-
- It's okay. It's okay.

390
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,934
We're gonna figure this out.

391
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:30,069
How many times have you saved me...

392
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:33,446
over the years?

393
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:39,317
It's my turn.

394
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,182
Let me help you.

395
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:56,597
Knock yourself out.

396
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:49,383
You asked me if you had to die.

397
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,650
I'm your answer.

398
00:32:51,758 --> 00:32:55,387
At the water, I brought you back.

399
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,530
I asked you to kill me.

400
00:32:58,632 --> 00:33:01,658
It's... time.

401
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:04,999
No. Stop. Stop!

402
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:16,881
I'm ready.

403
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:21,450
I want you to do it.

404
00:33:28,495 --> 00:33:30,725
Jesse, no!

405
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:37,295
Jesse, run. Run!

406
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:39,372
Jesse.!

407
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:42,373
No! Jesse!

408
00:33:42,475 --> 00:33:45,273
Jesse! Jesse!

409
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:55,112
Oh, my God.

410
00:33:55,222 --> 00:33:59,318
Let go of me! My friends are in there!

411
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:02,793
- I know. I'm not letting you go.
- No! Nick, wait!

412
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,140
Jesse. No!

413
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:35,825
- Jesse.
- Don't freak out.

414
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:38,997
Did I...

415
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,000
kill that guy?

416
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:45,503
He tried to kill me,
and you stopped him.

417
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:49,632
Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:52,143
It's okay.

419
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:54,145
We're okay.

420
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:56,977
We gotta find Judy.

421
00:35:03,556 --> 00:35:05,820
Do we have company?

422
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:09,123
- I heard someone upstairs.
- Yes, we have a guest.

423
00:35:09,229 --> 00:35:12,198
- How long will she be staying?
- I'm not sure.

424
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,234
You never are.

425
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:19,170
Excuse me.

426
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:21,797
Hello, Lucas.

427
00:35:23,076 --> 00:35:25,044
You haven't changed.

428
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:27,739
The digs have though.

429
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:29,974
How are you feeling?

430
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,484
- How do you want me to feel?
- Better.

431
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:36,248
- That's all.
- Oh.

432
00:35:36,356 --> 00:35:38,790
Thank you for the scarf.

433
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:41,861
It's a nice touch.

434
00:35:41,962 --> 00:35:45,728
But I'm really not sure that it's me.

435
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:52,228
Holly, please.

436
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,601
What's the matter?

437
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,609
Bad memories?

438
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:09,918
Would you want her back,
or would you want to get away with it?

439
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:15,416
Any other sap
would quit rescuing me.

440
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:19,362
I had to get you out of there.
What were you doing in that place?

441
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:23,266
Trying to feel... something.

442
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:26,404
Anything...

443
00:36:26,506 --> 00:36:28,474
besides this.

444
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:37,349
I gotta say-

445
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,011
whatever deal you made sure worked out
a hell of a lot better for you than me.

446
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:42,782
I'm sorry.

447
00:36:44,858 --> 00:36:46,985
Say it again.

448
00:36:58,104 --> 00:37:00,004
I'm sorry.

449
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,701
So am I.

450
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,513
Good night, young lovers.
I'm beat.

451
00:37:45,085 --> 00:37:48,054
I think I figured it out-
what's happening.

452
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:51,055
- Jesse-
- No, let me finish.

453
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:53,591
That guy Boyd- I don't know.

454
00:37:53,693 --> 00:37:56,127
This is gonna sound crazy, but...

455
00:37:56,229 --> 00:37:59,562
I sense something-
this power that he has.

456
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:02,157
- He's not here to protect you, is he?
- Listen, Jess-

457
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:04,964
I felt it.
He wants to see you hurt.

458
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:07,005
He wants to see all of us hurt.

459
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:12,033
Chris, you shine.

460
00:38:12,145 --> 00:38:14,375
There is such a light in you.

461
00:38:16,483 --> 00:38:18,951
I can see why this guy's after you.

462
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:22,317
People like him,
they hate things that are so right.

463
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:27,090
That's not all.

464
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:31,764
I think you're only seeing
what you want to see.

465
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:34,060
No, no. That's how it was.

466
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,567
I've been waiting to know
what my purpose is.

467
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:40,127
I mean,
I dragged you from the ocean.

468
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,266
We survived that bus crash.
We kept that woman from almost dying.

469
00:38:43,376 --> 00:38:45,674
Wait, wait. What are you saying?

470
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:48,178
You think you were put on Earth
to save me?

471
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,749
No, just-

472
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,284
We're stronger together.

473
00:38:53,386 --> 00:38:56,753
I mean, really stronger.

474
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:00,892
I think we were put here
to save each other...

475
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:04,555
and maybe do something great together.

476
00:39:04,664 --> 00:39:07,462
I don't know about any of this.

477
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:10,195
That's okay.

478
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:12,897
I do.

479
00:39:47,006 --> 00:39:50,134
- Chris, I-
- We'll talk later, okay?

480
00:40:25,178 --> 00:40:27,976
Hello?

481
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:30,709
Is, uh- Is someone there?

482
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:40,725
Paula?

483
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:52,803
Ben?

484
00:42:04,644 --> 00:42:06,908
Hi, Daddy.

485
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:09,481
Mom.

486
00:42:09,582 --> 00:42:11,482
Jude.

487
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:15,444
I'm making you this tape...

488
00:42:15,555 --> 00:42:18,490
because... I'm going to die today.

489
00:42:21,694 --> 00:42:25,653
Please know that this is what I want.

490
00:42:29,202 --> 00:42:32,933
I've seen what's coming... for all of us.

491
00:42:34,273 --> 00:42:38,334
I know what's going to happen, and...

492
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,274
I can't be here.

493
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:45,351
I'm not strong enough.

494
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:49,612
I won't feel any pain...

495
00:42:49,722 --> 00:42:53,522
so I hope that
brings you some comfort.

496
00:42:57,063 --> 00:42:59,861
Please don't be mad at me.

497
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,098
I love you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
