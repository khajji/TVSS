1
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:18,086
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,562
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:24,771
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:30,325
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:36,129
This is our night.

6
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:40,889
Once you're in the White House,
everything defers to the office.

7
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:44,010
lt's what you need to do the job.

8
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:47,802
lf it's your marriage
that helps you, that's great.

9
00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:53,604
But if not, that's OK too.
You can have whatever you want, David.

10
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:57,162
We gotta get outta here. Which way?

11
00:00:57,253 --> 00:01:01,929
l'm in an underground detention facility.
lt's being used as a prison to house Drazen.

12
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:04,766
You said you took him out two years ago.

13
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,931
- Take cover!
- Let my father go, Bauer.

14
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:10,972
The weapon's up.

15
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:15,285
When does your suffering end? After
you've killed all your thousands of enemies?

16
00:01:15,373 --> 00:01:17,364
Yes.

17
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:21,171
l will offer you one consolation.

18
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:23,972
Your family will be joining you soon.

19
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:26,408
Your son Alexis -
do you wanna see him again?

20
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:29,053
We captured him and l know where he is.

21
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:31,685
Get him in.

22
00:01:34,253 --> 00:01:35,288
l'm releasing you.

23
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:38,809
- (Kim) Did my dad call?
- No, but l talked to the people he works with.

24
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:42,124
- Have you spoken to my mom?
- Yeah. She's waiting for you at CTU.

25
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:43,851
- Are you serious?
- l'm serious.

26
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:47,972
- (Teri) How didyou end up injail?
- l'll tell you everything when l get there.

27
00:01:48,053 --> 00:01:50,362
(Kim screams)

28
00:01:51,373 --> 00:01:53,409
No! No! No!

29
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,324
Help me! No!

30
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,363
No! No! No! No!

31
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:09,452
No! No!

32
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,524
No! No!

33
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:29,442
(men speak in Serbian)

34
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,327
(man speaks in Serbian)

35
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:21,931
(over PA) And now l'm proud to present
the future president ofthe United States:

36
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,004
Senator David Palmer.

37
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,644
Congratulations, Senator.

38
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,124
Hey, we did it.

39
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:47,848
You know, this is our victory,

40
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:52,131
and when we started out
they said the country wasn't ready.

41
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:55,091
They said it couldn't be done,
that it would never happen.

42
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:58,722
Well, here we are, still standing tall.

43
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:07,126
And when we look back at this amazing time
we can all say that we were a part of history.

44
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,642
We can all say that we did our part
to make this world a better place,

45
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:16,204
and, God willing, our children and our
children's children will reap the benefits

46
00:04:16,293 --> 00:04:18,887
of the seeds we sow right now.

47
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:36,244
(phone rings)

48
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:41,124
- CTU. Myers.
- (Jack) Nina, it's me.

49
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:44,922
- Jack, where are you?
- l'm with Andre and Victor Drazen.

50
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:49,006
- What do you mean? Where?
- Nina, just listen. l'm being held hostage.

51
00:04:49,093 --> 00:04:54,008
The reason why l'm calling is Victor wants
confirmation that his son Alexis is still alive.

52
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,210
He's in the hospital.
l can try to get through to his room.

53
00:04:57,293 --> 00:04:59,887
- OK, do it.
- OK. Hold on.

54
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:03,602
Tony, get me the hospital.
l need Alexis Drazen on line two.

55
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:11,442
l spoke to the backup team.
Drazen escaped. l want a net over the area.

56
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,001
l want one, three and
five-mile mobile barriers.

57
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:17,005
We know. We've got Jack on the line.
He's with Victor Drazen.

58
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:19,482
- What?
- (Tony) Nina, l've got Alexis Drazen.

59
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:21,325
Transfer it.

60
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:25,647
- Who... who is this?
- Hold on.

61
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,049
Alexie?

62
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,930
Father.

63
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:34,766
Where... where are you? Did you get out?

64
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,643
Alexie, what happened?
What have they done to you?

65
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,765
You.. you always said that...

66
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:46,082
l would get in trouble with women.

67
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:51,010
You were right.

68
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:54,403
Forgive me, Father. l failedyou.

69
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,246
You have not failed. You are alive. l am free.

70
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,923
Free.

71
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,004
Hold on, Alexie.

72
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,443
We will be together soon.

73
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,171
No, Papa.

74
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:12,132
You go without me. l'm not going to make it.

75
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:15,967
You will make it. Be strong.
Tell me you can do this.

76
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:18,328
Yeah, Papa.

77
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,927
l have something to say to the rest of you.

78
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:27,043
l am willing to trade the life
of Jack Bauer for that of my son.

79
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:30,569
Mr Drazen, this is George Mason again.

80
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:34,009
l'm acting head of the CTU. l don't
have the authority to make the trade.

81
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,926
lf you do not have the authority,
you are not head of anything.

82
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:41,211
Talk to your superiors.
We will call back in 15 minutes.

83
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:44,046
Be ready to respond without qualification.

84
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:53,731
And let me remind you that when
l was ten points behind in the polls,

85
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:58,568
l told you l had a plan that
on this date we were gonna celebrate,

86
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,723
party nomination in hand.

87
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,929
Well, promise delivered.

88
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:13,087
- Hi.
- Hi.

89
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:17,132
l'm not gonna be able to go
to Dallas with David tomorrow.

90
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:19,242
Why not?

91
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:23,645
l committed to a National Youth
Service Day event here in LA.

92
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:29,285
- That's OK. l can reschedule that.
- No, Patty, l don't want you to reschedule.

93
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:35,209
David and l could use a couple of days apart.
But l don't want him to feel alone, OK?

94
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:38,204
Whatever you want.

95
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,285
..doing the right thing is the only thing to do.

96
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:48,947
- You talk to Chapelle?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,424
- No trade.
- What?

98
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,710
This whole Victor Drazen thing
is a big embarrassment for them.

99
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:57,705
lf they do a trade,
it's an admission that he's alive,

100
00:07:57,793 --> 00:08:02,583
that the DOD's kept him here secretly,
and that on top of that they let him escape.

101
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:05,865
So they're just gonna sacrifice Jack?

102
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:10,505
He's like all the rest of us. 
Expendable.

103
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:13,388
ls that what you think?

104
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:17,261
lt doesn't matter what l think. l don't think
he walks on water the way you do,

105
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:20,265
but l don't wanna see him
hung out to dry either.

106
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,583
Nina, l tried.

107
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:25,790
George, without the trade,
how are they gonna locate Drazen?

108
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:30,469
l guess they won't try. They'll let him leave
the country and pick him up in Europe later.

109
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,544
lf we do the trade, we know where he is.

110
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:36,342
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
That's what l just said to Chapelle.

111
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,830
They don't wanna draw
attention to the situation.

112
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,542
End of story.

113
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:48,545
So that's it. We just go back
to work and let Jack die.

114
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,389
What can l say?

115
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:59,784
Nothing.

116
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:21,786
Nina. Shouldn't Kim be here by now?

117
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:25,661
Well, they just left the police station.
She should be here soon.

118
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:30,543
- l never did hear what happened with her.
- She was arrested by mistake. Listen, Teri.

119
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:36,151
- Kim's fine. That's not the problem.
- What do you mean? What's going on?

120
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:40,585
lt's confirmed. Jack's been captured.
He's being held hostage.

121
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,827
We're doing all we can
to bring him back, but...

122
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:45,904
Wait.

123
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:51,262
- What do they want?
- lt's hard to say.

124
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:54,351
Well, tell me what you know.

125
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:59,544
This guy Drazen wants to trade Jack
for his son Alexis, who we have.

126
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,269
Well, then, he'll be OK, right?

127
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:05,272
No. The government won't make the trade.

128
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:11,423
What do you mean, they won't make the
trade? How are they gonna get Jack back?

129
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,532
They're not. 
Jack's on his own.

130
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:19,664
l'm sorry.

131
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:42,024
There can be no flaws
and it must be done soon.

132
00:10:42,113 --> 00:10:47,267
l don't care how much it costs or how many
men you need. We're out of here by midnight.

133
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:50,982
Call me back. 
Let me know.

134
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:53,064
There.

135
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,946
- Victor.
- Ah, my good, good friend.

136
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:03,191
l never thought l would see you again.

137
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,582
- How is your family?
- Eager to see you.

138
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:09,985
- Ah, soon. ls everything prepared?
- Yes. Please, come in.

139
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:12,587
Victor, l would like you
to meet my daughter, Mila.

140
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,664
- Mila, right.
- Hello.

141
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:17,347
- How beautiful.
- Thank you.

142
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:20,903
- Just like your mother.
- Yes, but she got my temper.

143
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:24,344
Ah! No good. 
That is no good.

144
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,346
We have fresh clothes for you,
whenever you're ready.

145
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:31,227
To you and your family.

146
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:39,062
- Would you like something to eat, Jack?
- No.

147
00:11:53,273 --> 00:11:58,427
lt makes no sense. How does letting a CTU
agent die help keep Drazen out of the news?

148
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:04,504
- Teri, l'm busy. Can Nina help you now?
- No. l'm talking to you right now.

149
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,787
Yeah. l'll call you right back, all right?

150
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:13,387
You are not gonna let my husband die.

151
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:17,785
No one is gonna let Jack die. We just can't
go through with the trade right now.

152
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,990
There's no difference.
Without your help he has no chance.

153
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:24,748
With an ordinary agent, l'd agree.
Jack's got a Special Forces background.

154
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,506
- l've seen him do the impossible.
- Stop patronising me.

155
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:33,145
You've done it all night. Just tell me what
you are prepared to do to help my husband.

156
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:35,701
Fine. l'll stop patronising you.

157
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:39,024
l'll tell you exactly what l'll do.
l'm gonna call up Division.

158
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:42,992
l'm gonna ask them to reconsider
one more time and they're gonna say no

159
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,871
and that'll be the end of it.

160
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:50,229
Anything else?

161
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:06,070
Nina. l'm asking you,
someone who cares about Jack,

162
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,223
we cannot just stand by and watch him die.

163
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:10,827
l know. l agree. 
l'm doing something about it.

164
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:14,110
What do you mean? 
What are you doing?

165
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:18,471
l think there's someone who can help Jack.
lt's not procedure, so l can't talk about it.

166
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:21,551
You're just gonna have to trust me.

167
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,628
- OK.
- OK.

168
00:13:24,713 --> 00:13:26,704
(dials phone)

169
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:44,587
Oh, Patty. See, this is the lady you should be
complimenting. We were talking about you.

170
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:47,392
- Oh, really?
- Yes. They loved the speech tonight.

171
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:52,342
Now, among other things, Patty's the brain
trust behind most of my public addresses.

172
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,664
Excuse me, Senator. 
Nina Myers at CTU.

173
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,631
- OK?
- Would you excuse me? l have to take this.

174
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:02,631
- This is David Palmer.
- Thank you for taking my call.

175
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,271
What can l do for you?

176
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:07,186
- Jack's in trouble. He needs help.
- What kind of trouble?

177
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:10,902
There's no time to catch up with everything.
Let me give you the headlines.

178
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:12,551
Victor Drazen is alive.

179
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:15,989
- Whoa, whoa. What do you mean, he's alive?
- That's all we know.

180
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:20,624
He was being held prisoner by the US
government up until about an hour ago.

181
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:24,027
OK. What happened an hour ago?

182
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:28,425
He escaped and he's taken Jack hostage.
He's willing to trade Jack for his son.

183
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:33,223
- What's DOD's response?
- They're refusing to get directly involved.

184
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,546
- Who knows you contacted me?
- No one.

185
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:39,386
- All right. Who's talking to Drazen?
- George Mason.

186
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:42,033
- Tell me about him.
- Normally he's by the book.

187
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:45,583
- But he's very ambitious and very political.
- OK.

188
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:48,870
Look, l'm gonna make a few calls first.
Where can l reach Mason?

189
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:51,786
Here at CTU. 
He's in Jack's office.

190
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:54,467
- All right.
- Thank you, Senator.

191
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:59,504
Are you sure?

192
00:15:00,593 --> 00:15:02,584
OK.

193
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,828
- Tony.
- What's up?

194
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:14,432
Kim's car was hit.
Two cops are down and she was taken.

195
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,068
- What?
- Yeah.

196
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:22,911
Was there any communication?
Any witnesses?

197
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:25,507
They're working it up now.

198
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,187
All right. Let me know what you find out.

199
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:37,470
Tony, l'm gonna need
to talk to you in a few minutes.

200
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,064
- Tony?
- What?

201
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,151
- You all right?
- No. We got a problem.

202
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:49,072
Hey. Any word on Kim?

203
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:54,392
- Uh, l was just about to check.
- Well, she should be here any minute, right?

204
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:56,464
Yeah.

205
00:15:57,393 --> 00:16:01,830
Teri, l'm sorry. Do you mind
waiting in the conference room?

206
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:04,104
- Sure.
- Thanks.

207
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:11,746
- What's going on?
- They grabbed Kim again.

208
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,949
- What?
- lt must have been Drazen.

209
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:18,670
- The patrol car she was riding in was hit.
- l don't believe this.

210
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,307
Are you gonna tell her?

211
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:38,624
(phone rings)

212
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:44,869
- Mason.
- (woman) l have Senator Palmer on the line.

213
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,626
Oh, yeah. Put him through.

214
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,063
Hello.

215
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:52,543
Senator, this is George Mason.
lt's an honour to speak to you, sir.

216
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:56,672
l want you to reverse your orders
on the Bauer-for-Drazen trade.

217
00:16:56,753 --> 00:17:01,702
Uh, l'm not sure how much information you
have about this, but this is agency business

218
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:05,672
and, with all due respect,
it doesn't fall under the Senate's purview.

219
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:10,190
As you well know, Mr Mason, your entire
agency falls under presidential purview

220
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:12,548
and in nine months l will be in that office.

221
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,101
l'm not sure if that's meant
to tempt or threaten me.

222
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:19,948
lt doesn't matter either way because l don't
have the authority to pull the trigger on this.

223
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:23,992
From what l'm told, that authority
is something you'd like to have some day.

224
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:26,223
What's that supposed to mean?

225
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:29,544
Act on your own prerogative.
Go through with the trade.

226
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:33,103
You'll be reprimanded,
possibly even demoted.

227
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:35,627
So far it sounds great.

228
00:17:35,713 --> 00:17:40,025
ln the first month of my term l'll instate you
in a high-level position in Washington.

229
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:42,707
You'll bypass five years
of middle management.

230
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:45,102
And if you don't get elected?

231
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:48,230
That's not gonna happen.
Think about it, George.

232
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:03,550
- Transportation has been arranged.
- Problems with last-minute changes?

233
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,703
- lt's going to cost more.
- How much?

234
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,784
200,000.

235
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:11,027
You should try, Jack, the borek.

236
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:15,025
- lt is wonderful.
- Do you need anything else?

237
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:17,308
No. Everything is perfect.

238
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:20,667
My father told me to take good care of you.

239
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:25,588
The service was impeccable
and my compliments to the chef.

240
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:28,547
Thank you. lt was my mother's recipe.

241
00:18:34,353 --> 00:18:37,425
Drop the weapons! Drop the weapons!

242
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:42,507
Put your weapons down!
Put your weapons down or l'll cut her throat!

243
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:44,549
Drop the weapons!

244
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:48,623
Put them down.

245
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:51,747
- You too, Victor.
- Of course.

246
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:54,465
Drop the weapon!

247
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:01,631
You son of a bitch.

248
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:05,422
- One more death for you to atone for, Jack.
- You son of a bitch!

249
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:08,232
How could you do this?

250
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:11,626
- What happened?
- Call CTU now.

251
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:14,910
Tell them l want your brother
Alexis here now.

252
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:19,305
Tie his hands behind his back.
And keep her father away from here.

253
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:23,784
You're supposed to be watching him.
What am l paying you for?

254
00:19:37,073 --> 00:19:39,382
- Where's Teri?
- ln the conference room.

255
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:41,464
(phone rings)

256
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:43,781
Mason.

257
00:19:43,873 --> 00:19:46,671
Mr Mason. What have you decided?

258
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:51,344
Mr Mason?

259
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:55,346
We're gonna do the swap on our terms.

260
00:19:55,433 --> 00:20:01,190
Yeah, that's an interesting dream. The swap
will take place exactly 30 minutes from now.

261
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:06,825
The address is 2127 Grand Avenue.
A green SUV will be waiting.

262
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:10,303
- Place my brother inside the vehicle.
- What about Jack?

263
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:13,829
When my brother's in position
l'll direct you to Bauer.

264
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:17,831
You have 29 minutes.

265
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,427
l got it. 2127 Grand Avenue.

266
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:25,345
- lt's a repair garage.
- Get ahold of Chris Porterfield at LAPD.

267
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,550
Tell him we're taking over the streets
in that area for two hours.

268
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:31,466
- Where are you going?
- The hospital, to get Alexis.

269
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:34,226
He just got stabbed.
They're not gonna let him out.

270
00:20:34,313 --> 00:20:36,907
They're gonna have to.

271
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:44,149
Oh, no, don't worry. My name's
not gonna be even close to this.

272
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:46,667
(man) This conversation has
to end between us two.

273
00:20:46,753 --> 00:20:48,789
- l agree.
- OK, then.

274
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,262
- Look, l gotta get back.
- We're clear?

275
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:53,344
Yeah.

276
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,501
There you are. David, where have you been?

277
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:09,345
l had to make some calls.

278
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,503
Just in case you haven't noticed,

279
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:15,506
everyone is here to see you. You need
to make an impression, not phone calls.

280
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:18,061
- l know what l have to do, Sherry.
- Do you really?

281
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,225
Don't talk down to me, Sherry. l don't like it.

282
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,908
l hope the weakness you've shown today
is because you missed a night's sleep

283
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,029
and you'll be back on your game tomorrow.

284
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:31,903
Otherwise we will be buried
before this election even happens.

285
00:21:35,953 --> 00:21:38,672
Steven! No, stay. l'll be over.

286
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:40,709
Get to work.

287
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:50,548
Senator? The Wall Street Journal
had a couple of questions for you.

288
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:54,308
l put together some past quotes
so you wouldn't have to bother with it.

289
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:57,305
l... l hope that's all right.

290
00:21:57,393 --> 00:21:59,384
Sure.

291
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,623
Well, don't you look gorgeous tonight?

292
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:07,183
- You've seen this before.
- lt's not just the dress.

293
00:22:07,273 --> 00:22:08,422
Thank you.

294
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:15,708
Patty, l've been thinking. Since this incident
with Keith is out in the open,

295
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,627
it's gonna shift the focus of every interview,
every press conference.

296
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:24,184
Yeah. l've already started a Q and A of all the
questions to expect over the next few days.

297
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:28,425
- Have you talked to Mike about this?
- Not yet. l need a little more time to prepare.

298
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,188
- l'd like to see whatever you have so far.
- Sure. Whenever you want.

299
00:22:32,273 --> 00:22:34,264
How about now?

300
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:36,745
- Now?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,064
Everybody seems to be having
a good time. There's an open bar.

302
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:43,862
- l doubt anyone will even notice l'm gone.
- l doubt that's true, Senator.

303
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:48,026
ln any event, l could use some quiet time.
Stay here. Tell me where your notes are.

304
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:53,062
lf you don't mind, l'd rather walk you through
it. lt would make more sense to you that way.

305
00:22:53,153 --> 00:22:57,863
OK. Why don't you meet me
upstairs in, say, five minutes?

306
00:22:57,953 --> 00:22:59,944
Sure.

307
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,630
(sobbing)

308
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:12,112
Ah.

309
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:14,184
My dear friend.

310
00:23:15,073 --> 00:23:18,702
lt's not what you think.
l have lost my wife and daughter.

311
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:23,708
You, both of your brothers and now Mila.
This is what our enemies have done to us.

312
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:26,990
He would have killed her,
and not in a merciful way.

313
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:43,472
How could you do this, murderer?

314
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:48,147
You killed my daughter.

315
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:52,112
You killed my daughter!

316
00:23:52,193 --> 00:23:54,582
You murderer! You...

317
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:02,583
- (Andre) We have to get out of here.
- Kim!

318
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:05,062
(Andre) Get him in the van.

319
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,144
(speak in Serbian)

320
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:15,142
Get this place cleaned out.

321
00:24:38,153 --> 00:24:41,225
Nina. What's happening?
Are they gonna help Jack?

322
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,873
- Yes. They're gonna trade.
- That's good, isn't it?

323
00:24:43,953 --> 00:24:46,706
- What do you think? Will he be safe?
- l think so.

324
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:50,103
Victor wants his son back,
so l don't think he'll pull anything.

325
00:24:50,193 --> 00:24:52,707
Oh, thank God.
And when's this gonna happen?

326
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:56,263
10, 15 minutes.
Mason's already left to pick up Alexis.

327
00:24:56,353 --> 00:25:00,062
That's so good. l can hardly wait
for this whole thing to be over.

328
00:25:00,153 --> 00:25:03,828
l think when Jack and Kim arrive,
l'll just have to collapse in a big heap.

329
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:06,302
- Do you need anything else?
- Um...

330
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:09,908
Actually, there is one thing.
l know Kim's on her way over here

331
00:25:09,993 --> 00:25:12,666
but l'd feel better if l could
speak to her on the phone.

332
00:25:12,753 --> 00:25:15,870
ls there any way you could patch me
through to the police car?

333
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:20,469
We were so busy tracking Jack, l didn't
have a chance to check on them. Um...

334
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:24,592
- Yeah, let me see if that's possible.
- Thank you. Nina.

335
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:29,661
l know it's been a really long day for you too,
and l guess l want you to know

336
00:25:29,753 --> 00:25:33,951
how much l appreciate your being
up front with me about everything.

337
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:39,390
Sure.

338
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:56,907
l couldn't tell her.

339
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:04,912
l just couldn't
after everything she's been through.

340
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:06,984
l understand.

341
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,551
You OK?

342
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:20,624
l just...

343
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:23,785
l just feel like l'm not doing my job.

344
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,627
Look, there's nothing wrong with
the way you're doing your job, OK?

345
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:31,262
l mean, ultimately, we're here
to try to help people, right?

346
00:26:31,353 --> 00:26:34,470
l don't know anybody
who does that better than you.

347
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,384
Thanks.

348
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:43,584
You're welcome.

349
00:26:53,753 --> 00:26:57,541
(Jack) You gotta let my daughter go.
She's got nothing to do with this.

350
00:26:57,633 --> 00:27:01,512
You want me to do something for you,
l'll do it, but let my daughter go. l'm not...

351
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:07,145
After what you have done, l should kill you
and your daughter right now. Don't test me.

352
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,827
You're not thinking this through, Andre.

353
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:15,064
You have a chance to get out
with your brother and father alive.

354
00:27:15,153 --> 00:27:18,543
- You kill innocents, they'll never let you...
- Enough!

355
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:23,582
Your best tactic right now, Mr Bauer,
is to be quiet and let my father rest.

356
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:26,869
OK.

357
00:27:38,713 --> 00:27:42,183
All l care about with Ferragamo
is that the public knows,

358
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:46,425
in no uncertain terms, that Carl and the
Latham Group acted outside our influence.

359
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:51,633
No, they will. Mike's already started setting
up interviews with all the major papers.

360
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,829
He's clearing up points with your attorney.

361
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:57,622
By the morning you should be able
to speak freely and get the word out.

362
00:27:57,713 --> 00:28:02,384
- When did you have time to do all this?
- ln the last couple of hours.

363
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:06,823
You wrote two speeches for me today.

364
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:10,708
lf l don't help you get into the White House,
l'm out of a job.

365
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:17,225
- Would you care for a glass of champagne?
- Sure.

366
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:24,169
- When do you find time for a life?
- Well, this is my life.

367
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:28,029
Oh, no, no, no. l mean a boyfriend. 
Friends.

368
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:30,832
Ah. l know.
 l should get out more.

369
00:28:30,913 --> 00:28:32,904
Yeah, you should.

370
00:28:34,593 --> 00:28:36,504
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

371
00:28:36,593 --> 00:28:38,749
You're welcome.

372
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:41,872
Cheers.

373
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,713
Mm. What are we drinking to?

374
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:47,468
To taking five minutes off, starting now.

375
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:50,825
- Mm, well. Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

376
00:28:57,793 --> 00:29:02,091
So, um, you and Sherry
were childhood sweethearts?

377
00:29:03,633 --> 00:29:05,824
That's right.

378
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:09,990
And there's never been anyone else?

379
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:13,709
l'm running for president, Patty.
l can't answer that.

380
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,969
Come on.

381
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:25,224
Are you flirting with me, Patty?

382
00:29:25,313 --> 00:29:28,311
l don't know.
 l think l might be.

383
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:38,104
This is good. Tell Mike l wanna meet
with him on this first thing in the morning.

384
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,981
l want you there. Call Everly.
Someone from legal should be there too.

385
00:29:42,073 --> 00:29:44,064
- Done.
- And...

386
00:29:44,873 --> 00:29:48,627
it wouldn't hurt to put in
a little more face time downstairs.

387
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:51,386
l think you might be right.

388
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,629
- Shall we?
- Yes.

389
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:27,304
(Jack grunts)

390
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:31,304
Wait here, Father.

391
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:44,144
(Jack groans)

392
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:51,029
lf your people deliver my brother
as promised, you'll live.

393
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:53,463
lf not, then you'll die here.

394
00:30:56,393 --> 00:30:59,465
There are sniper rifles
currently aiming at you.

395
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:02,863
- They await my instructions.
- What about my daughter?

396
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:07,185
You'll hear from us when this is over -
if you make it that far -

397
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:11,266
and to dissuade you from wasting
valuable time trying to trace,

398
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,662
l prepared a scrambled phone.

399
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:17,547
What do you want me to do?

400
00:31:18,153 --> 00:31:20,144
Not yet.

401
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:27,547
What do you want me to do?!

402
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:09,026
- Oh, Senator.
- Hey, John. Thanks for coming.

403
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:14,031
Hey, Michael. Thanks for coming.
Look at you. Don't you look nice?

404
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,232
- Sir.
- Hey, how are you?

405
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:18,404
Senator.

406
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:22,584
There you are. l'd like for you to meet

407
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:26,791
Doctors Bryan Chasin
and Darrell Maines from UCLA.

408
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:31,344
Yes, of course. You're the gentlemen doing
such wonderful work in AlDS research.

409
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,742
Sweetheart, l need to look after something.

410
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,024
- Uh-huh.
- Excuse me.

411
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:42,069
So, what isn't the government doing
for you that we could fix next term?

412
00:32:55,193 --> 00:32:57,104
Patty?

413
00:32:57,193 --> 00:33:00,703
- Hi.
- You were upstairs with David, weren't you?

414
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:04,544
Yes.

415
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,742
Good. What happened?

416
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:12,111
- l did what you told me.
- And?

417
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:17,986
l think it's working. Mrs Palmer,
l'm not sure where all of this is going.

418
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:24,432
All you need to know is that this is for his
own good and for the good of his campaign.

419
00:33:26,193 --> 00:33:31,187
What's the problem? l thought you liked
David. This shouldn't be a tough assignment.

420
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:33,946
l do like him.

421
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:37,191
lt's just hard for me to deceive him like this.

422
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:44,431
l understand your hesitation.

423
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:50,549
But l know my husband better than anybody
and he needs someone like you right now.

424
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:55,343
But it's gonna lead
to other things, Mrs Palmer.

425
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,948
Well, we'll just deal with that
when the time comes.

426
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,224
Oh, cherries. Mm.

427
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:04,504
Thanks.

428
00:34:48,193 --> 00:34:50,145
Everyone in position.

429
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:15,844
OK, we're here. Stay outside the perimeter.
Let's just get in and get out.

430
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:26,821
- Here's Alexis. Where's Jack?
- What's wrong with him?

431
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:30,389
- Nothing. He'll be fine.
- Alexis, are you all right?

432
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,983
(phone rings)

433
00:35:38,073 --> 00:35:40,109
- Yes.
- Alexis is hurt.

434
00:35:40,193 --> 00:35:41,911
- How badly?
- Worse than we thought.

435
00:35:41,993 --> 00:35:43,870
He's fine.

436
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:47,782
- We need a doctor.
- l'll have one there when you arrive. Go.

437
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:54,029
- What are we doing here?
- Once we're satisfied you're not following us,

438
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:59,003
- we'll give you Jack's location.
- That's unacceptable. We need to know now.

439
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:03,387
Hold it right there.

440
00:36:03,473 --> 00:36:06,471
Move to second position. 
We have a problem.

441
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:14,188
Are you going to shoot me?

442
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:18,425
You should have taken more English lessons.
''Trade'' means we get something too.

443
00:36:18,513 --> 00:36:21,705
l want Jack now
or you're all coming back with us.

444
00:36:24,233 --> 00:36:27,550
We have Jack's daughter.
You must know that by now.

445
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,908
What are you saying?
We get Jack and Kimberly?

446
00:36:30,993 --> 00:36:35,928
My English is clear. You're going
to get back Jack, as discussed.

447
00:36:36,553 --> 00:36:39,545
- What about the daughter?
- That's not my concern.

448
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:45,070
l need to talk to Drazen.

449
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:48,384
lf you keep holding me here,
l can't return Alexis to his father.

450
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:51,267
We are on a schedule, remember?

451
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:03,285
All right. Move back to the perimeter.
