1
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:18,906
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,564
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,907
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:32,250
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:47,593
Listen up, people. Listen up!

6
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:51,935
Alexis Drazen was leaving for a meeting.
At this meeting he was gonna make a payoff.

7
00:00:52,026 --> 00:00:56,902
So somewhere in this room there is money.
l want it found and l want it found now.

8
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,323
- Elizabeth can't be held responsible for this.
- l don't disagree.

9
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:03,909
But we have a tape of her plunging
a letter opener into a man's stomach.

10
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:06,321
- You got her into this.
- No, sir, l did not.

11
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,202
l did not ask her to stab Alexis Drazen.

12
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:15,628
l misjudged her ability to handle the stress
of this, and as l said, l will do all l can to help.

13
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,506
l know you're just trying to protect me.

14
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:24,641
Senator, l understand
the situation that you're in.

15
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:29,138
But l do not need to remind you that
there are at least two suspects at large.

16
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,310
Sir, please, l implore you. Have as much
security around you as you can tolerate,

17
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:35,559
and let us do our job.

18
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:42,694
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir. l promise l will.

19
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,493
(Nina) They need to bag all this as evidence.

20
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:58,003
- (Nina) OK. All this needs to be included.
- 15 minutes, team. Gotta be ready to go.

21
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:03,047
- (man) Bingo.
- (Nina) Found it!

22
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:06,757
- What?
- Bearer bonds.

23
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,684
As good as cash and easier to move.
Got the address of the restaurant yet?

24
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:15,556
- California Plaza. lt's 20 minutes from here.
- Good.

25
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,688
How are you gonna pull this off?
Pretending to be Alexis?

26
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:21,152
l don't know yet. Hey, Jake.

27
00:02:21,782 --> 00:02:24,356
Jake, come here. Give me your shirt.

28
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:28,236
- l'm going with you. Coordinate your backup.
- Fine.

29
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:40,001
- What's the update on Bauer's family?
- Still missing.

30
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,418
Anything back from forensics yet?

31
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:47,257
Based on preliminary reports, it looks like
the agents were killed protecting the women.

32
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,217
We have to find the wife and daughter.
l alerted a task force over at District.

33
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:54,064
Call and see if they need
anything else from our end.

34
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:56,686
- All right.
- Tony?

35
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,608
Still no word to Jack on any of this,
understand?

36
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,148
What do you want me to tell him
if he calls and asks?

37
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:09,283
Tell him you're workin' on somethin' else
and put him through to me, all right?

38
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,009
What are you lookin' for?

39
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:27,795
Whoever Dan was working for
might have information about my mom.

40
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,508
This guy who was in charge - Gaines?
l'd never met him before. Dan knew him.

41
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:34,058
- Maybe his number's here.
- What are you gonna do?

42
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,222
Call him and ask for your mom back?

43
00:03:36,315 --> 00:03:39,352
Any information l find,
l'm gonna give it to the police.

44
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:44,988
You hear that, Rick? She's gonna
call the police. ls that OK with you?

45
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:50,365
- l thought you said you don't trust the police.
- Whatever. l'll give it to my dad.

46
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:56,829
Dan'll go ballistic when he finds out
you guys have been going through his stuff.

47
00:03:59,964 --> 00:04:04,590
- You didn't tell her Dan's dead?
- Not yet. l don't wanna freak her out.

48
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:09,505
Besides, Dan's brother Frank is on his way
here and l don't want him to know.

49
00:04:10,558 --> 00:04:14,887
- Don't say anything, OK?
- OK.

50
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,315
(Kim sighs)

51
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,061
This is such a waste of time.
We're never gonna find anything.

52
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,230
l don't even know why l came.

53
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:36,416
You're married.
You have a daughter named Kimberly.

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,576
- l have a daughter?
- Yes.

55
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,621
A teenage daughter.

56
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:48,086
You and Jack, you were separated
about six months ago. That's when we met.

57
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:54,553
- Who are you?
- l'm a friend.

58
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:57,679
A very good friend...

59
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:02,557
- who wanted to be a lot more.
- But...

60
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:06,519
You were afraid to start a relationship,
so we didn't.

61
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:09,734
Then you decided
to go back with your husband.

62
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:13,785
Maybe it was because of Kimberly.
l don't know.

63
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:17,289
But you asked me not to call, and l haven't.

64
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,961
l... l don't remember any of this.

65
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:28,257
We need to get you to a hospital,
have you looked at.

66
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:33,765
- Why? You said you were a doctor.
- l'm a surgeon. You need a neurologist.

67
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,183
- You've suffered some trauma.
- l don't wanna go to a hospital.

68
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,224
- Why not?
- l don't know. l just don't want to.

69
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,812
What if l examined you here?

70
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:49,272
OK.

71
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:57,660
(Carl) There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office

72
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,871
that leads directly to you.

73
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:04,078
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time.

74
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:06,709
But with a little help, they'll find it.

75
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:14,010
- (Keith) So l'll be framed for his murder?
- Like l said, whatever it takes.

76
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,805
l don't know what you think you got.

77
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:27,687
What we've got is a tape of Carl Webb
admitting that he set my son up for murder.

78
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,272
lt's a while since l've practised law,

79
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:34,651
but l know that unless
Keith was sanctioned by a court order

80
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:38,077
and prepped by an authority,
this is not evidence.

81
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:42,244
l've been in politics long enough to know
that if the media gets hold of this tape,

82
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,411
the truth will come out.

83
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:49,379
No. Today can't be about two things, David.

84
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:53,547
lt's either about winning the primary,
securing the party nomination,

85
00:06:53,638 --> 00:06:58,299
or it's about a political scandal,
but it can't be about both.

86
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,819
- Destroy the tape.
- What?

87
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:16,698
lf you don't, not only
will you bring down yourself,

88
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,074
but you'll bring the entire party down.

89
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:22,034
- How do l do that?
- Because you're gonna win today.

90
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:24,959
You'll have enough delegates
by eight o'clock.

91
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,955
You are the Democratic Party's candidate
for president, whether you like it or not.

92
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:35,838
And if you decide to self-destruct, it will take
years for the party's platform to recover.

93
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,758
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't we
let the electorate decide on that?

94
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,470
And l don't consider
telling the truth self-destructive.

95
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,730
And how bad will it be for the Democrats

96
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:52,360
if somebody else comes out with this first
and l have to go on the defensive?

97
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,482
What do you think, Mike?

98
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,247
l've seen much uglier stories
kept under wraps.

99
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:10,537
The only people who know about this tape
are the people in this room and Keith.

100
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,831
This would not be a difficult item to shelve.

101
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:18,551
And besides, this is currency.

102
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:23,093
Once you get into the White House,
this could protect you.

103
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,558
- How?
- Well, think about it.

104
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:31,564
You'll have evidence against some of
the most powerful men in the country.

105
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,403
They won't be able to control you, David.

106
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:53,796
- Tony, it's Jack. How's everything going?
- Fine.

107
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:56,634
l need to speak to Mason.
He's not in his office.

108
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:59,292
- He's on the floor. Let me transfer you.
- OK. Wait.

109
00:08:59,388 --> 00:09:02,425
Before you do, have you spoken to Teri yet?

110
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:06,557
- No.
- Give me the number ofthe safe house.

111
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,478
- l'll call over there myself.
- Look, let me see if l can get that for you.

112
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,642
Hang on a second.

113
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:18,235
- What's up?
- Jack's on the phone. He wants you.

114
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,029
- OK.
- And he wants the number of the safe house.

115
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:23,609
- Of course he does.
- Look...

116
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:28,906
- Why not tell him what happened?
- Why is this so difficult to comprehend?

117
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:33,129
The man is neck-deep in an investigation.
He has a job to do. Let's let him do it.

118
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:38,421
We get him to a controlled environment, we
can tell him. Meanwhile, we have a job to do.

119
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,180
l gotta say, l just think it's wrong.

120
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:47,302
lt's not about right and wrong. lt's about the
fact that we have a priority to protect Palmer.

121
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:49,352
He's on line two.

122
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:52,309
- Jack, it's me. Where are you?
- We're on our way to a meet.

123
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,566
- What kind of meet?
- Alexis was supposed to make a payoff.

124
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:58,061
- A payoff to who?
- l'm not sure yet.

125
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:00,943
- So what are you gonna do?
- Pretend to be Alexis.

126
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,571
Oh, Jack, you're never gonna pull that off.

127
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:06,911
Alexis was supposed
to pay this guy $50,000 in bearer bonds.

128
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:10,616
George, you're gonna have to work
with me on this. l need backup.

129
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,244
Milo's got the address.
We should be there in about 15 minutes.

130
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:18,588
You keep this guy in play, we got
a chance of bringing these guys down.

131
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:23,089
Otherwise you can wait for Alexis to come to,
ifhe comes to. By then this could be over.

132
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,763
- All right. l'll go along. l'll send you a team.
- Thank you.

133
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:30,599
Can you pass me to Tony? He was gonna
give me the number for the safe house.

134
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:34,638
Yeah. l just spoke to Paulson over there.
He said the girls were sleeping.

135
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,518
OK. Um, get them to call me back
on my cell when they wake up.

136
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:40,605
- Definitely.
- Thank you.

137
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:43,189
- Mason's on board.
- Oh, that's good.

138
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:09,095
- So what else did Teri say?
- She didn't say much.

139
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,057
Once she guessed that you'd been seeing me,
she didn't wanna talk to me.

140
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:17,517
Not that l blame her.
But l couldn't finish the debrief.

141
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,730
l left and let Paulson do it.
Maybe that was a mistake.

142
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:24,487
No. You did the right thing.
This is my fault. l should have told her.

143
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:29,202
- Sounds like she didn't wanna talk about it.
- Doesn't matter. l still should have told her.

144
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:34,495
Jack, from what l could see,
she really loves you and wants to work it out.

145
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:41,082
- Maybe you wanna call and see how she is.
- l tried. Mason said they were sleeping.

146
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:48,343
You know, why don't you call Paulson
and see if they're up yet?

147
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,939
- lt's not going through.
- lt might be the area.

148
00:11:56,023 --> 00:11:58,431
Try again when we get to the plaza.

149
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,690
Look, l'm really sorry about all this.

150
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,855
Yeah, me too.

151
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,278
(Mason) Hanlin? No.

152
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:16,074
Come on, guys. Do what you can.
At least try to find somebody else, huh?

153
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,578
Yeah.

154
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:23,128
- Yeah?
- l need extra bodies to help track the Bauers.

155
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:26,467
l don't know. l don't see anyone
doing crossword puzzles here.

156
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:29,638
Look, uh, my hands are
a little tied without Nina here.

157
00:12:29,724 --> 00:12:31,800
Cos Nina's with Jack, right?

158
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,387
Yeah.

159
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:40,479
She says it's over between them.
What do you think?

160
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:43,237
- What?
- No, l'm just asking.

161
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:46,191
You gotta be wondering yourself, right?

162
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:50,029
Hey, Almeida. l'm on your side.

163
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,990
Nina oughta be here right now.
What does Jack need her for?

164
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:58,743
You bust your ass with no resources because
she's with him. lf that works for you, great.

165
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:02,371
You know what works for me? You keeping
out of my personal business. OK?

166
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:06,462
Know what? There's entirely too much
personal business going on around here.

167
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,877
l wanna get this place back on track.

168
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:13,966
- lt seems Nina is a big part of the problem.
- How do you figure that?

169
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,935
She covers for everyone that doesn't
follow code. And they cover for her.

170
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,021
She's with Jack. She's with you.

171
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:25,774
You don't think that's relevant?
You don't think that's a distraction?

172
00:13:25,863 --> 00:13:29,731
- No, l don't.
- No, you don't. Well, l do.

173
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:51,882
- Patty said you wanted to talk to me, Dad.
- Yeah. Sit down. Close the door.

174
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:58,100
What's up?

175
00:13:58,187 --> 00:14:03,145
Before l make my decision about giving
this tape to the DA, l wanted to talk to you.

176
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,811
OK.

177
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:08,437
l wanted you to understand
what you're up against.

178
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,982
- l understand, Dad. l'm ready to go.
- No, no, no.

179
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:14,152
Listen to me.

180
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,030
We're going to the press with a story

181
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:21,500
about some bad men committing murder
and trying to frame you.

182
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:24,337
But these men are going
to shift the attention to you

183
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:27,625
and your involvement
with Lyle Gibson's death.

184
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:30,671
Ultimately,
they're gonna make this about you.

185
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,881
On television, in the press,
everywhere you go.

186
00:14:35,516 --> 00:14:39,561
You're gonna be accused
of a crime you did not commit.

187
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,101
- Can you live through that?
- Yes, l can.

188
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:45,190
Don't just say it.

189
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,731
Think about it.

190
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:51,978
Dad...

191
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:55,360
What do you think l've been living through?

192
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:58,204
Not just today, but for years?

193
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,787
l made a mistake.

194
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:08,255
l was wrong to go to Mom and Carl.
l should have come forward right away.

195
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:12,260
Taken my hits right then and there.

196
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,670
But l was scared.

197
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,841
That's what you learn.

198
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,348
lt's OK to be scared.

199
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,853
What l said last night...

200
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,524
About you not being there.

201
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:38,528
lt's not true.

202
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,829
lt's, uh...

203
00:15:43,918 --> 00:15:48,129
what l told myself
so l can blame you for my screwup.

204
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:55,335
lt doesn't matter why you said it.
The fact is, there's some truth to it.

205
00:15:56,347 --> 00:15:58,838
l haven't always been there.

206
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,887
But l'm here now.

207
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,487
- Jovan?
- Yes, Andre?

208
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,033
l can't find Alexis. Have you heard from him?

209
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:23,328
- No.
- He's meeting Morgan in 20 minutes.

210
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,823
- l need to talk to him.
- l don't know, Andre.

211
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,619
- l've got my own situation to deal with.
- Still no sign of the women?

212
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:32,501
- l'll find them.
- You checked the hospitals?

213
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,803
l checked everywhere. l don't need
you looking over my shoulder!

214
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:40,091
l'll find them and kill them.
Don't worry about it.

215
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:44,809
Calm down, and don't tell me not to worry.
Just tell me how you plan to find them.

216
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:51,810
l'm going to the Bauer house.
Eventually, someone will show.

217
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,279
- Aunt Ethel isn't there.
- Anyone else?

218
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:07,991
l've tried everyone l can think of.
No one's heard from my mom.

219
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:12,130
- Rick. We got things to do. She's gotta go.
- What kind of things?

220
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:17,090
- You'll find out when Frank gets here.
- What's that supposed to mean?

221
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,929
- Kim's in trouble. l gotta help her.
- We'll be in trouble too.

222
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:25,100
- Look, she has to leave.
- OK. That's fine.

223
00:17:25,186 --> 00:17:27,392
Kim, wait. Wait.

224
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:31,723
Hey, look. l just need to talk to her
for a second, then she'll go.

225
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,019
Where are you gonna go?

226
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:41,484
There's a park my mom said to go
in an emergency, like an earthquake.

227
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:44,697
- Maybe she's there.
- Why don't you just go to your house?

228
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,196
The people that are after us
must know where l live.

229
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,123
- lf she's safe, she's not gonna go there.
- This park. How will you get there?

230
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,750
l don't know. Um...

231
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,876
Can l borrow your car?

232
00:17:56,968 --> 00:18:00,171
(sighs) lt's not mine, it's Melanie's.

233
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,090
Wait a minute.

234
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:18,151
Here. Take this. You can usually catch a cab
on Fourth. lt's a couple of blocks this way.

235
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,406
- Sure you can't come with me?
- After last night, l gotta lay low.

236
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:24,528
They're gonna be looking for me.

237
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,574
l still think you should turn yourself in.

238
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:30,701
lt's not that bad. You helped us escape.

239
00:18:30,793 --> 00:18:33,960
l'm on probation.
They catch me, l'm going to prison.

240
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,083
lt doesn't matter what you or your folks say.

241
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,386
l wish we would have met before this.

242
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:45,386
So do l.

243
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,017
Are you gonna be OK?

244
00:18:53,107 --> 00:18:55,265
Yeah.

245
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,695
l wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.

246
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,271
You wouldn't be in trouble if it wasn't for me.

247
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:05,153
That's not true.

248
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,868
Dan would have found someone else.

249
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:21,842
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey.

250
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,347
- So, how'd it go last night?
- lt went fine.

251
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,057
Yeah?

252
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,177
- Don't look fine. What happened to you?
- Nothin'. l'm OK.

253
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,855
Hey, Dan! Dan!

254
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,776
- Go. Get outta here. Grab a cab on Fourth.
- l know.

255
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,690
- Where's my brother?
- He's out.

256
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,859
- Out where?
- We got separated.

257
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:49,319
- Uh-huh. So where's the money?
- He's got it.

258
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,240
Uh-huh.

259
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:53,955
- l should get going.
- Where are you going?

260
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,119
- What do you mean?
- l don't know you.

261
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,501
- My name's Kim.
- Hi, Kim. How do you know Rick?

262
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:01,341
She's a friend from San Diego.
She's gotta get home.

263
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,999
- She's not going anywhere.
- What's that mean?

264
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:07,179
My brother's not here,
nor is my money, and l don't know her.

265
00:20:07,265 --> 00:20:10,633
- She's a friend.
- l got business going down in half an hour.

266
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:14,309
Until Dan gets back with the money,
nobody leaves.

267
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:40,081
(Nina) OK, the teams will be in
hidden positions here, here, here and here.

268
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,924
- (Jack) Communications?
- On the same channel as us.

269
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,085
- Exits?
- They'll be covered by the teams,

270
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,503
but l'll add one here at the widest exit.

271
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:49,673
- (phone rings)
- OK, good.

272
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:54,716
- Yeah?
- Jack, you all set up?

273
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:59,807
- Yeah. The team's in place?
- Yeah. That's what l wanted to call you about.

274
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,142
- Teddy Hanlin's running backup.
- What?

275
00:21:02,236 --> 00:21:05,735
Don't freak out. l'm sure it'll be fine.
Just avoid a confrontation.

276
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:09,773
- Dammit. How could you let this happen?
- l'm sorry. l just found out about it.

277
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,949
- Division made the assignment.
- l understand. Fine, l'll deal with it.

278
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:15,957
- l don't believe this.
- What?

279
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:19,826
- Teddy Hanlin's in charge of backup.
- Seth Campbell's old partner?

280
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,254
- Yeah.
- Great. Who are you calling?

281
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:29,426
The safe house. l wanna make sure Teri
and Kim are all right before this gets started.

282
00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:33,179
- No one's picking up. ls this number right?
- lt's the one Paulson gave me.

283
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:36,601
- Why can't l get through?
- Jack.

284
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,515
Hey, Jack. Haven't seen you
since you put my partner away.

285
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:44,985
- Teddy, don't start.
- Teddy, is your team in place?

286
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:49,400
Yeah. We're not up here shopping for
Dockers. l heard you really screwed up today.

287
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:54,533
l guess some people have connections and
don't get spanked when they break the law.

288
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:57,955
The guy we're looking for
is wearing a red cap. That's all we know.

289
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,331
l'll stay visible, hopefully draw him to me.

290
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,420
No one makes a move
until l give the word. ls that clear?

291
00:22:03,506 --> 00:22:06,423
lt's your show.
Just make sure you stay put when you do.

292
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:09,344
l always get a bit nervous
about target confusion,

293
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:12,797
and l'd hate to see one of
the good guys go down by mistake.

294
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,966
Teddy. Let's get started, OK?

295
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:19,430
Hey. l don't want a problem on this.

296
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:31,946
Hey. l got a call from the Rampart Division.

297
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:36,412
A woman matching Teri Bauer's description
was seen wandering around Griffith Park.

298
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:39,664
- You know, it's not far from the safe house.
- Where is she?

299
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,246
- She disappeared.
- All right. l'll get on the satellite uplink.

300
00:22:44,714 --> 00:22:46,920
- Post someone at the Bauer house.
- l did.

301
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:50,673
- Williams should be there in a few minutes.
- Good work.

302
00:22:58,686 --> 00:23:02,933
l don't like what l'm seeing. Looks like
you've been roughed up by someone.

303
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:07,986
Do you think maybe that l hit my head,
that that's why l can't remember?

304
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,486
That's just it.
There's no evidence of a head injury.

305
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:19,196
Except for the memory loss, you're coherent.
Beside the bruises, do you have any pain?

306
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,282
Yeah.

307
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:24,376
Something's been bothering me, sort of here.

308
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:35,546
Oh, my God. What...
What do you think happened to me?

309
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,716
l don't know.

310
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:42,896
But l... l think you have a condition.
lt's called dissociative amnesia.

311
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,393
lt can happen to someone when
they suffer an intense emotional trauma.

312
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:51,067
We need to get you to a hospital
so they can figure out what's going on.

313
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:56,446
No, l... l don't wanna do that. l...
l can't explain it, but for some reason l just...

314
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:01,281
l don't wanna go to a hospital. l just have
this gut feeling that it would be dangerous.

315
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:06,082
How could it be dangerous? l'd be with you.
l'd be by your side the entire time.

316
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,495
- Come on. lt'll be fine.
- No. l don't wanna go.

317
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:11,376
Teri, we can't stay here.
You need to get checked out.

318
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:15,002
Neural damage can become permanent
if it's not treated right away.

319
00:24:15,096 --> 00:24:17,053
- No, l don't wanna go.
- Come on.

320
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,883
l don't wanna go.

321
00:24:24,689 --> 00:24:28,556
l don't wanna go to the hospital.
Please don't make me go. l can't do it.

322
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:31,521
l'm sorry, but l can't.
l don't wanna go to the hospital.

323
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:33,486
- OK.
- l can't go.

324
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,612
OK.

325
00:24:39,704 --> 00:24:42,705
- Please, Phil. Just take me home.
- OK.

326
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,246
lt's OK. lt's all right.

327
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,457
Right. l heard.

328
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:52,337
No. No, we did much better in New York
than we thought. Oh, yeah, definitely.

329
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:54,501
(Palmer) Put this in my safe now.

330
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,511
Oh, yeah. That'll make him very happy.

331
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:02,590
Oh, l think so, too.
Oh, DNC, they'll really milk it.

332
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,476
Uh-huh.

333
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:07,721
Yeah.

334
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:10,520
Well, l... l'm not sure, but...

335
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:14,689
Well, that's good, though.
No, l spoke to Chris.

336
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,612
l told him we'd be in Baltimore
if we won New York. Mm-hm.

337
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:20,859
Right.

338
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,827
Mm-hm.

339
00:25:22,913 --> 00:25:25,202
Yeah. Jerry?

340
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:29,869
Jerry, listen. l gotta run.
We'll touch base in a couple of hours, OK?

341
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,252
Well, how are Beth and the girls?

342
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:35,879
That's terrific. All righty. Bye-bye.

343
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,135
Uh, Patty. Do you know where David went?

344
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:43,266
Just to the conference room. He and Mike
are meeting the publicist for tonight.

345
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:46,885
- Did he say how long he'd be?
- Um... he didn't say.

346
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,435
Shouldn't be about more than 15, 20 minutes.

347
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:54,435
- OK. Hm. Hey, did you hear about New York?
- Oh, yeah. lsn't it great?

348
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:24,555
- Oh. There you are. Jerry's on the line...
- l'm busy.

349
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:27,347
- He said he just wanted to...
- Well, l'm busy, Patty.

350
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:30,271
- Tell him l'll call him back.
- OK.

351
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,639
Oh, come on, Dan.

352
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:22,774
- Where's Keith?
- l don't know.

353
00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:28,244
- l heard, uh, you two had a talk.
- Yes, we did.

354
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:33,623
- You should talk to him too.
- Really? About what?

355
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,212
Well, we're putting him in a tough place.
He's gonna need both our support.

356
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:44,254
No, David. You're the one
who's put him in a tough place.

357
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:50,301
And as for needing us,
our... our baby left the nest a long time ago.

358
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:53,348
l don't think he cares
to hear what l have to say.

359
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:56,559
That's ridiculous. Speak to him, Sherry.

360
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:26,388
l destroyed it.

361
00:28:29,392 --> 00:28:32,262
- You destroyed the tape?
- Mm-hm.

362
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:42,311
And l know you're gonna be angry,
but it had to be done.

363
00:28:44,448 --> 00:28:48,316
You have blinders on.
You're not seeing this thing very clearly.

364
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:58,870
lt's for the best.

365
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:16,304
lt breaks my heart

366
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:19,849
that l was right.

367
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,813
Right about what, David?

368
00:29:32,455 --> 00:29:34,910
That wasn't the real tape, Sherry.

369
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,087
l've learned that l don't know you
as well as l thought l did.

370
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:51,716
l had to see just how far
you were willing to go.

371
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:01,022
l will do anything

372
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,315
to protect my family, David.

373
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:08,148
Anything.

374
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,993
Does that make me a bad person?

375
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,378
- Set up a press conference.
- When?

376
00:30:26,467 --> 00:30:29,801
- Now.
- We've got one in less than three hours.

377
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:33,552
- l want this one within the hour.
- Where?

378
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:39,062
Downstairs. l don't want anyone or anything
to interfere with what l have to say.

379
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,126
- Nina, l'm on channel one. Do you copy?
- Yeah, l hearyou, Jack. The signal's good.

380
00:31:09,218 --> 00:31:13,216
- Where are you posted?
- Under the east entrance, under the bridge.

381
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:17,218
Good. How about you, Teddy?

382
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:20,889
My teams are in position.

383
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:24,182
OK. l got you.

384
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:34,406
You're blocking my view, Jack.
Take a couple of steps back.

385
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,203
- How's that?
- There you go.

386
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:42,414
Perfect shot.

387
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,660
(Jack) OK.

388
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:51,583
- There you go, ma'am.
- Oh, thank you.

389
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:55,342
You're a very sensitive guy, Jack.
l've never seen that side of you.

390
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:57,969
Drop it, Teddy. We're working.

391
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:01,392
Jack can walk and chew gum
at the same time, can't you, Jack?

392
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:04,599
- What do you want?
- Nothin'. lt's just that we're both so busy.

393
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,181
We never really get a chance to talk.

394
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:11,403
Did you hear about
Seth Campbell's wife, Judy?

395
00:32:11,489 --> 00:32:15,154
- No, what about her?
- She hung herself.

396
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:18,448
Yeah. Happened a couple ofweeks ago.

397
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,863
l guess you didn't get the memo, huh?

398
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:24,207
lt was a real tragedy.
She didn't even bother leavin' a note.

399
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,535
l guess she thought it was kinda obvious.

400
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:31,207
Tryin' to raise four kids with
a husband in prison and no pension.

401
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:36,543
Cos why, Jack? You busted him for
linin' his pocket with a few extra dollars.

402
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:41,636
Look, l'm sorry about Judy and l'm sorry
about his kids, but this is not the time.

403
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,803
That's right. You're busy.

404
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:48,643
- Can this wait, Teddy?
- Uh, of course.

405
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:53,897
l just thought it'd be nice, you know,
to catch up, while we're hangin'.

406
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,528
Teddy, l understand why you're upset.

407
00:32:56,617 --> 00:33:01,742
As soon as this is over, l'll be happy to sit
down and tell you my side of the story.

408
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:05,449
l'd really like to hear
your side of the story, Jack.

409
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:09,291
Tell you what, why don't we go to
a Starbucks, get a couple of cappuccinos,

410
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,752
and we can have a little chinwag?

411
00:33:18,472 --> 00:33:21,308
- CTU, Mason.
- George, we have a problem.

412
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,848
- What?
- Teddy's on the channel hassling Jack.

413
00:33:23,936 --> 00:33:26,558
He's got a rifle,
and it's crawling with people here.

414
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:29,055
lt's too late. This is going down any minute.

415
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,819
- We have to do something.
- What channel are you on?

416
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:34,144
- Channel one.
- All right. Hang on.

417
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:37,774
(phone rings)

418
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:42,323
- Yeah?
- Tony, conference me in on channel one.

419
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,489
Uh, sure.

420
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,379
Hanlin, it's Mason.
What the hell's the matter with you?

421
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:55,413
You got a problem with Jack, bury it.
You realise how many agents we lost today?

422
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:58,380
You're in an uncontained
environment over there.

423
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:01,092
- So let's get on the same page now, huh?
- Yes, sir.

424
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:03,755
- Jack, you OK?
- Yeah.

425
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,927
OK. Let's get back to work.

426
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,997
(phone rings)

427
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:36,173
(Frank) Hello? Yeah, man, it's cool.
He'll be here.

428
00:34:58,364 --> 00:35:00,155
(car draws up)

429
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,701
(car door shuts)

430
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:16,958
CTU, this is Williams.
l've arrived at the Bauer house.

431
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:19,125
l'm checking the perimeter.

432
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:05,798
- ls this my neighbourhood?
- Not quite.

433
00:36:06,515 --> 00:36:08,591
We'll be there soon.

434
00:36:11,354 --> 00:36:13,927
Rick says he and Dan got separated.

435
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:17,439
He'll be here soon.
He knows we need the cash by seven.

436
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:25,985
- What happens when Dan doesn't show up?
- l don't know.

437
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:29,446
- l'm not gonna tell him his brother's dead.
- Why? You didn't do it.

438
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:32,374
- He's gonna find out.
- Not from me.

439
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,827
- (Kim sighs)
- What?

440
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:40,164
- l don't understand.
- Neither do l. Doing this deal is suicide.

441
00:36:40,257 --> 00:36:44,041
l'm not talking about the deal.
l'm talking about you.

442
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:46,758
- What do you mean?
- You have so much going for you.

443
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:51,344
You're smart, you're good-looking,
you're funny. How did you end up like this?

444
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:54,970
- l'm doing all right.
- All right? You're wanted by the police.

445
00:36:55,064 --> 00:36:59,062
You got shot in the arm. Your friends
that you hang out with are criminals.

446
00:36:59,151 --> 00:37:04,526
- Do you really wanna end up here?
- l do the best l can. l didn't grow up like you.

447
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:07,237
That's just an excuse.

448
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:11,241
l have a friend named Todd.
He went through two foster homes.

449
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,738
He's got a scholarship to Stanford now.

450
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:17,332
- Good for Todd. Why not go to his house?
- He can't help me find my mom.

451
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,496
Neither can l.

452
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:25,631
l know you're right. And if l get the chance,
l'll try to turn myself around.

453
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,171
But right now this thing is what it is,
and we've gotta get through it.

454
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:33,594
Get through this? This is crazy. You can't let
Frank make a drug deal without any money.

455
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:36,972
We won't get through this.
We'll get stuck in the middle of it.

456
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:40,683
- You have to talk to him, Rick.
- Hey, stud. Think fast.

457
00:37:40,776 --> 00:37:44,560
Thanks. So, what deal?

458
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:51,574
We're gonna take the 20 grand
you made last night and buy some ecstasy.

459
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:53,571
- Dan didn't tell you?
- No.

460
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:58,410
l'm gonna flip it to these guys in Redondo.
They'll pay 50 for it.

461
00:37:58,794 --> 00:38:04,168
- What happens if Dan doesn't show up?
- Hey, if Dan says he'll be here, he'll be here.

462
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:25,058
Someone get these kids out of here.

463
00:38:25,154 --> 00:38:28,108
- Station one, that's you.
- Roger. l'm on it.

464
00:39:00,314 --> 00:39:02,603
Hold up. l think l got him.

465
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:26,081
Hey.

466
00:39:44,317 --> 00:39:46,440
- Alexis?
- Yeah.

467
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:50,945
- l told you inside the restaurant.
- We're doing it out here.

468
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:53,783
- Why?
- Because there's a cop inside the restaurant.

469
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:56,785
Come on, let's get this over with.

470
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:01,120
Fine.

471
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:04,791
- Where's the money?
