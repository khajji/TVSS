1
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:18,771
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,403
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:25,698
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:32,003
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer.
This is the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,722
- Take the next exit.
- Placerita Canyon Road?

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,645
- Yeah.
- How much further is this place?

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,774
l told you l'd take you to your family
and l will. That was the deal.

8
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:13,608
The deal is you'd better hope my wife
and daughter are still alive. That's the deal.

9
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:25,117
(Alberta) l'm sure my being here
has been a big adjustment.

10
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:30,002
l appreciate the hard work
and long hours you're all putting in.

11
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:33,126
There's a high probability
that Palmer is still in danger,

12
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:35,922
but we are making progress on several fronts.

13
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:40,884
(woman) Senator, if we could just
get one statement from you, sir...

14
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,968
Yes, sir, please.

15
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,189
Our most promising lead
continues to be Jack Bauer.

16
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:01,158
Local and federal law enforcement
have made finding him a priority.

17
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:06,322
We're trying to locate the man who posed as
a photographer at the senator's appearance.

18
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,955
This man may have been
involved with Bauer.

19
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:15,048
l've told the agencies we're working with they
can expect full cooperation... from all of us.

20
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,048
Hopefully, we can repair some of the damage
caused by Bauer's recent actions.

21
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,925
Thank you. That's all.

22
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,511
(dials phone)

23
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,354
(phone rings)

24
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,435
- Bauer.
- (Nina) Jack.

25
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,228
You were right. Kevin Carroll showed up
with the information we need.

26
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,158
l'm on my way to where
Teri and Kim are being held.

27
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,864
- Where?
- Somewhere in the north valley.

28
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:47,580
East of the 5 between Tampa and Reseda.
l'm coming up to some orange groves now.

29
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,870
Activate the GPS function
on the PalmPilot you sent me.

30
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,129
l need satellite photos
so l can see what l'm going into.

31
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,666
Make them high res so l can
identify structures and personnel.

32
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,880
OK. l'll need a few minutes
to download off the satellite.

33
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:04,257
- lt won't be a fresh image.
- Fine. Get me what you can. l'll wait.

34
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,888
- Jack?
- What?

35
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,394
Green. She's still squeezing
everyone here to bring you in.

36
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,061
l will turn myself in
as soon as l know my family is safe.

37
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,522
- She thinks l've been in contact with you.
- Deny it. l'll back you up.

38
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:25,120
- l know you've put yourself on the line...
- No one's twisting my arm. l gotta go.

39
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,118
Excuse me.

40
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,701
- Was that Jack?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,165
- Where is he?
- The north valley, closing in on Teri and Kim.

42
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,923
- You gonna tell Green about this?
- Not until he gets them out.

43
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,088
What if he can't?

44
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,016
l'm gonna have to live with my mistake.

45
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,351
Tony, l appreciate
you looking the other way on this,

46
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,392
but don't feel you've gotta help me
cover for Jack any more.

47
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,606
l'm not doing this for Jack.

48
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,968
Kimberly. He tried to kill us.

49
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,681
l didn't have a choice.

50
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,318
Taking a person's life, believe me,
l... l feel sick.

51
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,774
That's just it, Mom. l don't feel bad at all. l...

52
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,654
l don't feel anything except happy he's dead.

53
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,407
(bleeping)

54
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,573
They're looking for him.

55
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:11,885
OK. We have to get outta here
before they find him. Cover up the blood.

56
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,571
(guard) Yeah, that's right, man.
No time for this.

57
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,990
There's two of them.
When they're gone, we'll move.

58
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,850
(phone rings)

59
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,273
- Nina.
- l have the photos. They're a few hours old.

60
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,735
Hold on.

61
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,196
- OK. l'm ready to receive.
- Are you there yet?

62
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,913
l'm just outside the perimeter.

63
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:22,000
l see a dozen people on the ground.
Some look like they're carrying weapons.

64
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,672
- That looks right.
- There could be more inside the buildings.

65
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,303
We should bring Green into this. Come
clean with her so she can authorise backup.

66
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,434
l don't want backup.
Not until l know my family is safe.

67
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,354
You cannot go into
an armed camp by yourself. lf...

68
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,222
Nina. My family's being
held hostage because of me.

69
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,603
lf you bring CTU in, they could screw up
and make this another Waco.

70
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,772
Send me the photo. Now.

71
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,859
- l'm sending.
- Thank you.

72
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,325
l'll get back to you.

73
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,922
Get outta the car.

74
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,093
What are you doing, Jack?

75
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,558
Dammit, Jack.
Will you get a hold of yourself?

76
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,897
We had an agreement.
l bring you here, you let me go.

77
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:30,731
The agreement was as soon as
my family is safe, l will let you go.

78
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:35,119
Jack, don't be stupid. Even if you get in there,
you'll never find them without me.

79
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,280
Come on!

80
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,583
Jack, please.

81
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,246
All right. All right.

82
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,012
You drive.

83
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:56,260
Jack, if Gaines thinks for a moment
that l brought you here,

84
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,889
he'll have no problem killing us both.

85
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,054
Then we should avoid Gaines.

86
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,555
Get in the car.

87
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,567
OK. OK. Just relax.

88
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,202
(sirens)

89
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:36,215
Real or not, the threat on your life will
probably give you a bounce in the polls.

90
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,314
- What's wrong, David?
- l'm tired.

91
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,352
There's something else.

92
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,611
You've been off your game
since you spoke to Carl.

93
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,864
Carl's gonna stop the Kingsley story
coming out... by cutting off her source.

94
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,367
- Keith's therapist?
- Yeah.

95
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,799
- Did Carl say how he planned to do this?
- No. He just said l'd better stay out of it.

96
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,456
Maybe that's good advice.

97
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:18,640
Well, you don't seriously think Carl
would do something to hurt this guy?

98
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,844
You know Carl better than l do. You tell me.

99
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,347
l think you're being paranoid,

100
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:32,146
but if you're really concerned
l'll call this therapist, tell him to be careful.

101
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,358
l already tried. l got his voice mail both times.

102
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,068
You called him? Exposing yourself like that?

103
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,581
For God's sakes, David,
you're running for president.

104
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,162
What were you thinking?!

105
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,138
Anything goes wrong, everyone
around the car dies, starting with you.

106
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,280
- Gaines has been waiting for you.
- l know.

107
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,783
- What happened to you?
- l had a fight with your wife.

108
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,453
Are you gonna open up the gate
or do l have to do it myself?

109
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,752
Roll up the window and go.

110
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,996
(Jack) Stop here.

111
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,257
- How many men on site?
- 15, 20.

112
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,631
- Which is it? 15 or 20?
- l didn't do the hiring.

113
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,891
My wife and daughter are in
one of these buildings. Which one?

114
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,937
- l don't know.
- Take a guess.

115
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,189
This whole rescue act...

116
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:45,277
You really think it's gonna make up for
how you screwed up your marriage, Jack?

117
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,613
Teri's told me everything.

118
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:52,033
How you were never around,
the separation... l mean...

119
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,453
You're wasting your time.

120
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,005
Teri's been very lonely.

121
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,468
For the last time, which building are they in?

122
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:15,774
lt's this one.
lt used to be used for cold storage.

123
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,114
Dammit.

124
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,791
- Yeah.
- You understand my concern.

125
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,503
- Yeah.
- You do realise what's at stake, don'tyou?

126
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,886
You know we're working against the clock?

127
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,186
Don't worry, Mr Drazen.
Yeah, we'll be outta here within the hour.

128
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,315
- lf there's a problem, you'll be first to know.
- l want an update soon.

129
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,108
Yeah.

130
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,067
Hey, Rick.

131
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,235
- Where's Eli?
- l haven't seen him.

132
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:06,072
l sent him to take care of the women
a while ago. See what's taking so long.

133
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,912
You want me to load this up first?

134
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,285
Yeah.

135
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,538
Dammit.

136
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,386
(siren)

137
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,608
(phone rings)

138
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,231
- Hello.
- This is Dr Ferragamo.

139
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,403
Thankyou for returning my call.

140
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:17,873
- Your message said it was urgent.
- Yes. l wanted to talk to you about my son.

141
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:24,250
- l can't do that. Doctor-patient privilege.
- lt didn't stop you from talking to the press.

142
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,420
- lf you're calling to threaten me...
- l am not the one who's threatening you.

143
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,800
Really?

144
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:36,131
Whatever you leaked to Kingsley, certain
people wanna stop you from confirming it.

145
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,979
l assume you're referring to yourself?

146
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,597
No! l'm trying to protect you.

147
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,902
You've covered up one murder, and now
you're threatening me if l don't keep quiet?

148
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,320
- You're twisting my words.
- l think l'm hearing you clearly.

149
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,027
(dials phone)

150
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:59,992
You've reached the office ofDr Ferragamo.
Please leave your name at the tone.

151
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:04,212
Dr Ferragamo, pick up the phone, please.
l need you to hear me out.

152
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,213
Dr Ferragamo.

153
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,336
Doesn't sound like it went very well.

154
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,804
l need to see him. Talk to him face to face.

155
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,435
- Later.
- Now.

156
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,686
You're supposed to be delivering
your policy statement

157
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,524
on public health care in one hour.

158
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,526
- l'll be late.
- What are you going to do?

159
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,317
Pull up to his office with your motorcade?

160
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,816
l'll ride with Secret Service.

161
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,738
You're getting in way over your head.

162
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,374
Pull over.

163
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,787
(siren)

164
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,839
They're gone. Let's go.

165
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,220
Are you ready?

166
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,103
- Kimberly...
- Mom, don't say anything. l know.

167
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,446
l love you too.

168
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,553
Sh. Teri, it's me. lt's Jack. Sh.

169
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,180
lt's me, baby.

170
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,111
- You OK?
- Yeah.

171
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,403
- Where's Kim?
- She's here.

172
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,859
- Kim? Sweetheart, come here.
- Daddy! Oh!

173
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,865
- (Jack) lt's gonna be OK.
- l knew you'd come.

174
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,538
lt's all right, baby. lt's all right.

175
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,632
- Can we leave now?
- Baby, we're gonna get outta here soon.

176
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,794
OK? Just one minute.

177
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,366
Making any progress?

178
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,793
- We're working on the threat assessment.
- l think you both know where Jack is.

179
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,750
You're interfering with a criminal
investigation, harbouring a fugitive...

180
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,837
Jack is not a threat to Palmer.

181
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,548
How do you know if you haven't talked
to him? And why is he still missing?

182
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:07,019
- Polygraph us if you think we're lying.
- So you can stall some more?

183
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,230
Save us all a lot of time and trouble
and just tell me where he is.

184
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,066
Tony, go to holding room two.
l'll be there soon.

185
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,411
- Nina, go to one.
- What are you doin'?

186
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,573
- l'm suspending you both.
- What?

187
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:31,079
- Until one of you tells me where Jack is.
- You don't have the authority to do that.

188
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,207
The first one to tell me
will have a career and a future here.

189
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,549
The other one will be
prosecuted and discharged.

190
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,860
Rick! l thought l told you to go check on Eli.

191
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,529
Yes, sir!

192
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,924
- Who is he?
- They sent him to kill us.

193
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,632
- When?
- About a half-hour ago.

194
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,223
That means someone's
gonna come looking for him.

195
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:35,150
- Hey, sweetheart, come here. Come on.
- l'm fine. l'm fine.

196
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,357
- (knocking)
- (Rick) Kim, it's me!

197
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,150
- lt's OK. He gave us the gun.
- Get away from the door.

198
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,398
- Dad!
- Go back to your mother.

199
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,568
(Rick) Kim? Kim?

200
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,118
Dad, stop it. No!

201
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,661
Jack. Jack! You're killing him.

202
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,705
(Kim) He wants to get outta here
just as much as we do.

203
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,168
lt's true. Jack! Please!

204
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,550
Why are you helping them?

205
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:07,303
Cos l got Kim into this. But l didn't know
how heavy it was gonna get.

206
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,468
Get away from him.

207
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,802
Get up.

208
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,438
- ls anyone else coming?
- Not that l know of.

209
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,445
Good. Go sit with your partner.

210
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,859
l'm glad you're OK.

211
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,044
We both know why Nina's covering for Jack.

212
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:45,127
But l think the only reason
you're covering for him is to cover for Nina.

213
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:49,135
From where l'm sitting, Tony,
it looks like she's using you.

214
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:53,934
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- l want to help you see the situation clearly.

215
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:58,185
Somehow, Jack Bauer is connected
to the threat against Palmer.

216
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,188
By not telling me where he is,
you're endangering the life of a senator

217
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,527
who stands a damn good chance
of becoming the next president.

218
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,634
What's Jack doing, Tony?
Why did he show up at the Palmer breakfast

219
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:38,639
- and grab the gun of a Secret Service agent?
- He claims he was creating a diversion.

220
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,268
Yeah, l know what Jack said.
l wanna know what you think.

221
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,229
- Look... if l knew where Jack was...
- You do know.

222
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,364
- You're wrong.
- No, l'm not.

223
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:58,324
Help me here, Tony, or getting fired's
gonna be the least of your problems.

224
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,334
l will make sure you're prosecuted.
You will go to prison.

225
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,590
l'll give you ten minutes.

226
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,674
Take the time to decide if it's really
worth ruining your life over this.

227
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,032
The car is on the north end of the compound.

228
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:36,905
l just need to go get it and l'm gonna
pick you both up right there. OK?

229
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,708
- You're not leaving us.
- Sweetheart, l'm not. l'll be right back.

230
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:45,295
Every bad thing that has happened
has been because we weren't together.

231
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,541
We're not separating again, Jack.

232
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:53,178
Maybe you don't have to.
There's another way out. A better way, l think.

233
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,136
- How?
- Gaines still thinks l'm on his side.

234
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,481
So l can get one of the vans
without them noticing.

235
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:08,645
Even if they stop me, your car'll still
be there. And you can all be together.

236
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,738
He's right, Jack.

237
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:20,372
- You trust him?
- l do.

238
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,078
Rick, it's Gaines.

239
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:27,043
Rick, what's going on down there?

240
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,010
- Answer it.
- Mr Gaines.

241
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:35,923
- Where's Eli?
- He's outside digging a hole to bury the girls.

242
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:39,765
Get him, dammit.
l need him back here right now.

243
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:45,600
When Eli doesn't come back, Gaines is
comin' down here. Let me get the van.

244
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,316
You've got five minutes.

245
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:12,696
Stack those on the side, you know.
They don't have to be upright.

246
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,066
- Can l bring it out on the other side?
- lf it'll fit.

247
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:27,450
We ain't got no time for lunch.
We gotta take care of this right now.

248
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:33,375
(Gaines) Then handle it.
There's been a change of plan.

249
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,089
No, l need to know now. Not later - now.

250
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,296
What's so hard to understand about that?

251
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:44,928
Come on, guys. Let's go.

252
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:51,776
- Will you guys hurry with the truck there?
- l'll take it, Mr Gaines.

253
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,115
Hey, Joe, where's Eli?

254
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:11,002
(Gaines) Get him, OK?

255
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,564
- What are you doing?
- Taking the van.

256
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,320
l can see that, Rick.
Where are you taking the van?

257
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,942
To help Eli get the bodies
from the guesthouse.

258
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,522
You can't move
a couple of women by yourselves?

259
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:45,074
He told me to get the van, so l'm getting
the van. But if it's a problem, l don't have to.

260
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,240
(guard) Mr Gaines.

261
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,502
- What?
- l was out on patrol and l found Kevin.

262
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,955
What? ls he alive?

263
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,917
Yeah, but he's out cold.
Someone messed him up pretty good.

264
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:02,712
- Where are you?
- l'm in the north grove, near the generator.

265
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,266
l'll be right there.

266
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,426
You're driving. Let's go.

267
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,975
Open the damn door.

268
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,541
At the very least
be careful what you say to Ferragamo.

269
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:44,967
- l'll be careful.
- l mean, it's not like he's so squeaky clean.

270
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,890
By talking about Keith to the press
he violated every professional ethic.

271
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,648
l know what he did, Mike.

272
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,773
(siren)

273
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:04,861
Pull over here.

274
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,494
Here's the office.

275
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:18,540
No, no, no. Let me find out
what happened. l'll be right back.

276
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,812
What happened? What caused this?

277
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,973
A possible gas explosion.

278
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:52,330
- lt's Ferragamo, isn't it?
- There was a fire.

279
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,252
They say it might have been
a broken gas line.

280
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:58,586
- He didn't get out in time.
- Dammit!

281
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:02,884
They torched his office.
And you can bet his records were destroyed.

282
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,092
We don't know anything yet.

283
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:10,518
- lt could have been an accident, David.
- But it wasn't. lt was murder.

284
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:14,516
- David, stop. No, wait, wait. Listen.
- Get out of my way.

285
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,395
Hear me out here. Just hear me out here.
Look, David, think this through.

286
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:26,780
Even if you're right, this is
the absolute wrong way to play it.

287
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,830
Dammit!

288
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,720
Go.

289
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:05,895
Time's up, Tony.

290
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,481
Have you thought about what l said?

291
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:12,158
- l have.
- And?

292
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:24,623
- Excuse me. You have a call.
- l said no interruptions.

293
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,793
lt's Bauer.

294
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,677
Where the hell are you?

295
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:36,302
You might have my office,
but if you wanna do my job, listen to me.

296
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:40,014
- l don't take orders from you.
- l found the people behind the Palmer hit.

297
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:42,895
You're one of 'em
unless you can prove otherwise.

298
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,651
They had kidnapped my family - my wife
and daughter. But l'm with them now.

299
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,693
lt's why l worked underground
and couldn't contact CTU.

300
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:54,161
- You haven't spoken to anyone here?
- l couldn't risk it. Believe me, l wish l could.

301
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:57,248
lt's not my job to believe you, Jack.
lt's my job to find you.

302
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:01,545
l'm at an orange grove three miles
north of the split on the 5. Hold on.

303
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,422
34 degrees, 17 minutes north,
118 degrees 28 minutes west. You got that?

304
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,297
- Yeah.
- l've identified 11 hostiles.

305
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:14,089
They're going west on the compound
service road. Bring in air support.

306
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,010
l'll get back in touch.

307
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:27,279
Get Central Dispatch. And find out where
Jack's family has been for the last six hours.

308
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:30,607
Dammit.

309
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,472
- Are you ready to go home?
- Definitely.

310
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:00,803
- We get to finish our chess game.
- l'm two moves from checkmating you.

311
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,898
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We'll see.

312
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,909
Hey. We're gonna be all right.

313
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,404
l promise.

314
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:25,749
- Let me know as soon as you see him.
- Yeah. OK.

315
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:35,180
Teri, it's gonna be OK.

316
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,923
Between us. You and me.

317
00:33:43,147 --> 00:33:48,105
l love you. And l promise you everything's
gonna be different from now on.

318
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:14,673
No, l want two choppers. lf Villa has
a problem with that, he can call me.

319
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:22,845
Jack called with his location.
l sent three field units to back him up.

320
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:26,187
- ls he all right?
- We'll find out soon enough.

321
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:32,025
- So which one of us are you gonna suspend?
- Neither of you.

322
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:37,534
Only because l don't have enough actionable
evidence that you withheld information.

323
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,987
But l plan to keep looking.

324
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:53,460

You took a lot of chances for me.
