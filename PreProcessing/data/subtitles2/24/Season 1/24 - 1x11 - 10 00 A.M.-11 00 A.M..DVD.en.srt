1
00:00:02,157 --> 00:00:05,456
- Previously on Point Pleasant.
- You have to believe me.

2
00:00:05,561 --> 00:00:08,655
- The things I see are real.
- I can't.

3
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:12,598
This is what you've been feeling your whole life.
You lived by the grace of God.

4
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:14,828
Jesse Parker. The lifeguard.

5
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:17,235
We have to eliminate Jesse Parker
before he ruins everything.

6
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not sure
he really can be killed.

7
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,007
- But we have to try.
- Go wash the car.

8
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:23,873
Christina's worried about your safety.
She's absolutely right to be.

9
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:26,504
This was the right move, baby.

10
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:28,947
You only have one master,
and Boyd's not it.

11
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:31,246
I hope for your sake you can die,
because if you can't...

12
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:33,787
this is gonna be a hell of a way
to spend eternity.

13
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:36,881
- Where's Jesse?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

14
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:38,892
Did you see how evil she got
because of me?

15
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:42,361
Once you calm down, you will see
everything I did was to help you.

16
00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:44,398
Lucas, don't leave me in here.!

17
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:48,629
Jesse, you asked Father Matthew
if you're chosen. You are.

18
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,644
Where have you been?

19
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:07,722
Meg. I didn't see you there.

20
00:01:07,823 --> 00:01:09,916
Did you find Jesse?

21
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:13,483
What? Did Judy tell you?

22
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:17,087
No, Judy doesn't tell me anything.
She doesn't want to upset me.

23
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:22,937
I figured it out for myself.

24
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:27,740
No, I didn't find Jesse.

25
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:30,937
I hope you weren't
up all night worrying.

26
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,777
I'm up all night anyway.
I don't really sleep anymore.

27
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,781
Why not?

28
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,590
I've let Judy pretend
that I don't know anything...

29
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:47,594
but I think that has to change.

30
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:50,164
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:56,597
I still hear the voices, and sometimes they're
hard to understand, but they're there.

32
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:58,764
The meds aren't keeping them out.

33
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:01,035
- Meg, I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be.

34
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:04,203
At least I know now
that I wasn't delusional.

35
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:07,111
Though sometimes I wish I were.

36
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,651
I know who you are...

37
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:15,052
and I see the horrible things
you're going to do to this place.

38
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:17,318
- Meg.
- But that's only one future, Christina.

39
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:20,725
I think there are choices
for all of us.

40
00:02:22,798 --> 00:02:25,266
What about Jesse?

41
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:31,295
He's in danger- terrible danger.

42
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:35,172
- From Boyd.
- Boyd...

43
00:02:35,277 --> 00:02:37,245
other strangers...

44
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,477
and you.

45
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,919
Is there still time to stop it?

46
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,591
I don't know.

47
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:59,661
- Holly, eat.
- Why? I can't die.

48
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:01,736
No, but you can starve.

49
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:06,138
You can't stand to see me suffer,
can you, sweetheart?

50
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:08,209
You already know
the answer to that.

51
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,438
- You let me the hell out of here.
- I can't do that.

52
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,741
I'll behave.

53
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:15,749
I'll do anything.

54
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:23,922
- Let me help you with her.
- We're beyond that now, Holly.

55
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:27,359
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't get Wes killed.

56
00:03:27,462 --> 00:03:29,430
I did. It was my fault.

57
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:32,796
I killed Father Tomas
to teach Christina a lesson.

58
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:36,428
I started a chain,
and it's too late to stop it now.

59
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:38,597
What's going on, Lucas?

60
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:43,738
They're here.
Christina's not ready yet.

61
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:09,364
Hey, Nancy, it looks like we're gonna
need a tow at Grand and 14th.

62
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,939
- What's the problem with your car?
- It's not my car.

63
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,339
- Well, where's the driver?
- I don't know. I found it like this 20 minutes ago.

64
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:46,599
Judy.! Sit down and have
some breakfast.

65
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,176
Oh, thanks.
Um, I'm going out.

66
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,177
Have you seen Christina?

67
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,980
I know she told you the truth
about what she is...

68
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:02,984
and I understand
why you kept it from me.

69
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,321
You were afraid
that I couldn't handle it.

70
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:12,357
But the only person in this house
who can't handle the truth is your father.

71
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:14,765
I've been telling him
about the voices for years...

72
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,236
and even with everything
that's happened...

73
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:21,173
he still won't see.

74
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:24,905
So, those meds he's had you on-

75
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,981
They never work for long.

76
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:31,586
No, what's happening
must be too powerful.

77
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:36,989
There are people here
who can help Christina fight...

78
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:39,390
and I'm going to find them,
no matter what it takes.

79
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,929
Mom, what's happening to us?

80
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,501
I don't know, sweetie.

81
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,900
But I do know that if we stick together...

82
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:51,836
we'll find a way.

83
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,249
Damn it.

84
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,284
Nick.

85
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,183
What the hell's going on?

86
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,056
You're with us now.
You're safe.

87
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,789
- Who are you?
- Graham.

88
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,092
We'll be working
very closely together.

89
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:25,936
Someone attacked me.

90
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:30,375
He was trying to bury me.
You killed him.

91
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,538
That was one of Boyd's men-
Wesley Feist.

92
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:37,641
- Why does Boyd want me dead?
- Because you're the only one who can kill her.

93
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,988
You went to Father Matthew
with some questions.

94
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,058
You knew you were special.

95
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:49,291
Everything we could tell you,
you already know.

96
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,000
Christina.

97
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,895
No. I don't know anything.

98
00:06:58,006 --> 00:07:00,497
- Fermo!
- Get out of my way.

99
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,678
I'll put you through that wall.
I'm serious.

100
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:07,475
Try.

101
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,913
You were built for a fight,
but not with me.

102
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:16,115
It's with Christina-

103
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:20,686
the Antichrist.

104
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,699
A week ago, I could've stood by and watched you
behave like an idiot. Those days are over.

105
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,900
You're going around town
looking for Jesse...

106
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,341
not only exposing yourself,
but leaving a trail.

107
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:13,676
- Leave me alone.
- Don't try and pretend like you don't know.

108
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:17,775
You've seen it in your dreams.
Jesse was sent to this Earth to destroy you.

109
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:19,854
He would never do it. He couldn't!

110
00:08:19,954 --> 00:08:22,479
Why? Because a teenage crush
is more powerful than destiny?

111
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,991
How do you know we can't change
the way things are supposed to go?

112
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:29,495
Jesse and I are different
when we're together- stronger.

113
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:33,062
If he's on your side,
why is he already with them?

114
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,937
- Who?
- A team of believers, high level-

115
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,440
the ones that killed Wes...

116
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:45,570
the ones that came here
to teach Jesse how to kill you.

117
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,874
Whoever they are,
he won't listen to them.

118
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:52,783
It's too late.
They've already started to turn him.

119
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,855
Trust me.

120
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:57,254
I have seen their work.

121
00:08:57,359 --> 00:09:00,590
I know what you think about me,
and I know what you think about your father...

122
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,186
but if you want to live...

123
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:05,766
we're the only ones
you can trust now.

124
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:09,803
Stay with me.
Let me protect you.

125
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:12,702
You can't take them on by yourself.

126
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:15,173
You can barely take me.

127
00:09:30,425 --> 00:09:32,393
They're ready to move us.

128
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:36,328
- I'm a prisoner.
- You're the world's only hope.

129
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:39,264
We can't let anybody hurt you.

130
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,801
Look, everything I've told you...

131
00:09:41,903 --> 00:09:44,269
everything you've seen-

132
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:46,272
I know it must be hard to believe.

133
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:50,572
The intricate plan to kill my girlfriend,
the daughter of the devil? Yeah.

134
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:52,578
Just think, Jesse.

135
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,739
Remember...

136
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:57,249
the seven hours you were dead...

137
00:09:57,352 --> 00:10:00,810
Christina- how to kill her...

138
00:10:00,922 --> 00:10:03,686
and what would happen if you didn't-

139
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:06,317
God showed it all to you.

140
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:09,591
- I didn't see any of that.
- You chose not to see it!

141
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:13,633
- That's different.
- We're here to help you.

142
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:16,431
We're almost done
with the preparations.

143
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:18,665
We'll be ready
for the body soon.

144
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:20,741
The body?

145
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,510
If you don't do this,
Point Pleasant will burn-

146
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:29,447
your family, everyone.

147
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:33,009
And that's merciful compared to
what'll happen in the rest of the world.

148
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:36,782
- Andiamo.
- Come on.

149
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:44,131
So where are you taking me?

150
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:46,359
I can't tell you that. Sorry.

151
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:48,402
So am I.

152
00:11:31,546 --> 00:11:33,411
Come on, Jesse.

153
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,736
Oh!

154
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,423
- I missed you last night.
- Yeah?

155
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:23,429
- How much?
- A lot.

156
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:25,658
Terry!

157
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:35,799
- I thought you were at work.
- Hey, Mrs. Hargrove.

158
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,777
- What is he doing here?
- Terry has a name, Mom.

159
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,713
You better learn it.
He's gonna be around.

160
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:45,411
- Do you know who he works for?
- Mr. Boyd.

161
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,852
So what?
You worked for him too.

162
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:51,414
Yeah, that's right.
I know what I'm talking about.

163
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:54,757
Look, it's nothing personal.
I'm sure you're a good kid...

164
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:58,798
but I won't allow Paula to see you,
as long as you work for that man.

165
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,835
Come on.

166
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:06,032
Paula-This is for you, Paula.

167
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,540
Look.

168
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:10,611
I'm just trying to protect you.

169
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:27,220
Okay. Wait a second.
Slow down here.

170
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:31,958
Boyd says that they're here to kill you?
Why would they want to do that?

171
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,557
Oh. That.

172
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:38,366
Maybe Boyd's lying.
Why should you believe anything he says?

173
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:40,839
This time I know it's true.

174
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:43,137
Somehow I've always known.

175
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:47,677
Why are you-
Why are you packing?

176
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:53,876
You know you can't leave Point Pleasant.
You've tried.

177
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:56,388
I don't know what they're
gonna be aiming at me...

178
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:58,425
but I don't want your family
to get caught in the middle.

179
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:02,758
You do kind of know
what they're aiming at you, right?

180
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:05,162
It's Jesse.

181
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:08,527
Mom told me.

182
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,604
She's seeing more and more.

183
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:14,072
It's- It's like Boyd said.
She's tapped in.

184
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,177
Did she know
they already have Jesse?

185
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,269
No.

186
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,747
By now, they've- they've probably
told him everything-

187
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,875
who my father is, what I am.

188
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:27,580
Chris, what are you gonna do?

189
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,481
I'm gonna try and find Jesse,
and I'm gonna talk to him.

190
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:33,560
Maybe I can stop this
from happening.

191
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:35,561
You're just gonna go at this alone?

192
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:37,756
I mean, there has to be
something I can do to help.

193
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:38,900
There is.
Take care of your mom.

194
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,333
There is.
Take care of your mom.

195
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,417
Mrs. Kramer.

196
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,080
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see your dad.

197
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:05,124
- You know he's-
- He's sick.

198
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:08,195
I understand. I just thought
he might like a visitor.

199
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,895
Okay. Yeah.

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,434
I, uh- I gotta go to work, but...

201
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:19,636
go ahead in.

202
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:21,971
Thanks.

203
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,448
Meg.

204
00:15:37,558 --> 00:15:41,324
I hope you don't mind
my just showing up like this.

205
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:48,896
- David, are you-
- I had a dream about you this morning...

206
00:15:49,003 --> 00:15:51,631
which is pretty weird because...

207
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,207
I haven't thought about you
since high school.

208
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:57,368
We never had much in common,
did we?

209
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,310
We do now.

210
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,680
How so?

211
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,813
The thing about invalids is...

212
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,026
no one really notices us, do they?

213
00:16:16,998 --> 00:16:19,626
That's why we make
the perfect soldiers.

214
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,362
What are you doing?

215
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:26,405
You were meant for
more than this, David.

216
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:30,500
But you can't do a damn thing from bed,
hooked up to these meds.

217
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:35,147
I'll die without that.

218
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:37,615
Maybe.

219
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,411
Maybe not.

220
00:16:54,569 --> 00:16:56,537
Thanks.

221
00:16:57,705 --> 00:16:59,673
Jesse!
Where you been, dude?

222
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:06,942
I don't have any time. Does your dad still have
that hunting cabin by Allaire Park?

223
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:11,212
Yeah, but no one's been out there in years.
Place is probably rotted.

224
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,378
I need to borrow it for a few days.
And I need a car.

225
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,887
- What's the matter?
- I can't talk about it.

226
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,720
I just need to know,
can you help me?

227
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:21,522
- Terry!
- Yeah. No problem. Take my dad's car.

228
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:23,597
The keys are in the visor.

229
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,433
And listen, I know this is gonna sound weird,
but don't say anything to anyone-

230
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:32,973
not Paula, not any of the guys
and not Mr. Boyd.

231
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:36,066
- Yeah, of course.
- Terry, stay away from Boyd, okay?

232
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:37,610
He's dangerous.

233
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:40,203
He's my boss.
That's not gonna be so easy.

234
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:43,477
Just trust me.

235
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,643
Be careful.

236
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:47,778
And thanks for this, man.

237
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:49,880
I owe you big-time.

238
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,794
- Hey, Atkins.
- Hey.

239
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,796
- So what do we know?
- Well, not much.

240
00:17:56,898 --> 00:17:58,798
This is Etta Challis.

241
00:18:00,534 --> 00:18:03,401
Etta, tell the chief
what you told me.

242
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,404
I was trying to buy
this stuffed thingy...

243
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:07,997
for my sister's baby shower,
but no one was at the register.

244
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:10,475
Did you see who was working the counter
before they left?

245
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:12,546
Was it an older guy-
thinning hair?

246
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:16,276
Yeah. He was there when I first came in.
Then he was gone.

247
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:20,020
Irwin flips the sign
when he takes a break...

248
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:22,919
- which is practically never.
- Can I just leave my money on the counter?

249
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:26,152
You're a cop. Is that illegal?
I mean, I'm really late for work.

250
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,285
All right. Go ahead.

251
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:35,595
- Did you check the back?
- Yeah. Restrooms too.

252
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:47,343
- Looks like the guy just kind of-
- Disappeared.

253
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:26,085
What the hell, Chris?

254
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:28,747
Drive! We need to get somewhere safe
we can talk.

255
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,527
- You believe them, don't you?
- No.

256
00:19:33,627 --> 00:19:35,993
Get out of the car.

257
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:38,565
- Jesse?
- I said, get out.

258
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,874
Christina, stop!

259
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:57,678
I said, drive.

260
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:07,453
If you're trying to convince me
that you're not evil, this isn't helping.

261
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:10,928
- I need you to listen.
- How can I believe you?
You're the devil's kid, right?

262
00:20:11,032 --> 00:20:12,897
Is that what they told you?

263
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,492
- They said a lot of things.
- Whatever they said, nothing is written in stone.

264
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,572
I'm made of more than my father.

265
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:22,938
How could you have not told me, after all those
questions? And could you slow down a little?

266
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:26,878
What should I have said? "You have amazing eyes,
and by the way, my dad is Satan"?

267
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:29,779
If you knew the whole story,
I was afraid you'd be in danger.

268
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:33,445
- You got that right.
- Whatever happened to all your talk
of your calling, Jess-

269
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:34,953
that we're made for something...

270
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:38,048
- together?
- We are- death.

271
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:44,558
I'm supposed to kill you,
Christina.

272
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:47,793
And if I don't think of some way out of this,
that means the perfect puzzle-

273
00:20:47,902 --> 00:20:49,870
you and me-
adds up to one of two things-

274
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,803
the end of everything
or your blood on my hands.

275
00:21:07,388 --> 00:21:09,515
That's why I was running.

276
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:14,554
We have to believe
we can change it.

277
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,630
My mother was human-
a good human.

278
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,494
Do you really know that?
You've never even met her.

279
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,469
Father Tomas-

280
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:25,539
He was sure of it.

281
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,607
He felt there was good in me.

282
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:33,344
Jesse, you said it.

283
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:36,143
We're stronger together.

284
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,845
You're the one person in the world
who makes me feel I can beat this.

285
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,780
Maybe you are supposed to save us...

286
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:49,822
just not in the way
that everyone thinks.

287
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:58,505
Judy, can I talk to you a second?

288
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:00,574
Sure.

289
00:22:05,813 --> 00:22:10,477
Sweetie, Mom's getting worse.
She needs some help.

290
00:22:10,584 --> 00:22:14,350
Actually, I think
she's doing a lot better.

291
00:22:14,455 --> 00:22:17,151
I know how tough this must be on you.
She's your mom...

292
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:20,694
and it must be really hard to let yourself
believe that something's really wrong.

293
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:24,594
Maybe you should listen to her for a change,
instead of just shutting her down.

294
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,666
Judy, what she's saying-

295
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:29,861
Mom is not crazy, okay?

296
00:22:44,518 --> 00:22:47,510
Is Christina here, or Jesse?

297
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:49,589
Wow. Give me a second.

298
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,558
I've never heard anything so heartfelt.
Apology for deserting me accepted.

299
00:22:53,661 --> 00:22:56,562
- Are they here?
- No.

300
00:22:56,664 --> 00:23:01,727
- Look, I have a job to do.
- Am I part of your job?

301
00:23:01,835 --> 00:23:05,794
The truth is, I was wondering
how I could convince you to leave town.

302
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:10,742
Excuse me? With you?

303
00:23:10,844 --> 00:23:13,813
No. With your family.

304
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,051
- Who are you?
- No one.

305
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:21,644
Just a job,
waiting to be finished.

306
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:28,427
I liked meeting you.

307
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,656
I'm grateful for it.

308
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:39,898
I know it hurts, David.

309
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:43,636
- I'm sorry.
- I can't do this.

310
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:46,975
- It's not too late to go back. Just say the word.
- Meg.

311
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:50,713
Lock the door behind you.

312
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:56,653
If Terry comes home
and-and sees this...

313
00:23:56,757 --> 00:23:59,123
he'll try and stop it.

314
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:02,928
Are you sure?

315
00:24:05,432 --> 00:24:07,923
Go!

316
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:27,110
Okay. We'll be in touch.

317
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:29,121
Who's that?

318
00:24:29,223 --> 00:24:32,192
Mrs. Brewster, the wife of your ghost
from the gift shop.

319
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:34,853
- She file a missing person's?
- Yeah.

320
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:39,866
What?

321
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:42,935
I don't know.

322
00:24:43,037 --> 00:24:45,267
This morning,
that abandoned vehicle?

323
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:48,273
It belonged to a 78-year-old male
who uses a walker to get around.

324
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:51,139
That's not exactly the type to run off.

325
00:24:51,245 --> 00:24:54,009
- You check the hospitals?
- Yeah. No record.

326
00:24:54,114 --> 00:24:57,242
I'm just saying, it's strange.
I mean, two M.P.'s in one day?

327
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:59,080
- Maybe it's a coincidence.
- Chief?

328
00:24:59,186 --> 00:25:01,984
- Yeah.
- I got a worried call from Principal Middleton.

329
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:04,387
Said his daughter never
made it home last night.

330
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:20,700
Mr. Boyd.

331
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:25,541
Hey, I- I was just getting
ready to head into-

332
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:29,207
Most employers would fire someone
for showing up with alcohol on their breath.

333
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:31,443
Yeah, I know.
I shouldn't have.

334
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:33,952
But not me.

335
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,921
I'm the kind of employer that cares
about the well-being of my people.

336
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,891
I see my guy drinking in the middle
of the day, I want to know...

337
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:41,722
is everything okay?

338
00:25:41,829 --> 00:25:44,127
Everything's good.

339
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:48,258
How about your friend Jesse?
Is everything okay with him?

340
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:53,099
He's... fine.

341
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:55,801
Where is he, Terry?

342
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:58,707
Well, why do you want to know?

343
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:02,215
Do you work for me or not,
Mr. Burke?

344
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:05,819
Jesse's my best friend.

345
00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:10,083
I'm not gonna let something bad
happen to him.

346
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,158
Terry...

347
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:14,284
things have been going
pretty well for you...

348
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,420
since you started working for me,
haven't they?

349
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,626
For example, you-you finally got
the girl of your dreams-

350
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:23,032
the lovely Paula Hargrove.

351
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:27,400
Now, I can have
a profound effect on people.

352
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:29,601
I'm sure you've noticed that.

353
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,113
It doesn't matter what
Paula thinks she feels now.

354
00:26:36,216 --> 00:26:39,617
I could take her away from you...

355
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,484
in the blink of an eye.

356
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:45,615
Or you could just...

357
00:26:45,726 --> 00:26:47,956
tell me where Jesse is.

358
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:52,930
It's so very simple.

359
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,135
I'll unlock the chain,
and you pull it through, okay?

360
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:05,143
We can't just stay here.
We need a plan.

361
00:27:05,245 --> 00:27:08,339
Let's just get to the cabin first.
Then we'll figure out our next move.

362
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:37,736
Christina! Oh, God!

363
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:40,405
- Jesse!
- Let us have him.

364
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:43,749
Nobody gets hurt.

365
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:56,258
Nobody else, you mean.

366
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,271
I'm warning you.
If you touch her, you'll be sorry.

367
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:15,177
We didn't want to involve her.
This is between us.

368
00:28:15,282 --> 00:28:17,773
Take him.

369
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:21,787
We won't hurt her,
but you need to come with us.

370
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:25,950
I don't think so.

371
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,976
That's enough, kids.
I've got men all around here.

372
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:49,406
- Boyd.
- Poor, dead Wes.

373
00:28:49,516 --> 00:28:51,950
He was a sadist and
a mediocre assistant at best...

374
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:54,577
but he was right about one thing.

375
00:28:54,688 --> 00:28:57,623
Jesse here was gonna kill
our little girl...

376
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:02,252
unless we... kill him first.

377
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:04,796
No! Jesse!

378
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:07,264
Christina, please. Leave him behind.
Come with me.

379
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,961
- Are you insane?
- It's simple now.

380
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:13,300
They want you dead.
I want you alive.

381
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:20,479
Damn it, Chris.

382
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:24,073
Don't you get it?
He's gonna kill you.

383
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:26,277
Leave us alone!

384
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:28,684
All of you!

385
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,462
Christina, come on.

386
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:39,088
Let's go.

387
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,556
Welcome to the Point.

388
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:07,822
You won't live through this either...

389
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,526
- demon.
- We'll see.

390
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,746
Terry, what's going on with you?

391
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:35,822
You're acting weird.

392
00:30:35,922 --> 00:30:39,380
I just... wanted you to meet my dad.

393
00:30:39,493 --> 00:30:43,691
I mean, this is serious
between you and me, right?

394
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:46,698
Of course.
And I totally want to meet him...

395
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,566
but all of a sudden,
you're in this rush or something.

396
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:55,471
I'm sorry.

397
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:58,544
I'm not in a rush.
We have all the time we want.

398
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,211
I just... wanted you
to see where I lived...

399
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:05,216
see my dad...

400
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:08,412
- get the whole picture, you know?
- Okay.

401
00:31:09,923 --> 00:31:14,053
I'm here.
I am not going anywhere.

402
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,767
- Remember, my dad's not-
- I know.

403
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:24,363
I can handle it.

404
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:37,517
Dad?

405
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:40,814
- Do you have a key?
- Door's never locked.

406
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,889
Dad, you okay?

407
00:31:44,257 --> 00:31:46,157
Terry, be careful!

408
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:51,053
Where would he go?

409
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:53,257
I don't know.

410
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:55,664
He hasn't been able to walk in years.

411
00:32:47,854 --> 00:32:49,879
I have to pull it out.

412
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,618
Don't. It's too dangerous.
We need to take you to the hospital.

413
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:54,694
No.

414
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,648
Oh, my God.

415
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,718
It's only like that
when you're with me.

416
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:21,549
But we should still go
to the hospital...

417
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:24,021
- and make sure you're okay.
- No. They'll find you.

418
00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:26,922
So they find me.
Maybe they should.

419
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:29,860
Don't say that.

420
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:34,565
A few hours ago,
you weren't sure if I should die.

421
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:38,627
It- It's okay. I-
I don't blame you.

422
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:43,609
Chris...

423
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,235
those guys back there-
You could've killed them.

424
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:50,680
- I did break 'em a little.
- Because you had to, to save me.

425
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:53,116
You could've done a lot worse.

426
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:56,551
I believe you
that you can win this...

427
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,647
no matter what anybody says.

428
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:02,662
I hope you're right.

429
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:11,601
Meg said there were other people who are
on our side- people who would help us.

430
00:34:11,705 --> 00:34:14,503
I just- I don't know who they are
or where to find them.

431
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:18,908
We wait till morning. Then we get into town,
find Meg and see if she can help us.

432
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:22,106
We just have to make it
through the night.

433
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:37,658
Why did you bring me up here
if you're just going to ignore me?

434
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:41,059
Lucas.

435
00:34:42,736 --> 00:34:46,035
- What are you so upset about?
- I told you.

436
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,575
I let Jesse slip away. Christina's in danger.
That never would've happened before.

437
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:53,637
Hmm, before I got here?

438
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:58,275
Well, isn't that sweet? You've gone all soft
and ineffectual because of little old me.

439
00:34:58,385 --> 00:35:00,649
It's not a joke.

440
00:35:00,754 --> 00:35:02,915
This battle-what's coming-
if it all goes wrong-

441
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:07,519
You have no idea.

442
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:11,154
If Jesse got away,
that means he's with Christina, right?

443
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:15,800
- Of course.
- Well, that's good for you.

444
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:20,031
They are intensely in love...

445
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,108
and they're desperate.

446
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,438
All they really have in the world
is each other.

447
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,845
I remember being in love like that.

448
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:34,550
And look how that ended.

449
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,528
It's bound to go wrong, Lucas...

450
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:44,859
and that's when Christina
will need you.

451
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:48,695
You'll get your girl back.

452
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:09,055
We should keep it dark in here
so people can't see in.

453
00:36:10,423 --> 00:36:14,325
- How's your chest feel?
- Chris, it's fine. I promise.

454
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:20,726
Hey, you need some sleep.

455
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:26,531
- You don't seem scared.
- I told you.

456
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,664
We can win this.

457
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:31,471
What if we don't?

458
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:33,546
Even if we don't...

459
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:35,773
I'm with you.

460
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:08,214
You said you wanted to wait.

461
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:15,079
For what?

462
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:17,156
I'm with you now.

463
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,935
Christina.

464
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:12,768
Jesse!

465
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,750
You are the devil.

466
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:27,222
Jesse.!
Jesse, talk to me, please.

467
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:29,818
Jesse, what happened?

468
00:38:29,929 --> 00:38:32,261
What did you see?

469
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:34,731
- I know what you're gonna do.
- Jesse!

470
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,927
Wait! Jesse!

471
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:40,731
Please don't leave me.

472
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,740
Please.

473
00:38:59,926 --> 00:39:02,156
Christina.

474
00:39:02,262 --> 00:39:02,362
Your wife was the last person
who saw him, and now he's gone.

475
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:05,422
Your wife was the last person
who saw him, and now he's gone.

476
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:09,229
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know. Meg said
she didn't know anything about it.

477
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:12,702
I'm sorry if this sounds harsh,
but everyone knows Mrs. Kramer's not right.

478
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:15,330
We all heard about her meltdown
at the church.

479
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:18,171
I'm sure she didn't hurt your father.
Meg couldn't hurt anyone.

480
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:20,940
He couldn't get out of bed.
Explain to me how else it could've happened.

481
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:24,073
I can't, Terry.
Don't you think I wish I could?

482
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:27,677
Then we'll let the cops explain.

483
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,526
Okay. Well, thank you.

484
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:38,756
If you think of anyone else who might know
where she is, give us a call. Okay.

485
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:41,766
Statement from a friend
of our missing Mr. Brewster.

486
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:44,132
He doesn't know where the guy is now,
but lately he's been-

487
00:39:44,237 --> 00:39:46,205
Says he saw him going
to confession three times?

488
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:49,275
This week alone. Guy's obviously
feeling guilty about something.

489
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,970
- Maybe he had a good reason
just to up and take off.
- Wait a minute.

490
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:55,707
Middleton said that he and his daughter
were fighting?

491
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:57,783
Hang on.

492
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:04,255
All right, here. "Candace said the only person
she could really talk to lately was her priest."

493
00:40:04,357 --> 00:40:06,484
Her priest was at St. Martin's-
same as Brewster.

494
00:40:06,593 --> 00:40:08,390
And Wayne Leone's car this morning-

495
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:10,394
Was found two blocks from there.

496
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,992
Sarah, it's me. Listen, I want to talk to you
about some folks at St. Martin's.

497
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:20,971
Give me a call as soon
as you get this, okay?

498
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:40,852
Meg.

499
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:44,697
Ben, something's happening
to Christina.

500
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:50,469
- It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
- How do you know?

501
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,765
I haven't taken good enough
care of you, honey.

502
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:55,773
Things have gotten worse again.

503
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,639
But that's going to change now.

504
00:41:00,313 --> 00:41:02,804
Dr. Evett, what are you doing here?

505
00:41:02,915 --> 00:41:06,009
- What is he doing here?
- I'm just here to help, Meg.

506
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,984
Ben, what are you doing?

507
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:09,884
- We're gonna take you to the hospital-
- No!

508
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,889
where they can take better
care of you than I can.

509
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:15,791
- Please just come with us.
- No. No. No! Please, God, no!

510
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:18,728
No! No, it's too important right now.

511
00:41:18,831 --> 00:41:21,163
- Please! You can't take me. I'm her only hope.
- Stop!

512
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:24,236
- Meg, just calm down.
- No, please understand!

513
00:41:24,337 --> 00:41:26,703
- Dad, what's going on?
- Judy, help me!

514
00:41:26,806 --> 00:41:28,899
Meg, just calm down.

515
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:31,738
- Judy! Judy, just-
- Let go! Just let go of her!

516
00:41:31,844 --> 00:41:33,505
This is for her own good
and for yours.

517
00:41:33,613 --> 00:41:36,741
You don't know what's good for her.
You don't know what's good for anyone.

518
00:41:36,849 --> 00:41:39,443
Enough!
You're scaring your daughter.

519
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:42,647
No.

520
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:45,189
God knows what you did
to Terry's father.

521
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:49,819
David Burke was ready to make his change.
I just gave him permission.

522
00:41:49,929 --> 00:41:51,487
No, honey.

523
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:55,033
That's why he left home-
'cause he-he wanted to go through it alone.

524
00:41:55,134 --> 00:41:57,830
- Let's go.
- No! Judy, don't let them keep me there.

525
00:41:57,937 --> 00:41:59,928
- Please, Judy-
- No, I won't.

526
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,836
- Mom, I won't let them-
- Christina needs me!

527
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:05,433
- Judy! Judy!
- Stop. Stop!

528
00:42:05,545 --> 00:42:07,945
It's okay.

529
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,845
Sarah?

530
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,451
Honey, you home?

531
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:36,104
Sarah?

532
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:57,990
Promise me
you won't kill Jesse.

533
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:01,725
You know he's gonna
try and kill you.

534
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:04,794
Promise me.

535
00:43:10,543 --> 00:43:12,511
What do I do?

536
00:43:14,213 --> 00:43:16,374
You come inside.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
