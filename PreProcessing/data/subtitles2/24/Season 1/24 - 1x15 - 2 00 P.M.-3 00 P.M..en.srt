1
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:17,156
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate,

2
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,815
my wife and daughter are in danger,

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,742
and people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,948
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,

5
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:29,960
and this is the longest day ofmy life.

6
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,786
l can go over your head, Mr Almeida.

7
00:01:05,873 --> 00:01:08,578
And l assure you, there will be consequences.

8
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,419
l apologise, Senator, but we do have protocol.

9
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,540
Our director, Ryan Chapelle,
is working on a clearance.

10
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:20,136
- But if l could tell him why you're here...
- All he needs to know is l need to see Bauer.

11
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,213
And l need to do it now.

12
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,769
- Can l get you anything while...?
- No.

13
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:48,743
Chapelle.

14
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:53,293
l don't think l can stall him much longer.
He wants to know why he can't see Jack.

15
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,835
What did you tell him?

16
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:58,628
Well, l told him you were workin' on it.

17
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:03,305
- And he still didn't say why he was here?
- No. He just wants to see Jack.

18
00:02:03,764 --> 00:02:07,714
Well, until l know more,
l don't wanna put those two together.

19
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,728
- l'm checking it out now.
- All right.

20
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:19,480
- So? You find out what Palmer's doin' here?
- Not yet.

21
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:24,364
- Any new intel on the backup shooters?
- Yeah, uh, an Alexis Drazen.

22
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:28,616
Looks like he's connected to two other
shooters, but he stopped in DC for two days

23
00:02:28,706 --> 00:02:31,244
before landing in LAX on Saturday.

24
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:34,334
There's other inconsistencies.
l'm working on it.

25
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,587
- Where's the report?
- l routed it to Nina's computer.

26
00:02:37,673 --> 00:02:39,998
- Send me a copy, would ya?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:50,642
Weren't we supposed to answer
some questions at Jack's office?

28
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:54,346
- We're gonna do that at the safe house now.
- ls my dad gonna be there?

29
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,024
Not right away.
Maybe when he's done at CTU.

30
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:03,066
- Are we OK, Nina?
- Everything's fine.

31
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:06,616
A small, controlled environment
is the most secure place for you.

32
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:09,787
- Does Jack know you're taking us?
- Of course. Myers.

33
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:14,830
We're moving Teri and Kim to the
safe house now. We should be there soon.

34
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,461
Mom...

35
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:18,918
you never told me what the doctor said.

36
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:21,758
(Nina) No, l'm not worried about that.

37
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:24,215
lt was a cyst that burst.

38
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:26,592
She said it wasn't serious.

39
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:32,136
- Then why did she...?
- There's nothing to worry about.

40
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:34,933
She said it would go away all by itself.

41
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,894
Gaines first contacted me on my cellphone,

42
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,858
directing me to a car
parked at St Mark's Hospital.

43
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,741
- The transmitter was in the car?
- That's when he asked me to put it in my ear.

44
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:56,079
Can we take a break? Could you find out how
my wife and daughter are doing at the clinic?

45
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,461
- Teri and Kim have already left the clinic.
- What?

46
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:02,334
They're fine.
Nina's moving them to a safe house.

47
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:06,209
You knew they were moving my wife
and daughter and you didn't tell me?

48
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:09,127
That's it. This is over.

49
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:12,841
l don't say another word.
l wanna speak to Chapelle.

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,264
Now, Alberta!

51
00:04:26,824 --> 00:04:28,900
You're exhausting.

52
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:31,902
l was surprised you called last night.

53
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,497
l didn't think l'd see you again after DC.

54
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:40,498
l'm not really that easy, you know.

55
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:45,126
Will you have another break later in the day?

56
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:57,764
The senator has to leave town this afternoon,
and he's going to... Nevada.

57
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:04,562
Only a few of us were told about it, and l am
one of the ones who has to go with him.

58
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:08,524
- You have to hold his hand?
- ln so many words.

59
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,658
Would it be too much to hope that
you might have some free time in Nevada?

60
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:19,121
You would wanna come?

61
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,665
lf you want me.

62
00:05:40,398 --> 00:05:43,980
This is a pretty big shower.
There's room enough for two.

63
00:05:44,068 --> 00:05:46,144
l'm on my way.

64
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:50,407
- Alan.
- Senator Palmer, what can l do foryou?

65
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:53,278
l'm trying to talk to
a CTU agent named Jack Bauer.

66
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:56,121
- Where are you?
- CTU, Los Angeles.

67
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:59,289
They say l need clearance,
but it's taking forever.

68
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,325
- Not a problem. Who's in charge over there?
- Ryan Chapelle.

69
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:06,540
Yeah. OK, l'll take care ofthis right away.

70
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,921
Thank you, Alan. l owe you.

71
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,722
Senator Palmer, Ryan Chapelle.

72
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,592
What seems to be the problem, Ryan?
Why can't l get in to see Agent Bauer?

73
00:06:20,688 --> 00:06:24,520
Please forgive the wait. When an agent
is under internal investigation,

74
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:28,440
procedure is to keep him isolated
until he's been fully interrogated.

75
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:31,198
lt's... really out of my hands.

76
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:34,023
Even if l can help you
with your investigation?

77
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:38,780
Mr Chapelle? Alan Optican from
the Pentagon's on the line for you.

78
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:41,700
Excuse me.

79
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:45,378
- Chapelle.
- This is Optican, Department ofDefense.

80
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:46,957
Yes, sir.

81
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:51,377
Senator Palmer is to be given carte blanche.
Make sure he gets whatever he needs.

82
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:52,749
- Yes, sir.
- Understood?

83
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,466
- Of course, sir.
- Thankyou.

84
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:58,261
Bring Jack Bauer down here right away.

85
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:10,358
Thanks... for helping me...
cut through the red tape.

86
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:12,399
Mm-hm.

87
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,737
l want all your cameras
and recording equipment shut down.

88
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:20,616
This is going to be a private conversation.

89
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:24,040
l understand. l'll make sure
the room is secure.

90
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,953
Thank you.

91
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,419
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey.

92
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,552
Listen, Nina called and wanted me
to tell you that Teri and Kim are fine.

93
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,345
- Who's guardin' the house?
- Paulson and Breeher.

94
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,845
OK, good.

95
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:45,352
Also, Chapelle wants to see you
in the conference room.

96
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,099
Good.

97
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,358
- Thanks a lot, Tony.
- You got it.

98
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,414
Milo, l'm sorry l had to switch the cards
on you last night. l had no choice.

99
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:06,204
We understand what you were goin' through.

100
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:08,370
Thanks for your help.

101
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,345
Senator Palmer.

102
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,509
Leave us.

103
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,763
- l'll be outside.
- Thank you.

104
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:28,932
Close the door.

105
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:31,312
Sit.

106
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,853
Yes, sir.

107
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,358
l wanna know who's working with you.

108
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:44,577
- ln which context, sir? l'm sorry, l don't...
- Right here, right now. We're gonna end this.

109
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:47,702
- l don't know what they told you...
- l know why you want me dead.

110
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,209
- l don't know what you're talking about.
- Kosovo!

111
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,874
- Kosovo?
- l know you hold me responsible

112
00:08:55,968 --> 00:09:00,298
for the men you lost there
two years ago today.

113
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,384
- You know about Operation Nightfall?
- l authorised the mission.

114
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:10,555
l know you took out Victor Drazen and his
inner circle. And lost six men in the process.

115
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,307
- And you think l want revenge?
- Yes, l do.

116
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:17,270
With all due respect,
l almost died today trying to protect you.

117
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:20,899
And if l blame anyone for the death
of my men in Kosovo, l blame myself.

118
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:25,121
- What were you doin' at the power plant?
- l was trying to...

119
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,955
The reason l went for that agent's gun, sir,

120
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:35,458
was to try and get you out of the room
without giving myself away.

121
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,385
The people that want you dead
had kidnapped my family.

122
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,891
They threatened to kill them if l didn't
assist them in the assassination attempt.

123
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:51,515
They didn't tell you any of this
when you came in, did they, sir?

124
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:53,267
No.

125
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,488
lt's the truth. You can verify it with Chapelle.

126
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:32,804
- OK, they're just arriving at the safe house.
- (man) Copy that. Show visual.

127
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,150
This way, Mrs Bauer.

128
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,161
These are Agents Paulson and Breeher.
They've worked with Jack for many years.

129
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,792
- This is Jack's wife, Teri, and daughter, Kim.
- (Kim) Hi.

130
00:10:53,878 --> 00:10:56,879
Hi, Kim. Where do you want us?

131
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:59,040
One in and one out.

132
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,147
Well, it's not exactly home,
but it's relatively comfortable.

133
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,657
There are motion detectors every ten yards.

134
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:30,903
- How long do we have to stay here?
- We'll worry about that after we debrief you.

135
00:11:30,998 --> 00:11:35,577
- Nina, where's the bathroom?
- There's one in each bedroom, through there.

136
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,047
lf you'd both like to clean up
before we get started, please do.

137
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,678
l was the head of the Special Defense
Appropriations Committee in the Senate,

138
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:34,182
which is just a euphemism
for covert operations.

139
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,725
Three years ago,
the ClA brought to my attention

140
00:12:36,814 --> 00:12:40,183
atrocities committed by
Victor Drazen in Kosovo.

141
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:44,650
Massacres, torture, ethnic cleansing.

142
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:48,108
The man was a monster,
and was gaining support.

143
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:54,070
l tried to go through the usual channels, but
l couldn't get anyone to work quickly enough.

144
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:58,577
So l contacted the one person
l knew who could get the job done,

145
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:01,587
have him terminated, off the books.

146
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:05,041
- And that would be Robert Ellis.
- That's right.

147
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:10,213
Ellis was funded through
a discretionary fund of my committee.

148
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:15,597
His job was to implement the covert missions
and see to it that no names were leaked.

149
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:19,386
Now we're both on somebody's list.

150
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:25,358
So this is payback for
what happened that day.

151
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:27,818
lt's the only thing that makes sense.

152
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,490
But if someone could put your name
and my name on a list together,

153
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,527
that means they should be
able to find Robert Ellis, too.

154
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:36,785
You're right.

155
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,874
Four sixes.

156
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:51,212
Let's see 'em.

157
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,555
l knew it! l saw it in your eyes!

158
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:03,064
lf you could read what's in my eyes,
you'd crawl under a rock and cry.

159
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,148
Go again.

160
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,568
(phone rings)

161
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:20,034
- Ellis.
- Bobby, it's David Palmer.

162
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,170
- You gotta be kidding.
- l'm not. l'm here with Jack Bauer.

163
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,172
Get lost.

164
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:35,755
What are you doin' with Bauer? l went to a lot
of trouble to make sure you two never met.

165
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,717
Someone close to Victor Drazen
seems to have connected us.

166
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,813
- Explain.
- Someone wants me dead.

167
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:45,650
And it appears they want Bauer, too. Today.

168
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,731
The two-year anniversary of Nightfall.

169
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,988
l'm the only one who knows
you both were involved.

170
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:56,617
Apparently not. And if we're
on the list, it's likely you are, too.

171
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:59,160
- Let me talk to Bauer.
- l'm right here, Bob.

172
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:02,826
- Jack. You still at CTU?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:03,127 --> 00:15:05,583
To source this we need each other's help.

174
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,539
Unfortunately, over the last 12 hours,
l've had to cut a few corners.

175
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:12,588
l'm being investigated right now.
My hands are tied.

176
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,798
Well, get them untied.
David can help you there.

177
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,259
lt has to be someone either
connected to your team...

178
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,768
No. No one on my team knew
of the senator's involvement.

179
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,180
Well, then it has to be Drazen's group.

180
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:31,359
l'll retrieve the closed file on Nightfall. lt'll
contain the names of Drazen's associates.

181
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:35,397
That'll take a few minutes. Meantime,
you need to pick up a trail on the money.

182
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:39,443
Odds are it's funded through Belgium. Can
you get to your K-3 accounts from there?

183
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,658
- Yes, if l get reinstated.
- All right, start there.

184
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,376
We'll compare names when we talk again.
Where can l reach you?

185
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,954
CTU, Los Angeles office.

186
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,673
All right.

187
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,128
(knock at door)

188
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,097
(Nina) Teri?

189
00:16:41,726 --> 00:16:44,845
- Yes?
- l put some clean clothes on the bed.

190
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:48,098
Thank you.

191
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:03,443
They called me and said you decided
not to fly out. Aren't we going to Nevada?

192
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:08,201
Apparently not. The senator needed to do
something. He thought we'd be safest here.

193
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,046
- Are you taking a later flight?
- l don't know. l hope so.

194
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,214
Call the Times. Tell them
l'll do that phoner, 45 minutes.

195
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,960
Sure.

196
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,104
(dials out)

197
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,441
- Hello.
- You miss me yet?

198
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,447
- Of course.
- l hope you didn't bookyour flight to Nevada.

199
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:41,652
l was just about to. Why?

200
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,653
We might not be going.

201
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:47,911
- When will you know?
- ln about an hour.

202
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,789
lf you stay in town,
will you remain at the hotel?

203
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,296
l don't know. They might
switch us for security reasons.

204
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:59,005
Either way, l'll let you know where l am.

205
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,130
l can still smellyour perfume on my skin.

206
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:06,382
l'll call you as soon as l know.

207
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,976
- ls that the girl?
- Yes.

208
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,395
Palmer might not be leaving after all.

209
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,315
- Better for us.
- Mm-hm.

210
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:20,407
Was there any problem
getting rid of Gaines's people?

211
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:22,151
No.

212
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,743
You should never have used him.
l told you it was a mistake.

213
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:31,031
Fine. You fixed the mistake,
now let's move on.

214
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,287
(girl giggles)

215
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,710
She looks like Martina.

216
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,680
Our sister's dead, Andre.

217
00:18:48,436 --> 00:18:50,263
Leave it alone.

218
00:18:54,817 --> 00:19:00,108
- Have you spoken to Jovan and Mishko?
- They have their targets in sight.

219
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:05,109
And as for Palmer, l give you my word
he will be dead by midnight.

220
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:17,958
- Hey. Do you have any toothpaste?
- Yeah, it's right there.

221
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:32,387
That's nothing. The doctor just
wanted me to take it as a precaution.

222
00:19:38,986 --> 00:19:41,358
You scared me.

223
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,155
Kim.

224
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,900
What?

225
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,905
You're pregnant.

226
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,711
l don't understand. What happened today...
How is that possible?

227
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,583
lt was Dad, of course,
but a test like this, it takes time before...

228
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:06,216
You were trying to have a kid
and didn't tell me?

229
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,057
No, honey, it wasn't like that.

230
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,134
Kim. Kim!

231
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:13,560
- What?
- Please!

232
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:17,145
This is just as much
a shock to me as it is to you.

233
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:21,313
Dad and l use birth control.
lt's protection, but it's never 100%.

234
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,776
Whatever. You don't need my permission.

235
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:27,115
l'm not asking for your permission, Kimberly.

236
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:33,826
Once in a while, you have to think about
what another person is going through.

237
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,490
Honey, l just found out l'm pregnant.

238
00:20:38,963 --> 00:20:41,370
You don't think that terrifies me?

239
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:46,044
Well, it does.

240
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,302
Mom...

241
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,469
l'm sorry.

242
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,607
(Ellis) Are there any other names
on the HK list thatyou recognise?

243
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:13,861
- Rich Goen, Michael Redman. That's it.
- No, they weren't cleared until after the op.

244
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:16,910
- l'll use what we have so far.
- l shouldn't be here.

245
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:19,409
- Green's got me on priority.
- l cleared it.

246
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:21,918
- OK, Bob, he's here.
- Milo.

247
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,549
- Yeah. Who are you?
- Don't worry about me.

248
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:29,677
Ah, l see you opened some sockets up to Ml5.

249
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:32,005
- How did you know that?
- Doesn't matter.

250
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,349
We're tryin' to hook up some names.
l'm gonna help you.

251
00:21:35,436 --> 00:21:38,639
Now, what's your login lD and password?

252
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,807
Give it to him.

253
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:44,768
The login lD is LFN.

254
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:48,939
Password's foothill 94022.

255
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:51,109
Lower case.

256
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:53,778
OK, hang on.

257
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,040
OK, looks like we got some partial results.

258
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,909
- Partial?
- Yeah. Looks like there's something missing.

259
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,202
What do you mean, Bob?

260
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:09,424
Something's been removed.

261
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:11,884
l'll look into it.

262
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:17,180
Meanwhile, Milo, l'm gonna...
l'm gonna send a file to your server.

263
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,847
Why don't you print out
hard copies for Jack and David?

264
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,433
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks, Milo.

265
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,868
All right, here we go.

266
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:47,120
Feels like l haven't eaten in years.

267
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:56,089
Feels good, doesn't it?
Not being afraid any more.

268
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:57,843
Yeah.

269
00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:04,187
l'm sorry, Mom, l was being
really stupid before.

270
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:08,935
So, when are you gonna tell Dad?

271
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:15,318
You know what?

272
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:19,030
Right now. Come on.

273
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,329
Um...

274
00:23:32,303 --> 00:23:34,461
(phone rings)

275
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:37,509
- CTU. Almeida.
- Hi, Tony, it's Teri Bauer calling.

276
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,183
- Could l talk to Jack, please?
- Hi, Teri. Actually, it's a bad time.

277
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,894
- He's... he's kinda busy right now.
- Could you tell him to call? lt's important.

278
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:48,692
Sure.

279
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:55,323
- l really want to hear his reaction.
- l'm so lucky to have you.

280
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,326
Aw, baby.

281
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:09,753
Hi. Sorry, but we need to start the debrief.
CTU's eager to find out what you know.

282
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,418
- We're ready, huh?
- Yeah.

283
00:24:11,676 --> 00:24:15,424
- Great. l'd like to start with just you, Teri.
- Fine.

284
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,057
- l think l'm gonna go to my room.
- That's a good idea. You should try and rest.

285
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:30,684
This is standard procedure.
We're gonna put you on videotape.

286
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:32,652
OK.

287
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:36,573
( ''Clocks Grow Old'' by lAm Spoonbender)

288
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,336
(phone rings)

289
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:04,594
- Yeah?
- Hi, Rick?

290
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:06,177
Hey.

291
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,348
- Kim.
- Are you OK?

292
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,188
Yeah. l just lost a little blood.

293
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,278
You need to see a doctor.
You don't sound good.

294
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:18,990
- l just need a few days' rest.
- Turn yourself in. You can get medical help.

295
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:21,484
And l'll also get arrested.

296
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:24,948
- But you helped us escape. l'll tell them that.
- No!

297
00:25:27,168 --> 00:25:29,493
Don't tell them anything about me.

298
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:34,833
Well, it's too late. My mom's already being
questioned. They're gonna ask about you.

299
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:37,417
l'm next. l can't lie.

300
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:39,587
OK. Don't.

301
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:45,303
Tell them that l didn't know
anything about what was goin' on

302
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:48,229
and that Dan threatened me, he had a gun.

303
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:53,519
OK, but promise me you'll turn yourself in.

304
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,316
l gotta think this through. l'm not like you,
Kim. l don't come from a good family.

305
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:04,569
- System's not gonna give me a break.
- lt's your only way out of this, Rick.

306
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,783
l brought you to Gaines. That's kidnapping.

307
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:11,834
They could put me in jail
for the rest of my life.

308
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:28,428
What's incredible is that none of this has
anything to do with me running for president.

309
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:33,598
lt has nothing to do with... the primary.

310
00:26:36,404 --> 00:26:39,607
lt has nothing to do with my being black.

311
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:47,492
lt's just revenge for
taking out... Victor Drazen.

312
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,619
Yes, sir.

313
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:52,912
(phone rings)

314
00:26:55,756 --> 00:26:58,164
- Hello.
- David, it's Sherry.

315
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:01,462
- Oh, hi. Are you back at the hotel?
- Yes. Where are you?

316
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:04,175
l'm at CTU, a government agency.

317
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:05,925
Why?

318
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:11,685
- There's some things l have to take care of.
- David, what's going on?

319
00:27:12,607 --> 00:27:16,521
l'm trying to find out
who's attempting to kill me, Sherry.

320
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:20,442
- l've got to go. Wait for me at the hotel. OK?
- OK.

321
00:27:20,531 --> 00:27:22,191
Bye.

322
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:30,365
Just doesn't stop.

323
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,795
l'm sorry this is happening to you, sir.

324
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,583
You've been detained.

325
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:44,133
Your family's been kidnapped.

326
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:46,510
And you're concerned about me.

327
00:27:50,353 --> 00:27:55,347
That didn't have anything to do with
the election. That was about my son.

328
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,606
ls he OK?

329
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:00,936
l just realised today...

330
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:05,031
that l haven't always been there for him.

331
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:09,236
And what's killing me...

332
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,494
is that he's always been there for me.

333
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:21,256
Being the son of a politician isn't easy.

334
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:26,089
Being a son... or a daughter...

335
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:29,216
or a father...

336
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,259
none of it's easy.

337
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,688
Your wife and daughter OK?

338
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:43,772
l don't know.

339
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:47,817
l hope so.

340
00:28:57,962 --> 00:29:00,334
- OK. Just try to be relaxed.
- OK.

341
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:02,711
l just have a few questions.

342
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,175
This just came in from Ellis.
l organised it into three sections.

343
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:12,008
Cross-references are in the first part. Then
there's a summary of Operation Nightfall.

344
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:14,426
Details that may not be
important are at the end.

345
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,189
- Any word on the missing file?
- No, not yet.

346
00:29:17,273 --> 00:29:19,349
OK, thanks, Milo.

347
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:26,943
What is the Ambassador
to Libya doing on this list?

348
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,152
Probably kept Drazen's money
separate from the government.

349
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:33,364
We've had our eye on him
for quite some time.

350
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,578
Do you know a Rene Bonniere?

351
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,075
- No. Who's he?
- He's out of North Africa.

352
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:45,208
A couple high-ups over at District thought he
was trying to set up terrorist cells in the US.

353
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,515
Jack. Page four.

354
00:29:56,812 --> 00:29:59,054
Second paragraph down.

355
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,152
Drazen's wife and daughter
were in the bunker?

356
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:13,239
Did you know about this?
This wasn't in our initial report.

357
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:15,950
They died in the explosion.

358
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,748
My God.

359
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:23,545
This is an eye for an eye.
We took out Drazen and his family.

360
00:30:23,631 --> 00:30:25,920
Now someone wants mine.

361
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:29,128
Who's in charge of protecting your family?

362
00:30:29,845 --> 00:30:34,009
Jack! Who has the authority to add
security to your wife and daughter?

363
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,760
Chapelle.

364
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:39,681
- (woman) Yes, Senator?
- Send in Mr Chapelle right away.

365
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:41,848
Yes, sir.

366
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:46,653
There was nothing else you saw or heard
that gave you a glimpse into their operation?

367
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:50,782
No, that's it. They really didn't
talk much in front of us.

368
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,202
- Tell me about this boy Rick. He helped you?
- Yeah.

369
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:55,567
How?

370
00:30:55,663 --> 00:31:00,823
Well, different ways, but mainly
he gave us a gun and he helped us escape.

371
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:03,836
- How'd he get a gun?
- l don't know.

372
00:31:04,422 --> 00:31:06,663
- And you don't know his last name?
- No.

373
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:11,087
- l don't think Kimberly knows either.
- How did she meet him?

374
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:13,586
Through her friend, Janet York.

375
00:31:16,684 --> 00:31:19,471
Everyone used to say
''Wait until she's a teenager,

376
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:23,773
you'll finally understand
the meaning of the word 'worry'.''

377
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:28,686
l'm sure she'll grow out of it.
Jack says she's basically a level-headed kid.

378
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:31,068
Jack talks about Kim?

379
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:33,730
Just the usual stuff.

380
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:38,702
lt surprises me. Jack's work always
seems so serious and secretive.

381
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:43,747
lt's hard to picture him sitting around
the office talking about his family.

382
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:48,628
Sometimes at lunch he'll bring up something
if something's on his mind.

383
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:58,057
So, do you think Rick had the confidence
of lra Gaines, the leader of the group?

384
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:00,633
l really couldn't tell you that.

385
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,438
- Nina, could l ask you a question?
- Sure.

386
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:08,057
When Jack and l were separated...

387
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,938
did he ever talk about me?

388
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,408
Jack never discussed his marriage.

389
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,199
Oh.

390
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,327
Sometimes he would... talk about Kim,

391
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:26,494
you know.

392
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:35,835
We all knew he was
going through a very hard time

393
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,635
and that he missed you both very much.

394
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:50,524
When Jack and l got back together again...
he told me that he'd been with someone else.

395
00:32:55,283 --> 00:33:00,359
l told him it didn't matter what l did,
what he did... when we were apart -

396
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:05,793
that was in the past. The only thing that
mattered was what we did from that point on.

397
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:15,335
lt was you, wasn't it?

398
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:19,924
Teri.

399
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,769
l saw it... when we got off the helicopter.

400
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,771
l saw it when you looked at him.

401
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:46,787
After you were separated,

402
00:33:47,543 --> 00:33:50,461
yes, we saw each other.

403
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:55,920
But it didn't last long. He realised
it was a mistake and he went back to you.

404
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,046
- What about you?
- What about me?

405
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:02,796
Did you think it was a mistake?

406
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:09,392
- Are you still sleeping with him?
- No.

407
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:11,648
Teri...

408
00:34:11,734 --> 00:34:15,732
it was over before he went back to you.
That is the truth.

409
00:34:21,077 --> 00:34:25,371
Look, l realise this is a terrible time
for you to discover all this.

410
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:27,994
When do you think
a good time would be, Nina?

411
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:32,704
l'm sorry.

412
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:36,584
lt's just we have to
get through the rest of this.

413
00:34:36,676 --> 00:34:38,917
l need to take a break.

414
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:59,691
Yeah, Mike, l know.
We'll be leaving in about five minutes.

415
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:04,276
l can't wait for Ellis. l've got to go.

416
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:10,408
Senator, they're not gonna let me continue to
work here. l am technically still under arrest.

417
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:11,414
Come on.

418
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,289
Ryan!

419
00:35:16,966 --> 00:35:20,382
- Yes, Senator?
- l understand you have Jack under arrest.

420
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:23,043
l told the senator l was being detained.

421
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:28,679
There is an ongoing crisis that supersedes
any charges that might be filed against him.

422
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,185
- But Senator...
- l want him reinstated immediately.

423
00:35:33,274 --> 00:35:36,191
Sir, you don't have the authority
to make that decision.

424
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:38,768
Alberta, please.

425
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:45,197
Sir, what you are asking isn't possible.
The charges against Agent Bauer are serious.

426
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:50,162
We'd be in contempt of agency regulations
if we reinstated him without a hearing.

427
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:54,117
Ryan, you don't have to reinstate me.
Not permanently.

428
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:57,711
Nobody here has as much information
about this situation as l do.

429
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,633
Give me provisional status
till the end of the day.

430
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:04,846
Then you can take me back into custody,
do whatever you want.

431
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:14,560
Fine, Jack.

432
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:18,896
You work the case out of CTU,
but you answer to me.

433
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:24,151
Good luck with your campaign, Senator.

434
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:26,281
Thank you.

435
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,405
Walk with me.

436
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:38,588
Secret Service wants me to leave the state.
They say it's not safe.

437
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:40,961
Well, l agree with them.

438
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:47,170
The one thing we know... is that Drazen's
people are here, and they want us today.

439
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,972
And it's almost three o'clock now.
The day is more than half over.

440
00:36:52,061 --> 00:36:54,219
l'm going to stay.

441
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:57,516
Let's flush them out into
the open and deal with them.

442
00:36:57,608 --> 00:36:59,897
Otherwise you and l and our families

443
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:03,604
will be looking over our shoulders
for the rest of our lives.

444
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:07,565
l understand. l'll follow up with Ellis.
l'll keep you posted.

445
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,365
- You know how to get in touch with me.
- Jack.

446
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:15,662
l'm sorry that l misjudged you.

447
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:22,582
Thank you, Senator.

448
00:37:25,136 --> 00:37:27,212
Excuse me.

449
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:36,436
Before my mom came, nobody talked to me.
They put me in the room, l was locked in.

450
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:40,436
- What about Rick?
- Rick? What about Rick?

451
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:44,394
- Well, he was one of your kidnappers, right?
- Not exactly.

452
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:47,062
l thought he and Dan brought you to Gaines?

453
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,945
Well, it was mostly Dan. l mean, not Rick.

454
00:37:50,036 --> 00:37:54,164
l think he was actually just as surprised
as we were about what was happening.

455
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:55,707
Really?

456
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:59,456
Well, yeah. He was fighting
with Dan the entire time.

457
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:01,787
He actually helped us escape.

458
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:04,170
Hold on. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

459
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:06,334
(phone rings)

460
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:08,503
Hold on.

461
00:38:17,104 --> 00:38:19,097
- Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

462
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,852
Chapelle reinstated me to provisional status
for the rest of the day, at Palmer's request.

463
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:27,729
- That's great, Jack.
- Yeah. How's everything going over there?

464
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:31,239
- Not bad.
- Look, we're sending over two more teams.

465
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:34,328
- Why?
- Looks like Teri and Kim were targets as well.

466
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:38,707
Nina... this is not information
they need to know, OK?

467
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:41,248
- No, of course.
- Good, thanks.

468
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:43,662
- Let me speak to Teri, OK?
- Sure.

469
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:52,127
Teri?

470
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:57,218
lt's Jack.

471
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:04,350
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, sweetheart. You OK? How you doin'?

472
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,237
l'm OK.

473
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:09,397
- How's Kim?
- She's fine.

474
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:15,025
Tony gave me a message that you
wanted to tell me something important.

475
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:17,409
No, it's nothing important.

476
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:20,824
Are you sure? You sound funny.

477
00:39:22,086 --> 00:39:24,209
lt's nothing, l just...

478
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:26,254
l just...

479
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,297
l'm so tired.

480
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:31,678
Why don't you try and get
some rest, sweetheart?

481
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:36,424
Listen, if... if you need anything
from the house, Nina will make sure

482
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:39,851
- someone can go and get it for you, OK?
- Yeah, OK.

483
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:45,191
l've gotta go. l love you, OK?
l'll call you as soon as l can.

484
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,894
OK. Bye-bye.

485
00:40:03,544 --> 00:40:04,742
Mom!

486
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:06,913
l'll be right back.

487
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:16,471
- So, what did he say?
- l didn't tell him.

488
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:20,006
- Why not?
- lt wasn't the right time.

489
00:40:20,937 --> 00:40:23,772
You should go back
and finish with Nina, honey.

490
00:40:23,856 --> 00:40:25,932
What's wrong?

491
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,395
Nothing. l just think you should
finish answering Nina's questions.

492
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:37,442
(phone rings)

493
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,031
Bauer.

494
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,826
- Jack, it's Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

495
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:47,076
Yeah, l shot over a few more things to Milo,
but l still can't locate the missin' file.

496
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:51,584
- How can l help?
- l gave Milo enough to try it on your end.

497
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:57,512
The more l look at this thing, the more l'm
convinced the file was taken out deliberately.

498
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:03,427
Which leads me to believe...
it contains what we're lookin' for.

499
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:06,771
Can you give an estimate of
when you think the file was stolen?

500
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:10,523
Also a list of people you think
could've had access to even get in there?

501
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:13,565
Not yet, but you tell Milo
l got some ideas on how to...

502
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:14,735
Urgh!

503
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,191
Bob?

504
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:21,113
Bob?

505
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:26,661
Bob?

506
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:29,287
Can you hear me?

507
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:31,999
Bob?

508
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:30,517
