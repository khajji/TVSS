1
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:18,452
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:21,252
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,485
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:30,966
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:36,292
(Patty) You and Sherry
were childhood sweethearts?

6
00:00:36,373 --> 00:00:38,682
- That's right.
- There's never been anyone else?

7
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,287
l'm running for president. l can't answer that.

8
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:44,206
- Come on.
- Are you flirting with me, Patty?

9
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,284
l don't know. l think l might be.

10
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,887
- l did what you told me.
- And?

11
00:00:48,973 --> 00:00:53,364
l think it's working. But it's gonna
lead to other things, Mrs Palmer.

12
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:58,131
- (Mason) Teri, l'm busy. Nina can talk to you.
- You are not gonna let my husband die!

13
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:01,569
No one is gonna let Jack die.
We just can't go through with the trade.

14
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:04,929
There's no difference.
Without your help he doesn't have a chance.

15
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:10,084
l am willing to trade the life
ofJack Bauer for that ofmy son.

16
00:01:12,253 --> 00:01:15,882
OK, we're here. Here's Alexis. Where's Jack?

17
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,884
Drop the weapon!

18
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:22,206
You son of a bitch!

19
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:26,361
lf your people deliver my brother
as promised, you'll live.

20
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:30,844
- What about my daughter?
- You'll hear from us when this is over.

21
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:34,524
(phone rings)

22
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:36,369
Yeah!

23
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:38,842
(Andre) South ofthe platform there's a car.

24
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:44,929
lfyou want to see Kim alive, talk to no one,
get into it, and head toward Century City.

25
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:17,484
(phone rings)

26
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:18,563
Yeah.

27
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:22,407
- (Andre) Proceed to Palmer's hotel.
- What do you want me to do?

28
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:27,408
When your government abducted my father,
they also froze $200 million of our assets.

29
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:30,485
Palmer has the necessary
clearance to unfreeze them.

30
00:02:30,573 --> 00:02:33,531
So everything that happened today
was because of money?

31
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:38,407
l wouldn't say that. That money is ours.

32
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:42,281
We'll call Palmer
at this number at exactly 10.45.

33
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:47,493
Once l receive confirmation of the transfer,
l'll give you further instructions.

34
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,962
What kind of instructions?

35
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:58,887
- You want me to take out Palmer.
- Well, of course.

36
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,567
That's why we let you go.

37
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,451
That's why we have your daughter.

38
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,131
- Jack?
- l'm still here.

39
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:11,922
Remember, we'll call at exactly 10.45.

40
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:17,007
l trust l don't have to tell you what will
happen if Palmer doesn't answer.

41
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:37,284
- Hello, Patty.
- You left the party early.

42
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:40,532
l wasn't in the mood. What's up?

43
00:03:40,613 --> 00:03:44,765
l was just wondering if you had a chance
to look at the Dallas schedule.

44
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:47,242
- lt's fine.
- Good.

45
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,847
Um, do you need anything else from me?

46
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,332
Sit down.

47
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:17,327
A little while ago, we started down a road
that was gonna take us to a dangerous place.

48
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:19,563
l know. And l'm sorry.

49
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,532
Are you?

50
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:26,332
Sorry?

51
00:04:28,053 --> 00:04:32,569
l'm attracted to you, Senator.
l always have been.

52
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:44,245
Meet me in 20 minutes in room 907.

53
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,244
l'll be waiting for you.

54
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:53,448
(door opens)

55
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,728
Oh, David, good. l...

56
00:04:56,693 --> 00:05:00,368
l, uh... need to talk to you for a second.

57
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:04,924
- l'll just make those changes to the schedule.
- Thanks, Patty.

58
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:16,687
l, uh... told Keith and Nicole

59
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:21,005
that we're going to stump it separately
for the next couple of days.

60
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,653
What did they say?

61
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:28,443
- They know we're not getting along, David.
- Fine. What are they going to do?

62
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:33,004
They'll stay with me.
Unless, of course, you want them with you.

63
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:39,811
No. l could use a couple of days alone.

64
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:43,085
Great.

65
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,967
We gotta work under
a couple of assumptions here.

66
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:12,409
The only way to find Jack is through Drazen.

67
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:15,929
The only way to get to Drazen
is if Alexis takes us there.

68
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:19,005
So we gotta devote all of
our resources to finding Alexis.

69
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:21,163
- Yeah, but he shed the trackers.
- l know.

70
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:25,007
So we use the satellite
and run computer simulators.

71
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,084
(phone rings)

72
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,323
- Yeah?
- (Jack) George, it's me.

73
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:34,483
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Drazen let me go.

74
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:37,167
- But l can't come in yet.
- What do you mean?

75
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,484
George, listen. Tell Teri l'm out.
l know she's worried about me.

76
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:44,327
lfDrazen calls, don't tell him that we talked.
lt'll put Kim in danger.

77
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:48,201
- Fine. But, Jack, let us help you.
- George, l gotta go.

78
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,967
l don't like the sound of that.

79
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,648
- What do you think he's doing?
- lf Drazen let him go for a reason...

80
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:03,565
Jack won't let us help him,
he won't tell us what he's doing...

81
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:07,729
Whatever he's doing,
he's trying to protect Kim.

82
00:07:09,413 --> 00:07:12,644
What's the one thing we know
for sure that Drazen wants?

83
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,724
Palmer dead.

84
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:23,732
Jane, connect me with the Palmer suite,
Secret Service.

85
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:53,802
What's happening?

86
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:58,045
- l can't stop the internal bleeding.
- Do not let him die!

87
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:06,204
Father...

88
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,610
Alexie!

89
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,210
Do something!

90
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:30,807
l'm sorry. There's nothing more l can do.

91
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,292
No. Leave us. We're family.

92
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,288
First Mother and Martina...

93
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:05,209
Now Alexis.

94
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:10,449
- And it's Bauer!
- Andre, not yet! We still need her!

95
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:13,411
- Call him. Let him hear her die!
- Andre!

96
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:44,768
Uh, could you wait for me, please?

97
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,445
Thanks.

98
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,532
- Well?
- He wants to see me.

99
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,251
- When?
- Tonight.

100
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,607
He didn't waste much time, huh?

101
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,608
How are you doing?

102
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:09,325
- l told you, l feel really uncomfortable...
- No, no, Patty, please. Don't patronise me.

103
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:14,043
You feel uncomfortable, but not because
you're ready to be with my husband.

104
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:19,403
You feel uncomfortable because you're
doing it with my knowledge and consent.

105
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,292
Why are you doing this, Mrs Palmer?

106
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:28,970
lt's... lt's important for David's career
that l have his full confidence.

107
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:32,202
And l no longer have that.

108
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:35,887
And you want me to get it?

109
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,441
Yes. And report back to me.

110
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:47,886
- We both know what it's going to...?
- Yes. We do.

111
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:53,648
- And you're OK with that?
- No, l never said l was OK with it.

112
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:58,602
But l'm willing to accept it...
because it's necessary.

113
00:11:06,173 --> 00:11:08,641
Your elevator's waiting.

114
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,211
Just make sure that Palmer
has an extra layer of security.

115
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,932
- lt's gonna be a little difficult...
- Yes, l know.

116
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,685
Nina, got a minute?

117
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,128
- Hold on.
- This is important.

118
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:26,001
Paul, we're done. OK. What?

119
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:30,052
The schematics to the detention facility
where they were holding Victor Drazen.

120
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,522
They've been tampered with.

121
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,651
- Who has access to these archives?
- Division and District.

122
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:39,645
Can you find out who's had access
to these in the last month?

123
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,203
- Yeah.
- Well, do it. The sooner the better.

124
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,006
- You think this is a second dirty agent?
- Yeah.

125
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,767
What did Tony want?

126
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:59,323
He was just telling me why it was
so hard to pick up a thread on Drazen.

127
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:02,723
Listen, l need your help.
Teri Bauer's a basket case.

128
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:07,726
- l don't know what you think l can do.
- You're good with her. You calm her down.

129
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:11,567
Come on! l gotta deal with Chapelle,
DOD's still trying to pass the buck...

130
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:13,450
All right.

131
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,524
She's in the conference room.

132
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:17,604
l know.

133
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:28,130
- ls it over? Did they make the trade?
- Jack's safe. He's no longer a hostage.

134
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,602
ls he on his way?

135
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,366
- We don't know where he is.
- What?

136
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,923
He called in to tell us he was OK,
but he didn't say anything else.

137
00:12:37,013 --> 00:12:40,528
- Why not?
- Drazen wants him to do something else.

138
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:44,162
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would he do anything for that man?

139
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:48,009
- l think it's to protect Kim.
- What are you talking about?

140
00:12:49,653 --> 00:12:51,689
Teri, the reason that Kim isn't back...

141
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,241
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Just listen to me.

142
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:58,049
We think that's where Jack is now.
He's trying to bring Kim back.

143
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:01,921
He's not communicating with us...
to protect her.

144
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,124
l'm sorry.

145
00:13:56,573 --> 00:14:00,043
The task we have given your father
is a simple one.

146
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:03,044
And if he does it...

147
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:06,564
will you let me go?

148
00:14:09,573 --> 00:14:11,564
We will see.

149
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:33,812
- Jack, l just got your message.
- Senator, l need to see you right away.

150
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:36,771
- Your office said you might be coming.
- l am coming there.

151
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:40,050
- Why?
- l have a message from Victor Drazen.

152
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:43,648
They also said that Drazen has your daughter,
and you could be a threat.

153
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:48,443
They've added to my security. Secret Service
has been instructed not to let you near me.

154
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:53,243
They do have my daughter, but l'm not
coming there to harm you in any way.

155
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:58,609
- What does Drazen want you to do?
- He wants to speak to you at 10.45.

156
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:01,127
lt's a scrambled phone
so that it can't be traced.

157
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:04,649
- What does he want to talk about?
- Money. l'll explain when l get there.

158
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,645
Just tell your people to let me through.

159
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:11,043
Drazen's people, who are holding
your daughter hostage, want me dead.

160
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,851
You're asking a lot, Jack.

161
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:16,846
They had my wife and daughter today,
and l still managed to save your life.

162
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:21,331
l'm not coming there to harm you in any way.
l give you my word, sir.

163
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:53,966
Hi.

164
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,089
Anyone see you come up?

165
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:58,368
No, l was careful.

166
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,728
Why don't you sit down?

167
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,204
Well, how much time do we have?

168
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:17,804
Don't worry about that.

169
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:24,125
l have something l wanna tell you, Patty.

170
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,692
Yes?

171
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:34,084
You're fired.

172
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,926
Pack up. Get out.

173
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:42,767
And don't bother to ask me
or anyone else on my staff for a reference.

174
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,526
Prospective employers
won't like what l have to say.

175
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:49,083
- l don't understand.
- l know what you're doing.

176
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,006
You're working with my wife against me.

177
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:57,565
Senator, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to deceive you like this.

178
00:16:57,653 --> 00:17:00,565
But your wife insisted
and l didn't know what to say.

179
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:04,692
- ''No'' would have done it.
- l know, l know. l should have.

180
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:09,722
- lt's just that... she can be scary sometimes.
- So can l.

181
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:14,728
Obviously l have made a terrible mistake in
judgment, and if there's anything l can do...

182
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,805
l want you out of this hotel in 30 minutes.

183
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:43,286
You gotta take a look at this. These six people
have accessed the detention-facility archives.

184
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:47,764
The first five were just doing
scheduled backups. Here's the sixth.

185
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,044
George?

186
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,203
George is the mole?

187
00:17:56,293 --> 00:18:00,286
lt's possible. He accessed
that file four days ago.

188
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,843
Why would he have done that
if he wasn't involved?

189
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:09,888
- You gotta call Chapelle.
- No, shut down his network access.

190
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,692
You can't let anything go in or out.

191
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,970
OK. l just gotta figure out
how l'm gonna do it.

192
00:18:33,053 --> 00:18:35,851
- Where were you?
- Downstairs.

193
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,049
- Downstairs?
- Yeah.

194
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:43,163
ln room 907... with Patty.

195
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:46,685
What?

196
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:51,449
Save your energy, Sherry.
No need to act surprised.

197
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,884
l fired her.

198
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,601
You know your problem, David?

199
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:13,769
You think everyone's conspiring against you,
when in fact we're just trying to help.

200
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:18,971
By putting another woman in my bed?
Do you realise how sick that is?

201
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:25,208
Oh, come on. We chose a certain life,
and we chose that a long time ago.

202
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:28,922
lt's not about a house in the suburbs
and PTA meetings.

203
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:32,847
And whether you're willing to accept it or not,
we serve a higher purpose.

204
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:37,131
You are not qualified
to talk about higher purposes.

205
00:19:37,213 --> 00:19:38,965
- Oh, l'm not?
- No, you're not.

206
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:45,728
We are about to move into the White House.

207
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,124
That's right. We.

208
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:51,450
You and l.

209
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:54,605
And all the issues, all the politics,

210
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,163
all the hard work
that's gonna help get us there...

211
00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:01,692
l'm as much a part of that as you.

212
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:03,764
So don't even try to deny it.

213
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:07,770
Please, Sherry... don't go there.

214
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:12,771
l'm not begrudging a single thing, David.
l don't need the limelight.

215
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:16,448
- You sent her to spy on me!
- That's right! And do you wanna know why?

216
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:20,287
- Yes, l do.
- Because you need me to look out for you.

217
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:25,208
And if you cut me out of your inner circle,
like you threatened earlier today, you will fail.

218
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:27,682
ln every way.

219
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,365
You need me, David.

220
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,648
- (knock on door)
- What?

221
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:36,123
- Jack Bauer just arrived, sir.
- l'll be out in a moment.

222
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:47,804
We're not done here.

223
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,884
- Jack.
- Senator.

224
00:21:04,253 --> 00:21:08,212
Convincing Secret Service to let you
come up to see me was difficult enough.

225
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:11,603
- They won't let me out of their sight.
- That's fine. All that matters

226
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:16,523
is that you talk to Victor Drazen when he
calls, listen to his demands and cooperate.

227
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:18,929
How did they get your daughter?

228
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:22,450
Senator, we don't have much time.
He could call any second.

229
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,783
- OK, you said this was about money?
- Yes.

230
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:27,433
$200 million of his was frozen
after he was abducted.

231
00:21:27,513 --> 00:21:28,832
- And?
- He wants it.

232
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:34,510
He says you have the clearance to get it back.
He'll give you instructions when he calls.

233
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,187
That's why he sent you?
To get me to release his funds?

234
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:42,870
Once he has confirmation of the transfer,
he'll ask me to take action against you.

235
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,989
- To kill me?
- Yes.

236
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:50,652
Of course, l would never do you any harm.
He has my daughter. l'm trying to buy time.

237
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:55,292
Jack, l don't have the authority to transfer
those funds, and Drazen knows that.

238
00:21:55,373 --> 00:21:59,446
- What do you mean?
- He knows our system. That money's gone.

239
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,922
l don't think that's the reason he's calling.

240
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:03,704
(phone rings)

241
00:22:04,513 --> 00:22:07,511
Senator, please, answer this phone.

242
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:25,984
OK, Jack. l'll do what l can.
l'll tell him what he wants to hear.

243
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:29,668
- l can't guarantee he'll buy it.
- Thank you.

244
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:35,029
- This is David Palmer.
- Senator Palmer.

245
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:38,992
lt must be nice being reunited
with your friend Jack Bauer.

246
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:41,507
- What do you want?
- (electronic whine)

247
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,663
Drazen? Drazen?

248
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:46,142
He knows you can't get the money. Senator...

249
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:48,423
No!

250
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:53,551
(static on phone)

251
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,225
Are you all right, sir?

252
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:30,030
A detonation of this magnitude
had to be military plastique.

253
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:34,106
- Get a powder residue. We'll try and trace it.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:45,392
- Where is he? David!
- Ma'am, this area's not...

255
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:47,703
Let her through. lt's OK. Calm down.

256
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,110
- Where's Keith and Nicole?
- At the party. Are you all right?

257
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:52,865
- l'm fine.
- Oh, God.

258
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,102
Senator.

259
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:57,549
This is Jack Bauer from CTU,
the man who saved my life twice today.

260
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:00,466
- Mrs Palmer.
- The man that put your life in danger?

261
00:24:00,553 --> 00:24:03,386
- Sherry, please!
- (radio) Status report on the senator?

262
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:08,228
Don't answer that yet. Senator,
we need to talk about this. My daughter...

263
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,508
Tell them you don't know yet.

264
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:13,630
This is Ron.
We don't have a 20 on the senator yet.

265
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,146
What's going on?

266
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:19,545
The man that planned this explosion
needs to believe that it was a success.

267
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:23,387
Wait a minute. You mean, you want
the world to think that David is dead?

268
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:26,187
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely not.

269
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:28,748
David, what's this all about?

270
00:24:29,993 --> 00:24:33,144
His daughter is being held hostage.

271
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:37,465
But we can't have people thinking
David was assassinated. lt's preposterous!

272
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:41,626
- lf we don't, ma'am, my daughter will die.
- Then what do you suggest we do, Mr Bauer?

273
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,022
We keep the senator quarantined
for a few hours.

274
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:47,185
We leak a story to the press
that he was killed in the explosion.

275
00:24:47,273 --> 00:24:51,751
- You've got to be kidding.
- l've never been more serious in my life.

276
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:05,190
- No, it's not gonna happen. David, tell him.
- This is about the life of an innocent girl.

277
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:09,471
David, we cannot keep playing games
with the public and expect to keep their trust.

278
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:13,209
Senator, if we're gonna do this,
we need to do this now.

279
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:23,465
Go downstairs. Bring the children up.
Talk to no one. l mean it.

280
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,867
l need all the agents
that have seen the senator.

281
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:30,547
- Who is your senior chief of staff?
- Mike Novick.

282
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:32,703
Bring in Mr Novick as well.

283
00:25:32,793 --> 00:25:38,684
As soon as Mr Palmer's family gets here, no
one is to enter or exit this area. Understood?

284
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:42,064
Now, Sherry!

285
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,463
- l'm very sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

286
00:25:48,553 --> 00:25:51,745
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- lt has to.

287
00:25:57,793 --> 00:26:00,626
Hey, Almeida. What's going on
with my network access?

288
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:05,343
- What do you mean?
- l can't access archives or Palmer's itinerary.

289
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:08,231
- l'll call lTS.
- l don't have time for that. Are you up?

290
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,504
- Yeah, l think so.
- Let's see.

291
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:13,706
Yeah, here it is.

292
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:16,382
So Palmer's still going to Dallas tomorrow.

293
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:19,431
Call Secret Service and find out
what time his plane leaves.

294
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:22,664
- Division's got it covered. l don't think...
- Hey, real simple.

295
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:26,746
Call Secret Service.
Find out what time his plane leaves.

296
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:29,941
And get my network up and running.

297
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:38,304
(phone rings)

298
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:42,512
- What happened?
- Well, he found out he's cut off.

299
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:46,666
And he seems overly interested in
what happens to Palmer after he leaves LA.

300
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:50,746
- We should alert Chapelle.
- No, not yet.

301
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:53,905
lf we go to Chapelle without evidence,
he'll slice us up.

302
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:57,702
- What about his access?
- l'm gonna have to restore it.

303
00:26:57,793 --> 00:27:00,830
All right, but monitor everything
and send it to me.

304
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,310
Put it up on all the monitors!

305
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:05,788
Everybody, eyes on monitors.

306
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:11,305
(TV) Events are unfolding by the minute
in this tragic and stunning development.

307
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:16,706
The hotel has been sealed off. Only a limited
number of authorised personnel are allowed inside.

308
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:19,626
We have heard from a spokesperson
from the Palmer camp,

309
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:24,582
who has just confirmed that Senator David
Palmer has been killed in an explosion.

310
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:28,586
There is speculation this is related
to this morning's assassination attempt,

311
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:31,990
but at this time no one has been arrested.

312
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:36,152
We did it, father. We did it.

313
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,428
Ah, yes.

314
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:41,789
All right. l'll take care of the girl,
then we can leave.

315
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:47,272
Do not do anything until we know
that Jack Bauer is dead. Do nothing.

316
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:01,829
(phone rings)

317
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:04,791
Sir, we just contacted Mike Novick.
He's on his way.

318
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:07,068
Agent Bauer, it's for you.

319
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:09,185
Thank you.

320
00:28:10,473 --> 00:28:14,466
- Yeah?
- (Andre) You're a very lucky man, Mr Bauer.

321
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:19,144
l was calling to confirm your death,
but l see you've survived.

322
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,349
Andre.

323
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,424
l have an offer to make you.

324
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:26,823
You've killed Senator Palmer.
l'm the last person on your list.

325
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,707
l'll make you a trade: me for my daughter.

326
00:28:32,073 --> 00:28:35,145
Come to Port of Los Angeles. 
Dock 11A.

327
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:38,305
What assurances do l have
that you'll let her go when l arrive?

328
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:44,582
Sadly, none. But we've decided the sins
of the father need not be visited upon her.

329
00:28:45,553 --> 00:28:48,465
Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.
l'll be there in 30 minutes.

330
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:54,683
And, Jack, if you bring your colleagues
or involve them in any way, we'll know.

331
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:57,384
l understand.

332
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:01,344
l have to go alone.

333
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:04,101
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

334
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:13,708
Why are you doing this to us?

335
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:24,106
Yeah, Jack, l can tell him,
but you should really let us help you on this.

336
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:25,706
No, l can't, not yet.

337
00:29:25,793 --> 00:29:28,307
Give us a general position,
so we can be nearby.

338
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:34,343
No. lf Drazen's got someone else working
on the inside, it could put Kim in danger.

339
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,468
All right.

340
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:38,021
- Let me speak to Teri.
- OK.

341
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:44,743
lt's Jack.

342
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,630
- Jack?
- How are you holdin' up?

343
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:51,423
- Where are you? Do you know about Kim?
- Yes. l'm on my way to pick her up. She's fine.

344
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:53,868
- Where is she?
- l can't say now, sweetheart.

345
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:56,726
But l promise you,
soon she's going to be with you.

346
00:29:56,713 --> 00:30:00,388
Thank God. What do you mean ''she''?
What about you?

347
00:30:00,953 --> 00:30:04,589
- l'm sorry. l meant to say both of us.
- Oh, good.

348
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:09,509
l just don't think l can take much more of this.
l need you both here, Jack.

349
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:13,472
l know, sweetheart. Look, it's almost over.
Just hang in there, OK?

350
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:15,350
OK.

351
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:18,024
- Teri?
- What?

352
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,831
- l love you.
- l love you too, Jack.

353
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:28,871
Honey, um...

354
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:32,746
There's something l have to tell you.

355
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:36,528
- l've been waiting for the right time.
- What is it?

356
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,428
You're gonna be a father.

357
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:42,310
Again.

358
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:45,830
What are you saying, that you're pregnant?

359
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:49,503
Well, yes, that's generally how it works, Jack.

360
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,788
- Jack?
- l'm still here.

361
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:59,752
l'm sorry, it was the last thing
l thought you were gonna say.

362
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,631
Are you all right with this?
Are you happy about this?

363
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:04,908
Oh, yes. 
l am.

364
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:13,030
l keep thinking that... maybe it's the
second chance we've been talking about.

365
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,024
Are you there?

366
00:31:19,393 --> 00:31:22,783
- Yeah, l'm still here.
- Are you happy about it?

367
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:26,585
Yes. Yes, l'm happy about it.

368
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:28,709
l'm very, very happy.

369
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:34,663
Good. Are you sure everything's OK?

370
00:31:36,153 --> 00:31:38,223
Yeah.

371
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,711
Sweetheart... l promise you
everything is gonna be OK.

372
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:48,144
lt's just been a really, really long day.

373
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:54,582
Just get on back here
so we can all go home, OK?

374
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,470
OK.

375
00:31:56,993 --> 00:32:00,185
Teri... l love you so much.

376
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:06,826
l love you too, Jack. 
l'll see you soon.

377
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,524
l had a sister once.

378
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:54,143
She was full of life... 

379
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:56,885
like you.

380
00:32:57,133 --> 00:33:00,025
She was a photographer
and took hundreds of pictures.

381
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:02,504
l used to love looking at them.

382
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:06,344
Now l can't do that any more.

383
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:12,186
You know how she died?

384
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:14,464
Has anyone told you?

385
00:33:16,353 --> 00:33:18,992
Your father killed her.

386
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:22,748
- My father would never kill innocent people.
- You wanted to know.

387
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:26,662
- l don't believe you.
- Oh, he says it was an accident.

388
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,948
But when a man goes
halfway round the world to set off a bomb,

389
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:36,192
he's responsible for
any ''accidents'' that result.

390
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:43,431
Has your father ever talked about his work?

391
00:33:44,993 --> 00:33:50,003
About where he goes...
on those long trips overseas?

392
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,428
Of course not.

393
00:33:55,513 --> 00:33:58,452
- He can't.
- Because he's a criminal.

394
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:00,824
My father is a good man.

395
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:06,224
No.

396
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,604
He's not.

397
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:44,390
Palmer's still alive. The suite at his hotel
blew up, but apparently he got out unscathed.

398
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:48,902
- Why the reports?
- l haven't been debriefed,

399
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:51,905
but l guess it makes sense
as a defensive strategy.

400
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:55,030
Palmer's safe as long as
the hitters think he's dead.

401
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:59,903
This goes no further than the three of us until
the public's made aware that he survived.

402
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:02,348
- What about the perpetrators?
- lt's unclear.

403
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,709
Our intel is being refreshed
by Secret Service as we speak.

404
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:10,150
So, stay at your stations. Start rebuilding
profiles based on the incoming information

405
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,027
and we'll have a new plan
in place within the hour.

406
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,946
Have you spoken to Jack
since the first time he called?

407
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,630
Not me.

408
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:21,110
lt doesn't matter.
This'll all be over soon anyway.

409
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:36,683
- Have you talked to Jack?
- Yeah, he called, but he won't let us help him.

410
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:54,063
lt's kind of cold.
Do you mind if l have some coffee?

411
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:13,987
Aaargh!

412
00:36:24,553 --> 00:36:26,544
(shouting in Serbian)

413
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:42,711
(speaks Serbian)

414
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:39,465
(Andre) Stop right there, Kim! 
Don't move!

415
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:45,868
Don't be foolish! You'll drown!

416
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:57,709
(speaks Serbian)

417
00:39:21,473 --> 00:39:24,033
How are we going to do this without the girl?

418
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:26,802
Bauer has no choice but to trust us.

419
00:39:27,953 --> 00:39:29,944
(phone rings)

420
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,544
(in Serbian)

421
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:04,626
Oh, there you are.
We just got some new intel from Langley.

422
00:40:04,713 --> 00:40:07,302
- Oh, good.
- Yeah, take a look at this.
