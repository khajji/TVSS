1
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:19,401
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:21,947
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:26,199
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:32,162
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,227
Mom!

6
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:19,170
Mom!

7
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,425
Mom!

8
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,891
Do you remember anything yet?

9
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:32,014
No.

10
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:36,269
lt must be weird.

11
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:40,526
l mean, l never met anyone
that has amnesia before.

12
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:46,080
l really appreciate you helping me out.

13
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:57,293
- What's your name?
- Tanya.

14
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,252
Tanya.

15
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:03,802
l hope you're not going
too far out of your way.

16
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,019
lt's fine. The hospital isn't far from here.

17
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,766
So, you come from money.
You look like you might.

18
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,266
Or your husband.

19
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,031
- My husband?
- Your little band of gold?

20
00:02:19,114 --> 00:02:21,190
On your finger?

21
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:28,282
l don't have any memory of my husband.

22
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,681
Agent Pierce, Jack Bauer.
We met at the breakfast this morning.

23
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,016
l'm sorry about that. We didn't know the
pressure you were under. ls your family OK?

24
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,890
Yes, they're fine, thank you.
This is my partner, Nina Myers.

25
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:00,105
Agents Johnson, Aleshire,
surveillance technicians.

26
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:03,613
You've met Miss Nash.
She's part of the senator's advance team.

27
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,776
Yes, from the senator's staff meeting.

28
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,953
Can l just say how sorry l am
to have caused so much trouble?

29
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,242
You didn't know who Drazen was.
Now you know he's a killer,

30
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:16,628
- it takes courage to walk into the same room.
- l hate to interrupt, but we have to go.

31
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:21,755
Drazen is down here in room 1243.
We went over it. lt's nothing unusual.

32
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:23,919
lt's ready to rig however you want to.

33
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:27,097
That gives us less than 30 minutes
to set up visual and audio.

34
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:28,842
- Fibre optics?
- Yes.

35
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:31,639
We also need to set up monitors
in an adjacent room.

36
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:35,429
We have 1242, across the hallway.
lt's been vacated already.

37
00:03:35,524 --> 00:03:38,478
OK, good. Gentlemen,
l want you to get started right away.

38
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:42,234
l want coverage of every square foot
of this room by at least two angles.

39
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,398
- Nina?
- Yeah?

40
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,609
Take Miss Nash into 1242.
Start prepping her. We'll be there in a minute.

41
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:54,165
- Have you set up the other checkpoints?
- Every entrance to the hotel is covered.

42
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:56,658
So is every approach from a block away.

43
00:03:56,753 --> 00:04:00,288
- Any civilians left on the floor?
- No, we've sealed it off.

44
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:04,249
Good work. Let me know
as soon as Drazen enters this hotel.

45
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:20,025
l think there's a hospital at the bottom
of the canyon. l'm not sure how good it is.

46
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,566
Wait, wait. Pull over.

47
00:04:22,654 --> 00:04:25,145
- You see something you remember?
- Yeah, l think so.

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,316
- The restaurant?
- Yeah.

49
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:02,062
- Do you recognise anything?
- l've been here before.

50
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:05,520
l was with someone.

51
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:07,690
With your husband?

52
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,319
Not your husband?

53
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:14,903
Maybe we should keep going, to the hospital.

54
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:17,572
No, no, no. Just being here helps.

55
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,873
Hey, is there a maître d'
or a manager or something?

56
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:24,834
- Manager. Mr Martin.
- ls he here?

57
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,416
No, but he should be in about 20 minutes.

58
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,587
Thank you. l'm gonna wait.

59
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:54,444
Maybe this Mr Martin
knows something about me.

60
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,031
This place seems so familiar.

61
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,585
l think l'm gonna stay.
You don't have to wait with me.

62
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:13,346
So, listen. Why don't you
give me your number, and...

63
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:17,809
when l'm better,
l'll send you whatever l can afford.

64
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:22,348
You know what?

65
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,317
Send me whatever you can afford,
plus ten bucks.

66
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:32,569
lt's a cab fare to the hospital,

67
00:06:33,243 --> 00:06:35,948
in case Mr Martin can't help you.

68
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:40,286
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

69
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,893
So, obviously,
without compromising yourself,

70
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:02,227
we need you to behave in the same way
you always have with him.

71
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:06,228
l know. lt's just the thought
of letting him touch me again...

72
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,484
l understand.

73
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:13,355
What do you usually
talk about with him? His work?

74
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,400
The truth is, we didn't really talk much.
lt wasn't that kind of relationship.

75
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:21,624
lt was more... take the plunge
and worry about the consequences later.

76
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,579
- You know what l mean?
- Yeah.

77
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:29,079
- OK, l'm waiting on the signal.
- Elizabeth?

78
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:31,048
- Hi.
- l heard what's going on.

79
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,839
- Are you sure about this?
- l'm sure.

80
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:38,674
- lf you have the slightest hesitation...
- No, l want to. Definitely.

81
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,221
- May l talk to you a minute?
- Yes, sir.

82
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:53,442
l told you to look after her,
not put her in danger.

83
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:57,743
Senator, l don't need to remind you,
but the threat against you is very real.

84
00:07:57,828 --> 00:08:01,244
- lt's no reason to put someone else at risk.
- l don't think l have.

85
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:05,625
l'll be across the hall with a squad of men,
ready to come in if something goes wrong.

86
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:08,415
He's a professional killer.
Things can happen fast.

87
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:11,839
He is not working alone.
Arresting him will not stop the others.

88
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:16,302
lf you want to put an end to this now,
sir, we keep him on the hook.

89
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:22,639
l know you've been through a lot,
and your family has gone through hell...

90
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,349
What does that have to do with this?

91
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,851
l hope you're not letting a desire
for payback cloud your judgment.

92
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:34,820
Sir, this has nothing to do with payback.

93
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:39,070
This is simply the best way
to nail these guys, period.

94
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:47,538
Elizabeth's father is one of my oldest friends.
l have known her since she was born.

95
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:52,336
lf anything happens to her,
l'm holding you personally responsible.

96
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:57,501
l understand, Senator,
and l promise you l will take care of her.

97
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,169
(tyres screech, car horn)

98
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:03,069
(phone rings)

99
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,197
CTU. Almeida.

100
00:10:10,252 --> 00:10:13,952
- Hi. l'd like to speak to Jack Bauer.
- He's not here. Can l take a message?

101
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:18,088
Listen, it's really important.
l need to speak to him now.

102
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:20,502
- Who is this?
- Kim, his daughter.

103
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:24,510
- Are you calling from the safe house?
- No. The safe house has been attacked.

104
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,893
The agents that were guarding us
are dead, and my mother is gone.

105
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:32,182
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
The agents are dead?

106
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:35,857
Yes. And l think they've kidnapped
my mother again.

107
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:38,945
- l need to speak to my father.
- He's not here, Kim.

108
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,281
- Where are you calling from?
- Um...

109
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,783
- Can l speak to Nina Myers?
- She's not here either.

110
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:49,121
- Where are you calling from?
- A payphone.

111
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:51,580
- Kim?
- Who did you say this was again?

112
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,744
Tony Almeida. l work for your father.

113
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:57,669
Tell me where you are.
l'll have somebody come get you.

114
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,715
(motorcycle passes)

115
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,796
Kim?

116
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:07,589
- That's what they said to my mother.
- That was Jamey Farrell. She was dirty.

117
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:10,851
That won't happen again.
Where are you? l'll have somebody...

118
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:14,638
Listen to me.
l need to speak to my father or Nina Myers.

119
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,149
He's not here, Kim.
Neither one of them are here.

120
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,272
Kim? Hello?

121
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:29,404
We got a problem. Jack's daughter says the
safe house has been hit. The agents are dead.

122
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:31,574
Call over there right now.

123
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:38,256
Nothing. lt's not even ringing.

124
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,958
Parker, get Biselli and head over
to the safe house on Pine Canyon.

125
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,757
Heads up - could be trouble.
Call me when you get there.

126
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:47,931
She also said that her mother
might have been recaptured.

127
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:49,843
- How'd Kim get out?
- She didn't say.

128
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:52,307
She just said she was calling on a payphone.

129
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:55,847
Access the phone company's computer
for all recent payphone calls

130
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:59,061
- within five miles of the safe house.
- All right.

131
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:03,102
- Are you gonna call Jack or you want me to?
- Not yet.

132
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:05,903
- lt's his wife and kid.
- That's exactly why.

133
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:09,278
He'll get emotional and distracted,
put Elizabeth in jeopardy.

134
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,416
She's going in with Drazen in 15 minutes.
We need to keep Jack focused.

135
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,956
- Then when do we tell him?
- We don't. l do.

136
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:19,994
When the situation's under control,
and not until. Clear?

137
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:24,377
- Thanks.
- (radio) Standing by.

138
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:26,047
Copy. He's on his way down.

139
00:12:26,138 --> 00:12:27,929
- Are you finished?
- Ready in ten.

140
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:32,344
- How's Elizabeth doing?
- She says she's OK, but, Jack, l don't know.

141
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:35,721
- Sure we're doing the right thing?
- lf she can plant the device,

142
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:38,139
it'll lead us to everything else. Yes, we are.

143
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,902
- lf she can't?
- We'll arrest him, try and turn him.

144
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:43,144
He can't touch her. We can protect her.

145
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:46,239
- l hope so.
- Stay focused and we can.

146
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:48,364
- Hey!
- What?

147
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,528
Are you all right?

148
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,990
l'm sorry.

149
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:04,498
l just can't stop worrying about Teri and Kim.
When l think what they've been through...

150
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:09,967
- My little girl thought she was gonna die.
- Hey, Jack. We're gonna get them, OK?

151
00:13:10,057 --> 00:13:14,719
Look, if it's any help, from what l could tell,
Teri and Kim seemed all right.

152
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,685
- Really?
- Yeah.

153
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:21,775
- What did the doctor say?
- Just some bruises. That's it.

154
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,522
OK. Thanks.

155
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:26,689
- OK?
- Yeah.

156
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,735
- Nina?
- Yeah?

157
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:34,865
You said that Paulson
was gonna finish the debrief?

158
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:38,076
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you stay and finish it?

159
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,920
l thought you wanted me back
as soon as they were safe.

160
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:43,412
No, l specifically asked you
to stay with them...

161
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:46,627
- Hey, Nina!
- Yeah, Mike, just a minute.

162
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:51,179
- Go back. l will be there in a minute.
- Yeah?

163
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,855
(phone rings)

164
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,449
l told you to take it off the hook!

165
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,878
- Yeah?
- Rick, it's me.

166
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,295
Kim, l told you you can't keep calling here.

167
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:37,632
Look, the safe house was bad. The agents
are dead and my mother is kidnapped again.

168
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:40,598
l know they're after me. You need to help me.

169
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:43,061
- Listen, l'm coming to your place.
- No!

170
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,815
You're the only person who knows
the people that have my mother.

171
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:49,110
- l don't! l...
- Rick...

172
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:53,658
l can't go to the police. l don't trust them.
After today, l don't trust anyone.

173
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:58,951
But if you don't help me right now,
l will tell the police everything.

174
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:03,372
Now, what is your address?

175
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,924
1804 Glade, in Echo Park.

176
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:15,507
1804 Glade, in Echo Park.
OK, l'm gonna call a taxi right now.

177
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:20,177
l'm gonna meet you there
as soon as l can. Wait for me.

178
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,900
Who was that?

179
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,566
Another wrong number?

180
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:57,219
How's the election going?

181
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,683
- Exit polls look very good.
- That's great.

182
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,267
Dad, l'm sorry.

183
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:11,650
Sorry about what?

184
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:19,114
You weren't covering up Ferragamo's death
to protect your campaign.

185
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:21,572
You did it to protect me.

186
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,455
Where'd you hear that? Your mom?

187
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:29,538
No, not Mom.

188
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:38,385
(Carl) There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office

189
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:41,344
that leads directly to you.

190
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:44,886
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time.

191
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,100
But with a little help, they'll find it.

192
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:54,646
- So l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder?
- (Carl) Like l said, whatever it takes.

193
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,689
That's whyyour father backed off,
and that's whyyou'll back off.

194
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:11,206
Do you know how dangerous it was
to go see Carl wearing a wire?

195
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,999
Look, it doesn't matter. l got it.
Now you can take it to the police.

196
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,755
Give me the tape.

197
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,557
What are you gonna do with it?

198
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,681
Do you trust me, Keith?

199
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:03,469
lt's me. There's been a development.
Palmer is staying in Los Angeles after all.

200
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:09,229
- The Nash girl called you?
- Yes. l'm on my way to the hotel now.

201
00:18:09,314 --> 00:18:12,149
Did she say why
the senator changed his plans?

202
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:17,311
- No, he didn't tell her.
- Really? She's a highly placed aide.

203
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:22,364
Well, they've tightened security
since the attempt on his life at breakfast.

204
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:26,782
l wonder that she wants to see you again
so quickly. You were with her two hours ago.

205
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,032
You don't understand women, Andre.

206
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:34,001
l understand them well enough to know
that they can use as well as be used.

207
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:38,463
- Not this one.
- Palmer should have been killed hours ago.

208
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,718
We can't afford any more mistakes.
We're running out of time.

209
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:46,052
He's as good as dead already.
You have to trust me in this.

210
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,140
The Nash woman will tell me Palmer's
schedule. She doesn't suspect a thing.

211
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,306
Maybe not.

212
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:58,142
Just to be safe,
when you're finished... kill her.

213
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,079
Miss Nash, please follow me.

214
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,962
We've been planting fibre-optic cameras
here, there and all through here as well.

215
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:22,052
l'm not really sure what those are.

216
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:24,426
l'm sorry. Please, sit down.

217
00:19:28,852 --> 00:19:31,011
Fibre-optic cameras are tiny cameras.

218
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,556
They're almost impossible to see,
even if you know where to look.

219
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,897
So when you come into the room,
we'll have visual coverage of the entire suite.

220
00:19:38,987 --> 00:19:43,199
- And you'll be able to hear everything too?
- Yes, every word.

221
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,157
- You all right?
- Mm.

222
00:19:45,243 --> 00:19:48,529
OK, now, he's gonna
be here in a few minutes.

223
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,907
This is the tracking device
that we want you to plant on Alexis.

224
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,868
Once he leaves the hotel, we'll be able
to track every move that he makes

225
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,039
without exposing ourselves at all.

226
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,504
- Where do l put it?
- Preferably his wallet.

227
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:03,629
He'll have it on him at all times,
even if he changes clothes.

228
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,054
As soon as you plant this device,
l'll call you on your cellphone.

229
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,930
l will tell you the senator is waiting for you.
You make your excuses, and you get out.

230
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:17,730
- So l plant the tracker, the phone rings...
- And then you'll leave.

231
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,060
- OK.
- One more thing.

232
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:24,103
lf at any point you think he's suspicious
or you're uncomfortable in any way,

233
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:28,197
all you have to do is utter the words
''l hope l'm not getting a cold.''

234
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,956
- ''l hope l'm not getting a cold''?
- Yes.

235
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,989
Then l'll be in this room in a few seconds
with half a dozen other agents.

236
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,956
- But that would ruin the plan.
- That doesn't matter.

237
00:20:38,046 --> 00:20:43,467
Right now all we're concerned with
is your safety. Do you understand that?

238
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:44,832
l understand.

239
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,974
You don't have to do this.

240
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:57,392
lf you're uncomfortable in any way,
no one here will think any less of you.

241
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:59,356
l'm fine.

242
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:02,275
And thank you.

243
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:06,196
For giving me this chance to redeem myself.

244
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,874
You're going to be fine.

245
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:19,961
Let's go.

246
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,256
Mrs Bauer?

247
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:27,420
How good to see you.

248
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:33,884
- You know me?
- Of course. Will Dr Parslow be joining you?

249
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:36,053
Dr Parslow?

250
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:38,724
l'm sorry. What's your name?

251
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:42,228
Mrs Bauer, are you feeling all right?

252
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:44,608
Actually, no, l, uh...

253
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:49,398
l must have been in
an accident or something. l...

254
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:52,908
l seem to have lost my memory.

255
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:57,409
But l was driving by
and this place looked familiar, so...

256
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,826
You say my name is Bauer?

257
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,253
Yes. Does that sound familiar?

258
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:07,416
Yes, it does, but...

259
00:22:07,511 --> 00:22:11,888
- But this man you mentioned...
- Dr Parslow.

260
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:15,592
You two used to come in here
together quite often.

261
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,019
But... he's not my husband.

262
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:25,777
Well... he's a doctor, and he's a friend.
Maybe he can help.

263
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:31,780
l happen to know the hospital that
he works at. Shall l give him a call?

264
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:33,944
Yes, please.

265
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:43,829
We're set.

266
00:22:51,013 --> 00:22:53,717
- ls everything up and running?
- Yep.

267
00:22:56,393 --> 00:23:00,177
- How's Elizabeth?
- She's in her room, waiting for Alexis to call.

268
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:03,189
- She said she wanted to be alone.
- Understandable.

269
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:05,102
Yes.

270
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:29,465
- You wanna tell me what's going on?
- What do you mean?

271
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:34,178
You've been holding something back ever
since you got back from the safe house early.

272
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:36,672
This isn't the time. Let's not get distracted.

273
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:42,472
lf you don't start telling me what's going on,
l'm going to be distracted, so spit it out.

274
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,398
All right.

275
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,069
Teri knows about us.

276
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:55,990
She guessed it.
l don't know how she did, but she did.

277
00:23:56,078 --> 00:24:00,206
She asked me point-blank.
l couldn't deny it. She would have known.

278
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:07,080
Did you tell her that it was over?

279
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:09,461
Of course l did.

280
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:15,589
l think she was just shocked that it was me.

281
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:19,467
Someone she knows.

282
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:34,360
When Teri and l got back together...

283
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:39,953
l tried to talk to her about this, but...

284
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:44,201
she said she didn't wanna know,
so l just let it go.

285
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:48,455
Look, Jack. You asked me
to go to the safe house, so l did.

286
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:52,710
- l was just trying to help.
- l know, l know. This is my fault.

287
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:56,965
- This is all my fault.
- (Pierce, over radio) Agent Bauer, come in.

288
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:01,100
- Bauer.
- We're a go.

289
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:05,348
Drazenjust dropped offthe car with the valet.
Should be upstairs in two minutes.

290
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:11,442
Copy. All personnel in the lobby
and on the floors, we are a go. We're a go.

291
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,664
He's in the room.

292
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:34,125
(Pierce) Copy that.
Advise when you are green to go.

293
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:41,594
There's no wallet here.

294
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:47,887
Let Elizabeth Nash know that the wallet is
either in his pants, or the jacket on the bed.

295
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:49,773
Copy that, Jack.

296
00:25:59,242 --> 00:26:03,287
(Pierce) Send her up in one minute.
One minute.

297
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:01,967
Hi.

298
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:15,188
- So good to see you.
- Yeah.

299
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:27,038
l can't believe how much l've missed you.

300
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:29,198
l know. Me too.

301
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,535
Even though it's only been two hours.

302
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:35,705
lt seems like two years.

303
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,092
Are you OK?

304
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:46,050
l'm fine. Why?

305
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:49,475
- You seem a little... tense.
- No, not at all.

306
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:53,687
Well... maybe a little.

307
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:59,774
The polls back east close in less than an hour
and we're alljust on pins and needles.

308
00:27:59,863 --> 00:28:02,152
Mm...

309
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:08,652
Well, you must have some idea
about the outcome. Don't you take, uh...

310
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:10,787
- Exit polls.
- Yes.

311
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,950
But they're not official.

312
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,587
What can we do

313
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:22,750
to help you... relax?

314
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:29,013
Well, it's a little early, but...
a vodka might be nice.

315
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:33,645
Nothing else?

316
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:36,641
lfyou insist.

317
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,633
- You feeling any better?
- Much.

318
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:14,561
You still don't seem like yourself.

319
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:19,024
l'll feel better after l've splashed
some water on my face.

320
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:31,828
She's going for the jacket. l want SWAT
personnel ready at the door. Quietly.

321
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:35,076
She's got the wallet.

322
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:42,085
Oh, God, Jack, she's dropped it.

323
00:29:49,514 --> 00:29:54,093
Come on. Come on, Elizabeth. You can do it.

324
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,687
- To the future.
- She's put it in her coat.

325
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:06,941
SWAT team at the door, stand down.
Stand down at the door.

326
00:30:17,626 --> 00:30:22,039
l'm sorry that this campaign
is giving you so much stress.

327
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,167
Goes with the territory.

328
00:30:26,718 --> 00:30:32,424
Maybe when the election is over,
the two of us can go somewhere together.

329
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:37,306
- Like where?
- lt doesn't matter to me.

330
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:41,932
As long as we're together.

331
00:30:44,528 --> 00:30:45,987
So...

332
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:49,522
who do l have to thank
for keeping you in town?

333
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:53,116
- He's gonna feel the wallet.
- Just give her a second.

334
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:55,197
She's all right.

335
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:59,332
What made the senator
decide to change his plans?

336
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:01,494
l don't know.

337
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:05,961
ls he gonna stay in town for long?

338
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:08,584
lt's hard to say.

339
00:31:10,053 --> 00:31:13,718
What about his... victory speech?

340
00:31:14,433 --> 00:31:17,387
Will he be delivering it here at the hotel?

341
00:31:17,477 --> 00:31:21,427
Why are you so interested in
the campaign all of a sudden?

342
00:31:21,523 --> 00:31:24,228
l have no interest in the campaign.

343
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:28,316
My interest is in you.

344
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:32,365
And l know that you go wherever he goes.

345
00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:35,617
Well, l don't know where that is yet.

346
00:31:35,704 --> 00:31:39,571
Well, then l won't let you out of my sight.

347
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:43,826
l must say, l do find it a little strange
that the senator wouldn't

348
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,957
include someone
as smart and capable as you

349
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:51,046
- in his inner circle.
- How would you know how smart l am?

350
00:31:51,136 --> 00:31:55,465
We've spent maybe 15 hours together,
and most of that has been in bed.

351
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:58,091
That wasn't smart.

352
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:04,556
Was that... a complaint or a compliment?

353
00:32:08,987 --> 00:32:11,359
Both, l think.

354
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:19,744
l just realised that l haven't eaten all day,

355
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:25,123
which may explain why
l'm in such a foul mood.

356
00:32:26,922 --> 00:32:29,923
Do you think we could order something up?

357
00:32:30,008 --> 00:32:32,380
What are you hungry for?

358
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:34,545
Where's the menu?

359
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:42,806
l was hoping you would be
hungry for something...

360
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:45,980
- There you go. Good girl.
- ..other than food.

361
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,829
- lt's in the jacket.
- She made the plant.

362
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:02,741
Clear the hallway. Copy. Clear the hallway.

363
00:33:11,466 --> 00:33:14,384
l know this might seem a little soon...

364
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:25,018
l've fallen in love with you.

365
00:33:30,402 --> 00:33:34,020
- The hallway's clear.
- Copy. l'm making the call.

366
00:33:41,663 --> 00:33:44,450
l thought that all women
can sense these things.

367
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:49,003
(phone rings)

368
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:56,298
Pick up the phone!

369
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:01,172
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- lt's just someone from the campaign.

370
00:34:01,266 --> 00:34:04,931
- No, it could be important.
- They can call back.

371
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,531
Say it again, Alexis.

372
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:21,065
- She hung up on me!
- Say thatyou love me.

373
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:23,569
- What is she doing?
- She's baiting him.

374
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,365
l love you.

375
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,750
And if l'm not very much mistaken,

376
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:35,715
- it seems you are falling in love with me too.
- (phone rings)

377
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:43,546
- l got her voicemail.
- Wouldyou order me a hamburger?

378
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:47,976
Ofcourse.

379
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:53,473
- What is she doing?
- l don't know.

380
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:57,143
Why did she take off her jacket?

381
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:08,541
What is going on here?
She has no intention of leaving that room.

382
00:35:10,794 --> 00:35:15,123
- Room service. How may l help you?
- Hello? A hamburger, please.

383
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:18,880
- All right. Everything on that?
- Yes, everything.

384
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:21,258
- We'll send it right up.
- OK.

385
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,257
What's that in her hand?

386
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:32,474
So, now... is there anything else?

387
00:35:34,192 --> 00:35:35,307
Yes.

388
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:38,319
- Oh, my God. She's got a knife!
- SWAT team, hit the room.

389
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:40,481
Hit the room now!

390
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:44,197
Son of a bitch!

391
00:35:49,124 --> 00:35:51,366
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

392
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,327
Hold your fire! Get me
some towels from the bathroom!

393
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:00,296
Nina, call in a medevac. We're losing him!

394
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:03,671
We cannot let him die! Dammit!

395
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:35,502
- Just a minute.
- (cab driver) Yeah, sure.

396
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,721
( ''Cataract'' by the Trephines)

397
00:37:09,454 --> 00:37:11,412
Um... l'm looking for Rick.

398
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,788
- Who are you?
- A friend.

399
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:19,287
Are you the one that keeps calling?

400
00:37:19,381 --> 00:37:22,750
- He said that l could come over.
- Not to me, he didn't.

401
00:37:24,303 --> 00:37:28,514
- Um... maybe you should ask him, then...
- l was about to tell you.

402
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:31,434
l just didn't think she'd get here so fast.

403
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:33,843
What's going on, Rick?

404
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:36,393
l'll explain everything.

405
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:40,265
- l'm listening.
- First let her come in.

406
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:43,229
lt's OK.

407
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:47,782
What does she want?

408
00:37:48,577 --> 00:37:52,325
Something got screwed up with Dan
last night. Big surprise, right?

409
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:56,625
That's why my arm was all messed up.
The guys Dan was with shot me and...

410
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,415
You said you cut your arm on a fence.

411
00:38:03,175 --> 00:38:08,252
Um... these people Dan knows,
l need to find them.

412
00:38:08,347 --> 00:38:12,510
And l was hoping that l could go in his room
and find something to lead me to them.

413
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:16,895
- A phone number, an address...
- So you wanna look through Dan's room?

414
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,225
Yeah.

415
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:21,438
(car horn)

416
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:27,025
l was wondering if l could
borrow some money for the cab.

417
00:39:00,691 --> 00:39:02,185
Teri.

418
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:05,816
You all right?

419
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:12,777
You don't remember me?

420
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:21,451
- Phil?
- Yes.

421
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:25,164
Are you my doctor?

422
00:39:25,257 --> 00:39:27,629
No, not exactly.

423
00:39:27,718 --> 00:39:31,051
Henry, thanks for calling.
Has she had anything to eat or drink?

424
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:34,055
l offered, but she didn't want anything.

425
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:39,512
No, it's...

426
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:43,097
Unless you want some water?

427
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:45,480
- Sure.
- OK. Some water.

428
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:51,153
All right, listen. We're gonna
figure out what this is all about.

429
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:56,152
We're gonna get you well again.
Do you understand? lt's gonna be fine.

430
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:58,998
Everything's gonna be fine.

431
00:40:03,086 --> 00:40:06,171
What do you want me to say?
We misjudged her emotional state.

432
00:40:06,256 --> 00:40:09,957
- No, we didn't. You did.
- lt was an unexpected outcome for everyone.

433
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:13,302
- lt's what l said it would be. lt was a bad idea.
- Fine. Maybe.

434
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:17,635
- Now we need to figure out our next move.
- What is that? What's the status on Alexis?

435
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:22,602
He has a fifty-fifty shot, but even if he comes
through, we don't know how long till he talks.

436
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:26,058
Did you find anything in the room?
Any phone numbers? Documents?

437
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:28,856
- No, nothing yet.
- What do l tell District?

438
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:33,358
Whatever you have to. Just keep them off
my back. l need time before l fill out reports.

439
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,992
- (Palmer) Let me in!
- Hold on.

440
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:37,912
- Where's Elizabeth? There was a stabbing?
- She's fine.

441
00:40:37,996 --> 00:40:41,033
- Where is she?
- She's across the hall. She's in custody.

442
00:40:41,124 --> 00:40:43,580
- What?! Why?
- She stabbed Drazen.

443
00:40:43,669 --> 00:40:46,835
- She was defending herself.
- No, that's not how it went down.

444
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:51,916
- She broke from the plan. She attacked him.
- l should never have let her do it!

445
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,382
- l gotta call you back.
- What's going on there?

446
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:57,044
- Senator!
- Let me in.

447
00:40:58,183 --> 00:41:01,517
- Senator...
- Say nothing until you speak to a lawyer.

448
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:05,648
- l'm sorry. l don't know what happened.
- lt's all right. We'll work this out.

449
00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:08,686
- Senator, please let us handle this.
- (phone rings)

450
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:11,315
l let you do that before,
and look where we are!

451
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:13,528
You are not helping matters right now.

452
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:17,198
- Jack!
- Excuse me for one second.

453
00:41:17,286 --> 00:41:21,034
- What?
- lt's Alexis's phone. What do we do?

454
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:33,672
We gotta take a chance.

455
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:38,512
- Yeah?
- (man) Do you have the money?

456
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,635
- Yeah.
- OK. We'll meet in 45 minutes.

457
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:43,600
- Where?
- l already told you!

458
00:41:45,939 --> 00:41:48,015
At Connie's. Downtown.

459
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:53,441
- How will l recognise you?
- l'll wear a red baseball cap.
