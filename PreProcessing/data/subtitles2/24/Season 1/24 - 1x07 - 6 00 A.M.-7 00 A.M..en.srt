1
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:22,286
You're seeing the senator in an hour.
Get going, or you'll hit traffic.

2
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,409
l'm on my way.

3
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,570
(Gaines) Eyes straight ahead, Jack.

4
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,738
Let the cops go.

5
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,379
lt's a green light, Jack.

6
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,049
Make a right.

7
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:32,105
l left something foryou underyour visor.

8
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:39,066
What do you want me to do with this?

9
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,777
l'll tell you when you get to your office.

10
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:54,912
You pull something off the key card?

11
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:57,922
- l may be close to finding your assassin.
- You got a name?

12
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:03,631
Almost. This is a scrambled medical file
listing a series of plastic surgeries.

13
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:06,509
The shooter's probably
trying to hide his identity.

14
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,722
Or assume someone else's.

15
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,974
- To get close to Palmer.
- Mm-hm. Call me when you get a name.

16
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:16,392
Right.

17
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,994
Pull over.

18
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:35,913
- Keith!
- Let my man bring him in.

19
00:04:36,004 --> 00:04:36,620
No.

20
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:39,999
- Senator, there's a threat on your life.
- Call your man off.

21
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:42,250
Sir! All right, Jimmy, stand down.

22
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,509
- Keith! Hold up.
- Go away.

23
00:04:44,596 --> 00:04:47,846
- l need to talk to you.
- Mom said you're doin' all the talkin'.

24
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:50,850
At the breakfast
l'm gonna tell our side of the story.

25
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:51,849
Our side?

26
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:55,981
Before Maureen Kingsley can put it out,
spin it the wrong way.

27
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,818
lt won't matter how the story comes out.

28
00:04:59,903 --> 00:05:05,988
Everyone will still think l went to kill Gibson.
Who's gonna believe it was an accident?

29
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,483
l believe you, son, if you say so.

30
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:15,918
Look, when your mother and l
go to this breakfast in an hour,

31
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:18,576
- we want you and Nicole to come with us.
- Why?

32
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:22,504
So you can save your campaign
by sacrificing me to CNN?

33
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:25,961
So l can stand by you, as your father.

34
00:05:28,556 --> 00:05:31,226
lt's a little late for that.

35
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:35,722
- You never gave me a chance to help you.
- How could l? You weren't there!

36
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:42,978
You... you can tell yourself
whatever you want,

37
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:46,440
but your career always came first.

38
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:53,908
For you to expect me to stand up in front of
everyone now and act like we're this family...

39
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,868
We are a family, Keith.

40
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:09,255
Keith!

41
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,859
You missed a spot, right here on your neck.

42
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,368
Rick, help me get out of here.

43
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:38,660
How? This place is like a prison.

44
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:42,753
People break out of prison all the time.

45
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,087
Look, Gaines said he'd let me go
after l'd buried Dan.

46
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:54,516
Now, once l'm out of here,
l'll call your dad and tell him where you are.

47
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:57,602
Great plan, except you're not gonna get out.

48
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:00,807
- Gaines won't let you go.
- He's got no reason to stop me.

49
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:03,900
- He doesn't need me any more.
- Exactly.

50
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:33,510
- What do you want me to do here?
- Replace the key card we gave you

51
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:36,718
with the one your people
are trying to decrypt.

52
00:07:37,143 --> 00:07:40,559
- Because we're getting too close?
- Just do it, Jack.

53
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:47,776
(Gaines) Remember, Jack,
l can hear everything.

54
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:56,155
l've been trying to reach you.
What is going on?

55
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:59,781
- My cellphone battery died.
- What happened at the hospital?

56
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:04,038
- Did you find Kim?
- Everything's fine. She was just at a party.

57
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:07,414
- That's good. Did Teri give you my message?
- No.

58
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:11,457
We lD'd the corpse you brought in.
His name is Alan York.

59
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,008
- What?
- He's an accountant from the valley.

60
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:17,470
We still don't know
how he's connected to this.

61
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,679
But we did have a breakthrough
in the key card.

62
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,056
Give me one minute.

63
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:31,862
lf Alan York is dead,
who is the man with my wife?

64
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:35,444
He's not an accountant from the valley,
that's for sure.

65
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:39,153
lf you harm my daughter or my wife,
l will kill you, you son of a bitch.

66
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:40,991
(gunshot)

67
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:44,831
Oh, my God! What have you done?
What have you done?!

68
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:51,962
Everything's fine, Jack. But that will be
the last sound your wife and daughter hear

69
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:56,096
unless you get hold of yourself
and you do as you're told.

70
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:59,347
- l'll do what you want.
- That's the spirit.

71
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:04,934
Now, the key card. l wantyou to replace it
with the one you took from the car.

72
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:09,522
- That won't be easy.
- Well, l'm sure you'll find a way.

73
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:11,687
Not without attracting attention.

74
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,650
That would be unacceptable.
You implicate yourself,

75
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:18,027
you cease to be useful
and so does your family.

76
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:21,619
As l said, Jack, find a way.

77
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,661
- Fine.
- OK.

78
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:37,254
(ringing tone)

79
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:42,267
The cellular customeryou are trying to reach
is currently out ofrange.

80
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:44,925
Please leave a message at the tone.

81
00:09:45,021 --> 00:09:49,399
Kevin. Bauer's wife knows
you're not Alan York. Be careful.

82
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:58,401
- You OK?
- l feel a little woozy.

83
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:01,447
We're almost there.
Janet said the party was up this hill.

84
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:05,488
- l'm sorry, but l think l'm gonna be sick.
- Try and take deep breaths.

85
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:08,335
Would you just pull over and stop the car?

86
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:36,066
You have one new message.

87
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:41,615
(Gaines) ..Bauer's wife... notAlan York.
Be careful.

88
00:11:02,098 --> 00:11:04,174
Teri?

89
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,638
Teri?

90
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:15,185
Teri!

91
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:18,689
Dammit.

92
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,122
Come on.

93
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:01,958
Oh, dammit.

94
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:18,692
Dan's buried.

95
00:13:18,777 --> 00:13:20,853
Oh, that's good.

96
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:28,987
You said you'd pay me
when we got back here.

97
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,652
Yeah, l know what l said.

98
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:34,784
Well, if it's a problem, pay me whenever.

99
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:37,332
Oh, that's very kind of you, Rick.

100
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,584
But l should probably go,
get out of everyone's way.

101
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:46,420
- l didn't realise you were in anyone's way.
- Well, l'm not, it's just...

102
00:13:46,513 --> 00:13:51,258
l did everything you wanted me to do,
so there's no reason for me to be here.

103
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:55,053
Tell you what.

104
00:13:55,146 --> 00:14:00,188
l've got a couple more things for you to do,
and then we can talk about when you can go.

105
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,211
This is taking too long, Jack.

106
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:31,432
l can't just switch the cards. lt'll attract
attention that'll be bad for us both.

107
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:34,470
You've got three minutes
to make this happen.

108
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,152
Fine, l'll do it.

109
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:47,613
l just need to make it look natural
when l go down to the work station.

110
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:55,904
Drop the pen and shred the paper.

111
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:03,542
That's right, Jack. l'm watching you.

112
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,505
Shred the note now oryour daughter dies.

113
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:21,022
What happened? l was telling you something
important and you just walk away.

114
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,515
l'm sorry. What did you wanna tell me?

115
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,109
- l think Milo's about to identify the shooter.
- That's great.

116
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:33,364
- We just need a few minutes with the card.
- (Gaines) Switch it, Jack. No more excuses.

117
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:35,244
Um...

118
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,122
Look, that's terrific. Uh...
Tell Milo to wait until l get down there.

119
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,997
- Stop working on the card?
- Just until l get there.

120
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,495
- Why?
- Because l asked you to!

121
00:15:47,592 --> 00:15:50,463
Look, l'm only gonna be a minute.

122
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:53,507
All right. But hurry. He's in section seven.

123
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,844
l'll be right down.

124
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:16,527
Palmer was absent from the rally, but he was
represented by his children, Nicole and Keith,

125
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:20,322
who've been instrumental in bringing
the younger voter to this election.

126
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:24,746
And Governor Hodges spent the morning
with heads ofCalifornia's labour unions,

127
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:28,373
discussing the importance
ofhis new healthcare proposal.

128
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:33,971
lt would ensure comprehensive coverage
ofmillions ofactive union members.

129
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:39,515
Also this morning
Governor Hodges will meet with...

130
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:43,053
Mom told you what's been going on?

131
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:46,140
Yeah.

132
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:54,529
ls Keith goin' to jail?

133
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:04,081
- Not if it happened the way he says it did.
- lt did.

134
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:06,541
Then he'll be fine.

135
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,593
ls he coming to the breakfast?

136
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:15,129
l hope so.

137
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,885
Listen, l know it's a lot to ask.

138
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:28,267
Don't worry, Dad.

139
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,227
l'll be there.

140
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,360
You're gonna get a lot of
hard questions thrown at you.

141
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:44,991
Not just about Keith.
They're gonna bring up the rape.

142
00:17:46,378 --> 00:17:48,287
l know.

143
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,712
You're gonna be OK.

144
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:57,463
l was hoping it was over.

145
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,680
Not talking about it all these years...

146
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:09,562
l started to let myself
believe it never happened.

147
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:16,197
You don't have to answer
anything you don't want to.

148
00:18:18,326 --> 00:18:21,576
Just say ''No comment''. Or refer them to me.

149
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,202
You're close to finding the shooter?

150
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,087
- Yeah.
- How much longer?

151
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:17,384
- Not long. l was waiting for you.
- Why would you be waiting for me?

152
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:21,633
- (Jack) Sorry.
- (Milo) lt's fine. l got it.

153
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:27,434
(Milo) Nina told me
to hold off till you got here.

154
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,727
She must've misunderstood me.

155
00:19:29,814 --> 00:19:31,854
That's my boy.

156
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:37,063
l just wasted ten minutes.
Get your signals straight.

157
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,231
Milo, just get me the name.

158
00:19:58,802 --> 00:20:00,878
Why are you doing this?

159
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:04,796
No, l already gave you that code.

160
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,093
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

161
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:11,637
l already computed this inverse,
and now it's not working.

162
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:16,227
- lt might be the sectors aren't linked.
- Oh, you think so, huh?

163
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,497
You were right.

164
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:35,536
- Nice one.
- Cool.

165
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:43,379
- Hey! Hey!
- Bad idea.

166
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:47,432
You flag down that car,
you bury your daughter.

167
00:20:47,517 --> 00:20:49,593
l'm your only hope of getting her back.

168
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:52,557
lf l don't deliver you in half an hour,
Kimberly's dead.

169
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:55,482
Where is she, you son of a bitch?

170
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,817
You gonna knock me out again?
l can't talk if l'm unconscious.

171
00:20:58,903 --> 00:21:02,070
- Where's Kimberly?
- Let me go and l'll take you to her.

172
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:05,608
You're not going anywhere.

173
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:09,996
Calling the cops would be just as bad.
Or are you calling Jack?

174
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:15,494
- l don't think that's gonna help, either.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut your mouth.

175
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:22,170
- Operations.
- Jack Bauer.

176
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,421
Clearance number Q22Q17. Pass me to
Senator Palmer's Secret Service liaison.

177
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:31,727
- Hold, please.
- What do you want me to tell them?

178
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:34,516
That you need priority clearance
at the breakfast.

179
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:37,560
- Frank Miller.
- Hey, Frank. lt's Jack Bauer over at CTU.

180
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:41,269
- l need priority clearance for the breakfast.
- We locked the list.

181
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:44,447
- Open it up.
- l can't without approval from Command.

182
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:48,482
Then call Command.
My clearance number is Q22Q17.

183
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:54,288
All right. You'll be checking in
with Agent Pierce when you arrive.

184
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,452
Thanks.

185
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:02,588
OK. Now call Division.
Post yourself out for the next hour.

186
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:08,346
Tell them you're going to the breakfast and
the investigation's making good progress.

187
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:16,138
(rattling)

188
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:23,354
Rick.

189
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:27,028
Well... you were right.

190
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:29,821
Gaines isn't lettin' me go yet.

191
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:34,033
- So what are you gonna do?
- l don't know.

192
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:38,086
Let's get outta here, Rick.

193
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:50,388
We're here.
There's a fence here which is over that way.

194
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:55,634
They got people everywhere, but l noticed
they're a little thin right around this area.

195
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:57,805
(man) Yo, Rick!

196
00:22:57,897 --> 00:22:59,974
Come here.

197
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:07,196
- Get off of me!
- What the hell are you doin'?

198
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:12,697
Give me five minutes, dude.
No one has to know.

199
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,751
- l'll give you four.
- (Kimberly) No, don't.

200
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:23,080
l'll be outside.

201
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,594
When l go back out,
l'll leave the door unlocked.

202
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:35,925
l'll see his back is turned so you can get out.

203
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:39,435
Go across the path behind the shed
and wait for me there.

204
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:41,598
Be careful.

205
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:45,311
- Sorry l hit you.
- No.

206
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,318
No. Not true.

207
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:55,571
Also not true.

208
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:59,038
What's wrong?

209
00:24:01,211 --> 00:24:03,998
This isn't the same key card
l was working from before.

210
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:07,090
- What makes you say that?
- lt's giving me different data.

211
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:11,588
- What?
- l was 20 per cent through this thing.

212
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,594
- Now it's saying it's 99 per cent complete.
- Well, isn't that good?

213
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:20,310
Yeah, if it were true, but l don't believe it.
This is a different key card.

214
00:24:20,397 --> 00:24:24,975
You've been sitting here this entire time.
Who could have switched it?

215
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:41,621
l need to post out until eight.

216
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,082
No, that won't be necessary.

217
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,958
Yes, l'm reachable. Thank you. Bye.

218
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:51,544
Nina, l can't talk right now.
There's an emergency down at Division.

219
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:54,258
- Where's the key card?
- What?

220
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:56,506
Careful, Jack.

221
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,562
Somebody replaced the key card
Walsh gave you with this one.

222
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:04,815
- Who?
- Milo thinks it was you.

223
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,490
- Jack?
- What are you talking about?

224
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:18,652
The only time Milo took his eyes
off the system was when you distracted him.

225
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:27,585
OK, you're right.
l just didn't wanna alarm anyone.

226
00:25:27,672 --> 00:25:31,884
Division got some information.
They didn't trust Milo with it.

227
00:25:31,968 --> 00:25:34,755
Where's the key card, Jack?

228
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:41,218
Take care of this, Jack.

229
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:46,147
Give it to me, Jack, or l'll call Division myself.

230
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:49,233
Fine. There's the key card.

231
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,938
What are you doing?

232
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:58,906
l'm sorry, Nina. l'm sorry.

233
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,283
But, believe me, l will kill you if l have to.

234
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,372
Now, no screaming.

235
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:11,293
Get her out of there now!

236
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:15,714
- Put this on.
- Jack, l don't understand.

237
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:17,962
- Why are you...?
- Nina, don't talk.

238
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:21,591
l will explain everything
as soon as we get out of here.

239
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,137
Nice and quiet.

240
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,809
Open the door.

241
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:05,262
- Where are you guys going?
- Division set up a meeting between agencies.

242
00:27:05,353 --> 00:27:07,844
Nina will brief you when she gets back.

243
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:39,169
Jack, where are you taking me?

244
00:27:39,262 --> 00:27:41,587
Just start the car and drive.

245
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,692
(phone rings)

246
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:10,455
- Hello?
- Jack.

247
00:28:10,543 --> 00:28:13,663
- Who?
- My husband, Jack Bauer. lt's urgent.

248
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:16,839
- This phone was lying on the ground.
- Where are you?

249
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:20,294
- St Mark's Hospital, the parking lot.
- Did anything happen there?

250
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:24,087
- Not that l saw. Shall l call the cops?
- No. No.

251
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:38,979
Oh, come on.

252
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,075
- CTU.
- Who is this?

253
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,446
- lt's Jamey. Who's this?
- lt's Teri Bauer. ls Jack there?

254
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:51,074
- He just left with Nina.
- ls he OK? He lost his cellphone.

255
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:55,414
- l thought something might have happened.
- He seemed fine. Can l help you, Teri?

256
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:58,210
Yeah. l'm in trouble
and so is my daughter Kim.

257
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,873
OK. Wait, wait. Slow down.
Tell me what's wrong.

258
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:03,175
- Kimberly's been kidnapped.
- My God.

259
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:05,884
- They tried to take me too.
- Did you call the police?

260
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:09,343
Jack says they can't be involved
or we'll risk Kimberly's life.

261
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:12,437
Tell me where you are
so l can send someone to pick you up.

262
00:29:12,522 --> 00:29:16,935
OK. l'm on Mulholland,
about a mile east of Coldwater.

263
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:19,103
- Jamey, tell them to hurry.
- OK.

264
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,698
(TV) OK, we're coming up on the hour.

265
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:30,487
lt's about the time the polls are about to open.
Not that far offnow.

266
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:32,456
l wanna remind everyone...

267
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:36,041
You look handsome. Presidential.

268
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:41,380
- Where's Keith?
- He's, uh... still in his room.

269
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:45,715
We don't have much time.

270
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:47,763
David.

271
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:54,228
What if Maureen could be persuaded
not to come forward with the story?

272
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,691
l already spoke to her. There's no way.

273
00:29:58,693 --> 00:30:00,769
There's always a way.

274
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:08,194
- What are you getting at?
- Maureen is just like everybody else.

275
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:13,826
She's got a past. What if there was something
in her past that she wanted to keep there?

276
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,708
- You mean blackmail?
- l don't care what you call it.

277
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:22,711
l'm just trying to save our son.
And your candidacy.

278
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,627
You've been talking to Carl.

279
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:29,212
You left me no choice.

280
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,679
No one has to know what happened.

281
00:30:31,768 --> 00:30:37,557
l'd know. We would know.
After everything we've been through tonight,

282
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:42,275
- how can you justify burying the truth?
- Because it's been buried for seven years.

283
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:47,949
And digging it up is not going to change
the fact that it's already happened.

284
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:50,444
You think about it.

285
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:27,027
Well, l can't say this gig
doesn't have its benefits.

286
00:31:27,115 --> 00:31:32,951
Dude, you're lucky. lf Gaines caught you
with her... Bang! You're dead.

287
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:37,577
Yeah, well, Gaines didn't
catch me, did he? Come on.

288
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:42,701
So, how long you been working with Gaines?

289
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:45,371
l don't know. On and off, a couple of months.

290
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:48,337
- ls he good for his word?
- What do you mean?

291
00:31:48,428 --> 00:31:51,215
ls he going to pay me, let me go,
if l do what he wants?

292
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:53,133
- Sure.
- l don't know.

293
00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:56,309
l get the feeling he doesn't like me.
Here. Here you go.

294
00:31:56,394 --> 00:32:01,555
Yeah. He gets uptight when he's on a job.
But he's really pretty chilly.

295
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,271
- You do the job, you'll be OK.
- Cool.

296
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:09,442
So how was she? Sweet?

297
00:32:09,532 --> 00:32:11,608
Yeah, she was OK.

298
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:18,117
Well, she's pretty hot.
Might wanna dip in myself.

299
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:23,202
What about the lecture you just gave me?
Aren't we supposed to be loading the trucks?

300
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:32,217
All right. Let's go.
Gaines really wants to get this done.

301
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,068
- (Rick) What are we loading?
- Everything. We're cleaning the place out.

302
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:53,110
Oh, man, my keys. l'll catch up with you.

303
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,451
- Did anyone see you?
- No. We're cool.

304
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:07,500
When we get to the fence
you'll see a cluster of trees.

305
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,879
That's where we wanna be. Ready?

306
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:12,293
Yeah. Let's go.

307
00:33:16,391 --> 00:33:19,262
(Teri) Hi. Hi.

308
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:21,519
- Mrs Bauer?
- Yes, hi. Teri.

309
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:24,178
- Charles McLemore, CTU.
- You guys got here fast.

310
00:33:24,274 --> 00:33:27,275
- They told us it was urgent.
- Someone's got my daughter.

311
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,275
This man knows where she is.
Has anyone been in touch with Jack yet?

312
00:33:31,364 --> 00:33:34,899
This guy's dangerous. What are you doing?

313
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,071
No! No!

314
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:40,830
- Let's hurry this up. We're way behind.
- No! No!

315
00:33:40,915 --> 00:33:43,371
Put her in the car.

316
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:54,169
Jamey.

317
00:33:57,057 --> 00:34:00,722
- What's up?
- Got a confirm on a jurisdiction meeting?

318
00:34:01,436 --> 00:34:03,725
l haven't checked. Why?

319
00:34:03,813 --> 00:34:07,348
Nina was supposed to brief me,
but she's not back yet or on her cell.

320
00:34:07,442 --> 00:34:10,313
Plus there's nothing on my screen about it.

321
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:15,654
lt's not coming up on mine either,
but that doesn't mean anything.

322
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:17,818
The lockdown made the system glitchy.

323
00:34:17,911 --> 00:34:20,449
That's probably why
the meeting's not posting.

324
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:23,456
lt's strange, the way she and Jack left.

325
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:29,379
- Something happened in his office.
- What were you doing? Spying on them?

326
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:32,216
Pull the security video from Jack's office.

327
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,507
l'm not authorised to do that.

328
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:38,923
l'm authorising you.
Jack and Nina aren't here. l got rank.

329
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:42,052
- Yeah, but...
- Give me ten minutes, starting at 6.30.

330
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:44,219
Send it to my screen.

331
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,446
- Where are we going?
- Turn right.

332
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:04,615
Turn right.

333
00:35:19,556 --> 00:35:24,799
All night you've been giving me this line that
somebody in the agency wants Palmer dead,

334
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:29,438
that your daughter's missing,
that no one can be trusted, not even me.

335
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:32,974
ls it all a lie, Jack, or just some of it?

336
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:38,609
What was on the key card
that you didn't want us to find?

337
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,318
Please, Nina, don't make this harder than it is.

338
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:48,792
You've got a gun on me, Jack.
l don't see how it gets much worse.

339
00:35:48,877 --> 00:35:53,005
Stay on Jefferson.
ln about three miles you'll see a turn-off.

340
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:57,999
Keep going straight.

341
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,718
To think that l ever trusted you, Jack.

342
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:05,633
- That l defended you.
- Watch out!

343
00:36:09,189 --> 00:36:11,561
Careful, Jack.

344
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,476
l need you alive.

345
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,106
Come on. Let's go.

346
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:51,017
(Jack) Stop the car.

347
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:54,142
What is this place, Jack?
What are we doing here?

348
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:56,606
- Somebody followed us.
- l know.

349
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:59,268
- Who are they?
- What do you want me to do here?

350
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:02,199
- What?
- Take her out and shoot her.

351
00:37:02,284 --> 00:37:05,487
- No.
- Your choice, Jack. Nina or your daughter.

352
00:37:06,538 --> 00:37:09,622
Jack, l don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

353
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,996
Get out of the car.

354
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:14,495
Get out of the car!

355
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:24,047
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

356
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:25,930
- Jack, what...?
- l'm sorry, Nina.

357
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:28,388
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

358
00:37:28,476 --> 00:37:33,304
- Ow! You're gonna kill me right here?
- l have no choice. They have Kim and Teri.

359
00:37:33,398 --> 00:37:36,315
How do you know they won't kill them
even if you do this?

360
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,643
- l can't take that chance.
- What about me?

361
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:42,485
Enough chitchat. Just do it.
Kimberly's dead if you don't do it!

362
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,981
- Forgive me.
- You think l'm messing with you?

363
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:47,283
- Turn around. Turn around!
- No. No.

364
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,659
- lf you do it, do it to my face.
- Shoot her!

365
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:52,867
- l won't make this easy for...
- (gunshots)

366
00:38:17,776 --> 00:38:19,852
Get back in the car, Jack.

367
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:18,627
- What do we do when we get out?
- We have to get to the road.

368
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:22,959
Highway 14's about a mile away,
and l know how to get there. You ready?

369
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:25,125
Yeah.

370
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,213
(woman screaming)

371
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,885
- What's the matter?
- (Teri) Oh, my God! Where's my daughter?

372
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:38,429
- (Teri) ls she here?
- That's my mom.

373
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:42,687
- We can't wait. We gotta go.
- l can't just leave her there.

374
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:46,063
Kimberly! ls my daughter here?

375
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:48,232
- What have you done with her?
- We gotta go!

376
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:50,317
l can't.

377
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:55,368
Get down. Kim, if we get out, we can help her.
We can call the police.

378
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:57,533
You go. Call my dad.

379
00:40:08,303 --> 00:40:10,295
(guard) Yeah, right there.

380
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:14,433
You just blew our only chance
to get outta here. Let's go.

381
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:16,759
Come on.

382
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:20,765
Come on.

383
00:40:31,701 --> 00:40:35,284
Stop it! Kimberly!

384
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:40,283
The polls are about to open in California,
which is a key state for the Palmer campaign.

385
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:43,995
Earlier polls show the senator
leading by a 15 per cent margin.

386
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:47,837
Assuming voting follows predictions,
the senator...

387
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,675
Jack, you son of a bitch.

388
00:41:09,406 --> 00:41:11,897
Why'd he give her a flak jacket?

389
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:29,025
