- Walsh isn't answering.
- As soon as you reach him, you find me.

2
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:24,786
- ls this the crew list from the 747?
- Yeah.

3
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,164
Want a maintenance history on the plane?

4
00:01:27,252 --> 00:01:30,871
- No. Let's assume this was not an accident.
- Why?

5
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,962
The flight originated out of Berlin, where
Walsh said the shooter was coming from.

6
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:37,460
l need a breakdown
of crew and passenger lists:

7
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:41,718
political affiliation, criminal record,
country of origin and residence.

8
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:43,932
- Jack.
- What?

9
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:48,312
- You wanna tell me what's goin' on tonight?
- What's going on?

10
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,527
Besides a 747 falling out of the sky and
a threat on a presidential candidate's life?

11
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:55,149
Yeah, that's right. Besides that.

12
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,450
George Mason comes in here,
disappears up in your office for half an hour,

13
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,777
then he limps out.

14
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,575
What's that all about?

15
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,704
Tell him, Jack.

16
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,838
- Fine. l will.
- Nina...

17
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:16,917
The agents Jack brought down on bribery
charges last year were friends of Mason.

18
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:22,253
Mason's looked for payback ever since.
Tonight he made accusations about Jack,

19
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,184
as well as some other people in this office.

20
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:32,355
Now, in case you haven't noticed, Jack
doesn't have a lot of tolerance for criticism.

21
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,601
l need that right away.

22
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:39,323
All right, look, l'll get you
that list within the hour.

23
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:41,484
Thank you.

24
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,244
That was quite a story.

25

(Mandy) Yes.

28
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:57,831
When you came to Jack's rescue
back there with your little performance,

29
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,329
it reminded me of something.

30
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,457
Yeah? What?

31
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:09,472
When we came into work together, about
a month ago, Lisa made some wisecrack.

32
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:16,272
You came up with this great BS story,
early breakfast meeting with District Three.

33
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,017
l was really impressed with
how convincing a liar you were.

34
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,314
What's your point, Tony?

35
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,703
l still wanna know what happened
with Jack and Mason.

36
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,238
- l already told you.
- And l don't believe you.

37
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,828
- Maybe l should ask Mason.
- A presidential candidate's life's at stake.

38
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,494
Maybe you should get back to work.

- No, let me call you back.

Yeah, it's just a simple key card. The kind
we use to get in and out of the building.

73
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,642
- l don't get it.
- Normally, the magnetic stripe

74
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,811
has just an access code on it,
but the stripe can hold a ton of data.

75

filled with references to Palmer.

- To smuggle confidential information.

l find out there's an agency
conspiracy to kill Palmer,

81
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:21,263
and the moment l realised what l'd stumbled
onto, l put my wife and kid on a plane.

the agency long enough to know what this is.

00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,869
was when l hit the game-winning three
against DePaul at the Final Four.

152
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,250
You just lost my vote, Senator.

153
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,090
Good night. Don't let this get to you.

154
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,054
- Thanks, honey.
- Good night.

155
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,491
We already know about that.
We got another way around security.

156
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:06,924
No. l don't want an explanation,
l just want him in place. Hold on.

157
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,131
Gaines. Yeah,
l'm finishing up with him now.

158
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,925
- All right. Get back to me.
- Mm-hm.

159
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,339
Hey, Mandy.

160
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,759
- ls everything put together there?
- Yeah.

161
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,928
l'll get back to you.

162
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,728
- You want somethin' to drink?
- Nuh-uh.

163
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,024
So, they'll be ready to go
by the time you get there. Leave now.

164
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,240
lt's all there.

165
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:50,540
- What are you doing this summer?
- Not interested.

166
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:56,554
- You haven't even heard what l have to offer.
- l don't care. l'm gonna disappear for a while.

167
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,930
So, when do l get the lD?

168
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,474
Soon.

169
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,784
- Myers.
- Nina, it's Jack.

170
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,790
- ls this a secure line?
- No. You want me to transfer it?

171
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,952
No time. l need an entry code.

172
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,544
- Entry code? Where are you?
- l had to take care of somethin'.

173
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:34,377
- Why didn't you check out with me?
- Nina, just give me the entry code, OK?

174
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,424
l'm at 2350 Dunlop Plaza, north garage.

175
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,520
Dunlop. Got it.

176
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,849
9-1-3-6-7-star.

177
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,730
- l'm in.
- Jack...

178
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,198
Jack?

179
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,788
- Richard, you OK?
- l'm fine.

180
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,999
- You said there were two shooters?
- At least.

181
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,923
- They look like they were ours?
- l couldn't tell.

182
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,459
- How high does this conspiracy go?
- l don't know yet, Jack.

183
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,305
- Did you see anyone downstairs?
- No one.

184
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,512
- ls this the only way out?
- This is it.

185
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,260
OK.

186
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,623
- l'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no. Come here.

187
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,535
Come here.

188
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,749
Wow.

189
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,082
You look just like Martin Belkin.

190
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,839
How'd they do that?

191
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,009
Plastic surgery.

192
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,803
That's amazing.

193
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,981
So, you're gonna kill David Palmer, huh?

194
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,143
- Hey, where's Jack?
- l don't know.

195
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,155
- l thought you were on the phone with him.
- No, that was Division.

196
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,655
Really?

197
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,657
This is a military organisation. There's
a chain of command. l'm your superior.

198
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,584
l tell you what l want
and you don't question it. Got it?

199
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,006
- All right. l can accept that.
- Good.

200
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,462
- There's somethin' you gotta deal with too.
- Yeah, what?

201
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,306
You can boss me around all you want here,

202
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,096
but when you and l punch out,

203
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,937
we're somethin' else... OK?

204
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,233
OK, Tony.

205
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,226
OK.

206
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,132
OK, we're clear.
Give me your tie. l wanna fix this.

207
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,020
(door slams)

208
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:13,320
- l should've been more careful.
- They could've followed Baylor.

209
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,867
This was my fault. l set it up wrong.

210
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,996
We were sitting ducks.

211
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,172
- l'm sorry to put you through this, Jack.
- Don't you ever say that to me.

212
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,222
You of all people. l owe you my life.

213
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:39,649
Across the mezzanine there's a corridor
that leads to a service exit.

214
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:44,395
We're gonna take that straight to the street.
My car is right there. You OK?

215
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,319
Good. Let's get outta here.

216
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,104
Take the wall.

217
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,041
Jack!

218
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,557
We gotta find out who sent these guys.

219
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,770
l'm gonna go lD 'em.

220
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,803
Hey.

221
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,760
OK.

222
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,534
What the hell is this supposed to be?

223
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,123
Give him the lD.

224
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:21,008
lt's OK. This is gonna work out better
for both of us. l figured it all out.

225
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:25,511
No, you don't figure anything out. This is
not your play. Now, where is the damn lD?

226
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:31,392
lt is my play, since l'm the only one
who knows where ''the damn lD'' is.

227
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,651
Go ahead.

228
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,358
l didn't find anything useful in the back.

229
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,695
Work schedule. Look.
Dan: Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.

230
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:23,649
- Great. ls there a contact number?
- No. And the office is locked.

231
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:27,789
- My husband might be able to help with this.
- How would he be able to do that?

232
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,622
- This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message.
- He turned his cellphone off.

233
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,201
How would your husband be able to help us?

234
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,508
He works for the government. He has
access to those things. Hang on a second.

235
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,755
(phone rings)

236
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,129
- CTU. Nina Myers.
- Hi. Nina, it's Teri Bauer.

237
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:47,350
- ls Jack there?
- Teri, Jack's not here.

238
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,352
He turned his phone off.
l wonder if you could help me.

239
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,015
Sure. What do you need?

240
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:56,317
l need the name and number of the owner
of a furniture store in the valley, Van Nuys.

241
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,359
Uh, Paladio's Furniture.

242
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,980
That's not really something l should do.
Can it wait till l talk to Jack?

243
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:07,697
No, not really. Um... Nina, it's Kim.
She took off with some kids l don't know.

244
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:11,489
One of the boys, Dan, works here.
l was hoping to contact the owner.

245
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:18,705
All right, give me a couple minutes. l'll see
what l can do. What's your cell number?

246
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,429
- Hey!
- Hey.

247
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:29,638
- There you are! You had quite a turnout.
- Oh, yeah, it was pretty insane.

248
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,392
l thought l heard the sound
of the young and the reckless generation.

249
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,603
- Dad, what are you doin' up?
- Hey, Dad.

250
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,936
- How you doin'?
- Good.

251
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,861
- Not enough hours in the day.
- How did it go?

252
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,353
Mom, it was huge.
l wish you could've been there.

253
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:46,695
- l wish l could've been there, too.
- l'm dead. l'll see you guys in the morning.

254
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:51,780
OK. Good night, sweetie. Get some good rest,
because they're gonna wake you up early.

255
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,744
- l will. Good night.
- l love you, honey.

256
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,455
(phone rings)

257
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,215
- So, how was it?
- Aw, Dad, it was unbelievable.

258
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,584
The chancellor introduces me,
and l'm totally killin'.

259
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:08,635
And just as l'm finishin', Green Day starts
to play ''Time of Your Life''. lt was huge!

260
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,800
Hold on.

261
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:16,476
- Carl.
- What's the problem?

262
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,981
- l got a call tonight from Maureen Kingsley.
- Yeah. So what?

263
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:23,484
- l don't wanna talk over the phone.
- OK, l'll come by in the morning.

264
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,692
No. We need to take care of this now.

265
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,654
Fine.

266
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:35,240
lt's hard to know with teenage girls
whether they're angry at you or just angry.

267
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,161
l know.

268
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:41,202
l did feel guilty, though,
when Jack and l separated.

269
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,374
Separated? l didn't know.

270
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,754
We're back together.

271
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:50,341
l admire that, tryin' to
work through the problems together.

272
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:54,382
My ex left and never looked back,
went home to Australia.

273
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,816
She hasn't spoken with Janet
or me for almost ten years.

274
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,023
l'm really sorry, Alan.

275
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,609
(phone rings)

276
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,742
- Hello.
- Teri, l got it.

277
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:19,202
Oh, great. Um, hang on a second.
All right, go ahead.

278
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,702
555-2937.

279
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,462
Nina, that's great. Thank you so much.
l really appreciate it.

280
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,627
OK. Bye.

281
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,467
Owner's name and phone number.

282
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,845
(man) Please leave a message.

283
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:39,147
ls anybody home? Mr Nowrasteh,
if you're there, please pick up.

284
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:42,565
My daughter is with one of the boys
who works at your store, Dan.

285
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:48,440
l need to talk to you. l'm in your store. Please
call me. My name is Teri and my number is...

286
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:52,482
Then he said ''Tell your dad to reserve
the Lincoln bedroom for us when we tour.''

287
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,950
l bet he did.

288
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,823
Hello, Mrs Palmer.
l'm Aaron Pierce, Secret Service.

289
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,502
- ls there a problem?
- l need to speak with the senator.

290
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,623
All right, l'll go get him for you.

291
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,344
David?

292
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,936
- Where is he, Patty?
- l don't know. l thought he was in there.

293
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:26,104
- Palmer has left. He is exposed. Find him.
- Would you tell me what's going on?

294
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,112
lf he left in one of the vehicles,
it'll show up on our GPS.

295
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:34,239
- Would you tell me what's going on?
- We're adding another layer of security.

296
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,036
Why?

297
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:41,745
We have a very high confidence that there
will be an attempt on his life sometime today.

298
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:12,990
- (woman) You know who l think that was?
- (man) l think it was the senator, wasn't it?

299
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:55,150
- Stay close, Richard!
- l'm right behind you.

300
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,788
l'm gonna get you outta here.

301
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,204
Jack.

302
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,125
Jack, listen to me.

303
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:19,308
Take this card and give it to Jamey.
Baylor said that we could trust her.

304
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,887
- Richard, don't move. You'll draw fire.
- Take the card. Give it to Jamey.

305
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,351
She'll match it to a computer.

306
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,773
Find the computer, you've got the dirty agent.

307
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,611
Richard!

308
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:43,556
Farrell.

309
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,967
- Jamey, it's me.
- What do you need?

310
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,181
Two agency personnel
were killed at 2350 Dunlop Plaza.

311
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:51,846
Phone Division and get
their bodies picked up.

312
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:54,267
- OK.
- That's not all.

313
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,481
You know the key cards we use
to get in and out of Division?

314
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:02,698
l've got one. l need you to pull some data off
of it. Do you have anything that can read it?

315
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,906
Yeah. But if you're in your car,
just send it to me now.

316
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,703
- How?
- Use your mobile scanner.

317
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,330
Switch it from optical to magnetic.

318
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,496
Hold on.

319
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:34,354
l'm sending this directly. Walsh said you can
trace the person whose computer encoded it.

320
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:38,275
- Yeah. l can match the electronic signature.
- Good. Do it.

321
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,495
- Come on.
- What are you gonna do to me?

322
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,583
Take you to the prom.

323
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,710
- Come on. Get out!
- lt's gonna be OK.

324
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:06,754
Just tell her what you want her to do,
and then she'll do it.

325
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,515
l said get out!

326
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:26,109
lt's time to call Mommy. You tell her that
you're OK, you're at a party, you're sorry,

327
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,406
- and you'll see her in a couple hours.
- Go to hell!

328
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,870
Gaines said not to hurt her, remember?

329
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:35,204
Yeah.

330
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,706
Fine.

331
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,562
- (Janet screams)
- Call your mom!

332
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,228
(phone rings)

333
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,445
- Hello?
- (sobs) Mom?

334
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,775
Kim, is that you?

335
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,945
- Hello?
- Mom...

336
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,166
- Honey, where are you?
- l'm at a party.

337
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:14,657
- What?
- l'm at a party.

338
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,710
- With Janet York, right?
- Yeah. How did you know that?

339
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:23,625
l'm standing here with her dad. Do you have
any idea how worried we were about you?

340
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:27,254
- Can l talk to Janet?
- Honey, Janet's dad wants to talk to her.

341
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,551
- She went for a walk. l'll tell her to call.
- She went for a walk.

342
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:35,221
Listen, we're OK
and l'm really sorry l did this. l mean it.

343
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,686
l'll be home as soon as l can get a ride.

344
00:38:37,775 --> 00:38:41,724
You're not waiting for a ride.
We'll come pick you up. Where are you?

345
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,569
- l don't even know how we got here.
- Kim?

346
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,323
Kim, honey, this is not the night
you wanna shine me on, l promise you.

347
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,905
- l gotta go.
- Kim!

348
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,321
Mom, l love you.

349
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,286
''l love you.''

350
00:38:59,088 --> 00:39:02,457
Nice touch. ln the van.

351
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,254
- What happened?
- l can't believe it.

352
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:10,260
She's at this party, she said
she was sorry and she'd be back.

353
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,591
- What about Janet?
- She's fine.

354
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:19,015
What's wrong?

355
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,642
She said ''l love you''.

356
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,977
She never says that.

357
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:35,035
(Jamey) l got a match on the card.
Do you need a confidence on this?

358
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:37,615
Yes. My eyes only. Send it.

359
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,847
- Thanks, Jamey.
- You got it.
