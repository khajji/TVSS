1
00:00:13,402 --> 00:00:18,942
Right now, terrorists are plotting to
assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,606
My teenage daughter is missing.

3
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:25,320
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:28,323
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer.

5
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:32,249
Today is going to be
the longest day ofmy life.

6
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:22,794
(reporter) lt is 7am on the West Coast and
the California primary is officially under way.

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,331
We're here outside the San Clarita
power plant in Los Angeles,

8
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:30,008
where Senator David Palmer will be
addressing local labour leaders

9
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:34,045
and members of the state energy council.
The senator pledged his support...

10
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,217
(phone rings)

11
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:41,186
- Yeah?
- Bauer's on his way. You in yet?

12
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,896
- Just about.
- Good.

13
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:50,107
(reporter) This promises to be a landmark
day, as it's expected that Senator Palmer

14
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:55,240
will get the delegates he needs to become the
firstAfrican-American presidential candidate

15
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,487
ofa major political party.

16
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:02,872
Ofthe eleven states looking for delegates
today, California is expected to be crucial.

17
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:08,715
And most ofthe polls say that
David Palmer will win by a decisive margin.

18
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:12,841
Have you decided?

19
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:22,762
l've rewritten the speech
l was gonna give this morning.

20
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:26,307
l'm gonna tell them about Keith.

21
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:31,863
- What are you gonna say?
- The truth.

22
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:36,658
That seven years ago he was
involved in an accidental death.

23
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:41,123
l need you to stand by me, Sherry.
lt's the only way to protect Keith.

24
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:54,137
l will never forgive you
if something bad happens to my son.

25
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,427
He's my son too.

26
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:00,299
And we'll get through this.

27
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:03,180
l hope so, David.

28
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,268
Hey, Mom.

29
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:13,316
Good morning, honey. Where's your sister?

30
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:16,408
- She changed her mind. She's not going.
- Really?

31
00:03:16,493 --> 00:03:18,866
She went to pick up
Suzy and Rachel instead.

32
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:23,077
Oh, that's right, the Brenner girls are flying in.

33
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:26,785
So, uh, what's gonna happen this morning?

34
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,121
We have to put this thing behind us, Keith.

35
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:33,841
Oh, by me being in prison and you in the
Oval Office? That how we put it behind us?

36
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:37,635
You're not going to prison.
You didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:42,681
- That's not how a jury will see it.
- Just have a little faith in the system.

38
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,391
What's this fairy tale that you're living in?

39
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:49,525
Look, the world's gonna believe that
l killed a white kid who raped my sister.

40
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,148
You think anyone will
believe it was an accident?

41
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,862
- Yes, l do.
- Then you're a fool.

42
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:56,617
- Keith, no...
- No, that's all right.

43
00:03:57,117 --> 00:04:01,364
You talk about fairy tales.
You think you can run from this?

44
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:03,993
You think it's gonna make things better?

45
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:09,706
l'm not running anywhere. l'd just rather not
spend my last hour of freedom with you.

46
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:15,790
Let's go and get this over with.

47
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:22,840
- Martin Belkin?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:26,885
Hi. l'm Jessica Abrams,
l work for Senator Palmer.

49
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,602
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you. Can l help you...?

50
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,977
- l got it.
- OK. Great. Follow me.

51
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,320
- ls the senator here yet?
- Not yet, but he is on his way.

52
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:39,028
- Great.
- l am a huge fan of your work.

53
00:04:39,118 --> 00:04:41,953
- Thank you.
- (guard) Right this way, please.

54
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,159
Hi. l'm going to be taking
some photographs of the senator.

55
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,712
l need a check on a Belkin. B-e-l-k-i-n.

56
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:01,260
First name Martin.

57
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:10,144
- (man) Clear on Belkin.
- All right, copy that. Thank you.

58
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,603
You can go in.

59
00:05:13,986 --> 00:05:16,477
(Teri whimpering)

60
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,795
Turn right at the light.

61
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:48,603
- (lra) You see the bus stop on your left?
- Yeah.

62
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:50,930
Pull over to it.

63
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,285
Hey, Jack.

64
00:06:14,672 --> 00:06:16,748
Howyou doing?

65
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:23,378
- Don't touch it until l tell you to. Now go.
- Not until l can talk to my wife and daughter.

66
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,217
Oh, you'll do this, because it really isn't an
inconvenience for me to hurt your daughter.

67
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,762
Or your wife, for that matter.
ln fact, here she is.

68
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:35,059
Would you like to speak to your husband?

69
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,151
Say anything you want.
Tell him you love him.

70
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,186
- Jack?
- Teri!

71
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:44,069
l don't know where l am.
l haven't seen Kimberly or...

72
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,363
(lra) You were saying, Jack?
You're not sure you want to do this?

73
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:54,621
That's what l thought. San Clarita power
station, 417 Ridgeway Road. Go there now.

74
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:09,470
This is temporary, Mrs Bauer. lf Jack follows
instructions you'll be free within the hour.

75
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,477
- Where's my daughter?
- She's here and she's safe.

76
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:15,428
Would you take me to her, please?

77
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,313
- Hey.
- What, Milo?

78
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:03,562
- What happened to Nina?
- She got called out.

79
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:07,404
So what do l do about this key card?
This was supposed to be important.

80
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:10,613
They brought me in on highest priority
and l'm sitting around.

81
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:14,998
l think Nina got some new intel that
pre-empts this. That's why she had to run out.

82
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:18,417
- So what should l do?
- Why don't you help me format some files?

83
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:23,082
They didn't bring me here
at five in the morning to format files!

84
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:57,453
Does Milo know he's working
on the wrong key card?

85
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,711
ls this gonna be a problem?

86
00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:18,891
Nina Myers is dead. Make up
a story for why she's not there.

87
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,743
- Mom!
- Kimberly!

88
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,501
(Kim sobbing)

89
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:54,004
lt's OK. lt's OK, honey.

90
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:27,622
- Where's Dad?
- l don't know.

91
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,052
- Does he know we're in trouble?
- Yeah, he does.

92
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:34,221
He's doing everything he can, baby.

93
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:39,182
- l'm sorry. l'm sorry. (sobs)
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it's not your fault.

94
00:10:40,562 --> 00:10:42,555
lt's not your fault, honey.

95
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:48,861
Why don't you tell me about these boys?

96
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,821
l met them through Janet, and...

97
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:59,861
she started dating this guy, Dan,
and his friend Rick came into town,

98
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:02,448
and we just hang out, and... oh, God.

99
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:08,213
- Have they kept you here the whole time?
- Yes.

100
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:17,212
Janet was hit by a car.

101
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:21,181
- l know.
- You do?

102
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,859
We are gonna get through this, l promise you.

103
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,222
Hello?

104
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,330
Come on, Jamey, pick up.

105
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,686
(phone rings)

106
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,900
- Almeida.
- Tony.

107
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,323
- Nina, where you been?
- l can't get into it.

108
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,494
Well, force yourself. Where are you?

109
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,905
Just east of downtown.

110
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:09,791
- What are you doing there?
- Tony, you have to listen to me carefully.

111
00:13:09,878 --> 00:13:13,045
No one at CTU can know l'm alive.

112
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:16,797
- Who would think you were dead?
- l can't tell you any more right now.

113
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:20,005
- Where's Jamey?
- She's working with Milo.

114
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:23,098
- Get her for me.
- No, not till you tell me what's going on.

115
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:24,927
Please, Tony, this is an order.

116
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:28,057
- l needyour help.
- All right.

117
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:40,821
Threatening emails, hate mail for Palmer -
this is a giant waste of time.

118
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:44,741
- When is Nina coming back?
- Probably not for a couple of hours.

119
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,286
What makes you say that?

120
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:50,957
- l just talked to her.
- When?

121
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:56,252
Couple of minutes ago. She's at Division.
lt's possible she'll be there all day.

122
00:13:58,135 --> 00:14:00,424
What do you need?

123
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:04,382
Never mind.

124
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:09,135
Look, if somebody doesn't tell me
what's going on, l'm going to Chapelle.

125
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:11,388
l told you, l have to speak to Jamey.

126
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:16,309
Yeah, and l just heard her tell Milo you were
at Division and you might be there all day.

127
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:18,147
- Oh, my God.
- What?

128
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:21,857
- Who did she hear that from?
- She said she just talked to you.

129
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:25,492
- Nina, what is going on?
- We can't trust Jamey.

130
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,953
- Jack said CTU had been infiltrated.
- Are you saying Jamey's a spy?

131
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:34,127
Why else would she lie?
She must think l'm dead.

132
00:14:34,213 --> 00:14:38,875
- Why would she think that?
- l'll explain later. You have to bring me in.

133
00:14:39,176 --> 00:14:41,085
OK. l'll come get you.

134
00:14:41,178 --> 00:14:44,049
No. Stay there. Act as ifeverything's all right.

135
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:48,725
Jack behaved very strangely when he was
at CTU. These people must be watching us.

136
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:51,847
l dunno, probably through
our own surveillance.

137
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:55,474
All right, look, l'll send a car.
What's your address?

138
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,209
- Good morning.
- Mrs Palmer.

139
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:24,675
How are you?

140
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:37,062
(Palmer) How you doing today?

141
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:03,755
(lra) Allyou have to do now,
Jack, is get through security.

142
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,853
Jack Bauer, CTU. l've been
cleared by Frank Simes.

143
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,651
All right, l'll need you to open the case.

144
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:27,817
Sure.

145
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:41,920
What do you need a laptop for?

146
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:47,168
Everything we compiled on Palmer
over the last eight hours is in there.

147
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:50,014
All right, you wanna lift that up, please?

148
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:01,975
Turn it on.

149
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,642
(lra) Just press any two buttons, Jack.

150
00:17:05,864 --> 00:17:07,738
(computer bleeps)

151
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,616
- All right, go ahead.
- Thank you.

152
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,337
Thank you. Where is Senator Palmer now?

153
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:28,503
- He's on his way up.
- Good.

154
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:34,550
Excuse me.

155
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,815
Jack Bauer?

156
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,401
Jessica Abrams?

157
00:17:44,486 --> 00:17:48,401
Yeah. Hey. What are you doing here?

158
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,990
- l'm working security.
- Wow. How many years has it been, huh?

159
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:56,075
- Since high school?
- Yeah. l'm sorry, l've got to get going.

160
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,323
Hey, are you still racing motorcycles?

161
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:01,667
- (lra) Keep moving, Jack.
- Not since my daughter was born.

162
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,549
Look, l'd like to catch up later.
l've just gotta go.

163
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,755
- Great, l'll be here.
- OK.

164
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:16,224
- (Jack) What do l do now?
- Hand the briefcase to one of our people.

165
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,883
- Who?
- l'll tell you when it's time.

166
00:18:19,271 --> 00:18:22,189
Go wait by the buffet table.

167
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:41,998
(TV) Now our election coverage
shifts to the polls.

168
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:45,170
Back east we've had some
interesting developments...

169
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,875
(applause)

170
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:27,328
- Senator, l'd like you to meet Martin Belkin.
- Senator.

171
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:31,586
Good you could make it, Martin.
Jessica says you're the best.

172
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:35,711
l look forward to working with you.

173
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:54,941
You're so tired.

174
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:28,725
Oh. Hi.

175
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,734
l brought you some breakfast.

176
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,614
- ls Kim OK?
- Who are you?

177
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:48,409
- Rick.
- You're the one who kidnapped my daughter.

178
00:20:48,504 --> 00:20:51,339
- l didn't know.
- How could you not know?

179
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:53,167
Hey! l tried to help her get out...

180
00:20:53,258 --> 00:20:56,425
Gaines wants to go over some stuff with us.

181
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:01,129
- What's goin' on here, Rick?
- Nothin'.

182
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,933
- Don't make friends.
- l wasn't.

183
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,642
- Good. They won't be around much longer.
- What?

184
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:09,807
Move it.

185
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:24,618
(lra) OK, time to move, Jack.
Let's head across the floor.

186
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,575
Excuse me.

187
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,169
Excuse me.

188
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:35,254
OK, Jack, head towards the south wall.

189
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,383
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Jess.

190
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,550
Hey, do you remember Tracy Zigler?

191
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,966
Yeah. Yeah, l just saw her last winter.

192
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,975
Well, we keep in touch,
and she said you and Teri got divorced.

193
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:54,231
- (lra) Get out ofthere, Jack.
- No, we... We just got separated.

194
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,242
Jared, take care of this.

195
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,785
Look, if you ever wanted to get in touch,
you can reach me at this number here...

196
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,293
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

197
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,454
- l am so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

198
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,255
- You sure?
- Yes.

199
00:22:23,515 --> 00:22:26,303
He's heading across now.

200
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,265
(lra) Take a left in front ofthe turbines, Jack.

201
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:40,944
Show him your lD.

202
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,907
Jack Bauer, CTU.

203
00:22:42,993 --> 00:22:45,069
That's my boy.

204
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,408
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

205
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,795
Go to the end.

206
00:23:05,057 --> 00:23:07,892
On your left is medical station three.

207
00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:20,979
- l'm here.
- That's where l wantyou. Go in and wait.

208
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:50,639
- Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- l'm OK.

209
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:54,643
You don't look OK.

210
00:23:59,028 --> 00:24:01,945
- ls it safe to come in here?
- Yeah, l looped the cameras.

211
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:04,107
They can't see us.

212
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:10,326
- Why is Jack doing all this?
- They've kidnapped his wife and daughter.

213
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:13,201
- How long have you known this?
- Not long.

214
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:16,827
- And you chose not to tell me?
- That's right. l was acting on orders.

215
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,040
- Screw orders!
- Shh. Tony, l'm sorry.

216
00:24:20,883 --> 00:24:24,003
- Where's Jamey?
- She's still working with Milo.

217
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,552
So what do you wanna do? Do you
wanna restrain her, call in Division?

218
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,680
No, we can't call anyone yet.

219
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:33,056
- We gotta do something.
- l know.

220
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:37,641
This thing must be about Palmer. They're
using Jack to, what, stop the investigation?

221
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,275
Maybe.

222
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,933
Hang on. We gotta do something.

223
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:49,407
- Are you sure this room is dark?
- Yeah, l checked the log. No active cameras.

224
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,947
We should call Secret Service.

225
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,623
lf we do, the people holding Teri and Kim
will think Jack gave the order.

226
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,625
l hate to say it, but it's not our problem.
We have one mandate - protect Palmer.

227
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:03,170
- We gotta make the call now.
- Wait!

228
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:06,126
Jack wouldn't put Palmer's life in danger.

229
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,841
Let's try to find out more
before we do anything.

230
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:12,382
Are you giving me an order
not to call Secret Service?

231
00:25:16,021 --> 00:25:18,097
No, you're right.

232
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:25,779
Hey, this is Tony. Get me
Agent Pierce's number, please.

233
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:27,490
(door opens)

234
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,421
Assemble it.

235
00:26:31,347 --> 00:26:34,182
You want my prints on this weapon.

236
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:40,847
Do you really think that anybody's
going to believe that l shot David Palmer?

237
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:59,455
You better put that away.
Somebody might get hurt.

238
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,565
(TV) We're watching Senator Palmer work the
room a little bit before he gets to the speech...

239
00:27:35,494 --> 00:27:37,783
(Tony) Milo, come here.

240
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:40,864
- You were right.
- About what?

241
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:44,460
The key card. lt was a forgery.
We found the original.

242
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:46,952
- Where?
- Jack's office.

243
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:49,336
- Why did he swap it out?
- Doesn't matter.

244
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:52,794
Look, l sent it down to Archiving
to make a backup of all the data.

245
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:56,172
Then it's going straight to you.
You'll have to work quickly.

246
00:27:56,265 --> 00:27:58,341
Just get it to me.

247
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:03,980
A forged key card. What's that about?

248
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:06,523
l have no idea.

249
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,702
She's squirming.

250
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:22,865
(phone rings)

251
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:28,003
- Almeida.
- This is Pierce from Secret Service.

252
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:32,038
Aaron, l calledyou because we have
new information you should know about.

253
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:36,672
- One of our agents, Jack Bauer, may be there.
- Yeah, he's here. l cleared him.

254
00:28:36,764 --> 00:28:40,263
Well, we learned that
he may have been compromised.

255
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:44,843
- He may not be acting to protect the senator.
- Are you saying he's a threat?

256
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,476
Yeah.

257
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:51,023
Take the appropriate actions.

258
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:53,187
She's on the move.

259
00:29:05,501 --> 00:29:08,502
OK, ladies' rest room. Second-to-last stall.

260
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:11,374
- These cameras are on a 20-second loop.
- Am l clear?

261
00:29:11,674 --> 00:29:13,797
No, not yet.

262
00:29:28,274 --> 00:29:29,732
Go. You got 20 seconds.

263
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:40,491
Get out. Now.

264
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,237
Get out!

265
00:29:44,581 --> 00:29:47,119
Get out! Out! Go!

266
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:04,559
l gotta keep you guys working. The fatter
your pay cheque, the more tax you can afford.

267
00:30:07,021 --> 00:30:09,428
Excuse me, guys.

268
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:12,394
- What's up?
- l just got a call from CTU.

269
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:14,810
- We need to get you out of here, sir.
- Why?

270
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,819
- There's a problem with one of their agents.
- What kind of problem?

271
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,695
He could be a threat to you.

272
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:25,035
lf he's one of ours, find him
and take care of this quietly.

273
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:27,280
We are trying, sir.

274
00:30:29,251 --> 00:30:33,083
l tell you what. l'll lose the
face time, but the speech stays.

275
00:30:33,172 --> 00:30:37,668
- There's something l have to say.
- With all due respect, it's a mistake, sir.

276
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,923
This information comes
directly from CTU headquarters.

277
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,094
l am sure your people will take care of us.

278
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:57,860
All right, everyone on the floor,
listen up. This is Pierce.

279
00:30:57,947 --> 00:31:02,858
Palmer has decided to proceed.
l repeat, Palmer will remain.

280
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:05,906
We need to locate and detain a suspect.

281
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:08,368
His name is Jack Bauer.

282
00:31:08,624 --> 00:31:12,918
Bauer's 5'11'', blond hair, 160 pounds.

283
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,960
He is wearing a dark...

284
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:18,498
brown jacket that may display CTU lD.

285
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:22,175
This is Hayes. Possible 20 on Bauer.
How would you like me to proceed?

286
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:25,299
- Hold your position. l'll be right there.
- Copy.

287
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:37,981
Hi, Jamey.

288
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:41,777
What's this all about?

289
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:45,199
- Why don't you tell us?
- l've no idea what you're talking about.

290
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:49,200
- Who were you going to contact?
- None of your business. lt was personal.

291
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,827
The same people who set me up to be killed?

292
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:55,831
- To be killed? What are you talking about?
- We don't have time for this.

293
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:59,835
Talk to us, Jamey. Who's got
Jack's wife and daughter?

294
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:02,962
- What are they making Jack do?
- l don't know!

295
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,341
Richard Walsh is dead. So is Scott Baylor.

296
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:11,770
You will be charged with murder and treason.
l suggest you tell me what's going on!

297
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:15,812
- They told me nobody would get hurt.
- Who are ''they''?

298
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,731
- l can't tell you.
- Telling us everything is the only way out!

299
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,896
You understand?

300
00:32:23,532 --> 00:32:28,408
l was just supposed to tap into the
surveillance. All the security cameras.

301
00:32:28,495 --> 00:32:31,200
Then they asked me
to start sending messages.

302
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:33,491
What messages?

303
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,660
What messages?!

304
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:40,707
Mostly about Jack.

305
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:47,838
Then about the key card. l didn't know this
was gonna happen. You have to believe that.

306
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,550
OK, fine. We do. But now you have to help us.

307
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:53,767
Who were you doing all this for?

308
00:32:55,898 --> 00:33:00,394
- No. l have to talk to someone first.
- What? No! There is no time, Jamey!

309
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:06,524
Palmer is exposed. Jack's family is in danger.
You have to start talking to us. Now!

310
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:14,119
All right, look, l'll make sure everything you
tell us goes into cutting you a deal, OK?

311
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,619
No, l'm not saying anything.
Not until l get agency counsel.

312
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:48,403
Sit.

313
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:54,577
(PA) As Mayor ofLos Angeles, l often get the
opportunity to meet truly remarkable people.

314
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:59,327
People that strive for the greater good,
that work to make our world a better place.

315
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,924
One ofthose people is here today, and
''remarkable'' only begins to describe him.

316
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:09,338
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president
ofthe United States, and my good friend,

317
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:11,303
David Palmer.

318
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,217
(cheering and applause)

319
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:37,406
l love you, Kimberly. You know that?

320
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,743
Yeah.

321
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:44,831
Good.

322
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:48,842
lt's important that you know that.

323
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,632
Mom, if you're feeling guilty
about our fight yesterday...

324
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,215
l'm over it. l just wanna get home.

325
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:01,019
That's not why l'm saying that.
lt's just... we're stuck in this awful place

326
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:04,226
and l just want you to know

powerful thing my love for you is.

family dies and we'll get Palmer anyway.
