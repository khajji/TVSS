1
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:18,566
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:21,121
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:21,213 --> 00:00:25,286
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:31,125
l'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day of my life.

5
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:38,205
You must talk to Victor Drazen when he calls.
Listen to his demands and cooperate.

6
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:40,723
Senator, please answer this phone.

7
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:44,405
- This is David Palmer.
- Hello, Senator Palmer.

8
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:46,487
Senator!

9
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:50,368
We did it, Father.
We did it.

10
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:55,809
The man that planned the explosion
needs to believe it was a success.

11
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:58,282
You want the world
to think that David is dead?

12
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:00,603
- Yes, ma'am.
- Absolutely not.

13
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,481
- David, what's this all about?
- His daughter is being held hostage.

14
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:06,882
l'll take care of the girl.
Then we can leave.

15
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:11,842
Do not do anything until we know
Jack Bauer is dead as well. Nothing.

16
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:14,970
l was calling to confirm your death,
but l see you've survived.

17
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,044
l have an offer to make you.

18
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,569
You've already killed Senator Palmer.
l'm the last person on your list.

19
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:25,747
- l'll make you a trade. Me for my daughter.
- Come to Port of Los Angeles. Dock 11A.

20
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,642
(Kim) Do you mind if l have some coffee?

21
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,452
(Andre) Stop right there, Kim! Don't move.

22
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:37,241
(speaks Serbian)

23
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,804
(phone rings)

24
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,210
(in Serbian)

25
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,244
(voices speaking Serbian)

26
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,684
(phone rings)

27
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:13,091
Maybe you're right.
Maybe she drowned.

28
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:17,925
lt does not matter, as long as
Bauer believes his daughter is here.

29
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,690
- (horn blares)
- Stop! Stop, please!

30
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:59,448
At this time, we do not have any information

31
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:04,151
as to the cause of the explosion
that killed Senator David Palmer.

32
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,867
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

33
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:12,351
Since no one has seen a body,
the media's circulating all kinds of rumours.

34
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:17,587
Look, l will tell them as soon as l have
confirmation that Bauer's daughter is safe.

35
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:20,312
And then what, David?
You're gonna play dead?

36
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,690
And l'm supposed to hide in here
and play the grieving widow?

37
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:27,006
Just how long do you think
we can keep that charade up?

38
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:30,503
- For as long as we have to.
- Well, that's crazy! lt's...

39
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:33,353
Mike, tell him how crazy it is.
He listens to you.

40
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:37,048
- Don't put me in the middle of it.
- lsn't that your job? To be in the middle?

41
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:41,062
For crying out loud, Mike.
lt's your career on the line too.

42
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:46,891
OK. You came clean on TV today.
You got lucky.

43
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:49,885
But it could just as easily
have gone the other way.

44
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:54,451
Testing the public's patience like that?
You won't be lucky again, David.

45
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,524
Listen to me.

46
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,388
Jack Bauer saved my life today.

47
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:03,182
- Not once, but twice.
- Yes, l realise that.

48
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:06,424
- And l am sympathetic to what he's going...
- l don't think you are.

49
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:10,301
- David, l am. Listen to me.
- No. l am going to respect his request.

50
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:14,149
And so are you.
You will not sacrifice his daughter.

51
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:36,187
Anything new?

52
00:05:36,273 --> 00:05:39,106
- l'm going over the intel from Langley.
- l mean about Jack.

53
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:42,230
- CTU, Almeida.
- l assume you still haven't heard from him?

54
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:43,985
- (Tony) You sure?
- No. Not yet.

55
00:05:44,073 --> 00:05:48,510
George? l got Highway Patrol on line seven.
They picked up a girl at Port of Los Angeles.

56
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:51,791
- Says she's Jack's daughter.
- Patch it through.

57
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:59,551
- This is Mason, CTU. Who am l speaking to?
- Sergeant Devlin, Highway Patrol.

58
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,387
- You have a young woman with you?
- She claims to be the daughter of an agent.

59
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,464
- Jack Bauer?
- That's right.

60
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:07,789
Can l speak with her, please?

61
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,704
- Hello?
- Kim, this is George Mason at CTU.

62
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,830
- How are you? OK?
- Yeah. You gotta tell my father l've escaped.

63
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:20,906
- He'll go back there and they'll kill him.
- Can you tell us where these people are?

64
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:23,188
The port. l... l don't know exactly.

65
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:26,146
- May l speak with the sergeant again?
- OK.

66
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:31,583
- Yeah. We picked her up near Dock 11 Alpha.
- Send two tactical teams, highest priority.

67
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:33,903
Have law enforcement
establish a perimeter.

68
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,632
- Where are you now?
- Just north of the harbour.

69
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,705
All right. Get Kim over here ASAP,
all right?

70
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:42,227
We gotta find Jack
before he walks into a trap.

71
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:43,905
We need to coordinate two...

72
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:42,104
(phone rings)

73
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,067
- Yeah?
- (Andre) What's taking so long?

74
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:54,270
- l just got here.
- Where exactly?

75
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:57,106
Don't worry, l'm close enough.
Where's my daughter?

76
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:59,866
- Right here.
- Put her on the phone.

77
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:03,992
Come to the parking lot of the freight office.
l'll come out with her.

78
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:07,065
- Let me speak to her first.
- There's been enough talking.

79
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,747
After what's happened,
you expect me to trust you?

80
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,872
You lied to us about Palmer being dead,
so don't talk to me about trust, all right?

81
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:17,628
Get down here now
or l'll kill her myself. Trust that.

82
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,342
l'm not gonna show myself
until l speak to my daughter first.

83
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:25,191
Don't test me.
Bauer!

84
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:33,022
- He's not coming.
- He's coming.

85
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:43,027
Nina, what's the ETA on the tac teams?

86
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,991
Five on the alpha, eight on the beta.

87
00:08:46,353 --> 00:08:48,867
- lt doesn't matter. Stay on it.
- (phone rings)

88
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,633
- Myers.
- (Jack) Nina, it's me.

89
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:56,227
- Where are you?
- Listen carefully.

90
00:08:56,313 --> 00:09:00,829
l've just confirmed that someone at CTU
is feeding the Drazens information.

91
00:09:00,913 --> 00:09:03,905
- Based on what?
- They know Palmer wasn't killed in the blast.

92
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:06,666
Who at CTU had clearance
for that kind of intel?

93
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:11,429
- Besides me, just Tony, Mason and Chapelle.
- One of those three is working for them.

94
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:14,073
You need to find out which one.

95
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,542
Jack, what are you doing?
Where are you?

96
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:19,352
Andre agreed to a trade.
Me for Kim.

97
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:25,145
- Are you gonna just walk right up to them?
- lf l can guarantee Kim's safety, yes.

98
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:28,464
Nina, there's a chance
l won't be able to see this thing through.

99
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:34,185
Until you find out who's giving the Drazens
information, don't trust anyone. l gotta go.

100
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:52,964
l don't think the situation
will require much spin,

101
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,284
as long as you do
what you've been doing all along.

102
00:09:56,373 --> 00:10:00,412
- Tell me again what l've been doing, Mike.
- Telling the truth.

103
00:10:00,493 --> 00:10:02,370
Oh, yeah.

104
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,682
And tearing my family apart in the process.

105
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,162
As hard as it's been for everyone,

106
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:14,485
l think this last day has been about
finding out who you really are.

107
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:17,564
And not just as a candidate.

108
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,484
(phone rings)

109
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:26,242
- Yeah?
- Mike, turn on the television.

110
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,409
- (sighs)
- What is it, Mike?

111
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,046
A reliable source from inside
Senator Palmer's campaign

112
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,762
confirmed just moments ago
that the senator was indeed unharmed

113
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:41,606
- by the blast reported here over an hour ago.
- Dammit!

114
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:45,686
What is still uncertain is why
the senator has not made a statement

115
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:47,923
- and how the rumour of his death...
- Sherry.

116
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:51,649
David. We have to deal with the press. David!

117
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,164
David!

118
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:57,771
- You couldn't wait to leak it to the press.
- David, l...

119
00:10:57,853 --> 00:11:02,449
- lt was you. What were you thinking?
- They already knew.

120
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,763
Dammit, Sherry!
The way you keep defying me!

121
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:08,562
- l'm not defying you! l am protecting you!
- Protecting me from what?

122
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,008
- Mike!
- Back off, David. l mean it.

123
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:12,526
- Get off me!
- l mean it!

124
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,331
- Get off me!
- Back off!

125
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:18,083
David, you have to talk to the press now.

126
00:11:18,613 --> 00:11:22,049
The longer you take to make a statement,
the more control you give up.

127
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:24,927
- Come on.
- Dammit, if that child dies...

128
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:53,564
(Nina dials phone)

129
00:11:57,453 --> 00:11:59,125
- Yes?
- lt's me.

130
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:01,283
- What is it?
- They found his daughter.

131
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:03,364
She'll be here within the hour.

132
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:05,728
(sighs)

133
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:07,929
- Does Bauer know?
- No. Not yet.

134
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:12,450
l'm the only one who's in contact with him.
l've been ordered to send in two teams.

135
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,001
- They're on their way.
- Right. Hold on.

136
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:19,291
They found the girl. Bauer doesn't know,
but the CTU people are on their way.

137
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:21,887
We have to get you out of here.

138
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:25,761
He won't come if we can't produce the girl.
He's not stupid.

139
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,242
We just have time
to get to international waters.

140
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,291
l can't risk you getting captured again.

141
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:33,609
Give me the phone.

142
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:38,447
Can you contact Bauer?

143
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,603
Yes.

144
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:46,407
Tell him his daughter's dead.
Her body was found floating in the harbour.

145
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,851
- You think he'll come after you?
- Yes.

146
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:52,728
You'll have to kill him.
No mistakes.

147
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,532
lf he finds out l've lied to him,
my cover will be blown.

148
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:58,805
Of course we will kill him.
That is the point.

149
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,206
He is coming.

150
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,962
- (phone rings)
- Andre?

151
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,045
No. lt's me.
l think you should come back to CTU.

152
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,728
l can't. l'm running out of time.
l'm going in to get Kim now.

153
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:18,692
- l don't know how to tell you this, Jack.
- What is it, Nina?

154
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:20,843
Nina, what is it?

155
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,403
A coastguard cutter answered
the APB we put out on Kim.

156
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,484
- They found her body, Jack.
- What?

157
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,333
l'm sorry.
She's dead.

158
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,050
- No.
- Jack, l'm so sorry. l know... Jack?

159
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,484
Jack?

160
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:10,689
(speaking in Serbian)

161
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:21,524
What if Bauer doesn't come? He may be too
crushed by the thought his daughter is dead.

162
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:24,247
That is exactly why he will come.

163
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,810
Believe me. l know.

164
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:51,287
Go! Go! Hurry, Father. Get to the boat.

165
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,527
Agh!

166
00:17:35,873 --> 00:17:37,726
(gun clicks)

167
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:40,523
(gun clicks)

168
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:24,721
(Palmer) lt has come to my attention that
some misinformation was given to the press.

169
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:29,409
And, again, l apologise
for the misunderstanding.

170
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:32,929
As you can imagine,
this has been a very chaotic situation.

171
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:38,849
But l appreciate the confidence the voters
have continued to show for our campaign.

172
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:42,846
We regret that false information has
been broadcast regarding this incident.

173
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,606
But, thankfully, no one was hurt.

174
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:48,812
My family and l are safe,
and we have no intention

175
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,726
of letting this slow us down
in any way.

176
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:59,042
- Did you come in here to lecture me, Mike?
- Lecture you on what?

177
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:02,523
About how l'm not being
supportive enough of David.

178
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:06,565
Actually, l'm on your side this time.

179
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:10,441
l think David was hurting himself
with this charade.

180
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:14,763
Maybe it's good
you leaked the truth to the press.

181
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:22,544
l wanna know what this entire day
has done to his campaign.

182
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:26,489
l think we should run some focus groups
first thing in the morning.

183
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:28,882
l've already called Robin over at ASl.

184
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:34,047
OK. Good. Do you think David should cancel
his trip to Dallas, go back to Washington?

185
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,124
l don't know, Sherry.

186
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:40,842
l think... David should make that call.

187
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:44,972
Oh, no. l don't. David's in no frame of mind
to make critical decisions right now.

188
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:48,489
lt's gonna take you and l
to steer this thing by ourselves, OK?

189
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:51,565
Until he gets his head screwed on right.

190
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:54,604
Listen, Sherry.

191
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,003
David wanted to meet you privately
when he finished his statement.

192
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:02,405
David doesn't need to make an appointment
to see me, Mike. l'm right here.

193
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,007
He'll be in the ballroom in five minutes.

194
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,848
l've already called the Secret Service.

195
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,842
What... what's this all about?

196
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:15,170
He didn't say.
lf l were you...

197
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:20,691
l'd take it as an opportunity
to make the first move...

198
00:20:22,253 --> 00:20:26,148
to patch things up,
make things right, Sherry.

199
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,609
Fine, Mike.

200
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,771
(Mason) lt's too much.
Tony, get this.

201
00:20:44,853 --> 00:20:47,606
l'll call you back.
Tac team gets there. Jack didn't wait.

202
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:49,604
- He went in without 'em.
- By himself?

203
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,967
- Evidently.
- ls he all right?

204
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,772
- He's alive.
- What about the Drazens?

205
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,242
- What are you talking about?
- Dead.

206
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,769
Congratulations, Teri. Your family's fine.
They're on their way here.

207
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:06,210
Anyway, Karris counts seven down.
Jack's the last man standing.

208
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:10,081
- Contact Secret Service. l'll update Division.
- l talked to Jack an hour ago.

209
00:21:10,173 --> 00:21:12,892
- He said he was on his way to get Kim.
- Everybody's fine.

210
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,282
Now go in there and celebrate.
Relax.

211
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,289
Nina?

212
00:22:16,093 --> 00:22:17,811
Can l help you?

213
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:30,723
(woman) Ja?

214
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:32,292
(in German)

215
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,044
(Nina speaks German)

216
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:52,007
- Just call me when it's time.
- Someone is there?

217
00:22:52,093 --> 00:22:54,209
- Yes.
- l understand.

218
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:56,807
- You speak German?
- Frankfurt Division.

219
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,927
- Something wrong?
- Yeah.

220
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:04,211
l heard there was some big shoot-out.
l can't get anyone to tell me what's going on.

221
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:08,844
Teri, calm down. Jack and Kim are fine.
They're on their way here right now.

222
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,731
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

223
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:14,373
- And the men that were after Kim and me?
- They're dead.

224
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:16,489
You and Kim are completely safe.

225
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:18,803
- And so is Jack.
- OK.

226
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:22,124
l just want us all to be back together again.

227
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:24,404
lt won't be long.

228
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:27,287
- Thank God.
- (phone rings)

229
00:23:29,173 --> 00:23:31,762
- This is Myers.
- You're still not alone?

230
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:34,413
- That's right.
- Listen carefully.

231
00:23:34,593 --> 00:23:37,644
Procedures are in place.
Collect all of your information.

232
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:40,493
- We have arranged for your extraction.
- Where?

233
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,606
The usual pick-up point.
Northwest corner.

234
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:46,107
ls there anything else?

235
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:49,763
No. l know you're busy.
l'm gonna let you get back to work.

236
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,907
l can't let you go.

237
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:04,108
Not yet.

238
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:06,784
Move back into the room.
Slowly.

239
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:10,163
l said move!

240
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:15,928
Against the wall.

241
00:24:16,013 --> 00:24:18,608
On your knees.
Do it!

242
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:32,324
Officer!

243
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,928
The body that you guys pulled out
of the harbour. lt was my daughter.

244
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:41,922
- l'd like to claim the body.
- Not sure what you're referring to.

245
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:45,012
The coastguard.
They pulled a body out of the harbour.

246
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:48,051
- ln the last hour?
- l didn't hear anything. l just got on duty.

247
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:51,887
- lf you'd like, l can call the harbour master.
- Hold on one second.

248
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:54,368
Give me your phone.

249
00:24:56,613 --> 00:25:00,925
- Could you call him now, please?
- Yeah, sure.

250
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,409
- Harbour master's office.
- Hey, Frank.

251
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:05,688
Did you pull a body
out of the harbour tonight?

252
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,492
- Uh, no. Nothing on our patrol.
- Are you sure?

253
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,803
- No reports anywhere.
- All right. Roger that.

254
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:14,772
- What did he say?
- No body was found in the harbour or near it.

255
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:17,048
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

256
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,249
ls it possible another unit picked her up?

257
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:23,592
We cover 50 miles of coastline.
There was no body found tonight.

258
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:26,649
Thanks.
Thank you.

259
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:55,684
(phone rings)

260
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:58,090
- This is Mason.
- Hey, it's Jack.

261
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:01,051
Shall l congratulate you
or demand your resignation?

262
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:04,210
- Do you know where my daughter is?
- As a matter of fact l do.

263
00:26:04,293 --> 00:26:07,603
Highway Patrol picked her up
half an hour ago. She's heading here now.

264
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,971
- lf you'd called, l could have told you.
- You need to arrest Nina.

265
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,850
- What?
- She's working against us.

266
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:17,642
- Don't let her out of the building.
- Jack, hold on. What's all this about?

267
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:20,247
She told me that
the coastguard found Kim's body.

268
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,211
l confirmed with them
they never found a body tonight.

269
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:25,761
She was working with the Drazens
to set a trap for me.

270
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:27,969
Are you sure it wasn't a misunderstanding?

271
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,363
About Kim being dead? No, she lied.
There was no misunderstanding.

272
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,887
lt doesn't sound like there's any proof either.

273
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:38,205
l'll get you your proof.
Just don't let her out of your sight.

274
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,644
(Jack dials phone)

275
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:53,204
(phone rings)

276
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,927
- Archives. Wilson.
- Hey, Paul. lt's Jack.

277
00:26:57,013 --> 00:27:01,729
l need a copy of the security tape from this
morning, between 8.50 and 9am in the lTS,

278
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:04,411
when Jamey committed suicide in there.

279
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,932
All right.
Let me check.

280
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,424
- That's weird.
- What, you got it?

281
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:17,526
- Yes, sir. Except the tape was erased.
- When?

282
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:20,010
- This morning.
- The digital backup?

283
00:27:20,193 --> 00:27:22,591
There's no digital backup system for lTS.

284
00:27:22,673 --> 00:27:27,048
There is. You need the clearance code.
Try: C 2 2 7 1 7.

285
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:31,165
- How long is this gonna take?
- Just a few minutes.

286
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:34,026
OK. Get back to me as soon as you can.

287
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,604
(horns blare)

288
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:46,684
Wait a moment, please.

289
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:04,287
David?

290
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,688
Mike said you wanted to see me.

291
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,764
Yes.

292
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,924
l know we need to talk, but...

293
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:22,368
Honestly, David, we haven't slept in two days.
Can't it wait till the morning?

294
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:35,229
(Sherry) We've had a rough day.

295
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:44,742
And, yes, l know that
you are very angry with me.

296
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,691
But when we've put this day in perspective,

297
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:57,003
you'll realise that l've been acting
in your best interest all along.

298
00:28:57,093 --> 00:29:01,491
- l'm not angry with you, Sherry.
- Oh, good, David.

299
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:06,123
l feel sorry for you.

300
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:11,781
You feel sorry for me?

301
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:17,667
You've lost touch with what it is to be...

302
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:21,830
a parent.

303
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,169
A friend.

304
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:28,884
A wife.

305
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:33,045
What?

306
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,924
After tonight...

307
00:29:43,453 --> 00:29:46,213
l don't wanna see you again.

308
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:52,708
- David, will you just...
- Sherry, please. l've heard it all before.

309
00:29:56,293 --> 00:30:00,127
And l don't care
what this may do to my candidacy.

310
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:04,526
And it's not because
l don't wanna be president. l do.

311
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,324
l just don't think you're fit to be the first lady.

312
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:15,924
(sighs)

313
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:26,843
Do you really think
that you can just leave me?

314
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:34,528
Don't believe for a second
that it's gonna be that easy.

315
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:39,084
Secret Service will take you back
to Washington whenever you're ready.

316
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:45,529
David.

317
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:48,785
David, you just don't walk away from me!

318
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:54,562
David, you can't do this without me!

319
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:58,287
David, l'm talking to you!

320
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:01,385
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Get your hands off of me.

321
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:36,365
- (phone rings)
- Yeah?

322
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:39,889
lt's Wilson. l got the Jamey Farrell
interrogation footage for you.

323
00:31:39,973 --> 00:31:43,283
Good. l've got a monitor in my car.
Upload it and send it to me.

324
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:45,364
Yeah, sure thing.

325
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:02,524
Oh, my God!

326
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:07,326
Send this over to Mason. His eyes only.
Then patch me through to him.

327
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:09,044
(phone rings)
- Mason.

328
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:11,722
l'm sending something.
Are you in front of your screen?

329
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:15,469
- Yeah. What is it?
- Proof against Nina. She killed Jamey.

330
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:18,209
- What? Why...
- Can you see it?

331
00:32:18,293 --> 00:32:20,284
Uh... yeah.

332
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,492
Oh.

333
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:28,121
This is unbelievable.
Where are you right now?

334
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,886
- l'm about five minutes out.
- OK.

335
00:32:30,973 --> 00:32:33,587
Find her, George.

336
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,724
(continuous beeping)

337
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,228
- Where are you?
- l'm leaving now.

338
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,788
You have 16 minutes
to reach the pick-up point.

339
00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:07,307
We're routing you through
Munich for three days.

340
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:09,623
Why Germany?
Why can't l come to you directly?

341
00:33:09,713 --> 00:33:12,625
l don't know. 
These are the instructions.

342
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:15,102
You'll need to be untraceable
during that time.

343
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,226
Make sure nothing
can connect you to Germany.

344
00:33:19,673 --> 00:33:22,467
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah. All right.

345
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,728
l'm leaving now, Teri.

346
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:30,846
l'm gonna lock you in from the outside.

347
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:33,544
Someone will find you soon.

348
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,568
Everything will be fine.

349
00:33:41,673 --> 00:33:43,664
- Anything?
- Nothing.

350
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:06,145
Miss Myers!

351
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:26,941
Yeah...

352
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,461
Put your hands where l can see them!

353
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:24,391
Nina, put your hands on the steering wheel!

354
00:35:42,713 --> 00:35:44,465
Jack.

355
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:47,884
lf you kill me, you won't know 
who l work for.

356
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:51,465
You think l work for Drazen, but l don't.

357
00:35:53,513 --> 00:35:55,504
l trusted you.

358
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:59,872
- l was just doing my job.
- Your job?

359
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:03,104
My wife and daughter almost died today.

360
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:07,823
How many people that trusted you lost their
life today because you were doing your job?

361
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:10,711
Walsh. Jamey. Ellis.

362
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,547
- How many others?
- How many died because of you, Jack?

363
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:18,262
(Mason) Jack, take it easy. 
We need her alive.

364
00:36:18,353 --> 00:36:20,992
Come on, Jack. 
Kim just got here.

365
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:24,224
They're taking her inside right now. 
Come on.

366
00:36:24,313 --> 00:36:26,986
(Tony) Jack, don't do it.

367
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:32,194
Come on, Jack. 
Come and be with your family.

368
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:34,468
 Come on. 
Let's go.

369
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:39,909
Let's go inside.
This is no good. Come on, Jack.

370
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:54,144
Good, Jack. 
Come on.

371
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:57,152
Come on. 
lt's OK.

372
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:00,184
You all right?

373
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:03,743
You did the right thing.

374
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:06,881
You wanna take her up?

375
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,504
Come on.

376
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:16,068
All right. 
Let's go.

377
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,106
- Sweetheart!
- Dad!

378
00:37:37,193 --> 00:37:40,026
- Thank God you're all right. Aah!
- Oh, l'm sorry.

379
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:42,786
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, baby. l'm all right. How about you?

380
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:44,670
- l'm fine.
- Are you sure?

381
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:48,482
- l'm positive. Oh, l was so worried.
- Oh, sweetheart.

382
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:54,010
lt's all over, baby.
No one's gonna hurt you now, l promise.

383
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,951
- l love you so much.
- l love you.

384
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:04,663
- Where's Mom?
- l... l thought she was here with you.

385
00:38:04,753 --> 00:38:07,790
l'll go find her.
Just stay here with the guards, OK?

386
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:09,864
- OK.
- OK.

387
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,706
(TV) ..two assassination attempts
just hours apart.

388
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:18,832
lt may take days, even weeks,
before the details become clear,

389
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:22,110
but sources close to the ClA
cite Special Agent Jack Bauer

390
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:27,472
of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit
as the man responsible for saving Palmer.

391
00:38:42,273 --> 00:38:44,833
- Still nothing.
- One...

392
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:47,588
Have you searched the floor yet? 
Have you searched the floor?!!


393
00:38:47,689 --> 00:38:48,978
Not yet, sir.

394
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:50,704
Teri!

395
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:54,266
Teri?

396
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:55,360
Teri!

397
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,084
Teri!

398
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:01,484
Oh, my God.

399
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:07,801
Come on. 

400
00:39:08,002 --> 00:39:09,491
Come on.

401
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:17,927
No. 

402
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,117
Oh, God.

403
00:39:20,353 --> 00:39:21,745
Teri? 

404
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:24,321
Teri, no.

405
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,172
Teri, no.

406
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:28,303
No.

407
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:29,884
Teri...

408
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:31,332
Please, no.

409
00:39:31,533 --> 00:39:33,993
Come on, baby. 
Come on. Come on.

410
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:43,271

00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,625
- You really appreciate it? How much?
- Jack.

414
00:39:58,593 --> 00:40:00,373
l'm so sorry...

415
