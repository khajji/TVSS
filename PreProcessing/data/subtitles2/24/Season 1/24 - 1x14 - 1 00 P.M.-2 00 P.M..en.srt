1
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:21,749
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:21,834 --> 00:00:24,408
My wife and daughter are in danger.

3
00:00:24,503 --> 00:00:28,335
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:34,969
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,
and this is the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,076
- (Jack) You OK?
- (Kim) Yeah.

6
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,997
Are you all right?

7
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:18,893
- Who's in this chopper?
- Just Jack and his family.

8
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,557
The prisoners are in other transport.

9
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:44,541
(man) Sir, this way.

10
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,546
All together.

11
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:51,673
- (Teri groans)
- Are you hurt?

12
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,182
No. My stomach's been
bothering me for a couple of hours.

13
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,843
Sweetheart, did something happen there?

14
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,810
No. lt's probably just
from all the stress, honey.

15
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:07,192
There's an ambulance waiting to take you
to a clinic where a doctor will examine you.

16
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:10,982
- Can't we stay with you?
- No. l've gotta stay here at CTU.

17
00:02:11,953 --> 00:02:15,998
- Jack?
- Alberta. My wife Teri and my daughter Kim.

18
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:18,622
- Hi.
- Thanks, Nina.

19
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:23,414
- The ambulance will take them to the clinic.
- (Jack) Good.

20
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,135
You'll be going with Agent Scott.
He'll take care of you.

21
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,012
- Jack, what's gonna happen with you?
- lt's all right, they just have to debrief me.

22
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,176
Hey, come here.

23
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,309
Don't worry, OK? l'll call you as soon as l can.

24
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:50,574
We're doing more than debriefing you.
l have to place you under house arrest.

25
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:55,320
You'll be held here and questioned
until we hand you over to the FBl.

26
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:28,272
Nina, l want you to watch over
Teri and Kim. Make sure they're OK.

27
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:32,823
- Green's got me doing mop-up.
- Get Tony to do it. Just get over to the clinic.

28
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:36,029
- l'll have to get Green's approval.
- Nina, please!

29
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:55,046
- Could you ask if l could have some water?
- Right away, sir.

30
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:20,403
Alberta. Tony's finishing
the procedures on the mop-up.

31
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:24,959
l've been here since before midnight.
l'd like an hour off to go home, clean up.

32
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,871
Denied.

33
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:31,207
Come on, Alberta. Please.

34
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,542
l've been through hell today.

35
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:39,222
l have a great eye for BS. lf you want
an hour off, tell me where you're going.

36
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:48,978
Jack asked me to look after Teri and Kim.
They feel isolated since he can't be there.

37
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:53,732
Now, there's an irony for you:
you looking after Jack's wife.

38
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:02,074
Make sure Tony's got everything
he needs before you leave.

39
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,088
Elizabeth, have we heard
from Christopher yet?

40
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:16,880
Yes. But he only had early projections. Those
were from New York and Massachusetts.

41
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,966
Get with me when he has the other states.

42
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,226
l wanna know if the incident
at the breakfast is hurting us.

43
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:27,389
Of course.

44
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:40,692
What's on your mind, Sherry?

45
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:58,049
You've got to go out there today
with your best face on.

46
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:02,213
There can be no talk about Keith
and no talk about Ferragamo.

47
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:05,179
Ferragamo's death was an accident.

48
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,643
l'm not gonna talk about Ferragamo.

49
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,892
l'm dropping it.

50
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:15,192
Really?

51
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,771
l'm being blackmailed.

52
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:23,531
- By who?
- By some of the people who finance me.

53
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:27,204
- What do they want?
- They're determined l get to the White House.

54
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:32,369
And if l don't do what they want, they say
they can build a murder case against Keith.

55
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:34,171
For Lyle Gibson?

56
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:37,044
No. For Dr Ferragamo.

57
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:42,932
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Keith was
nowhere near Ferragamo's office today.

58
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,965
According to Carl,
who's been doing all their dirty work,

59
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:52,316
someone planted evidence that could
implicate Keith in Ferragamo's death.

60
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,973
Oh, no, David. No.

61
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,694
Oh, no.

62
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:01,240
- This happens when you cover things up.
- Don't preach to me, David, OK?

63
00:07:12,337 --> 00:07:15,124
- What are we going to do?
- l don't know yet.

64
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:18,002
- Does Keith know anything...?
- No.

65
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,001
And he's not going to.

66
00:07:28,937 --> 00:07:34,014
You must be Teri. l'm Dr Kent. We're gonna
be taking very good care of you today.

67
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:37,228
- This is your daughter Kim?
- Hi.

68
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,689
We know about your abdominal pain.
l'd like to get an ultrasound.

69
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:43,736
No. lt's actually not
as painful as it was before.

70
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:47,776
That's good. But we wanna
make sure we know what it is.

71
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:54,790
ls there any other discomfort? Anything
you wanna tell us before we examine you?

72
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,338
No.

73
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:59,631
Mom?

74
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:23,363
Mrs Bauer?

75
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,367
l was raped.

76
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,912
l see. OK.

77
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:42,669
Then we're going to need to
draw blood and do some tests.

78
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,678
And l would like to
recommend you to a psychiatrist.

79
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,922
That's not necessary.

80
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:52,476
Mrs Bauer, of course you can do what
you want, but under the circumstances,

81
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:56,560
l think it's important for you to take
a few minutes and speak to someone.

82
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,603
Well, l'd like to keep this confidential.

83
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:02,861
The records are private.
Only the doctors have access.

84
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:06,067
No, l mean from my husband.

85
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:12,194
All right, if that's what you wanna do.

86
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:33,929
(Dr Kent) The nurse'll be in shortly.

87
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,058
l think we should spend some time with
Senators Blalock and Gleeson pretty soon.

88
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:42,938
l don't feel comfortable
aligning myself with them.

89
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,236
You're going to need their states.
Just being seen with them will go a long way.

90
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,737
(Palmer groans)

91
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:52,738
OK.

92
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,039
Was there something else?

93
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:01,995
l'm worried this Ferragamo thing
is not going to go away.

94
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,290
Let me handle the Ferragamo situation, Mike.

95
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:09,003
You just make sure the rest
of the day gets back on track.

96
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:13,384
Did l hear you say
something about Dr Ferragamo?

97
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:17,930
- There was a fire in his office.
- l'll get on this other stuff.

98
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:19,849
- Thanks, Mike.
- Dad?

99
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:24,102
Keith, l'm sorry.

100
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:28,439
Dr Ferragamo died.

101
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,106
- When?
- About an hour ago.

102
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:35,078
We just found out.

103
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:38,249
Wait. l don't get it. What kind of fire?

104
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:41,169
We're still waiting to hear the details.

105
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,331
What's goin' on?

106
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:49,718
Are you saying that my psychiatrist,
Dr Ferragamo, was involved in this?

107
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:54,051
That he told Maureen Kingsley
something l said to him during a session?

108
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:57,725
ls that how this whole story
about Lyle Gibson started?

109
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:00,386
lt seems that way.

110
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:03,482
But he died in a fire an hour ago?

111
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:06,059
lt was an accident.

112
00:11:06,154 --> 00:11:09,439
- No. l don't believe this.
- Keith, look.

113
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:16,201
- We have to let it go right now.
- Let it go?

114
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:18,994
- You mean cover it up.
- There's nothing to cover up.

115
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,875
Sure there is!

116
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,412
Somebody didn't want him to talk
because it'll hurt your campaign.

117
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:27,625
What would you like me to do?

118
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,793
- Go to the police?
- l can't.

119
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:34,133
l don't get it. What was all that stuff
you said before about trusting the system?

120
00:11:34,224 --> 00:11:35,386
l trust the system.

121
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:38,808
When my hind part's on the line.
But when it's your campaign?

122
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:43,308
My campaign's been on the line
ever since you lied to me about Lyle Gibson.

123
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,026
l don't understand. You've been on me
all night to keep quiet about Gibson's death.

124
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:51,363
This isn't about Lyle Gibson any more, is it?

125
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,023
l might have been involved in Gibson's death,

126
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:57,155
but somebody murdered Dr Ferragamo,
and they have to pay!

127
00:11:57,247 --> 00:11:59,488
Keith.

128
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:02,334
He meant something to me.

129
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:05,124
That's right.

130
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:09,756
Look, l was in real pain, and Dr Ferragamo
was the only one there for me.

131
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:13,543
So we're not gonna pretend like
this thing never happened, OK?

132
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:17,256
- Keith...
- No! You don't know how messed up l was.

133
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:21,563
l wouldn't have made it without him.

134
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:26,399
Just give me a little time.

135
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:29,319
Let me get to the bottom of what happened.

136
00:12:29,904 --> 00:12:34,234
lf there was foul play,
l promise you, we'll come forward.

137
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:38,443
- Why can't we come forward now?
- Because we can't!

138
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:44,953
Son, l love you.

139
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,871
You have to know
l'm doing what's best for you.

140
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:55,168
You have to know it.

141
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:16,943
- Good afternoon, Tony.
- (Tony) Mr Chapelle.

142
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,957
Looks like they're bringing in the big guns.

143
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:28,541
What do you think they're gonna do to Jack?

144
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,203
Not gonna name a street after him.

145
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,264
(door opens)

146
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,549
- Hey, Jack.
- Ryan. lt's good to see you.

147
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,878
l've got five priority cases
on my desk this morning.

148
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,089
- Your name's on each one.
- l can imagine that.

149
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:25,640
- Look, l just wanted to say...
- Hang on.

150
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:32,852
You were saying?

151
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,652
At approximately 12.15
l got a phone call from Agent Nina Myers,

152
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:48,322
telling me to assemble the team at CTU.

153
00:14:50,003 --> 00:14:52,375
District Manager Walsh...

154
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,710
Where's Teri Bauer?

155
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:02,342
- l don't know.
- Who are you with?

156
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:05,882
FBl. And you?

157
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:10,561
- CTU.
- Just waiting for the rest of my debrief team.

158
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:15,856
We're interrogating some of the injured
prisoners they're bringing into the clinic.

159
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,238
Thanks.

160
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:23,072
l'm with CTU. Where's Teri Bauer?

161
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:26,328
- She was moved to room seven.
- Thank you.

162
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,961
Teri?

163
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:49,391
- There you are.
- Nina. l didn't know you were gonna be here.

164
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:51,396
Yeah.

165
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:56,318
Hi, Kim. We didn't officially meet.
l'm Nina Myers. l work with your dad.

166
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:58,313
Hi.

167
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:00,777
l'm just so glad the two of you are OK.

168
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:06,820
l'll be here until you're done. So if you need
anything, l'll be down in the waiting room.

169
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:10,198
Nina, what's happening with Jack?

170
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,699
He's being questioned.

171
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:14,833
- ls he in trouble?
- That depends.

172
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:19,630
He broke a few laws, but he did it to save
you and Kim, so l think they'll understand.

173
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:22,802
lf he doesn't piss 'em off first.

174
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:24,880
My thoughts exactly.

175
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:30,094
Guess you know Jack
just about as well as l do, huh?

176
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:35,597
l'm sending someone to your house
to pick up some clean clothes.

177
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:40,142
What's gonna happen when we get released
from here? Why can't we just go home?

178
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:44,485
Until we know exactly what happened,
we'll take every precaution to keep you safe.

179
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:47,067
When do we get to see my dad?

180
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:52,701
l don't know. A lot of things have to happen
first. Some people will wanna talk to you.

181
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:58,665
Division, Secret Service, us.
Cos, you see, this wasn't a simple crime.

182
00:16:58,756 --> 00:17:03,964
This was a terrorist conspiracy, and
unfortunately you were in the middle of it.

183
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:07,128
But that's over now.

184
00:17:09,142 --> 00:17:11,218
- Nina, wait.
- Yeah?

185
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:13,766
l don't know the details about last night,

186
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:17,935
but l understand you're a big part
of the reason why we're still alive.

187
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,817
So thank you.

188
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,355
Sure.

189
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:25,524
l'll be out here.

190
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:29,512
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

191
00:18:29,597 --> 00:18:32,515
Nina Myers, CTU. ls that man FBl?

192
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,847
- Yeah. He's with me.
- He was in three. l'd like to speak with him.

193
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:39,725
Sure. But he wasn't in three. We just got here.

194
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:41,858
Stu?

195
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,947
- Who else is here from the bureau?
- lt's just the two of us.

196
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:50,950
- Are you sure?
- Of course l'm sure.

197
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:13,634
The reason l didn't call CTU
immediately for backup?

198
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:18,221
l was worried things could get out of control.
My wife and daughter were in the compound.

199
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:21,432
- But you did eventually call?
- Yes. Yes.

200
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:25,024
The second Teri and Kim were with me,
l called Alberta Green.

201
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,982
You did what any loving father would do.

202
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:33,743
Unfortunately, as you know, our procedures
don't allow for any deviation from protocol.

203
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:36,663
l can't reinstate you, Jack.

204
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:40,247
Have you heard a thing l've said?
D'you understand what's happening?

205
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:44,997
Senator Palmer is still in great danger.
Now that my family are safe, l can help you.

206
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:48,790
As of now, your case will be put in
the hands of the Justice Department.

207
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:50,545
Justice Department!

208
00:19:50,637 --> 00:19:56,342
Yes, under the circumstances, l had to break
the rules of procedure to protect my family!

209
00:19:56,434 --> 00:20:00,598
But l never deviated from my assignment
to protect Palmer. And you know that!

210
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:05,813
Yes, l know that. That's what might keep you
from going to prison, but that's not my call.

211
00:20:05,902 --> 00:20:10,279
We don't have time for this. l have come
in contact with suspects who are still at large.

212
00:20:10,365 --> 00:20:15,157
And l guarantee you, they have a contingency
plan. l am a resource. l can identify them.

213
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:20,915
You wanna arrest me, do that later. But let me
help Palmer get through the rest of this day!

214
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:26,537
- l'll ask Alberta if she wants you...
- She's been here for four hours, Ryan!

215
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:29,750
(phone rings)

216
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,759
Chapelle.

217
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,421
(woman) ls Nina Myers
cleared to talk with Bauer?

218
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:39,011
- Yeah.
- l'll patch you through.

219
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:41,178
That's fine.

220
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:46,059
OK. We're through here. lt's Nina.

221
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:59,370
- Keep him company.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:02,907
- Hey. lt's Jack.
- How's it going?

223
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:06,002
They're handing me over
to the Justice Department.

224
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:09,670
- Did you explain why you did what you did?
- Yes, of course l did.

225
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:13,885
l think Alberta Green's trying to make
a career move. How's Teri and Kim?

226
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,805
They seem OK, considering
what they've been through.

227
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,929
How long will they have to stay there?

228
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:22,468
A couple of hours, then they'll be
transferred for questioning.

229
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:27,769
Nina, look, l can't thank you enough
for being there. Really, l appreciate it.

230
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,646
- Nina?
- Yeah, l'm here.

231
00:21:31,738 --> 00:21:33,814
What's wrong?

232
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:39,403
When Walsh said someone in the agency
was working against Palmer,

233
00:21:39,495 --> 00:21:41,737
didyou sense it was more than one person?

234
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:47,122
He didn't say, but l've been thinking about
this too. Someone had to recruit Jamey.

235
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:52,502
So for now you have to assume that someone
else is on the inside. Maybe not CTU.

236
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:56,803
District, Division, maybe Secret Service.
Why? What are you thinking?

237
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:59,723
l just wanna make sure that
Teri and Kim are safe here.

238
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:02,263
What do you mean? At the clinic?

239
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,759
- Yeah.
- Why wouldn't they be?

240
00:22:04,854 --> 00:22:08,804
l don't know. l'm just exhausted
and probably getting paranoid.

241
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:12,900
- What's going on there?
- Nothing, Jack. Don't worry.

242
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:17,365
- l will make sure that they are safe here.
- OK. Thanks. Can l talk to them?

243
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,863
- They're being examined right now.
- OK. Get back to me as soon as they can talk.

244
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:23,698
- Yeah.
- OK. Thank you.

245
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,661
Any more information on
the backup plan to assassinate Palmer?

246
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:35,084
The information that came in matched
what we got from Division's database.

247
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:38,877
- Looks like things are falling into place.
- Give me the headlines.

248
00:22:38,972 --> 00:22:43,598
Three shooters, possibly hired to kill Palmer
in case the breakfast attempt failed.

249
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:47,101
There's Jovan Myovic.
Entered the country two days ago.

250
00:22:47,188 --> 00:22:51,138
Mishko Suba, also from the Balkans,
came in three days ago through Florida.

251
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,689
And the other one?

252
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:56,862
- No name yet.
- Keep looking.

253
00:22:56,948 --> 00:23:01,693
lf he's connected with the other two, we need
to know where he is and what he's doing.

254
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:40,072
Let's leave it right there!
Get the equipment in the shed.

255
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:44,108
l'll be in to brief you on our exit strategy.
Let's move it out!

256
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:53,077
- Mr Drazen, it's Kevin.
- Yes?

257
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:56,540
- We just got to the transfer point.
- What about Gaines?

258
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:59,040
- He's dead.
- l see.

259
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:03,049
Listen, Mr Drazen,
when Gaines hired me for this,

260
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:06,971
l told him there were some defects
in his plan that could be exploited.

261
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:12,267
Not to say l told you so, but l'm not surprised
that any of this happened the way it did.

262
00:24:12,357 --> 00:24:15,560
- ls there a point to any of this?
- Yes.

263
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:19,981
- Yes. l can fix it for you.
- lnteresting. And how can you do that?

264
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,449
l've done this before. l know people.

265
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:27,487
When l was working for the DEA in Florida,

266
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:31,281
l was able to get to a witness
that no one else could find.

267
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:35,836
12 hours later he was dead. Problem solved.
You get what l'm saying?

268
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:40,999
l appreciate the offer, Kevin,
but as you Americans so often say,

269
00:24:41,094 --> 00:24:43,667
plan B is already in effect.

270
00:24:45,848 --> 00:24:48,090
What does that mean?

271
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:50,426
Hello?! Drazen!

272
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,211
Get... away from me.

273
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:15,259
ls there anything left in the truck?

274
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:17,765
Go to hell.

275
00:26:42,507 --> 00:26:46,920
(Palmer) Get me three copies of this report
as soon as you can get it.

276
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:50,638
Are we saying Palmer
should stay in for the duration?

277
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:54,057
No. No, he's gotta get outta California now.

278
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:58,188
The backup shooters are in LA
and they're gonna come after him.

279
00:26:58,273 --> 00:27:03,694
All right. Leave that with me. Let me look
it over one more time before l do anything.

280
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:05,988
Tony?

281
00:27:07,198 --> 00:27:08,823
Yeah?

282
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,279
Are you satisfied with your position here?

283
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,080
Sure.

284
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:23,043
Because l always had the impression you had
too much talent to be a number three at CTU.

285
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:31,088
What do you want me to do, Alberta?

286
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,549
See, that's what l like about you.
You get right to the point.

287
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,390
Before Chapelle makes his final evaluation
of Jack, he'll wanna talk to you.

288
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:43,269
- Why me?
- Because you called in the lockdown.

289
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:49,732
Let's face it, Nina is hardly impartial when
it comes to Jack, and Chapelle knows that.

290
00:27:50,909 --> 00:27:53,909
And you want me to tell him what?

291
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:58,286
The truth. That even though
Jack's family was in danger,

292
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:03,998
there were ways he could have dealt with it
without compromising the integrity of CTU.

293
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:07,878
lf Jack had confided
in you from the beginning,

294
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:13,472
you never would have had to call George
Mason to lock things down. Am l right?

295
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:31,530
Jack?

296
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,324
Alberta.

297
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,782
Chapelle asked me to debrief you, personally.

298
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,246
Fine.

299
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,410
l have to tell you, this is your turf.
l feel uncomfortable debriefing you.

300
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:43,410
Don't. lt's quite all right.

301
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:46,461
lt's pointless to ask you questions.

302
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:50,415
Why don't you tell me what you think
l need to know? Save us some time.

303
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,882
l went through the events with Chapelle.

304
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:57,597
What you need are the threads and lDs
so you'll know how to proceed tactically.

305
00:28:57,684 --> 00:29:01,135
- Do you mind?
- No. But before we start, l need something.

306
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:05,024
- What's that?
- l wanna phone my wife and daughter.

307
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:09,604
They don't know what's going on with me
over here. l wanna ease their minds.

308
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:12,269
Sorry, Jack. l can't do that.

309
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:18,663
So why don't we dispense with the ''Are you
all right, Jack? l feel uncomfortable'' crap?

310
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:24,283
OK. You wanna talk straight?
Fine. Don't handle me.

311
00:29:26,588 --> 00:29:28,331
Tell me what you know.

312
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:33,001
You need to get ahold of Langley. Have them
open up their Balkan terrorist database.

313
00:29:33,094 --> 00:29:34,173
Why the Balkans?

314
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:37,761
The people behind the hit on Palmer
are financed by a Ted Cofell.

315
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:41,384
He was a banker with family
connections in that area of Europe.

316
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:42,972
Was?

317
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:44,936
He died three hours ago.

318
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:48,357
Keep talking.

319
00:29:48,443 --> 00:29:53,650
The money that we traced came back to Ted
Cofell lndustries, which is based here in LA.

320
00:29:57,076 --> 00:29:59,152
(phone rings)

321
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:03,372
- CTU. Almeida.
- Tony, l have a problem.

322
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:07,408
20 minutes ago a man identified himself
to me as FBl, but l know he's lying.

323
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:08,452
How d'you know?

324
00:30:08,546 --> 00:30:12,758
Cos l met the only two FBl agents assigned
here, and they knew nothing about him.

325
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:15,001
Maybe the right hand's
not talking to the left.

326
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:19,673
l don't think it's that. Can you send someone
over? l need to pull some prints off a phone.

327
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:21,224
Sure. Anything else?

328
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:24,393
- No, that's it. Just hurry.
- All right. You got it.

329
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:32,438
And the senator wanted
to get your approval on these.

330
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,483
- What are they?
- The photographs for Time magazine.

331
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:38,064
Oh, right. l wanted to see those.

332
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:41,454
- These are nice.
- Uh-huh.

333
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,492
- (Keith) Mom?
- Hey. Um...

334
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:47,500
- Use that one, Patty.
- OK. Thanks.

335
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:50,994
So what's goin' on?

336
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:54,463
- l talked to Dad.
- And?

337
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,294
And l'm a little confused.

338
00:30:56,386 --> 00:31:01,807
All night he's been trying to convince me to
air this thing about Nicole's rape and about...

339
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:04,596
No. We don't need to worry
about that right now.

340
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:07,259
No, that's just it. We do have to.

341
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:10,556
l know about Dr Ferragamo.

342
00:31:13,945 --> 00:31:17,195
- And l know that fire wasn't an accident.
- Keith.

343
00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:20,199
- But Dad wants to keep it quiet.
- Don't get worked up.

344
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:22,491
- l am worked up!
- Hey.

345
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,951
Look, covering up an accident is one thing,

346
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,532
but we're talkin' about murder.

347
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,871
- l'm goin' to the police.
- No.

348
00:31:32,964 --> 00:31:36,629
- l'm sorry, l've made up my mind.
- You will listen to me, Keith!

349
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:47,518
- lt is not your decision to make.
- l can't believe you're saying this.

350
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:51,436
That's because you don't know what
it takes to raise a family, to keep it safe.

351
00:31:51,524 --> 00:31:56,649
- What does this have to do with safe?
- lt has everything to do with it.

352
00:31:56,738 --> 00:32:01,565
Nothing is simple in life.
Sometimes you just have to make a decision.

353
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:05,159
That is what we did, and you will respect that.
Do you understand me?

354
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:07,322
l understa...

355
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:12,584
Have Patty pack up your things.
We have to leave the state.

356
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,129
Why?

357
00:32:14,214 --> 00:32:17,832
They've done a threat assessment.
lt's too dangerous for us to stay.

358
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:21,211
- Where are we going?
- Nellis Air Force Base, in Nevada.

359
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:24,641
- Have you discussed this with Mike?
- Of course.

360
00:32:24,724 --> 00:32:28,804
He believes this isn't a call they would make
unless the threat was imminent.

361
00:32:28,895 --> 00:32:33,889
l thought you said that the man from
the breakfast, Jack Bauer, was in custody.

362
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:36,557
He is, but he may not be working alone.

363
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,856
There are others... that are after me.

364
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:45,619
So let's go.
Let's get our things together. Now.

365
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:47,779
Come on, Keith. Keith.

366
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:08,967
- You didn't call it in.
- My family were in danger, so l kept CTU out.

367
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:13,305
(phone rings)

368
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,441
- Yeah?
- (woman) Tony, Chapelle's ready for you.

369
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:19,603
All right. Thanks.

370
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:39,085
- Hey, Tony.
- Sir.

371
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:41,250
Have a seat.

372
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,432
As you know, we have an important decision
to make pretty soon about Jack Bauer,

373
00:33:48,516 --> 00:33:52,051
whether or not to pursue
criminal and disciplinary charges.

374
00:33:52,812 --> 00:33:55,683
- l understand.
- l'm not gonna lie to you.

375
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,437
This may boil down to your testimony, as
you seem to be the most impartial observer.

376
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:09,239
Let me save you some time, Mr Chapelle.

377
00:34:11,873 --> 00:34:14,446
l'm not the biggest fan of Jack Bauer.

378
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:18,455
l don't agree with the way
he delegates authority,

379
00:34:18,546 --> 00:34:21,464
and l don't like the way he runs operations.

380
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:28,214
But since midnight last night,

381
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,972
you won't get me to disapprove
of a single action he's taken.

382
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,185
Fair enough.

383
00:34:58,336 --> 00:35:00,578
You talked to Nicole?

384
00:35:00,672 --> 00:35:05,298
Yeah. They're taking care of her.
They're gonna meet us at the airport.

385
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,876
Yeah. l'll tell him. Thanks.

386
00:35:08,555 --> 00:35:10,464
That was the Pentagon.

387
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:14,768
Remember after the incident at the breakfast
you asked me to check out Jack Bauer?

388
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,929
Who is he?

389
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,938
He used to be in Special Forces.

390
00:35:23,027 --> 00:35:27,025
Led a six-man team into Kosovo
a couple of years ago.

391
00:35:29,868 --> 00:35:32,822
That's what it was.

392
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:34,656
The Drazen mission.

393
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:38,330
Yeah. He hand-picked
his men and trained them.

394
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:40,953
Only Bauer survived.

395
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,464
He blames me for the loss of his team.

396
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,041
That's what this is about.

397
00:36:08,698 --> 00:36:12,233
Patty, can you get this to Mrs Palmer?
l didn't have time to pack it.

398
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:15,530
- Aren't you coming with me?
- No. l'm taking a later flight.

399
00:36:15,622 --> 00:36:19,833
l have an aunt in town. l promised my mom
l'd visit. She's in a nursing home.

400
00:36:19,918 --> 00:36:21,791
Sure.

401
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:29,419
OK. We need to get destinations on that one.
Make sure you fax that to the other office.

402
00:36:40,438 --> 00:36:43,190
- Hold the elevator, please.
- Sure.

403
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:25,598
- Elizabeth?
- l can't stay long.

404
00:37:26,484 --> 00:37:28,643
Then we shouldn't waste any time.

405
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:55,504
(Nina) Anything?

406
00:37:56,514 --> 00:38:00,132
- Nothing.
- That can't be. l saw him holding the phone.

407
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:03,393
- Those prints have been wiped off.
- lt doesn't make sense.

408
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,935
Housekeeping didn't come in here.

409
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:10,152
This wasn't housekeeping. There's not
a single print anywhere on that phone.

410
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:12,727
lt was done by a professional.

411
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:20,369
Yes. The weapons would be
consistent with that scenario.

412
00:38:20,455 --> 00:38:22,578
(phone rings)

413
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:24,741
Excuse me.

414
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,496
- Green.
- lt's Nina.

415
00:38:28,004 --> 00:38:30,756
Can l move Teri and Kim Bauer
to the safe house now?

416
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,085
Are they done?

417
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:35,923
Everything but the debrief,
but l can do that once we're over there.

418
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,135
- Fine. Do it.
- Thank you.

419
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:44,888
The ultrasound showed
the remnants of a small follicular cyst.

420
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:48,099
- A cyst?
- Yes. lt burst. That's what caused the pain.

421
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:52,983
The good news is, it's the most common type
of ovarian cyst and it's completely benign.

422
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:55,776
- Why did it burst?
- Could have been the assault.

423
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:59,530
Can also happen when your uterus enlarges.
When was your last period?

424
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:02,240
Last month. lt's due some time this week.

425
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,541
l'd like to do a pregnancy test,
just to rule it out.

426
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:08,037
OK.

427
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:10,797
Excuse me. Teri, we need to go now.
Get your things.

428
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,003
We're not finished here yet.

429
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:16,045
- Change of plan. We need to move.
- ls something wrong?

430
00:39:16,135 --> 00:39:19,587
We wanna get you and Kim
to the safe house now rather than wait.

431
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:23,678
- Aren't we safe here?
- You're just not as contained as we'd like.

432
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,844
Kim, come on.

433
00:39:29,065 --> 00:39:30,476
- Kim, get your things.
- Now?

434
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,773
Now. Go.

435
00:39:48,459 --> 00:39:52,540
Here's the test l was telling you about.
l want you to take it as soon as possible.

436
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,204
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

437
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:35,290
They're leaving now.

438
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,174
His name was Theodore Cofell.
We traced his company to Los Angeles

439
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:50,186
from money that had been
rerouted from the Balkans.

440
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:14,117
Senator Palmer.

441
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:18,374
- Can l help you, sir?
- l'm here to see Jack Bauer.
