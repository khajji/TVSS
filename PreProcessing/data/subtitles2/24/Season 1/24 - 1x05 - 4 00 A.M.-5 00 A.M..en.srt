1
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,778
Excuse me. Hello?

2
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:45,038
(both) Hello?

3
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:47,495
Hello? Excuse me. Hello?

4
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:54,045
Excuse me. There was
a teenage girl in an accident.

5
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:58,249
- A teenage girl in a traffic accident.
- l'll be right with you.

6
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:04,347
- We just called. There was a traffic accident.
- Certainly. You have our fax number?

7
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:07,304
- Excuse me.
- Thank you. You're welcome.

8
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:10,729
Doctor, did you get the message
about the heart seminar?

9
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:12,891
- Yes, l did.
- There was a car accident.

10
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:16,483
- Sorry. My shift starts at four. l just got here.
- Please help me.

11
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:19,607
- A teenage girl, traffic accident.
- The name?

12
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:25,034
- Kimberly Bauer or Janet York.
- B-a-u-e-r. Y-o-r-k.

13
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:31,914
No name listed. Just a Jane Doe.

14
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:35,714
- Well, maybe...
- Hey! You can't go in there!

15
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,635
Oh, my God. Janet.

16
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,478
l'm sure you're gonna find Kim.

17
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:02,232
(mobile phone rings)

18
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,661
- Hello.
- Honey, it's me.

19
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,740
Jack, l've been trying to reach you.

20
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:13,201
- Have you found Kim yet?
- No. We're at St Mark's Hospital.

21
00:03:13,294 --> 00:03:16,628
- Hospital?
- Kim's friend, Janet, was in a car accident.

22
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:19,170
- And Kim?
- l don't know. She tried to call me.

23
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:21,750
She was in a panic, like she was in trouble,

24
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:24,514
and l tried to get her,
but we were stopped by a cop...

25
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:27,088
Teri, Teri, Teri, calm down.

26
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:30,219
- l'm losing my mind. l need you here.
- l know, sweetheart.

27
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,605
l'm gonna get there as soon as l can. Where
was Kim when she called the second time?

28
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,356
l... l don't know. She was... uh...

29
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:41,648
North Hollywood.
lt sounded like she was being chased,

30
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:44,526
and then when we got there, she was gone.

31
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:48,401
- Kim's friend, Janet. Let me speak to her.
- She's in surgery.

32
00:03:48,496 --> 00:03:51,414
Surgery? ls she gonna make it?

33
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,907
- l don't know.
- Listen to me, Teri.

34
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,457
What l'm trying to do
right now is to find Kim.

35
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:59,666
Stay where you are,
and l will get there as soon as l can.

36
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:04,585
What do you mean? l've been trying to find
Kim. l've been out all night trying to find Kim.

37
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:09,804
Teri, l'm gonna explain it to you later, OK?
You're gonna have to trust me.

38
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:12,644
Teri? Honey, l love you.

39
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:17,183
l promise you,
we're gonna get through this, OK?

40
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,566
l love you too, Jack.

41
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:23,607
l'll get back to you
as soon as l know anything.

42
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:37,993
(Kim sobs)

43
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:44,502
Yeah, she's here. They say
the other one's dead. Don't worry. l will.

44
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:50,344
OK. Change of plan. Drive to the compound.
You'll get your money there.

45
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,307
- No problem.
- Use a different route.

46
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,643
- l don't want us to look like a caravan.
- Right. OK.

47
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:02,192
- Let's just split.
- Are you crazy? We have 20 large coming.

48
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:05,943
- l don't like it. This guy's psycho.
- You're forgetting something.

49
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,701
Last month? Phoenix? You owe me.

50
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:11,702
So let's get the money, then split. All right?

51
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:30,091
Mm-hm. This is fine, Patty.

52
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:35,721
We'll finish it after the breakfast. Still got
a couple of hours to grab some sleep.

53
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:38,219
Only if you do.

54
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:40,390
l made mochas.

55
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,559
Hey. l thought you were down.

56
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,646
l'm up. l couldn't sleep.

57
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:51,365
The polls open in less than three hours...
Mr President-To-Be.

58
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:56,247
- Heavy on the caffeine for me. Patty?
- Nothin' for me. Thanks.

59
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:58,408
- Mom?
- No.

60
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:02,914
You look exhausted.
Go to bed. That's an order.

61
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:07,674
All right. Promise you'll wake me
if you need anything?

62
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,919
- Absolutely.
- OK.

63
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:16,764
- Night.
- Good night.

64
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,892
David.

65
00:06:25,236 --> 00:06:28,107
You won't say anything
to Nicole about Keith, will you?

66
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:32,824
We don't even know whether Maureen
Kingsley's going to go forward with the story.

67
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,654
- l have to, Sherry.
- Why?

68
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:39,573
Because the press is gonna get a hold of this,
whether it's today, tomorrow or next week.

69
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,712
- Nicole should be prepared.
- l thought you said Carl would take care of it.

70
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:48,008
He'll do what he can, but l don't want her
to suddenly hear something on the news.

71
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:50,844
- She'd be devastated.
- She's so happy right now, David.

72
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,598
We've gotta take it one step at a time.

73
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,757
(Nicole) Dad, it's ready.

74
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:13,362
Dad, l've figured it all out. Even if we lose
Orange County, we're still gonna win.

75
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,740
lf we win Ventura by a ten per cent margin.

76
00:07:15,828 --> 00:07:19,873
No. Even seven.
lt's all right there in last night's poll.

77
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,745
You make it look like
there's nothing to worry about.

78
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:27,003
That's because there is
nothing to worry about.

79
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,801
- Mm. Dad...
- Nicole...

80
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,009
- No, go ahead.
- No, no, no. You first.

81
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:39,435
l talked to Suzy and Rachel Brenner. They're
flying out. l invited them to the victory party.

82
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,054
My Lord. l haven't seen them
since you all were in high school.

83
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:46,184
Well, we're gonna see them tomorrow.
Actually, tonight.

84
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:49,479
Ah, that's great. What were you gonna say?

85
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,522
Nothin'.

86
00:07:53,116 --> 00:07:56,650
- CTU, this is Myers.
- (Jack) Mason looking overyour shoulder?

87
00:07:56,744 --> 00:08:00,742
No. He ended the lockdown
as soon as he found out where you were.

88
00:08:00,832 --> 00:08:02,824
Be careful. He'll come after you.

89
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:06,831
l'm at the precinct. They've got a ring
around the suspect. l need help.

90
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:10,966
Get Ryan Sealey over at District.
Say it's about Palmer and l need an override.

91
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,126
OK. l'll take care of it.

92
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,728
Damn it.

93
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,653
Tony, l'm still off the net. l need a contact
number for Ryan Sealey at District Two.

94
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:39,403
Sure.

95
00:08:41,914 --> 00:08:44,156
You still pissed off about the lockdown?

96
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,915
Jack's never gonna trust you again,
and l'm not sure l will either.

97
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:50,791
You don't trust me, but you trust Jack?

98
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:53,633
Come on, Nina. He's been lying.

99
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:58,261
He's been hiding things from us.
lt may be OK for you, but it's not OK for me.

100
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:01,845
Do you have the number?

101
00:09:09,484 --> 00:09:11,560
Thank you.

102
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,578
Sorry, but this guy killed a cop.
l won't interfere with booking protocol.

103
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,660
l told you - you'll get a call from Ryan Sealey,
our liaison to the PD's office.

104
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,285
Until then, you can have my badge,
my gun, and l will not interfere.

105
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:32,463
- But l need to see that man now.
- What can l tell you?

106
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:36,416
- Fine. Where's your lieutenant?
- He checked out. Midnight.

107
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,381
But if he was here,
he'd tell you the same thing.

108
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:45,308
Sergeant, the cop that was killed tonight,
Officer Hampton. Did you know her?

109
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:50,894
- l knew her.
- l'm investigating a federal case.

110
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:54,816
She was helping me.
Do you want her death to be in vain?

111
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,075
Please forget about the damn chain
of command. l need to see this man now.

112
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,117
Just for a few minutes. Please.

113
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,340
Where's the suspect?

114
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:21,505
Move him to room two.

115
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,136
- Thank you.
- Follow me.

116
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:40,071
Hold it, Sergeant.
This man's under my authority.

117
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:11,264
We shouldn't have let him take her! There's
two of us, one of him, and we got a gun.

118
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:15,852
- You don't wanna pull a piece on Mr Gaines.
- No? Just on girls?

119
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:20,237
lf you had the hots for her,
then you should have done something.

120
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,614
l just don't want her to get hurt.

121
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:27,450
Get real, dude.
She saw our faces. She saw his face.

122
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,076
She's not walking. She never was.

123
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:34,994
- You think he's gonna kill her?
- Maybe he already has.

124
00:11:36,798 --> 00:11:40,665
Rick. Dude. Come on. lt's ten grand apiece.

125
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,387
All right? We just wanna get paid
and get going. Forget Kimberly, man.

126
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:47,596
She's history.

127
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:02,815
Listen, till you can tell me what you were
doing at Dunlop Plaza with Richard Walsh,

128
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:07,035
- l'm treating you as a prime suspect.
- Why would l kill my only ally at the agency?

129
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,532
You tell me. Why'd you blow the whistle on
your own agents, and try to blackmail me?

130
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:14,625
Because you were
withholding vital information.

131
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:19,836
l was following orders. l realise that's
a concept you may be unfamiliar with, Jack,

132
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:23,969
but it's something that some of us
actually do take seriously.

133
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:30,678
Through there is a suspect who is connected
with the people who want Palmer dead.

134
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:31,717
How do you know?

135
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:35,262
Walsh and Baylor died because
they got information that led me to him.

136
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:38,523
And if you interfere now
and something happens to Palmer,

137
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,446
you'll be seen as impeding this investigation
cos of a grudge against me, so cut the crap.

138
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,701
- How do you wanna play this?
- (knock at door)

139
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,827
l'll talk to him myself.

140
00:12:56,919 --> 00:13:01,831
Look, you're lucky l haven't already
put you in cuffs. Just sit down.

141
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:08,588
(mobile phone rings)

142
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:12,099
- Gaines.
- Have you heard from him?

143
00:13:12,185 --> 00:13:16,847
No. l'm gonna be calling him in about
15 minutes. He should be done by then.

144
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:22,726
l've got the girl and we're on our way
to the compound right now.

145
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,896
Gotta go.

146
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,774
Stop, please.

147
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:59,889
Listen, l don't have time
for this, you understand?

148
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,746
- Maureen, it's David Palmer.
- Senator?

149
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,125
- l'm sorry to wake you.
- Oh, no, no, that's OK. What's up?

150
00:14:27,218 --> 00:14:30,587
- The matter you called about earlier.
- Mm-hm.

151
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,179
- We need to talk about it.
- OK. Um... let's talk.

152
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:38,810
Since we're just a few floors apart,
l was thinking maybe we could get together.

153
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:43,226
- OK. How about l meetyou in the lobby?
- No, no. The lobby's too public.

154
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:46,568
The conference room on the third floor -
l'll have it opened.

155
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:50,355
ljust need about ten minutes to get dressed.
How does that sound?

156
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,285
- Yeah, that's good.
- l'll see you in ten.

157
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:55,445
- Thanks, Maureen.
- Sure.

158
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:03,493
And those are the only places
you know they were?

159
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:05,082
Yes.

160
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:09,170
What about this boy, uh, Dan,
who works at the furniture store?

161
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,843
We don't know anything about him,
but the store owner's a Mr Nowrasteh.

162
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:15,422
l have his number in here somewhere.

163
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:18,926
- Here you are.
- (mobile phone rings)

164
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,096
Excuse me.

165
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:28,061
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. ls Janet out of surgery yet?

166
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,823
Yeah. The police showed up.
We're talking to them now.

167
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,528
- Anything new?
- No. How about you?

168
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:38,161
l'm at the Van Nuys police station. Someone
here knows where the girls were tonight.

169
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:42,625
- You mean one of the police officers?
- No. They picked him up in North Hollywood.

170
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,750
- l think he saw Kim.
- Who?

171
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:47,459
- l don't know. A man.
- Well, what did he say?

172
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:52,376
l'm waiting to talk to him. You've gotta talk to
Janet as soon as she gets out of surgery, OK?

173
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,379
l know. l know, l know.

174
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:57,885
l'll call you as soon as l can. l gotta go. Bye.

175
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:06,264
- So what did he say?
- (sighs)

176
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:09,692
He says he won't talk to anybody except you.

177
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:15,072
So, can l go in?

178
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:18,449
Yeah.

179
00:16:18,538 --> 00:16:20,614
Thank you.

180
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:37,924
My colleague said
you only wanted to speak to me.

181
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,841
Well, here l am. And guess what?

182
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:46,183
- Right now, you're speaking to everyone.
- What the hell is he doing?

183
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:50,398
- l thought we were going to talk alone.
- You killed a cop.

184
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:54,611
What you need to do right now
is start telling me the truth.

185
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,150
- lt was self-defence. You were chasing me.
- (whispers)

186
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:00,654
What's he saying?

187
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:05,957
Go to hell! l'm done talking.
Get this guy outta my face!

188
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:17,213
- You've got nothing. l want my lawyer!
- Settle down.

189
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:19,381
- l'll take him.
- Come on.

190
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:22,510
l want my phone call. You've got nothing!

191
00:17:22,936 --> 00:17:26,435
- l want my phone call, now!
- Jack. Great job.

192
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:30,483
- He knows something.
- So are you gonna beat it out of him?

193
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:34,648
What's the plan, Jack? Hm? What's the plan?

194
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:36,815
Take a walk.

195
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,779
(mobile phone rings)

196
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,238
- Bauer.
- ls this line safe?

197
00:18:20,326 --> 00:18:23,161
- Tell me about my daughter.
- Not till you get me out.

198
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:27,196
- How do you know where she is?
- l heard some guys talking. Guys l work with.

199
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:30,246
- What guys?
- All you need to know is they have her.

200
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:33,207
- They're gonna call me in 20 minutes.
- Where?

201
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:35,871
- Back where you first saw me.
- San Fernando Road?

202
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:39,965
Yeah. But if l don't answer, they'll know
something's wrong, so get me out.

203
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:43,803
- l don't know if l can.
- l'm the one chance you got to find her.

204
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:46,845
l'm not there for that call, the chance is over.

205
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:49,012
Better think ofsomething fast.

206
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:06,330
- CTU. This is Myers.
- Hey. lt's Jack.

207
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:10,625
The suspect's name is Penticoff.
He's expecting a call in 20 minutes

208
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,462
at 18166 San Fernando Road.

209
00:19:13,546 --> 00:19:16,582
l need you to trace all available public lines.

210
00:19:19,302 --> 00:19:25,091
- l see water lines, utilities, no phone lines.
- Keep looking. He said he'd get the call there.

211
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:28,386
Wait. There's a pay phone
halfway down the block.

212
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:31,637
- And it's in service.
- Set up a trace.

213
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:34,815
- There's not enough time for a warrant.
- Forget the warrant!

214
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:38,768
lf they're expecting Penticoff,
they'll hang up when they hear your voice.

215
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:42,279
- They won't. They'll hear Penticoff's.
- Did Mason get him out?

216
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:45,486
- No.
- So what are you planning? Ajailbreak?

217
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:48,322
Jack?

218
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,576
Set up the trace.

219
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:21,902
(Mason) Bauer's behaviour is far from
representative of this agency's work.

220
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:27,197
Whether you like it or not, we have to be
involved, because this is bigger than...

221
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:33,702
Hey. Are you the officer
that interviewed Penticoff?

222
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:37,838
- No, l just transferred him to a holding cell.
- l still need to see him.

223
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,460
- You Bauer from CTU?
- Yeah, that's right.

224
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:45,962
Look, the cop that he killed,
she was my partner, you understand?

225
00:20:48,516 --> 00:20:51,434
- l'm sorry.
- l heard you went off on him before.

226
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,220
l want him to go down for it,
which means a clean bust.

227
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:58,897
- No more extracurricular activities.
- Understood.

228
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:02,982
All right. But l've got the access card.

229
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:07,989
Now, you can go in with me...
or you don't go in.

230
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:11,075
l'm fine with that.

231
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:30,302
- Keep him away from me.
- Just a few more questions.

232
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:33,511
No more questions without my lawyer.

233
00:21:33,603 --> 00:21:37,303
- Who are you working for?
- Are you deaf?

234
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:40,435
l said no questions without my lawyer.

235
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,686
- Your lawyer can kiss my ass.
- Oh, yeah?

236
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,068
- Who do you work for?
- Hey, hey! Back off!

237
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:48,778
- Get your hands off of me.
- He killed my partner!

238
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:52,486
- l know. l was there. Where were you?
- What?

239
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:56,040
Where were you
when your partner really needed you?

240
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:03,584
Hey!

241
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,881
Get him outta here!

242
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:11,923
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- He's crazy. l'm filing charges.

243
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:19,849
You oughta get yourself under control, Bauer.

244
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:24,152
(man) What's going on? l'll take care of it.

245
00:22:49,012 --> 00:22:54,219
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.
Paediatric resident to Labour and Delivery.

246
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:03,185
l'm sorry. l... l didn't mean to wake you.

247
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,813
- l wasn't asleep.
- l thought you might like some coffee.

248
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:08,981
Thank you.

249
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:23,827
- She'll turn up.
- How's Janet?

250
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:26,709
Um...

251
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,086
They're relieving some pressure on her spine.

252
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:35,297
But she's gonna be OK.
At least, that's what they say.

253
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:37,680
Of course she will.

254
00:23:40,563 --> 00:23:42,639
Any news from Jack?

255
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:45,982
No. As far as l know,
he's still out looking for Kim.

256
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:50,778
Well, that's good. You said he has
resources the police don't have, right?

257
00:23:58,331 --> 00:24:00,407
Even so, um...

258
00:24:01,793 --> 00:24:04,081
l imagine you wish he were here.

259
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:16,214
Hands out, please.

260
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:26,305
- Turn around.
- Oh, enough. Maureen's an old friend.

261
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:29,852
- lt's all right. He's just doing his job.
- Thank you.

262
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:32,567
Your lD, ma'am.

263
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:34,733
Would you excuse us?

264
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:41,493
How long have we known
each other, Maureen?

265
00:24:41,582 --> 00:24:44,287
Come on, Senator. That's not fair.

266
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:46,500
No, l'm just saying.

267
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:49,292
You, me, my family.

268
00:24:49,382 --> 00:24:51,458
We made a journey together,

269
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:54,552
from local politics to where we are now.

270
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:58,682
We helped each other along,
because we cared about the same things.

271
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:01,970
- l know that.
- Have l ever lied to you?

272
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:04,848
- No.
- Embarrassed you?

273
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:08,106
- No.
- Then why are you doing this?

274
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:12,612
Senator, l wish to God
that l didn't get this information.

275
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:16,774
- But we're talking about murder.
- A rumour.

276
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:22,695
Started by my enemies, of whom,
as you well know, l have many.

277
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,287
That's what l thought too, at first. But...

278
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,913
Please. Go on.

279
00:25:30,882 --> 00:25:34,962
- You know l can't tell you my sources.
- Come on, Maureen.

280
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:38,172
We're not in court here. l'm just an old friend,

281
00:25:38,264 --> 00:25:41,598
with a career and family
that you just may destroy.

282
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:44,927
You owe me that much, at least.

283
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,099
OK.

284
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:52,776
Two sources.

285
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:57,026
One, a man named George Ferragamo.

286
00:25:58,576 --> 00:26:01,494
He was your son's therapist for four years.

287
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:04,239
He came to me with the story.

288
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,159
And the second source?

289
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:15,587
The boy who raped your daughter, then
threw himself off the balcony - Lyle Gibson?

290
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:21,051
His autopsy showed that he had cuts and
scratches that pointed to ''a violent struggle''.

291
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,758
Nicole tried to fight him off.

292
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:28,219
Yes, that was the explanation.

293
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:32,182
But an hour later, an African-American
teenage boy went to an emergency room,

294
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,981
one block away, with similar injuries.

295
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,272
The name here says Edward Johnson.

296
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:42,827
The handwriting where
he filled out the form and signed his name?

297
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:46,948
l had it analysed by an expert.

298
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:51,498
lt's your son's.

299
00:27:04,976 --> 00:27:09,305
l don't give a damn about your expert.
My son never killed anybody.

300
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:13,525
- Senator, l would never...
- You do what you have to do, Maureen.

301
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:17,605
Just be prepared to accept the consequences.

302
00:27:42,221 --> 00:27:47,298
(TV) ..truth in the rumour that the Pentagon
wastefully dumped military supplies

303
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:50,643
costing millions, perhaps billions,
oftaxpayer dollars

304
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,517
in the years since the Vietnam War started.

305
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:56,360
The spokesman, who declined
to be interviewed on camera,

306
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:59,480
states only that ''in the hurly-burly ofwar

307
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:02,573
and the constant movement
ofperimeters and people,

308
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:05,446
one must expect that
there would be a certain amount

309
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:08,621
ofacceptable loss
ofsupplies and armaments.''

310
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,251
Hey, Dad.

311
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,632
Somethin' wrong?

312
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,385
l guess you'll have to tell me.

313
00:28:40,238 --> 00:28:45,612
The night your sister was raped, did you have
any contact with the boy who raped her?

314
00:28:46,786 --> 00:28:49,359
- What?
- You heard me.

315
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:53,991
l... l don't believe this. l mean...

316
00:28:54,752 --> 00:28:57,124
What brought this up all of a sudden?

317
00:28:57,213 --> 00:29:00,914
l mean, let's just leave that
all in the past where it belongs.

318
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:03,085
l'd like to, believe me.

319
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:07,593
But, as it happens, l can't.

320
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:17,854
What did you do that night, after you
found out that Nicole had been attacked?

321
00:29:17,942 --> 00:29:20,350
The truth, now. All of it.

322
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:25,608
l don't think you have a right to ask me that.

323
00:29:31,372 --> 00:29:34,409
- You don't think l have the right?
- No, l don't.

324
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:39,835
See, this thing happened.
Somebody had to deal with it.

325
00:29:39,922 --> 00:29:42,840
But you were in Chicago
givin' a speech, or New York...

326
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:45,677
We'll deal with
my shortcomings as a father later.

327
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:49,594
Now l wanna know what you did after
you found out your sister had been raped.

328
00:29:49,682 --> 00:29:53,727
- And l told you. l'm not gonna answer.
- You will answer me!

329
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:21,167
l apologise about Bauer.

330
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:25,300
But l'd really appreciate it
if we could handle this internally.

331
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:27,840
l got no problem with that.

332
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:32,009
Sergeant, excuse me, but if our federal
colleagues are through with Penticoff,

333
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,049
- l'd like to process him into the system.
- Why are you here? l thought you left.

334
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:40,392
l'm not leaving till Penticoff
is behind bars without bail.

335
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:42,939
The computer says you left five minutes ago.

336
00:30:43,027 --> 00:30:45,269
(Mason) All right, guys, we're on the move.

337
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,106
Damn it!

338
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:54,323
l got this notice in the mail this afternoon.

339
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:57,783
Actually, it was yesterday afternoon.

340
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,951
Kimberly was failing algebra.

341
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:06,207
lt was the second notice. She intercepted
the first one and threw it away.

342
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:10,668
When she got home, l was so mad at her.

343
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:23,390
l guess l accused her, and l...
l said things to her l shouldn't have said.

344
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:27,067
There isn't a parent in the world
who hasn't been there.

345
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:33,273
Last night, when l told her good night,
she wouldn't even acknowledge me.

346
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:38,075
l actually had the thought that l'd be...

347
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,953
l'd be so glad when she got out of the house.

348
00:31:46,466 --> 00:31:50,298
When Janet wakes up, she'll know
where Kim is and then we'll find her.

349
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,545
- l just hope it'll be that easy.
- lt will.

350
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,639
But why wasn't she with Janet?
lt doesn't make any sense.

351
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:59,390
- Maybe she got freaked out by the accident.
- We should've waited.

352
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:01,721
- We should've waited.
- No, no, no.

353
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:07,057
We were right to come here.
All we had to go on was the ambulance.

354
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:09,561
We had to follow up on it.

355
00:32:15,203 --> 00:32:17,279
Listen, whatever happens,

356
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,624
l'm gonna stay with you until we find Kim.

357
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,829
You have my promise.

358
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,875
Thank you.

359
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:34,003
Come on, Davis, we need that uplink.

360
00:32:35,807 --> 00:32:38,298
He says we oughta have a picture by now.

361
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:44,724
W-7 satellite was in the southwest sector
when Bauer helped Penticoff escape,

362
00:32:44,816 --> 00:32:49,810
so, with luck, we'll be able to pull up some
visuals that'll help us pinpoint his location.

363
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:52,276
- That's it.
- Here we go. All right.

364
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:56,279
Davis, the link's up.
Now l gotta get a back trace.

365
00:32:56,577 --> 00:32:59,365
This is the roof of the building
from 200 miles up.

366
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:01,993
About how long
would you say since they got out?

367
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,954
l don't know. Seven or eight minutes?

368
00:33:05,044 --> 00:33:09,753
OK. Davis? l wanna go back ten minutes,
and give me stills at 30-second intervals.

369
00:33:09,841 --> 00:33:13,838
Look for two men
exiting the building together.

370
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:16,502
(Davis) As often minutes ago...

371
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:19,267
- 30...
- There they are.

372
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,476
- OK, you can speed it up.
- All right. Speeding up.

373
00:33:25,064 --> 00:33:27,104
- Slow it down now.
- You got it.

374
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:29,267
You got a mark on that car?

375
00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:34,990
- Coming to you now.
- All right.

376
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,610
Where are you headed, Jack?

377
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:09,983
- (Jack) All set?
- All set.

378
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:12,440
- How much time do you need?
- A few seconds.

379
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:16,486
- Who are these guys?
- l told you. l don't know.

380
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:20,323
They tell me what to do.
l do it, they pay me. That's it.

381
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:23,329
- (phone rings)
- lt's ringing.

382
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:25,158
- Yeah?
- l'm not showing anything.

383
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:26,412
- (phone rings)
- Yeah?

384
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:31,328
- lt's a cellphone.
- We're screwed. l don't know the frequency.

385
00:34:31,756 --> 00:34:33,416
- l'll get back to you.
- Jack?

386
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:36,343
- Yeah?
- lt's Gaines. There's a change ofplan.

387
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:41,884
Nothing you can't handle. Taped to the back
ofthe phone is a set ofkeys with a remote.

388
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:47,264
- Got 'em.
- lt's for a parked car on Avenue 26.

389
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:51,684
Nevada plates, 782NOF.
Find it with the remote.

390
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,445
There's a body in the trunk. Get rid ofit.

391
00:34:55,154 --> 00:34:57,230
- What does he mean, body?
- l don't know.

392
00:34:57,323 --> 00:35:00,028
- Whose body is in the trunk?
- l don't know!

393
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:19,294
Walk in front of me.

394
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,258
Come on.

395
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:31,682
(alarm beeps)

396
00:35:36,654 --> 00:35:41,363
Kneel up against that wall and interlock
your fingers behind your head. Now.

397
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:44,193
Don't move.

398
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,993
Oh, my God.

399
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,046
(tyres screech)

400
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:13,643
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, we had a deal.

401
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:16,022
Shut up.

402
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,945
- Put him in the car.
- Hey! Hey!

403
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,738
Bauer!

404
00:36:20,823 --> 00:36:24,275
That's pretty quick work, George.
Trackin' me on a satellite?

405
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:29,031
- l'm takin' you in, Jack.
- He had evidence on the Palmer hit.

406
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:31,614
That's why l broke him out.

407
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:38,382
- So who was this?
- l don't know yet.

408
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:46,254
You're havin' quite a night here,
aren't you, Jack?

409
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:49,476
Why don't you tell me
what the hell is going on here?

410
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,057
Unless you want me to throw you
back to the cops? They're ready for you.

411
00:36:56,317 --> 00:37:00,564
There are people within the agency
that are supporting the Palmer hit.

412
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:03,775
That's why Walsh and Baylor were killed.
They found out.

413
00:37:03,866 --> 00:37:06,404
The truth is, l thought you were a part of it.

414
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:09,115
l apologise if l was wrong.

415
00:37:09,205 --> 00:37:13,073
George, as crazy as this sounds,
you're gonna have to trust me.

416
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:18,542
This is gonna look very bad for us
if something happens to Palmer tonight.

417
00:37:24,596 --> 00:37:27,680
- So what's next?
- l need to take the body down to CTU,

418
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:30,007
and try and make an lD.

419
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:33,268
l'll go grill Penticoff,
get what l can outta him.

420
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:37,603
- We never had this conversation, right?
- Right.

421
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:42,899
l'll be at District. OK. Call the precinct,
tell 'em we've recovered Penticoff.

422
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,409
(dials phone)

423
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:03,127
- What have we got?
- Body. Male. Badly mutilated.

424
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:06,254
l need a positive lD now.
Who's our best forensic?

425
00:38:06,346 --> 00:38:09,097
- Perry Tanaka.
- Get him. l'll be there in ten minutes.

426
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:10,724
- l'm on it.
- OK.

427
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:15,721
(dials phone)

428
00:38:18,274 --> 00:38:20,231
- Yes, Doctor.
- Clamp, please.

429
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:24,526
- (phone rings)
- Hello?

430
00:38:24,614 --> 00:38:27,650
- Hey. lt's me.
- Jack, did you find out anything?

431
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:30,529
- Maybe. l'm not sure yet.
- What have you been doing?

432
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,704
- l'll be there in 20 minutes. l'll explain then.
- All right.

433
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,490
- Janet out of surgery yet?
- No, not yet. She should be soon.

434
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,420
Good. lt's really important l talk to her.

435
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:44,716
l know it sounds cold, sweetheart,
but she's our only link to Kimberly.

436
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:48,170
Hang in there, honey.
l love you. l'm on my way, OK?

437
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,339
OK.

438
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,691
(bird flies off

439
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,075
Just be cool.

440
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:36,598
We'd like our money now,
if that's like, you know, OK.

441
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:44,599
Well, just so we're, like, you know, clear...
what happened to the other girl?

442
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:47,814
Janet? lt's like l told you. We had to kill her.

443
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:51,654
My people say someone
fitting her description

444
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:54,779
was taken to a hospital
near to where you were.

445
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:58,202
How do you explain that?

446
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:02,749
Well, the thing is...

447
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:08,128
Maybe, uh, she wasn't quite dead.

448
00:40:10,637 --> 00:40:14,421
Well, l'll tell you, Dan,
you're either dead or you're not dead.

449
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:17,267
There's no such thing as sorta dead.

450
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:19,178
Here. Let me show you.

451
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:21,430
No!

452
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:31,151
You've just been promoted.

453
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,943
Congratulations.

454
00:41:00,645 --> 00:41:03,599
We're losin' her. We've lost pulse.
She's gone asystole.

455
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,766
Start compressions now.

456
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,603
What's going on?
