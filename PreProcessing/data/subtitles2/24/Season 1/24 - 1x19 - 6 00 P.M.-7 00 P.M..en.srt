1
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:17,150
(Jack) Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,732
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:23,991
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:29,621
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,
and today is the longest day ofmy life.

5
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:55,302
The first time you invited me back here, you
left your keys in my car. lt was pouring rain.

6
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:57,967
We didn't wanna run back, so...

7
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:01,810
we used your Hide-A-Key.

8
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,400
(burglar alarm)

9
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:27,585
What do l do? l don't know what to do.
l don't know what the code is.

10
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:30,795
Just take your time. Maybe it'll come to you.

11
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:35,138
Just make this stop!

12
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,516
(phone rings)

13
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,945
- Hello?
- (woman) This is SuperiorAlarms.

14
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:54,904
- Could you turn this off?
- l'll needyour password.

15
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,909
- What?
- Ma'am, what is your password?

16
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:02,617
- l don't know the password.
- Are you having an emergency there?

17
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:06,500
(Nina) Alan Morgan... Saugus.

18
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:10,753
- (man) Yeah. Pacific Electric.
- (Nina) Got it. All right. Thanks.

19
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:17,715
Jack? His name was Alan Morgan.
He worked for Pacific Electric in Saugus.

20
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:22,222
Saugus? OK, he was paid off by Alexis
to kill the power in a section of the grid.

21
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:25,018
- Did you get the coordinates? 26...
- Double G. Yeah.

22
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:28,809
- We need to know where that is.
- l'll get this to Tony. Shall l stick around?

23
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:32,438
- No. Just get hold of me if you get anything.
- OK. See you at the office.

24
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:34,608
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:38,536
- (alarm ringing)
- None of these are working.

26
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:41,492
- (gasps)
- Superior Alarms! Stay where you are!

27
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,786
Please. This woman, she lives here.

28
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,547
She just forgot her code.

29
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,346
(alarm stops)

30
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,147
Thank you.

31
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:07,727
- Teri Bauer?
- Yes.

32
00:03:07,817 --> 00:03:10,106
- Do you have any lD?
- Um...

33
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:14,988
Sure. lt's probably in my purse. l'll go check.

34
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,886
No lD necessary. You obviously live here.

35
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:47,190
She just couldn't remember her code.

36
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:50,393
l don't usually set it. My daughter must have.

37
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:53,058
lt's all right. Just sign this.

38
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:03,245
OK. l'm gonna reset the alarm and check
the contacts around the outside of the house.

39
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:05,739
That should take about 15 minutes.

40
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:07,910
Thank you.

41
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,373
(Phil) Thank you.

42
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:46,162
Nice, Jack. There's always
a body count everywhere you go.

43
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:50,033
- l gave Hanlin clear orders not to shoot.
- Where'd he go?

44
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:52,619
- (phone rings)
- He's over there.

45
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,291
- Bauer.
- Jack, it's David Palmer.

46
00:04:56,384 --> 00:05:00,464
- Yes, Senator?
- l just heard from my source at the Pentagon.

47
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,426
l had to twist a lot of arms
to get the missing Drazen file.

48
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:05,889
- What was in it?
- Dates and locations.

49
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:09,892
lt seems to relate to the last months
of Victor Drazen's life.

50
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:12,935
- Anything we can use?
- Maybe.

51
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:17,652
The last entry is an address
unrelated to everything else.

52
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:22,531
- What is it?
- 21911 Kipling, in a city called Saugus.

53
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:25,952
- l don't know where that is.
- Senator, did you just say Saugus?

54
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,956
- Does that mean anything?
- Yes. l'll get back to you.

55
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:32,327
- Thankyou, Senator. This is going to help.
- All right.

56
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,458
(phone rings)

57
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:41,713
- CTU. Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack. Take down this address.

58
00:05:41,805 --> 00:05:47,012
- Go ahead.
- 21911 Kipling Avenue, in Saugus.

59
00:05:47,102 --> 00:05:50,103
l got a feeling it's in
the grid coordinates Nina gave you.

60
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:52,477
All right. Hang on.

61
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:03,694
Yeah, you're right.
lt's right in the middle of sector 26-GG.

62
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:07,652
- OK. Find out what's there. Get back to me.
- All right.

63
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:11,750
(Mason) Hey. Where are you headed?

64
00:06:11,835 --> 00:06:16,164
Saugus. Alexis paid this guy off to knock
the power out at a specific address there.

65
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:20,419
- l wanna know why.
- Slow down. l'm on your side. Fill me in.

66
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:28,974
Two and a half hours ago Robert Ellis was
killed because he almost found this location.

67
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,521
We got the address from the Drazen file.
The senator just gave it to me.

68
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:36,560
- OK. Let's go.
- What do you mean ''let's''?

69
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,854
You wanna go, l'm your chaperone.
You want a ride?

70
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:48,161
Yeah.

71
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,322
(Mason) Hop in.

72
00:06:58,923 --> 00:07:02,506
Where's my brother?
These guys are gonna be here in 20 minutes.

73
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:08,264
l told you, we split up. He said he was gonna
meet me here with the payoff from Gaines.

74
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,849
Look, if l was ripping you off,
why would l come back here?

75
00:07:11,936 --> 00:07:14,143
Damn!

76
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,434
- Where are you going?
- (Frank) Don't worry about it.

77
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:20,016
- What you doing?
- l'm not waiting here to get killed.

78
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:23,112
You're not going.
She'll tell the police about the deal.

79
00:07:23,198 --> 00:07:27,030
l don't care about the deal! l came here
cos l wanted you to help find my mom.

80
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:29,490
- That was a dumb idea.
- You came for Rick.

81
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,035
- l did not!
- Don't worry about her. Just leave.

82
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:34,495
What do you mean ''Don't worry about me''?

83
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,209
- Come with me.
- l can't.

84
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,501
Whatever's out there is better than in here.

85
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:41,423
You heard Frank.
Nobody leaves until Dan gets back.

86
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:44,213
Dan is not coming back!

87
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:47,835
What do you mean?

88
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:54,179
- l don't know. l just... l don't...
- What do you mean?!

89
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,975
- Leave her alone.
- Where is he?

90
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:03,648
- He's dead.
- What are you talking about?

91
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:08,815
Gaines killed him. He was gonna kill me too.
l swear to God. Gaines was out of control.

92
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:35,099
So who's got the money now?

93
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:38,437
Nobody. Gaines never paid us.

94
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:49,364
These guys are gonna be here in half an hour.

95
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:52,321
These are not the kind of guys
you come up short with.

96
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:55,199
- Then call it off.
- Too late to call it off!

97
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:40,616
What are you gonna say
down there today, David?

98
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,252
- He's gonna tell the truth.
- Don't start.

99
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,796
- You've caused enough pain in this family.
- Sherry!

100
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:52,420
Well, l'm sorry, David,
but somebody's got to say the words.

101
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:57,935
This thing wouldn't have started if Keith
hadn't taken matters into his own hands.

102
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:01,897
Listen to me.

103
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:05,351
Nobody's defending what Keith did.

104
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:08,195
He acted on the moment. lt wasn't right.

105
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:13,570
That doesn't make you right for covering
it up, or make me right for not being there.

106
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,993
So we're all to blame.
Let's just leave it at that.

107
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:23,825
That's right, Mom. l'm willing to pay the price
for this, even if it means going to jail.

108
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:29,169
You still think this is
just about you, don't you?

109
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:33,173
When are you gonna get it through your head

110
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:38,091
that your father is running
for president of the United States?

111
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:41,885
A black man. You don't just decide

112
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,309
to ease your conscience at the cost
of what might be best for this country!

113
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:49,402
- l didn't, Mom!
- Both of you, calm down.

114
00:10:54,993 --> 00:11:00,118
Look, l kept it inside. And l was gonna
suck it up for as long as it took.

115
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,117
But someone murdered Dr Ferragamo.

116
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:06,246
You can't tell me
hiding that is best for this country.

117
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,959
You know what?

118
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:12,085
l never saw it until just this minute.

119
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:14,928
You're your father's son.

120
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:19,260
You cover up your weakness with a bunch
of bleeding-heart sentimentality.

121
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:20,975
- That's enough!
- Am l wrong?!

122
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:25,141
And when are you gonna be man enough
to do what it takes to be president?!

123
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:28,232
- Nicole? Nicole, you OK?
- (moans)

124
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:31,897
- (Keith) What's wrong?
- (Sherry) Nicole...

125
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:34,526
Keith, get me some water.

126
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:37,368
- Come on. Come on.
- We need a doctor in here!

127
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,829
Easy. Easy.

128
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,788
Easy. Relax. Come here. Gimme your hand.

129
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,002
(Nicole sobs)

130
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:02,266
- (sobs) l'm sorry, Daddy.
- Why? About what?

131
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,892
Honey, talk to me.

132
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,687
- This is all my fault.
- Don't you ever say that.

133
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:20,195
No, sweetheart. Don't you say that.
Everything's gonna be fine.

134
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,363
- No.
- Yes, it is.

135
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:31,042
Sorry, Daddy. l'm sorry.

136
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:33,207
Sorry, Daddy.

137
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:37,877
l just got in. l've got some more info
on that location in Saugus.

138
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:40,047
OK, hold on.

139
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:43,850
- OK, go.
- lt comes up as a wildlife preserve.

140
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:47,553
- Great. We're going to a Sierra Club meeting.
- Who's with you?

141
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,936
Mason. A wildlife preserve in Saugus?

142
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:53,892
That doesn't make sense. Saugus is
industrial. What about the GPS maps?

143
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:56,145
- l've got three on the way.
- Good work.

144
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,940
- We'll callyou when we find what's out there.
- Yeah, OK.

145
00:13:05,832 --> 00:13:10,411
So correct me if l'm wrong, but this day
basically boils down to a personal vendetta

146
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,792
against you and Palmer by the Drazens.

147
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:16,499
Yes. Palmer authorised the mission,
l carried it out.

148
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:19,547
Today is the second anniversary
of Victor Drazen's death.

149
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:22,175
Happy anniversary.

150
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:26,761
So what is it we're expecting
to find out here in Saugus?

151
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,929
l don't know yet.

152
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:33,433
l gotta tell you, Jack,
it never gets dull with you.

153
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:37,438
Yeah.

154
00:13:38,114 --> 00:13:41,697
Look, for what it's worth,
l'm sorry about last night.

155
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:45,865
What, shooting me in the leg with a trank?
Don't give it a second thought.

156
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:52,041
Needless to say, l was pretty wound up. l feel
a lot better now, knowing my family's safe.

157
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:00,465
- What's the matter?
- No. Just... beat, you know?

158
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:04,088
- Could use a little sleep.
- Tell me about it.

159
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:23,363
- How you doing?
- l don't know.

160
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,238
Everything looks familiar
but l don't understand any of it.

161
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:31,788
l don't feel anything. l should, shouldn't l?

162
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:33,952
No. Not yet.

163
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,459
Sometimes music can help unlock memories.

164
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:44,129
(music plays quietly)

165
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:59,987
- Did you ever meet Kim?
- No.

166
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:02,741
You didn't want her
to know you were seeing anyone.

167
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:05,611
You said she was taking
Jack's side in the separation.

168
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:09,616
You didn't wanna give her
any more reason to be angry with you.

169
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:12,991
And why did my husband... Jack...
Why did Jack leave me?

170
00:15:13,084 --> 00:15:15,456
You asked him to.

171
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:18,961
You told me he was too removed.

172
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:22,334
There was no connection
between you two any more.

173
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:24,918
How about you and l?

174
00:15:27,766 --> 00:15:30,932
- l thought there was one.
- But, what, l didn't?

175
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:35,310
Truth is, l think you did.

176
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:39,063
But you were scared.
You didn't wanna lose your family.

177
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:42,897
And when Jack asked
to move back in, you let him.

178
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,944
- lt's funny.
- What?

179
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:52,743
l don't remember you at all.

180
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:59,250
But being with you makes me feel good,
and... maybe l don't feel so scared.

181
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,839
Thank you for doing this, Phil.

182
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,485
Did Chuck come through?

183
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:24,689
l hope not. Just park in the back.

184
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,860
- Just sit tight.
- l can't stay here. l need to find my mom.

185
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:32,202
- l don't know how to get you outta here.
- l'll make a run for it.

186
00:16:32,288 --> 00:16:36,072
l wouldn't. Frank's a psycho.
You don't wanna cross him.

187
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:39,703
- l'm gonna go.
- No.

188
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,835
(knock on door)

189
00:16:47,637 --> 00:16:51,386
Hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no, no.
Get in the kitchen.

190
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,635
Come on in, man.

191
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:58,685
You, be careful.

192
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,065
No, he's cool. Come on. lt's all right.

193
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,399
Let's see it.

194
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,660
Yeah.

195
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:24,123
- That's what l'm talking about.
- These the guys with the ecstasy?

196
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:27,715
- No, these are just friends of mine.
- Frank, what are you gonna do?

197
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:31,052
What does it look like?
We can't pay if we don't have any money.

198
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,428
- You're gonna rip 'em off?
- Yeah.

199
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:36,181
(gun clicks)

200
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:52,609
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

201
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:59,038
- You all right, honey?
- l'm absolutely fine, Daddy.

202
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:02,627
- Good.
- Go ahead. They're waiting for you.

203
00:18:04,214 --> 00:18:07,168
OK. l'm gonna head down now.

204
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,596
This is a test for us.

205
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:25,682
lf we love each other, support each other...

206
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:33,612
nothing else will matter.

207
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:41,575
Sherry?

208
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,496
l need you now more than ever.

209
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:14,277
l've always liked this tie on you, David.

210
00:19:16,453 --> 00:19:19,240
Senator? lt's time.

211
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:56,905
Anything look familiar?

212
00:19:56,993 --> 00:20:02,782
lt's so weird. Looking at what l did for the last
few months, it doesn't mean anything to me.

213
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:07,251
''Yvonne's birthday.''
''Kim in Cambria for the weekend.''

214
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:12,625
''Dinner with Phil. lvy at the Shore.''

215
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,546
Was it nice?

216
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:19,259
Well, the wait was over an hour, so...

217
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,098
we decided to walk down the pier
and have some hot dogs.

218
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,102
And you beat me at air hockey.

219
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:35,488
Air hockey, huh?

220
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:43,742
What's in there for today?

221
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:49,502
Nothing. Although yesterday l had
a conference call with Kitty, whoever that is.

222
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:53,336
Kitty - she's a friend of yours.
You work with her sometimes.

223
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:57,469
You do commercial interior design.
lt's just freelance right now,

224
00:20:57,554 --> 00:21:01,254
but you wanna expand
when Kim goes off to college.

225
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:05,596
How come l can sort of remember air hockey
but l can't remember what l do for a living?

226
00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:07,763
(doorbell rings)

227
00:21:08,315 --> 00:21:10,687
- Maybe that's Jack.
- He wouldn't ring the bell.

228
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:16,481
lt's probably my friend Chris. Remember? l
wanted someone here, to be on the safe side.

229
00:21:16,573 --> 00:21:19,064
- Yeah.
- Stay here, just in case.

230
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,498
- (man) Hey, Phil.
- (Phil) Hey, Chris. Thanks for coming.

231
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,414
- Teri, this is Chris.
- Hi.

232
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,007
- Why does he have a gun?
- He's here to...

233
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:40,965
l don't care. Get him
outta the house with that gun.

234
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:44,140
Chris, will you just
give us a couple of minutes, OK?

235
00:21:44,225 --> 00:21:46,716
- Yeah. Sure.
- Thanks.

236
00:21:51,483 --> 00:21:55,777
- Teri, Chris is a friend of mine...
- That doesn't mean anything to me.

237
00:21:55,862 --> 00:21:59,990
l don't know who you are. l don't know
who he is. l don't want any guns.

238
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:03,408
OK. l'll tell him to stay outside. ls that OK?

239
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:07,658
But we need him here, just in case.

240
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:11,794
Teri, your husband could have been
the one who roughed you up.

241
00:22:11,878 --> 00:22:13,954
l want you safe.

242
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,167
Teri, look at me.

243
00:22:19,094 --> 00:22:21,170
Look at me.

244
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:25,174
l'm your friend.

245
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:28,552
You trust me. You told me so yourself.

246
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:32,432
So you're gonna have to trust my judgment.

247
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:36,814
OK.

248
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:42,032
- (Andre) What's going on over there?
- The wife is here.

249
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:43,825
- The daughter?
- No.

250
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:48,244
- What are you waiting for?
- There's a little interference.

251
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:51,285
But it'll pass soon. Didyou findAlexis?

252
00:22:51,376 --> 00:22:53,119
Not yet.

253
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:55,963
- Call me when it's done.
- Yes.

254
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:15,392
(woman) Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
if you will please take your seats now.

255
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:19,433
Senator Palmer is just about here.
We will begin.

256
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:36,910
(man) Senator Palmer?

257
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,926
Last night l received a phone call
regarding my son, Keith,

258
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:45,134
and my daughter, Nicole.

259
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:50,726
That call has unfortunately set offa chain
ofevents that has culminated in a tragedy.

260
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:58,268
Whether or not what l have to say jeopardises
my campaign is for the voters to decide.

261
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,648
l'm doing this for my family.

262
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:06,235
A large portion ofthe
financial support for my campaign

263
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:10,952
comes from a group ofbusinessmen
right here in Los Angeles.

264
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,416
- Every presidential campaign relies on...
- l'll take care of it.

265
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:19,202
Too late, Carl.

266
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:23,674
l have apparently misjudged
these local businessmen.

267
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,509
More importantly, they have misjudged me.

268
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:40,394
(Palmer) How it was acquired,
l am not at liberty to say.

269
00:24:41,277 --> 00:24:46,948
l have already handed this incriminating tape
over to the Justice Department.

270
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,987
Whether or not it's admissible in court,

271
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:54,870
it will still implicate the men
who have been supporting my campaign.

272
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:57,993
l'll emphasise again

273
00:24:58,086 --> 00:25:02,582
that these men acted without
my consent or my knowledge.

274
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:07,541
As for my son, Keith,

275
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:14,425
he is prepared to turn himselfin and face any
consequences a grandjury deems necessary.

276
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:19,147
He is my son, and l love him.

277
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:22,516
And l will stand by him.

278
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,611
l am confident that
when presented with the facts

279
00:25:25,697 --> 00:25:30,158
it will be clear that there was
no criminal intent or wrongdoing.

280
00:25:30,243 --> 00:25:34,111
He will only be guilty
ofnot reporting an accident.

281
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,032
As for my daughter, Nicole,

282
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:45,924
it is important for everyone to remember
she was the victim of a horrible crime.

283
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:48,926
A physical and psychological crime.

284
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:53,008
She is not a source ofinformation.

285
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:58,928
This is about the cover-up
ofan accidental death.

286
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:02,685
This is not about rape.

287
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:08,197
So l'm asking you now, as a father,
please find your humanity

288
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:12,658
and spare Nicole the indignity
of having to relive this nightmare.

289
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:20,417
- (man) We lost track of both of 'em.
- (Nina) How long have you known this?

290
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:23,040
- Does Jack know about this?
- Nina. Nina!

291
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:26,047
- Not that l'm aware of.
- Did you know the safe house was hit?

292
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:29,382
- Relax, OK?
- Tony, answer me!

293
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:33,049
- Yes, l knew.
- Why didn't you tell me?!

294
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:37,267
Look, Mason didn't want you to know
cos he didn't want you to tell Jack.

295
00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:39,843
His family is missing! He should know that.

296
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:43,982
Yeah, l'm with you on this.
Look, Mason gave the order, all right?

297
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:47,151
He's deployed resources.
He's called locals to help find 'em.

298
00:26:47,237 --> 00:26:49,775
You should have told me. You work for me.

299
00:26:49,864 --> 00:26:52,237
And you work for Mason.

300
00:26:53,868 --> 00:26:57,866
This is my fault.
l should never have left Teri and Kim.

301
00:26:57,956 --> 00:27:01,539
Nina, you're not a field agent, all right?
What could you have done?

302
00:27:01,626 --> 00:27:04,034
Jack needs to know about this.

303
00:27:07,424 --> 00:27:09,500
(phone rings)

304
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:14,127
- Mason.
- Have you told Jack about his family yet?

305
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:18,599
- No, we're not there yet.
- You can't do this. You have to tell him.

306
00:27:18,685 --> 00:27:22,552
- Uh-huh.
- Let him know so he can help us find them.

307
00:27:22,647 --> 00:27:25,601
They're exposed.
lf Drazen's people find them first...

308
00:27:25,692 --> 00:27:28,728
- That's a good idea.
- Listen to me, George.

309
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,948
lf anything happens to them he's gonna
hold you responsible. Think about that.

310
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:35,524
l will. OK, let me know
if you have any progress.

311
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:38,192
George!

312
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:40,779
Nina...

313
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:48,461
Jack, my battery just died.
Can l use your phone for a sec?

314
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:51,121
Yeah, sure.

315
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:53,214
Thanks.

316
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:02,058
(ringing tone)

317
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:06,558
Yeah, it's me. No, all l wanna say is
keep the backup units on stand-by, all right?

318
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,193
(woman) The cellular customer
you are trying to reach is unavailable.

319
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,197
- OK.
- l got a signal.

320
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:42,099
- What'd Nina have to say?
- She's just checking our location.

321
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:43,976
What does GPS say?

322
00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:47,846
lt doesn't make sense. lt's saying
the address is right up ahead.

323
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:51,357
l know the whole thing was hush-hush,
but who was Victor Drazen?

324
00:28:51,444 --> 00:28:55,940
Drazen was Milosevic's shadow. He was
in charge of all of his covert operations.

325
00:28:56,032 --> 00:29:00,943
He was responsible for organising the ethnic
cleansing campaigns in Kosovo, Sarajevo

326
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:03,362
and Bosnia.

327
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:05,828
- Your unit took him out?
- That's right.

328
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:08,408
- You rolled the whole deal up?
- Yeah.

329
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:15,131
So who'd have the kind of influence to run an
operation like this against you and Palmer?

330
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:18,753
My guess would be Serbian military exiles.
They could pull this off.

331
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:22,097
Alexis and Andre pulled together
a cell without us knowing.

332
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:26,395
lt's a hell of a cell to be able
to infiltrate the CTU, turn Jamey.

333
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:32,185
l agree. lt's hard to believe Jamey could work
against us without some kind of umbrella.

334
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:37,064
Any ideas why the Serbs
would wanna spend this much money

335
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:40,111
to turn the power off
in the middle of the woods?

336
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:42,277
No.

337
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:48,121
George, look. A power transformer.

338
00:29:59,346 --> 00:30:01,837
The lock on it's new.

339
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:06,971
Why would this be designated
as a wildlife sanctuary? Think about it.

340
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:11,640
There's no water. No water, no wetlands.
No wetlands, no birds, no animals...

341
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:14,568
No nothing, as far as l can make out.

342
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,361
(knock on door)

343
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:26,787
Here they are, man. Let's get ready.

344
00:30:35,674 --> 00:30:37,962
Right on time. l like that.

345
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:55,312
- Who the hell's this?
- Just some friends of mine. lt's cool.

346
00:31:00,198 --> 00:31:02,819
How you know Frankie?

347
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,985
l'm a friend of Rick's.

348
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:07,367
Who's Rick?

349
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:11,916
- l am.
- Ah. And what happened to you?

350
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:14,623
We gonna play twenty questions
or do business?

351
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:19,006
l just wanna know who's in the room.
You got a problem with that?

352
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,922
No, man. Knock yourself out. Get a medical
history, take a urine sample for all l care.

353
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:27,340
Let's just get on with it. Come on.

354
00:31:29,602 --> 00:31:35,641
- Fine. Let's do this. Got the cash, Frankie?
- l got what you need. Let's see the E first.

355
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:37,810
OK.

356
00:31:39,904 --> 00:31:44,613
Pure MDMA. No caffeine. Wanna check it?

357
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:47,574
No, man. l trust you.

358
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:53,116
All right, homey. Where's the money?

359
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:57,417
Did you hear that?

360
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,581
This guy called me ''homey''.

361
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,999
l got your money.

362
00:32:02,093 --> 00:32:04,584
lt's right here.

363
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:12,469
Stand down!

364
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:20,020
Come on, homey.
Stand down or you're eating one.

365
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:23,987
You pull that trigger, you're going down too.

366
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:29,360
Let's just do 'em! Let's do 'em.

367
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:36,249
All right.

368
00:32:36,336 --> 00:32:40,120
Everybody chill out, man. lt's all cool.
We're gonna put the guns down.

369
00:32:40,215 --> 00:32:42,540
On the ground. Nice and easy.

370
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:46,679
- lt's going down.
- Let's go. See what else they got on 'em.

371
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:48,637
Get down.

372
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:52,808
All this cos you couldn't
keep my brother alive.

373
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:14,031
They might not have registered
with their real names.

374
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:17,658
No, just use the description
that we sent you, OK?

375
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:23,171
- You checking the hospitals?
- Yes.

376
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:26,461
l don't understand how
Teri and Kim just disappeared.

377
00:33:26,553 --> 00:33:31,891
Well, it might be a good thing. lf Drazen's
people had them, we'd have heard about it.

378
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:34,810
After all, Jack and Palmer
are the primary targets.

379
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:38,678
- What about Jack's house?
- l sent Williams over, but l'll check on him.

380
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:42,723
- And Kim's phone call?
- A phone booth. We're checking the area.

381
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:45,903
Look, Nina, we're doing
everything we can, right?

382
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,065
Are you?

383
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:19,178
What you gonna do now, man? Kill us?

384
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:29,231
Yeah.

385
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:35,865
l'll kill you...

386
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:38,447
if l ever see you again.

387
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:43,701
You should get that stitched, man.

388
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:48,374
- How's that for a nose job?
- Pretty good. l like it.

389
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:54,132
- Hey, Frankie?
- What's that, homey?

390
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:00,017
Speak up.

391
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:04,309
You have the right to remain silent.

392
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:08,144
Everybody freeze!

393
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,942
(shouting)

394
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:25,461
- Arrest all of 'em.
- Please, don't do this. We didn't do anything.

395
00:35:25,547 --> 00:35:27,623
- We're not a part of this!
- Arms up!

396
00:35:27,716 --> 00:35:30,420
Up against the wall.

397
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:33,169
Let me have your Handie.

398
00:35:36,641 --> 00:35:39,428
This is Krugman. We got a code four.

399
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,437
One suspect down, five being booked.

400
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,807
l think l got a broken nose.

401
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:55,779
Look, l'll say it again. l bear
full responsibility for not knowing about it.

402
00:35:57,954 --> 00:36:00,326
A senator's duty,

403
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:04,282
a president's duty,
an elected representative's duty,

404
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,702
is not only to his country

405
00:36:06,796 --> 00:36:09,085
but also to his family.

406
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:15,259
lf he cannot manage the interactions
of the people close to him,

407
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:20,424
then he can't expect the electorate
to believe in his abilities to lead a nation.

408
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:24,312
l don't deny l made a mistake.

409
00:36:24,397 --> 00:36:26,888
A serious one.

410
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:33,401
l only ask you to consider that l am not
the first person in public office to make one.

411
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:36,817
Thank you.

412
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:01,554
l love you, Dad.

413
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:05,099
l love you, son.

414
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:32,997
This is Emily. She's eleven.
And this is Jennifer. She just turned nine.

415
00:37:33,925 --> 00:37:36,677
- And l didn't meet them?
- No.

416
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:41,838
We decided to leave everyone outside of it
until you were sure what you wanted.

417
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,424
- (kettle whistles)
- l'll get it.

418
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:11,787
She made this for me.

419
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:15,632
(Phil) You want milk or sugar in it?

420
00:38:15,717 --> 00:38:17,793
Yeah.

421
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:24,054
- Phil, l think l'm remembering something.
- Really? l'll be right there.

422
00:38:28,188 --> 00:38:30,893
- Rest room?
- Right down the hall.

423
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:37,939
Teri!

424
00:38:49,793 --> 00:38:51,869
Where's the girl?

425
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:56,757
Your daughter. Where is she?

426
00:38:58,093 --> 00:39:00,548
l... l don't know!

427
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:05,263
Tell me where she is and l'll make this
painless for both of you, l promise.

428
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,639
l... l don't know.

429
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:11,055
Fine.

430
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:13,354
(gunshots)

431
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:16,442
(Teri) Oh, God!

432
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:18,770
Teri, step away.

433
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:20,939
Move away, Teri.

434
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:23,950
- Oh, my God.
- Teri, step away, please!

435
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:30,821
The car... Oh, my God, the car...
(sobs hysterically)

436
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:33,538
l lost Kimberly!

437
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:35,787
(Tony) Teri, it's OK. You're safe.

438
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,956
l lost Kimberly!

439
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:05,316
GPS says this is it.

440
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:08,153
Yeah, right.

441
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:18,286
What's that? Reconnaissance?

442
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:22,670
Someone knows we're here.
