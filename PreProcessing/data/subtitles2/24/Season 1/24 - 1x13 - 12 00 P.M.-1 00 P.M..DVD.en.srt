1
00:00:02,324 --> 00:00:04,451
Previously on Point Pleasant.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,551
God knows what you did to Terry's father.

3
00:00:06,662 --> 00:00:08,562
David Burke was ready to make his change.

4
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:10,029
We're gonna take you
to the hospital.

5
00:00:10,132 --> 00:00:11,963
- They can take better care of you.
- No!

6
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:13,967
How could he do this to you?

7
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:16,401
It's not that your father doesn't see.
It's that he can't.

8
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:18,063
- Maybe Christina can help.
- No.

9
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,368
She's changing.
I think we're losing her.

10
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:24,138
You have to understand. The things
that you've been saying lately, you sound-

11
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:26,373
- I want to hear you say it.
- Crazy.

12
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:29,314
- Get out!
- My mom's really not supposed
to see anyone right now.

13
00:00:29,418 --> 00:00:31,409
- Let me talk to the doctors.
- No!

14
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,715
This is a family thing now.
Let us deal with it.

15
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:36,313
What you'll do to them will be quick and painless.

16
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:40,088
What they'll do to each other,
if you let them live- ohh.

17
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:42,755
This world is a sick dog
that needs to be put down.

18
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:45,129
Five people have vanished.
Is there anything you can tell me?

19
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:48,601
I'd like to be more helpful,
Chief, but I can't betray my vows.

20
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:50,968
Morals are the very
foundation of the church.

21
00:00:51,073 --> 00:00:53,633
If my wife turns up dead,
I'll come show you my morals.

22
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,266
- What do you see?
- You're him.

23
00:00:55,377 --> 00:00:58,141
Make the kind of deal he made.
With me by your side...

24
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:00,272
- you'll be unstoppable.
- What are you talking about?

25
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:02,748
- Let me tell you a story.
- Mom?

26
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:05,012
Tell her, Anne.
Tell her, or I will.

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,588
I'm here to kill
the child of the beast.

28
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,590
I'll do what you want, but on my terms.

29
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:14,025
Fair enough. But we kill Christina tonight.

30
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:16,097
Can you do what needs
to be done?

31
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,162
It's starting.

32
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:29,271
This is a family thing.

33
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:41,222
Still a doubter, Daddy?

34
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:44,451
- Look, Chris-
- Can we not have another big talk?

35
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:46,686
I'm so over
the heartfelt download.

36
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:49,320
- Whatever happened, we can help you.
- I'm over it.

37
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:52,730
Okay? Just want to have
a nice quiet family dinner.

38
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,132
- Is that too much to ask?
- What the hell is goin' on?

39
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:02,133
Dinner. Now.

40
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:05,179
- Just do what she says, Ben.
- Your wife's got the right idea.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,248
Again.

42
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,341
You should try
listening to her.

43
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:13,512
Although it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

44
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:16,716
You guys don't have to look so scared.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,928
Not unless
you make me angry.

46
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,348
- What are we waiting for?
- They'll tell us when they have Christina.

47
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,852
- You're not getting cold feet, are you?
- No. I'm ready.

48
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:50,550
Jess, I'm really proud of you
for accepting this responsibility.

49
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:57,298
No matter what happens,
I'm always here for you.

50
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:01,062
You know that, right?

51
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:06,204
I had Christina.
She was lowering her guard.

52
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,071
- Oh, Boyd.
- Yeah. He survived.

53
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:12,476
- Then he has Christina.
- No. She ran. And she's growing
more powerful by the second.

54
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,708
I'm sorry. Who is she?

55
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,716
This doesn't concern you.

56
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:19,378
Anne, you're Christina's mother.

57
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:22,480
I don't think that.
Not anymore.

58
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:26,721
You were the trap.
That's how you were gonna do it?

59
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:30,457
Get her mother to tuck her in for the first time
in her life, then send me in for the kill?

60
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:33,728
- We had to use every advantage to stop her.
- But it backfired, didn't it?

61
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:37,327
- That's why it's more important
now that you get to her, Jesse.
- Sarah's right.

62
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,273
Jesse, you have to prepare.
Go to the sanctuary. Clear your mind.

63
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:44,004
As soon as we find her,
you're going in.

64
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:55,115
And that's the ugly truth.

65
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:58,522
Buck up, kid.
Nothing's changed.

66
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,653
- Except you knowing you're
in the big leagues now.
- Nothing's changed?

67
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,788
Everything's changed.

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,100
Really?

69
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:09,102
Tell me.

70
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:12,605
All you've done for Boyd
and where you are now...

71
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:14,675
would you take it back?

72
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:18,278
Yeah. Okay.

73
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,373
I knew Mr. Boyd's
business was shady, but...

74
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:24,509
I didn't sign up for this.

75
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:27,144
It doesn't matter how big
or small the game is.

76
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:29,280
You just did
what it takes to survive.

77
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:31,291
Well, I'm through.

78
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:35,727
- People are dying.
- Baby, it is raining death around here.

79
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:40,393
Look, the endgame is coming up fast,
and we all have to choose sides.

80
00:04:40,502 --> 00:04:44,404
The question now is,
do you want to just survive?

81
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,435
Or do you want to win?

82
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:01,546
My money's on you.

83
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,024
- I don't know.
- Well, you better know.

84
00:05:05,127 --> 00:05:07,027
Real fast.

85
00:05:13,535 --> 00:05:15,503
Terry.

86
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,896
- What was that about?
- I scared him off.

87
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:22,033
Spooky me.

88
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:24,374
Well, someone's
awfully perky.

89
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,549
Christina's gonna
take apart the Kramer's.

90
00:05:31,453 --> 00:05:34,422
And I'll be damned
if I don't get a ringside seat.

91
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:37,492
- I want us to pack up- fast.
- Where are we goin'?

92
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:40,959
If everything goes down the way I think it's gonna...

93
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:43,758
there won't be a Point Pleasant
when the night is over.

94
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:47,528
We'll hit the city.
Christina will take over daddy's corporation.

95
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:52,398
A lot of damage can be done
with those kind of resources.

96
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:54,873
And you'll be
right there with her.

97
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,811
We will.

98
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,074
As long as Team Vatican
doesn't get to her.

99
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:02,173
Look, she was born
to do this.

100
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,718
You have nothing
to worry about.

101
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,846
I've worked too hard and too long
not to see this through.

102
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:12,415
Christina needs to
take down Jesse once and for all.

103
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,395
Be ready to go.

104
00:06:20,502 --> 00:06:23,596
- To the future.
- Or lack thereof.

105
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:46,717
I wanted to tell him.

106
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:50,026
I've hidden so many things.

107
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:52,099
To keep him safe.

108
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:57,332
- He'll hate me for this.
- You can't tell him.

109
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,374
If he knows of your sacrifice,
it'll only weaken him.

110
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:12,352
Sarah.

111
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:16,720
And you-
are you ready for this?

112
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:20,693
We showed you the prophecy.
The seven must die willingly.

113
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:26,229
Bless the killing blow.

114
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,137
I know my part in this.

115
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,453
This looks so good, Mom.
Thanks.

116
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,823
Judy, you want to
lead grace?

117
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:55,020
Say grace.

118
00:07:57,866 --> 00:08:00,300
Judy.

119
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:02,734
Bless this food, Father.

120
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:06,034
Thank you for our
many blessings.

121
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,201
- Amen.
- Good. Eat.

122
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:15,111
I don't mean to be
so bossy.

123
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:17,776
I just really
need you guys right now.

124
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:20,787
It's been a tough
couple of days.

125
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:28,018
I guess we should get a few things
out there for Dad's benefit.

126
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,791
Ben, my birth parents.

127
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,732
Dad is the devil,
and it turns out Mom's a bitch.

128
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:36,531
- What is she-
- Christina, please. What happened?

129
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:39,937
- I met her. Anne.
- It didn't go well.

130
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,737
Understatement.
Pass the bread.

131
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:47,475
There are these guys from the Vatican-
soldiers or something.

132
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:50,073
They're here to kill me.
Anne's here to help 'em do it.

133
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:53,382
- Christina, I am so-
- Sorry? Me too.

134
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:56,013
She was
my final hope, right?

135
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:58,649
- To keep from going all Antichristy.
- Oh, this is insane.

136
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,388
- You still have hope.
- I don't know.

137
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:05,796
I think I've been just a little too focused
on the whole good versus evil thing.

138
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,301
I mean, ultimately, it's just about getting
what you want, right?

139
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,839
- Elbows.
- What?

140
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:17,002
Your elbows
are on the table.

141
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:20,946
- Oh.
- I've been thinking a lot about it, and...

142
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,678
we don't call animals evil,
and they take what they want.

143
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:27,277
- Kill.
- But you're not an animal.

144
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:29,482
Sure I am.

145
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,126
We all are.
Right, Dad?

146
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:37,531
- I'm not your father.
- Dad.

147
00:09:37,632 --> 00:09:40,658
- I don't know what you are, but I didn't make you.
- What?

148
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,001
I want you out of
this house right now.

149
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:48,132
- Ben, please.
- I don't think that's what Meg wants.

150
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:53,012
- Or what Judy wants, is it?
- Uh-uh.

151
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,674
- No. Of course not.
- See?

152
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:58,116
You think you understand.

153
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:00,551
- I do. I understand fine.
- You don't.

154
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:04,223
You have no idea.

155
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:07,192
You've been completely oblivious
to what your family's been going through.

156
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:10,287
I knew something was wrong when
you walked through that door. I knew!

157
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:12,730
I'm not the problem here!

158
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:15,668
It's you.

159
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,171
You've been blind.

160
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:20,571
- Oh, my God!
- Dad!

161
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:29,245
Blind as a bat.

162
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:06,745
- Here.
- Thanks.

163
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:10,188
Ben, honey.
We're going to put this on your eyes.

164
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,191
Ow.

165
00:11:12,293 --> 00:11:15,285
You can undo this.
Please.

166
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,627
It seems harsh. I know.
But it's gonna be good for him.

167
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,633
For all of you.
He'll learn how to listen.

168
00:11:20,735 --> 00:11:21,895
No.

169
00:11:22,003 --> 00:11:24,130
You've taught him
his lesson. He gets it.

170
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:26,298
I'm telling you.
It's for the best.

171
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,399
Okay. Christina, why don't
you and I go clear the dishes?

172
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:32,207
I want dessert.

173
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:48,154
- I'm here, Daddy.
- Oh, good.

174
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,937
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

175
00:11:57,038 --> 00:11:59,006
You did.

176
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:03,777
- But I know that you don't want to hurt us.
- I don't.

177
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:05,846
I really don't.

178
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:10,646
Ben shouldn't have
spoken to you like that.

179
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:13,016
He knows that.

180
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,850
But can't you help him?

181
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:17,083
Please.

182
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,328
I'll stop the pain.

183
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:23,863
But he stays blind.

184
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:50,891
Oh, for the love of-

185
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:54,762
Holly!

186
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:04,204
F-

187
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:09,203
Damn it.

188
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:31,165
Oh, damn it.

189
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:38,538
She wanted to be alone.
She said she needed to concentrate.

190
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,269
- We shouldn't have left him alone with her.
- What was I supposed to do?

191
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:44,470
She made me leave.

192
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:49,883
She's gonna kill us,
isn't she?

193
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:53,283
No. It's not over.

194
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:56,915
Other people know what's happening,
and they're trying to help us.

195
00:13:57,025 --> 00:14:00,461
- What other people?
- I'm not the only one who can see, Judy.

196
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,461
We're not alone.

197
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:26,313
- Mr. Burke.
- How they treating you, Jess?

198
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:28,753
You need to be in bed.

199
00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:32,292
No. I thought
I was sick- dying-

200
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,384
but I was just changing
into something else.

201
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:41,562
Why he picked a wreck like me
to deliver the message, I'll never know.

202
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:44,661
Maybe he does favor
the meek after all.

203
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,297
- Mr. Burke.
- They're wrong, Jesse.

204
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:51,139
Those guys with their books.
They've made it all so complicated...

205
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,179
when it should be so simple.

206
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,976
Thou shalt not kill.

207
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,520
- What are you talking about?
- Jesse.

208
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:09,087
Are you all right?

209
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:11,165
Do you need anything?

210
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:15,433
No. I'm-

211
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:17,504
I'm okay.

212
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,810
Chief, do you copy?

213
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:35,555
- Yeah.
- Sorry to disturb you, sir.

214
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:38,420
- Is it my wife? Is she okay?
- No, sir. That's not it.

215
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:42,622
Some residents from Magnolia Street
called this morning. Mr. and Mrs. Jensen.

216
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,221
It's like the others.
They just disappeared.

217
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,597
- That's seven people in two days.
- Get this.

218
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:50,899
The Jensens met with their attorney
this morning, revising their will.

219
00:15:51,005 --> 00:15:53,701
They're leaving their entire
estate to St. Martin's.

220
00:15:55,843 --> 00:15:57,868
I'll handle this.
All right?

221
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:10,580
Stale cookies for the Antichrist.
Think that's gonna fly?

222
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:12,659
It's all we've got,
and she's not-

223
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,696
- Well, not yet.
- Yeah. When she's totally gone, she'll eat our...

224
00:16:16,798 --> 00:16:18,766
heads on a stick.

225
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,458
I- I really
thought that-

226
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:28,135
I was so stupid.

227
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,178
I really cared about her.

228
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,406
You weren't stupid, honey.

229
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:37,513
Caring about Christina
was the only choice you had.

230
00:16:38,986 --> 00:16:41,648
It's the only choice any of us have
if we want to survive.

231
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:44,350
That doesn't make any sense.

232
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,688
We gotta get out of here.

233
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:50,787
We have to run. You know, I say we grab Dad
when she's not looking, and we bail.

234
00:16:50,898 --> 00:16:52,798
- Judy-
- Cut the platitudes, Mom.

235
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,926
Okay? We're stuck
in a house with a psycho.

236
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:00,265
Ben's ready
to come downstairs.

237
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:02,342
He's feeling better.

238
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:08,877
- Mom.
- Let me handle this.

239
00:17:16,624 --> 00:17:18,592
Holly!

240
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:26,496
Holly!

241
00:17:32,406 --> 00:17:35,273
You ungrateful-

242
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:37,344
She didn't mean it.

243
00:17:38,846 --> 00:17:41,246
This isn't gonna work, Meg.

244
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,840
It's okay to call me Mom.

245
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:48,185
- We're family. You know that.
- Step.

246
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,849
It's okay. Step.

247
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:58,028
I always wished
I had a sister.

248
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,259
But I'm not gonna
beg Judy to like me.

249
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:03,337
She's scared, Christina,
but she loves you.

250
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:05,530
- Really?
- Like I do.

251
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:12,344
We just want you to come back to us-
the way you were.

252
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:22,986
It's Jesse. Leave a message.

253
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,253
It's Judy.
She's in the house.

254
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,659
I sure as hell hope you do know
how to kill her, Jesse.

255
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,623
Tell him I said hi.

256
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,932
I can't believe
you called him.

257
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:43,169
- Christina, I'm- I'm sorry.
- She wasn't trying to-

258
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,472
Let us finish.

259
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:54,850
I tried with you.
I really have.

260
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:57,424
But you fought it
from the beginning.

261
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:00,585
- What? I fought what?
- Me!

262
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:02,925
You were jealous.

263
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,668
I had a connection.

264
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,170
- Meg loved me.
- No.

265
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:14,605
What you did for her-
I was grateful.

266
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:17,439
Hardly.

267
00:19:17,545 --> 00:19:20,742
- When Isabelle died, you were
glad. Got to be the only one.
- No.

268
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:24,375
- Your heart wasn't in it when
you asked me to bring her back.
- Oh, my God!

269
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,045
Don't you think I would have
begged you if I didn't think...

270
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:29,782
- she was gonna come back as some sort of thing?
- You didn't want competition.

271
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,915
- Christina, stop.
- That's not true.

272
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:36,122
God, if you were a person,
you'd see how much I miss her...

273
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,130
how much I want her to be here.

274
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:43,202
Are you sure about that?

275
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:57,545
You have to use this blade,
and you must not waver.

276
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:01,212
She may try to trick you-
maybe even play on your love.

277
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:04,324
I won't let her get to me.

278
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:06,290
I swear.

279
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:16,103
These cookies are stale.

280
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:21,074
Isabelle won't mind.

281
00:20:23,778 --> 00:20:26,269
So is she.

282
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:36,120
Now...

283
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,090
if I were a person...

284
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:41,787
I might feel bad for doing this,
but I don't.

285
00:20:41,896 --> 00:20:44,160
You know why?

286
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:46,859
- 'Cause you don't listen.
- What do you want from us?

287
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:50,334
What he means is
how can we help you?

288
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:55,271
You need to stop asking that.
Don't you get it?

289
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:57,606
Get what?

290
00:20:57,711 --> 00:21:00,271
I'm here to help you.

291
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,350
Somebody's here.

292
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:15,395
Paula?

293
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:20,461
- How did you get in here?
- Where's Paula? I need to talk to her.

294
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:23,833
- If you think I am letting you
near her, you're crazy. Get out.
- It's important.

295
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:27,567
You may have Paula fooled into thinking
that you love her, but I don't trust you.

296
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:30,143
- I don't trust anyone that works for Lucas Boyd.
- Fine.

297
00:21:30,244 --> 00:21:33,736
- Just hear me out, and you'll
never have to see me again.
- I'm listening.

298
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:36,214
Leave Point Pleasant. Now.

299
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:39,352
- Boyd put you up to this?
- No.

300
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:43,412
Look, there's a reason
why Boyd became friends with both of us.

301
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:45,992
We didn't have far
to fall.

302
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:49,256
- You don't know me.
- Paula talks.

303
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:53,659
Deep down you know
what's happening here.

304
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:56,031
That's why you stopped
talking to Boyd.

305
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:58,264
That's why you don't
want me with Paula.

306
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:07,037
I know you want to
protect her.

307
00:22:12,153 --> 00:22:16,920
Okay. So, what? Just run away
and pretend like we never had a life here?

308
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:19,458
You won't have one
if you stay.

309
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:31,635
Oh!
Cute. Cute.

310
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:36,109
Sealed the place up.

311
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,644
- Smart.
- I don't like surprise visitors.

312
00:22:38,746 --> 00:22:41,078
You're late.

313
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:47,114
I would have been here sooner,
but I had to put out a fire.

314
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,980
- Logan.
- Sarah.

315
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,954
Oh, isn't this
a domestic scene.

316
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:07,363
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to the new arrival?

317
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:10,266
Don't gloat.
This has nothing to do with you.

318
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:13,499
I should have listened to you-
both of you.

319
00:24:14,908 --> 00:24:17,342
We're going to
get through this.

320
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:20,772
Talk. Jesse'll be here soon.

321
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:22,849
Excellent. Are you ready?

322
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,850
I'm looking forward to it.

323
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:27,250
When it's over,
it's time to go.

324
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:30,152
- We have bigger things to attend to.
- Not yet.

325
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:32,725
I'm not done here.

326
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:35,624
People don't know how to act,
what's good for them.

327
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:38,596
- They need to be trained.
- How's it goin'?

328
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:43,470
- It'll take some time.
- You see? That's just it.

329
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,004
You don't have enough time.

330
00:24:46,106 --> 00:24:48,597
You'll never
get that dog to heel.

331
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:52,372
Burn it down, Christina-
the house, the town.

332
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:55,505
This world was an experiment,
and it failed.

333
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:57,880
Your dad sees that.

334
00:24:57,985 --> 00:25:01,079
And so do you.
Let it end.

335
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:04,851
It's Jesse.

336
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:08,291
Oh. What's that look? Oh, don't tell me
you still have a soft spot.

337
00:25:08,395 --> 00:25:11,228
- You know why he came here.
- I'm ready.

338
00:25:11,332 --> 00:25:14,597
- I want him to hurt.
- But do you want him to die?

339
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:21,363
Aaah!

340
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:55,801
You should have tried the balcony, Romeo.

341
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,324
Chris would do this
herself, but...

342
00:26:14,595 --> 00:26:16,460
she's feeling
a little fragile.

343
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,694
You too, it seems.

344
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:33,436
Didn't anybody ever tell you
not to play with hammers?

345
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:40,644
- What are you doing?
- Grab everything you can. We're leaving town.

346
00:26:40,754 --> 00:26:42,654
What? Are you
out of your mind?

347
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:45,452
I mean it, Paula.
We can't stay here.

348
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,289
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me why.

349
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:50,659
Terry told us
to leave town.

350
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:53,130
Something horrible is gonna happen
in Point Pleasant...

351
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:55,963
and you don't want to
be here when it does.

352
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:58,333
We're moving so I won't
see Terry anymore.

353
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:01,567
Even for you, that's insane.
You can't have your own relationship...

354
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:03,700
- so you have to destroy-
- No. It's not about us!

355
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:05,506
It is not safe here.

356
00:27:07,181 --> 00:27:09,547
Now, I swear to you, Paula.
That is the truth.

357
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,844
No.

358
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:14,079
If it was, Terry would
talk to me, not you.

359
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:15,917
Okay. Fine.

360
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:18,287
If you need to
hear it from him-

361
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,525
- Hello?
- Hey, Terry.

362
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:30,364
My mom's flipping out.
Um, did you tell us to leave town?

363
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:32,371
Yeah, I did.
And you should.

364
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:35,772
- What? Why?
- Do it. Go.

365
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:40,336
- I'm not going anywhere until I
can see you and you explain-
- I'm done with you, okay?

366
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:43,280
The whole thing was hotter
when you were Jesse's girl.

367
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:48,551
Listen to your mom. Get out of here.

368
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,439
You're okay.

369
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:53,183
What is going on?

370
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:56,245
There were other people here.

371
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:59,617
They're getting ready.

372
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:03,025
- I should be too. I don't have much time.
- What? I don't-

373
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,260
I don't understand. Sarah,
do you have any idea how worried I've been?

374
00:29:09,403 --> 00:29:12,839
The other people-They're the ones
that have been missing around town, aren't they?

375
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:20,378
Irwin Brewster, Victor Garby. Why?
Why not let people know that they're okay?

376
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:24,183
We didn't want anyone
to try and stop us.

377
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:30,348
The seven of us have been called
to sacrifice ourselves tonight.

378
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:34,393
- What?
- Jesse is on his way to kill Christina Nickson.

379
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:38,794
It's his destiny, Logan.
It's why he died and came back.

380
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:42,733
She is not human.
She is... something evil.

381
00:29:42,836 --> 00:29:45,737
- Sarah, can you hear yourself?
- I know how this must sound to you.

382
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,468
You have to listen to me.
We don't have time.

383
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:53,342
When he kills her, our souls will be there,
ready to take hers to heaven.

384
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,506
Sarah, you-you can't
believe this stuff.

385
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:58,210
It's what I have to do.

386
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,616
You are the love
of my life, Logan.

387
00:30:02,723 --> 00:30:04,714
I hope you believe that.

388
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:07,692
And Jesse couldn't have
asked for a better father.

389
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:10,024
All right. Just stop.
Listen to me.

390
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,291
This is a death cult.
Do you understand?

391
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,526
- Somebody has sold you a pack of lies.
- No.

392
00:30:14,635 --> 00:30:18,196
Someday I hope you understand
I did this for you.

393
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,379
Sarah.

394
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:29,616
Sarah.!

395
00:30:30,717 --> 00:30:32,685
Sarah!

396
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:44,553
- Oh, great.
- Boyd?

397
00:30:50,203 --> 00:30:52,296
Boyd.

398
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,914
You shouldn't be able to
get in here unless I want you to.

399
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,484
- Maybe you do.
- Interesting.

400
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:12,818
I'm over my death wish,
so that's not it.

401
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:17,429
Maybe I wanted a booty call.

402
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:20,261
Last time was good for me.

403
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:23,131
- I mean, obvious problems toward the end.
- Christina...

404
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:26,501
you wanted me to come in
because you want help.

405
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:32,943
You're not gonna be
any fun, are you?

406
00:31:38,952 --> 00:31:40,442
Christina, don't.!

407
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:42,981
Know why he's here?

408
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,785
Yes, I do.
And you both need to stop.

409
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:46,916
He's here
to use this on me.

410
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:48,153
No!

411
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:50,525
Stay out of it.

412
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:55,123
This is gonna be
a short date.

413
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,636
Maybe not.

414
00:32:03,744 --> 00:32:05,678
You make me stronger.
Remember?

415
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:13,515
Sarah!

416
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:46,043
You must have
broken Boyd up real good.

417
00:32:46,153 --> 00:32:48,678
- He won't be coming to help you.
- He won't need to.

418
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:55,650
Christina! Jesse! Please listen!

419
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:01,698
Thou shalt not-
Thou shalt not-

420
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:03,565
Thou shalt not-
Thou shalt not-

421
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,172
Thou shalt not-
Thou shalt not-

422
00:33:05,172 --> 00:33:06,332
Thou shalt not-
Thou shalt not-

423
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:09,306
Thou shalt not-
Thou shalt not-

424
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:13,573
And you shall be cleansed
of all your stains, sayeth the Lord.

425
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,808
- Lord, have mercy.
- Lord, have mercy.

426
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:19,078
Lead us not
into temptation.

427
00:33:19,186 --> 00:33:21,120
But deliver us from evil.

428
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:24,213
Lord, heed my prayer.

429
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:27,589
Let my cry be heard by him.

430
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:29,685
The Lord be with you.

431
00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:31,764
And also with you.

432
00:33:35,735 --> 00:33:39,227
Christina,
you're in there. I know it.

433
00:33:39,339 --> 00:33:41,603
"In there"?

434
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,767
This is me.

435
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:47,210
That whiny wimp of a girl-
she's the one who should be buried.

436
00:33:47,314 --> 00:33:50,977
- "I don't want to hurt anybody.
Where's my mommy?"
- No. Listen.

437
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:54,281
- I don't want to kill you.
- And I don't want to kill you.

438
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:56,412
Oh, wait. Actually, I do.

439
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:59,048
I swear.
That's not why I'm here.

440
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,319
You know, the big brown eyes
say sincere...

441
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:04,329
but the knife in your hand
is throwing me.

442
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:06,592
I had to play along,
make 'em think I was with them.

443
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,136
Everybody you cared about
has hurt you, abandoned you.

444
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:13,729
And I did too. And I'm sorry.
But I won't do it again.

445
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:21,011
Do you honestly
expect me to buy this?

446
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:24,106
You ran away.
You left me!

447
00:34:24,217 --> 00:34:26,242
I got scared.

448
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:30,289
I saw what might happen,
but it doesn't have to end like that.

449
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,688
I need you
to beat this, Christina.

450
00:34:32,792 --> 00:34:36,660
- And I'm not the only one.
You can bring such hope.
- To who?

451
00:34:36,763 --> 00:34:40,358
People are too stupid to fix themselves.
It's too late.

452
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:43,994
Dear God in heaven,
I entreat you, blessed our Father...

453
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:48,404
to guide these souls to safety
as they enter the gates of heaven...

454
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:53,172
and deliver unto you
the spirit of Satan's progeny...

455
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,306
through Christ, our Lord.

456
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,941
Amen.

457
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,157
I know who you are.
You can change things. We can-

458
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:09,057
You're wrong.

459
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,198
You're just muscle.

460
00:35:14,434 --> 00:35:17,130
Dumb muscle.

461
00:35:20,774 --> 00:35:22,799
Then kill me.

462
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:26,738
Go ahead.
Kill me.

463
00:35:26,846 --> 00:35:30,976
'Cause if you're gone,
I don't want to be here.

464
00:35:33,353 --> 00:35:35,753
I love you, Christina.

465
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:45,025
Yes. That's right.

466
00:35:45,131 --> 00:35:46,996
- That's right.
- What?

467
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:06,716
Don't say that.

468
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,345
I do.

469
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:11,754
Don't.

470
00:36:11,858 --> 00:36:14,554
Then do it.

471
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:26,437
Jesse.

472
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:36,781
Jesse.

473
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,599
Jesse.

474
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,479
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

475
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,946
and of the Holy Spirit.

476
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:16,354
Spiritus Sancti.
Amen.

477
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:20,455
Help him.

478
00:37:42,649 --> 00:37:45,447
And I had
such a crush on you.

479
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:51,624
You got me.

480
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:55,452
And I had you pegged
for a terrible liar.

481
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:58,656
I meant it-
that I love you.

482
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:02,064
- So much you had to gut me?
- To save you from what you'll do.

483
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:04,568
Christina. Jesse.
What's happening?

484
00:38:06,206 --> 00:38:09,141
I think it's time for the lifeguard
to see some people die.

485
00:38:09,242 --> 00:38:11,335
- No.
- Everybody drop the knives.

486
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:13,378
Drop 'em.

487
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,471
- Step back.
- You don't understand.

488
00:38:18,685 --> 00:38:20,585
Jesse!

489
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:23,315
- Mom, don't.
- What did you do?

490
00:38:23,423 --> 00:38:24,890
- I did what they told me to.
- No.

491
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,824
They told you this would work?

492
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:31,488
The God guys?
They need some new leadership.

493
00:38:31,598 --> 00:38:33,896
God has nothing
to do with them.

494
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,695
He sent you a message.

495
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:38,362
Through David Burke.
That was real. Not the church.

496
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,063
What was he supposed to do?

497
00:38:40,173 --> 00:38:42,937
Love her?
I mean, look at her. She's gone.

498
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,340
- Hi. Standing right here.
- No, you're not.

499
00:38:45,445 --> 00:38:48,209
You're the thing
that took Christina, my friend.

500
00:38:48,314 --> 00:38:51,841
You know what? If you're gonna hurt us,
just do it. Because I'm sick of being scared.

501
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,350
No.

502
00:38:55,388 --> 00:38:56,514
No!

503
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,890
- Jesse.!
- Jesse!

504
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,994
I'm sorry.

505
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:12,503
Oh, my God.

506
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,403
Boyd was right.

507
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,104
Let's get this thing
over with.

508
00:39:32,659 --> 00:39:35,594
Please! You can stop this.

509
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:43,168
Someone took his
"get out of death free" card.

510
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:49,439
Bye, Mom.

511
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:51,169
Bye, Sis.

512
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:58,646
Ben! Ben!

513
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:07,753
- Isabelle.
- Daddy.

514
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:12,120
I can see you.

515
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:30,746
The shaking.
What does it mean?

516
00:40:31,784 --> 00:40:34,218
It means we failed.

517
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:48,364
Christina.

518
00:40:50,103 --> 00:40:52,799
You did it, baby.

519
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:55,567
I could feel his
death rattle from here.

520
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:59,678
Oh, well, he-

521
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:01,747
he busted me up all right.

522
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:03,873
Help me, would ya?

523
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:06,417
Come on.

524
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:09,579
Come on. We can be
in Manhattan by breakfast.

525
00:41:11,324 --> 00:41:13,519
It's over, Chris.

526
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:16,424
We won.

527
00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:21,098
No.

528
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,168
I won.

529
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:33,479
That's my girl.

530
00:41:45,058 --> 00:41:47,026
We lost her.

531
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:50,584
- It's over.
- Not yet.

532
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:55,033
Not as long as
we're still alive.

533
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:05,544
It's not over.

534
00:42:05,645 --> 00:42:09,376
We have to go after Christina,
and if we save her, we can save ourselves.

535
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:16,411
And if we can't save her...

536
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:19,047
we kill the bitch.

537
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:06,965
The city.
Take the long way.

538
00:43:07,073 --> 00:43:10,975
I want to enjoy the sights.

539
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,038
Yes, sir. It's the dawn
of a whole new day.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
