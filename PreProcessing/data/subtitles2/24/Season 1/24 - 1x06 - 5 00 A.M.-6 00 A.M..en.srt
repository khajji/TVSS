1
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:25,323
- (nurse) She's crashing. Get Dr Collier.
- (nurse #2) She's on her way in.

2
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:28,285
- What have we got?
- (nurse) BP's dropping. She's in v-tach.

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:32,420
- (anaesthetist) BP's 90/50.
- Give her an amp of epi. Let's go at 200.

4
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:34,331
(nurse) Yes, Doctor.

5
00:00:34,423 --> 00:00:36,499
(anaesthetist) Epi's in.

6
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:41,043
- (nurse) Start.
- (Dr Collier) Clear.

7
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,008
- (nurse #2) Nothing.
- Again. 300.

8
00:00:47,102 --> 00:00:50,056
- (nurse #2) 300. Start.
- (Dr Collier) Clear.

9
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:56,107
- (anaesthetist) Blood pressure still dropping.
- (nurse) Nothing. Doctor?

10
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:59,900
- (Dr Collier) Go again.
- (nurse) 360. Charge.

11
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,481
- (Dr Collier) Clear.
- (nurse) Clear.

12
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,778
(nurse) No rhythm.

13
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:12,242
(nurse #2) One more time.

14
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:15,088
- (Dr Collier) Charge.
- (nurse) 360. Charge.

15
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,046
(nurse) Clear.

16
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:19,208
(cellphone rings)

17
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,382
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

18
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:26,224
- Jack, where are you?
- l'm still in the West Side.

19
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:30,223
- You said you were coming here.
- l'll be there soon. ls Janet out of surgery?

20
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:33,432
There's been a complication.
They're working on it now.

21
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:36,893
Listen. Do not let anyone near Janet
who doesn't belong there.

22
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:39,821
- What do you mean?
- l think she might be in danger.

23
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:41,814
- From whom?
- l'll explain later.

24
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:44,576
- Until then do not mention this to anyone.
- OK.

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,329
- l'll be there soon.
- OK.

26
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:51,165
(Dr Collier) Clear.

27
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,296
- Whose car?
- Penticoff was paid to pick it up

28
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,876
and get rid of this.

29
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:09,639
- Oh, my God. Who is it?
- That's what you're gonna find out.

30
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:13,012
Somehow all of this is
connected to Senator Palmer.

31
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:17,685
- They didn't leave much of his face.
- Or his fingers or teeth.

32
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:20,730
- ls the forensic here?
- Not yet. He's on his way.

33
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:25,034
Call me as soon as you got a name.

34
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:32,492
Nina! l need a favour.

35
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,872
They're starting to add up, Jack.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,997
Don't tell anyone
l requisitioned this for personal use.

37
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:39,464
Personal use?

38
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:43,166
Yes. Could you please patch me
through to hospital security?

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,305
Thank you. You know Kim's friend,
the girl she went out with tonight?

40
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:50,260
She turned up at St Mark's ER.
She got hit by a car.

41
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:52,924
- Think she knows where Kim is?
- lt's my only chance.

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,937
l'm meeting Teri at the hospital now.
Get me that name.

43
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:59,558
Yes, hello. My name is Jack Bauer.
l'm a federal agent.

44
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:03,945
l'm coming to you now but l wanted to give
you a heads-up on one of your patients.

45
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:10,568
l think her life might be in danger. Yes, l'll be
there in ten minutes. Her name is Janet York.

46
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,002
Jack requisitioned a chopper but he didn't
log a destination. Where's he going?

47
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,044
- He's tracking a lead.
- lgnoring protocol again?

48
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:27,586
First he assaults an agent,
then he breaks a prisoner out of jail.

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,428
- What the hell's going on here?
- Stop following me, Tony.

50
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:40,189
- l prefer to think of it as watching your back.
- When l need your help, l'll ask for it.

51
00:03:57,793 --> 00:04:00,794
Yeah, we got a little off schedule
but we're good now.

52
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,955
Yeah, l know.

53
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:12,724
You see what happens when you lie?

54
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,550
- Don't ever lie to me, Rick.
- l won't.

55
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:20,429
Oh, l know you won't.

56
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:23,276
- Now bury your friend.
- Where?

57
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,436
ln the ground.

58
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,326
(digging)

59
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:55,801
- We gotta get outta here.
- What do you mean ''we''?

60
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:59,593
l don't know how you hooked up with
these guys, but they don't trust you.

61
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:02,096
You just saw Gaines kill your friend.

62
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:04,397
- He's not gonna let you walk away.
- Shut up.

63
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:07,058
The only way either of us
is gonna stay alive is...

64
00:05:07,154 --> 00:05:09,859
l said shut up!

65
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,418
(TV) Sources say the senator spent the night
working on a party-unification speech

66
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,342
which he's set to deliver later...

67
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:33,638
- How did you get past Secret Service?
- Good to see you too, Sherry.

68
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:39,179
Listen. David has a meeting and the polls
open in an hour, so whatever you're doing...

69
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,761
- David asked me to come.
- Why, Carl?

70
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:44,144
l don't know.

71
00:05:53,742 --> 00:05:56,660
l've gotta get ready, and so do you.

72
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:57,575
Mm-hm.

73
00:06:02,543 --> 00:06:05,793
What's the big emergency, David?
l thought we had a game plan.

74
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,414
We did. Until l found out my son lied to me.

75
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:14,177
That he's been lying to me for seven years.

76
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:16,339
What's going on?

77
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:22,301
Why would Maureen Kingsley
run a story this big unless it were true?

78
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:26,014
Are you saying you believe
her accusation about Keith?

79
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:31,019
l'm saying my son was involved
in Gibson's death and you covered it up.

80
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:36,024
- Not only from the law, from me.
- David...

81
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:40,863
Someone altered the hospital records
to make it look like Keith wasn't involved.

82
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:43,661
That could only have been you.

83
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:48,750
Look me in the eye...

84
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:52,504
and tell me what happened.

85
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:59,304
You sure you wanna know? You might not
like what you find if you open that door.

86
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:03,678
lt's already open and l'm listening.

87
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:17,110
The night Gibson raped Nicole,

88
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:20,866
while Sherry was still at the hospital
and you were flying back,

89
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:23,446
Keith went to see Gibson.

90
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,706
How do you know this?

91
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,914
Keith told me. Your son came to me, David.

92
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:35,834
He said Gibson pulled a knife.
l took him at his word. lt was an accident.

93
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:38,929
He was defending himself.

94
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,807
So you made it look like
Keith was never there?

95
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,598
As far as l was concerned, he never was.

96
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:50,978
Why didn't we just go to the police? lf it was
self-defence, Keith would have been cleared.

97
00:07:51,068 --> 00:07:53,903
Maybe, but your career
would have been over.

98
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:56,692
Gibson was white, David.

99
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,823
- l still wouldn't have covered it up.
- Are you so sure?

100
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:06,405
lt was my decision, not yours.

101
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,965
l don't want you anywhere near me...

102
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:19,298
or my family... ever again.

103
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:23,968
You have never needed me
more than you need me now.

104
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:31,808
Get out.

105
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,277
Before you finish crucifying me...

106
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,121
save some nails for your wife.

107
00:08:46,707 --> 00:08:49,874
- Sherry didn't know anything about this.
- No?

108
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,127
How do you think Keith
got to me in the first place?

109
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:35,588
- (Rick) What are you doing?
- (Kim) What does it look like?

110
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:38,424
- l said l don't need...
- l heard.

111
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:59,695
Think l wanted to leave Janet there?

112
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:03,573
Everything just got so crazy.

113
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:09,029
All we had to do was hang out with you guys.

114
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:12,492
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
None of this was supposed to go down.

115
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:15,918
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- l don't know.

116
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:20,963
- Smoking that's really gonna help.
- l just can't believe this is happening.

117
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:23,922
lt is, and you can sit there
feeling sorry for yourself

118
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:28,057
or you can get up and help me figure
out a way to get us out of here.

119
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:00,709
- Claude Davenport. Hospital security.
- Jack Bauer. Thanks for mobilising.

120
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,003
l put a man at each end of the lCU corridor.
Should lock it down.

121
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:07,131
- They know not to let anyone in or out?
- Only hospital staff.

122
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,132
- Good.
- Tell me what this is about?

123
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:11,550
l wish l could.

124
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:13,720
- Teri.
- Jack.

125
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,772
- Thank God. Thank God.
- lt's OK. lt's OK. l'm here now.

126
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:23,187
Oh, don't leave me.
Don't ever leave me again. OK?

127
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,985
l promise l won't.

128
00:11:26,617 --> 00:11:29,286
l'll be walking the floor if you need anything.

129
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,446
Thank you, Claude.

130
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,789
lt's gonna be OK.

131
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:45,084
- Tell me about Janet.
- She's stable.

132
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:48,463
- Can she talk?
- No, not yet.

133
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:52,636
What did you mean before about
her being in danger? Danger from whom?

134
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,933
Someone who doesn't
want her talking to me.

135
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,309
You must be Jack.

136
00:11:57,398 --> 00:12:00,683
Alan, yeah. This is my husband Jack.

137
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

138
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:05,274
Alan's been a great friend tonight, Jack.

139
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:09,148
- l'm glad your daughter's OK.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

140
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:12,078
Gave us a good scare,
but she pulled through.

141
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:15,329
When she's up to it,
l'll need to ask her a few questions.

142
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,582
But, Jack, my daughter's
been through a lot. Um...

143
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:23,376
lf the doctor says it's OK.

144
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:30,135
The guys that Kim and Janet were with
tonight, Teri told me you didn't know them.

145
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:33,971
- No. No. Janet never mentioned them.
- Are you close to Janet?

146
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:37,676
She's my daughter.

147
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,179
- But you don't know who she goes out with.
- Jack.

148
00:12:40,274 --> 00:12:44,141
No, not tonight, l didn't,
but apparently you didn't either.

149
00:12:44,236 --> 00:12:46,644
- What are you doing?
- Trying to find Kim.

150
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:48,530
By treating Alan as a suspect?

151
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:52,150
He can handle a few questions.
Understand? Our daughter's missing.

152
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:56,158
- Of course l do.
- Alan, would you excuse us for a minute?

153
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:59,083
Jack. What's going on?

154
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:03,118
l don't know what you were doing for
the last five hours, but Alan was with me.

155
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:07,922
- l'm sorry if that makes you feel bad but...
- Hold on one minute.

156
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,299
(man) l'm here to see my brother. My bag?

157
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:13,388
l'm not gonna open the briefcase.
l wanna see my brother.

158
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:16,558
- (Jack) What's the problem here?
- There's no problem.

159
00:13:16,644 --> 00:13:19,644
- What you got in the briefcase?
- Don't worry about it.

160
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,647
- What's in the briefcase?
- Don't worry about it.

161
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,809
(man) Get off me!

162
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,147
What is this?

163
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:29,907
- lt's my medication.
- What kind of medication?

164
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,991
- Ben? Ben? What is going on?
- (Ben) Virgil's in pain.

165
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:37,822
- You guys aren't giving him what he needs.
- lt's OK. We're taking care of your brother.

166
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:41,118
His brother's up in detox...

167
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,701
(Ben) You guys just don't get it!

168
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:51,210
l'm sorry.

169
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:58,051
Come on.

170
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:16,113
What did Carl want?

171
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:23,667
l know about Keith.

172
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:26,457
Know what about Keith?

173
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:33,634
That he went to Carl to cover up the Gibson
boy's death. Keith was there, wasn't he?

174
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:37,054
Look, David, just because Carl
wants to feed you some story...

175
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:41,352
Are you sure you're not the one
that's feeding me stories?

176
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,817
The thing l can't understand,

177
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,610
what l keep asking myself,
is why you hid this from me.

178
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:08,417
- l wanted to tell you, David.
- But you didn't.

179
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:11,839
- Carl said you'd be exposed.
- Don't put this on Carl.

180
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:16,504
You keep your own counsel, Sherry.
You always have.

181
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,965
Nothing l say to you is gonna
make you feel any better. l know that.

182
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:26,105
l did what l thought was right
for our family and for your career.

183
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:41,154
What about Nicole?

184
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,207
Did she know too?

185
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,296
- We were protecting you.
- Really?

186
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:57,504
- Yes.
- Or were you protecting your chance

187
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:01,261
- to move into the White House?
- l am as ambitious as you are, David.

188
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,561
- That's why you married me.
- No, l married you because l love you.

189
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:08,563
- l thought we were working together.
- We still are.

190
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:11,270
- Well, it doesn't feel that way.
- David.

191
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:18,569
What are you gonna do?

192
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,034
l don't know.

193
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,164
Look, you can be as angry at me as you want.

194
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:31,248
But l'm telling you, we should do everything
we can to keep this thing from coming out.

195
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:35,878
lt's too late for that.

196
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:43,589
Well, l'm sorry to hear you say that,

197
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:48,180
because you'll lose a lot more
than the election if it does.

198
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,018
Are you prepared to send our son to jail?

199
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,857
Everything was always a game with Dan.

200
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:47,032
He acted like nothing could touch him,
and l bought into it.

201
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:51,246
- So did Janet.
- l'd give anything to turn back the clock.

202
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:53,624
Me too.

203
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:58,922
l spend every day trying
to get away from my mother...

204
00:17:59,927 --> 00:18:03,378
and now l can't stop wishing she were here.

205
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,137
She must be freaking.

206
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,932
lt must be nice having a mom you like.

207
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,853
You don't like yours?

208
00:18:13,941 --> 00:18:16,514
Not all women are meant to be mothers.

209
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:21,190
- l'm sorry.
- lt's not your problem.

210
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:26,361
Rick...

211
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:29,862
We gotta get out of here.

212
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,458
Come with me.

213
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,335
Let's go.

214
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:51,177
Leave the shovel,
unless you plan to use it on me.

215
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,027
When l come back,
your friend better be in the ground.

216
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:19,539
(phone rings)

217
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,919
- Myers.
- Hey. Any word on the John Doe yet?

218
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,799
Time of death between
11 and midnight last night.

219
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,638
Right before we were tipped on
the Palmer hit. How close are we to an lD?

220
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:35,226
The lab are running his DNA
against all databases.

221
00:19:35,314 --> 00:19:38,683
- That's gonna take too long.
- We're going as fast as we can.

222
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,860
Put Jamey on it.
We've gotta take care of this now.

223
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:44,483
- Did you find Kim?
- No, not yet.

224
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:46,696
- ls her friend all right?
- She will be.

225
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:49,820
- What about Teri? How's she holding up?
- She's fine, Nina.

226
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:52,237
What else is going on over there?

227
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:55,830
l think l have to apologise for Jack.

228
00:19:55,918 --> 00:20:00,461
You don't have to apologise for
your husband. We're all pretty wound up.

229
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:04,331
l think Jack's wound up
a little tighter than the rest of us.

230
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:07,295
No argument here.

231
00:20:08,013 --> 00:20:12,177
l guess l've always kind of accepted it
as an occupational hazard.

232
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:16,051
l thought you told me
that he sat behind a desk.

233
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:19,765
The truth is half the time
l don't know what he's doing.

234
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:23,025
He can't tell me. lt's a security thing.

235
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,947
Must be tough on you.

236
00:20:26,031 --> 00:20:28,107
Sometimes.

237
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,823
But you deal with it.

238
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,746
Right now he's just worried about Kim.

239
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:38,956
Yeah, well, hopefully when Janet wakes up,
she'll be able to tell us where she is.

240
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:41,788
Yeah.

241
00:20:43,382 --> 00:20:48,127
Look, l gotta go. Call me back
as soon as you got anything.

242
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:05,231
Walk with me for a sec.

243
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,689
What is it, Jack?

244
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,454
Why is there all this security here?

245
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:16,242
Who wants to hurt Janet?

246
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:23,746
Today someone is going
to try and kill David Palmer.

247
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,084
What?

248
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:28,340
That's why l was brought in last night.

249
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:31,345
Well, why is Janet in danger?

250
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:34,931
Because she was with Kim.

251
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:39,266
Our daughter's missing.

252
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:44,100
How do...? You're saying that relates
to an assassination attempt?

253
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:47,941
They must know that l've been
assigned to protect Palmer.

254
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:51,865
And you think this person kidnapped Kim?

255
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,913
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

256
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:59,073
Teri.

257
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,324
l'm so sorry.

258
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:04,922
l know this is all happening because of me.

259
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:12,886
l've tried to keep a wall between my work
and my family and the wall's coming down.

260
00:22:12,972 --> 00:22:15,759
Now l don't know what to do.

261
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:26,559
(Teri) OK.

262
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:33,194
OK.

263
00:22:34,326 --> 00:22:36,533
What do they want from you?

264
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,779
- l don't know.
- What are the police doing?

265
00:22:38,872 --> 00:22:42,039
l haven't been able to call them
without risking Kim's life.

266
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:45,245
- What if it's too late, Jack?
- lt's not too late.

267
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:50,757
Kim is OK. They took her for a reason
and that was not to hurt her.

268
00:22:50,843 --> 00:22:52,919
- OK.
- Honey.

269
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:03,097
l promise you we are going to get her back.

270
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,767
l'm so sorry.

271
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,964
- l need you in forensics.
- l'm about to crack the outer shell.

272
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:41,264
You said that two hours ago.

273
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:46,097
- This key card is our best lead on the hit.
- l'm not dropping it. l called in Milo.

274
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,733
- Milo is an outside contractor.
- Which is why we can trust him.

275
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:56,027
- l can do this. l'm as good as Milo.
- Not with this kind of thing. And l can't wait.

276
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:59,775
Look, Jack wants you on this.

277
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:08,366
l'll brief you on the way.
The deceased is a male Caucasian...

278
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:27,221
- (man) Who is it?
- lt's David.

279
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:33,892
Sorry to wake you like this,
Mike, but something's come up.

280
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:37,072
- l was hoping to keep you out of it.
- l'm your chief of staff.

281
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:40,941
- l shouldn't be kept out of anything.
- lt was a private matter.

282
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:44,904
You're running for president.
Nothing's private any more.

283
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:56,544
- Where are you going?
- They moved Janet upstairs to the lCU.

284
00:24:56,635 --> 00:25:00,965
- She's out of Recovery?
- She's a little groggy, but she's awake.

285
00:25:01,056 --> 00:25:04,306
- Alan, that's wonderful.
- Yeah, thank you.

286
00:25:04,393 --> 00:25:06,516
Alan, l owe you an apology. l'm sorry.

287
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:10,648
You don't need to be. l understand
exactly what you're going through.

288
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:12,974
(cellphone rings)

289
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:15,524
Excuse me.

290
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,771
- Bauer.
- (Nina) We found something.

291
00:25:17,865 --> 00:25:20,320
X-rays show a surgical pin
in John Doe's ankle.

292
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,027
Turns out it's not standard.
Custom-made. One ofa kind.

293
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:27,039
So we can trace it back
to the surgeon who implanted it.

294
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:31,169
Jamey's searching the AMA database,
crosschecking it with the manufacturer.

295
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:34,420
- Hopefully we'll have his name in an hour.
- Sooner is better.

296
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:37,875
Call me as soon as you got something.

297
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:47,261
(Mike) The minute Maureen breaks the story,
you'll free-fall in the polls.

298
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:50,472
Then the media'll start
churning this thing 24-7.

299
00:25:50,564 --> 00:25:53,601
They'll pick you clean,
then go to work on the bones.

300
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:57,026
Chances are the party'll try to cut bait.

301
00:25:57,112 --> 00:26:01,774
So, l'd say you're textbook unelectable.

302
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:08,455
- So l'm right to withdraw from the race.
- No. That's the last thing you should do.

303
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:13,202
- You just got through telling me l can't win.
- l told you what to expect so you can.

304
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:17,756
lf we handle this right,
l think you can come back from this.

305
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:21,210
David,

306
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:27,130
you're the most important presidential
candidate this country's had in a long time.

307
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:30,725
Like it or not, fair or not,
you're making history.

308
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:39,063
My son was involved in another man's death.

309
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:44,107
- lt was an accident.
- OK.

310
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:49,955
And what if some judge rules it was?
l mean, how do we justify the cover-up?

311
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,199
All of them -

312
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:57,535
Sherry, Keith... Nicole -
kept this from the police.

313
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:03,922
l don't wanna seem crass, but
the important thing is, you didn't cover it up.

314
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:06,089
You didn't know.

315
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:10,179
What does that say about me?

316
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:20,359
Not knowing the most important
things about my family.

317
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:23,945
l'm not saying it's not a hard sell.

318
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:27,402
The election is still six months away.

319
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:32,872
The voters know how to forgive.

320
00:27:34,168 --> 00:27:37,085
You just have to know how to ask for it.

321
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:45,334
- Do you still want the job, David?
- You know l do.

322
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:52,306
Then you need to come out with the story
yourself before Maureen Kingsley.

323
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:58,601
Make it the first thing
you say at the breakfast.

324
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:11,324
l just don't know how
my family's gonna feel about that.

325
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:15,791
Find out fast, because
you can't do this without them.

326
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:20,833
When you come clean,

327
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:24,632
be damn sure your family's
standing next to you.

328
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:35,635
l did a neurological exam which showed no
spinal injury. She suffered multiple fractures,

329
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:38,683
- but nothing she can't recover from.
- What went wrong?

330
00:28:38,774 --> 00:28:43,068
When they were trying to stop the internal
bleeding, she went into cardiac arrest.

331
00:28:43,153 --> 00:28:46,688
- But she's OK now?
- The next six hours will be critical.

332
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:50,365
- But l'm optimistic.
- ls it possible to ask her a few questions?

333
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:53,204
- When?
- Soon as possible. Our daughter is missing.

334
00:28:53,289 --> 00:28:57,749
- Janet was the last person to see her.
- l'm not happy with her being interrogated.

335
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:01,535
l'm just talking about asking her
one or two questions.

336
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,880
l'll leave it up to her father.

337
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:11,723
Let me go in first. Make sure she's up to it.

338
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:14,132
Thank you.

339
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,615
You know what we should do
when this is over?

340
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,776
Get some sleep?

341
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:38,033
We should take that trip we always talked
about. You know, up the coast into Canada.

342
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:40,533
Just the three of us.

343
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,869
That sounds nice.

344
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:44,872
(cellphone rings)

345
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:47,421
l'm sorry. Nina's following up a lead.

346
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:49,134
That was quick.

347
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:52,470
Do what l tell you, Jack,
and you might see your daughter again.

348
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:56,055
Say yes if you understand me.

349
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:58,895
Answer me, Jack.

350
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:01,141
Yes.

351
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:06,308
Now smile at your wife like nothing's wrong
and move away from the doors.

352
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:17,948
That's right. We're watching you.

353
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:25,334
Walk away now or Kimberly
gets a bullet in her head.

354
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:39,723
The reception's really bad. l'll be right back.

355
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,441
Now continue down the hall.

356
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:52,359
Come on, Jack. l don't have all day.

357
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:58,742
What do you want me to do?

358
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:01,238
Go out the north entrance.

359
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:10,958
Left.

360
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:14,214
Yes, l'm still watching you.

361
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:17,634
That's it. Out the north entrance.

362
00:31:21,645 --> 00:31:25,429
- She's a tough one, your daughter.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

363
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:32,153
- Would you rather go in alone?
- Do you mind?

364
00:31:33,365 --> 00:31:35,274
No.

365
00:31:35,367 --> 00:31:38,072
(heart-rate monitor beeps)

366
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:49,043
Daddy?

367
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:51,207
Hello, Janet.

368
00:31:53,886 --> 00:31:57,337
You've had a rough night, haven't you?

369
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:00,807
Who are you?

370
00:32:04,563 --> 00:32:06,971
Where's my father?

371
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:14,522
(beeping speeds up)

372
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:21,452
(Janet gasps for air)

373
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,376
(beeping stops)

374
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:59,875
- Where am l going?
- (Gaines) On your left is a silver Taurus.

375
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:05,132
- l see it.
- Get in.

376
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:22,231
- Open the glove compartment.
- First prove to me that my daughter is alive.

377
00:34:25,245 --> 00:34:28,116
- Daddy?
- Kimberly. Are you OK?

378
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:31,208
Yeah, they haven't hurt me but l'm...

379
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:36,923
There's a metal box inside
the glove compartment. Take it out.

380
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:49,681
Tuck it in your ear.

381
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,983
Now say something.

382
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:01,897
- lf you hurt my daughter, l will kill you.
- Good. There's a nice, clear signal.

383
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:07,614
You won't need your phone any more.
Lose it out the window.

384
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:11,369
Out the window, Jack.

385
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,220
The keys are on the seat next to you.

386
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:33,973
- Where do you want me to go?
- You're going to the office like everyone else.

387
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:36,306
- CTU?
- That's where you work.

388
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:06,129
(phone ringing)

389
00:36:06,847 --> 00:36:10,216
- This is Jack Bauer. Leave a message.
- Jack, where are you?

390
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,393
- Oh, God!
- Sorry. l didn't mean to scare you.

391
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:15,767
- Where's Jack?
- He went to take a call.

392
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:18,857
- l need to talk to him.
- Why? What did Janet say?

393
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,647
- They were trying to escape.
- From whom?

394
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:24,193
A couple of boys who got too aggressive.

395
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:27,199
- She doesn't know if Kim got away.
- Kim would have called.

396
00:36:27,284 --> 00:36:30,451
Janet says they were being held
in a house up in Bel Air.

397
00:36:30,537 --> 00:36:33,455
- That's the address?
- We should give it to the police.

398
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,245
Jack is the police.

399
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:39,833
Oh!

400
00:36:39,922 --> 00:36:41,796
- Pick up.
- This is Jack Bauer...

401
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:43,424
- Dammit.
- He's not answering.

402
00:36:43,509 --> 00:36:47,091
Jack, listen. lt's me again.
Janet may know where Kimberly is.

403
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:50,299
Would you please call me
as soon as you get this? OK.

404
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,014
Jack?

405
00:36:55,104 --> 00:36:57,511
- Jack?
- Teri.

406
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:00,014
He was just here.
He promised he wouldn't leave.

407
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:02,481
Keep trying on his cell. l'll call the police.

408
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:05,239
- No, l have to get there.
- lf you want, l'll take you.

409
00:37:05,322 --> 00:37:07,647
- Well, what about Janet?
- She's sleeping.

410
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:11,905
Dr Collier says she's not in any danger
and she'll be out for a couple of hours. OK?

411
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:14,072
OK.

412
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,834
l guess l'll just call from the car.

413
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:13,594
(man) Go on. Move.

414
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:38,403
l'm sorry, man.

415
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:48,465
- We're gonna be OK.
- Maybe.

416
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,251
- l just spoke to my dad.
- How?

417
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:56,260
- Gaines put me on the phone with him.
- What does he want from your dad? Money?

418
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,430
No, l'm not sure,
but l don't think it's about money.

419
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:04,768
- My dad's gonna get us out.
- He doesn't even know where we are.

420
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:06,934
lt doesn't matter.

421
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,396
He'll find us.

422
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:31,377
What's up, Milo?

423
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:34,469
Did you try using
an S-box inversion on that key card?

424
00:39:34,555 --> 00:39:37,093
No. Why?

425
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:40,516
lt's just... it's the fastest way
into a file that size.

426
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:45,690
Your hunch on the AMA database paid off.
We just lD'd our John Doe.

427
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:20,432
What happened to your wrist?
You didn't have that before.

428
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:23,969
Yeah, l did. lt happened
back at the furniture store.

429
00:40:24,063 --> 00:40:25,391
Oh.

430
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:28,019
- (cellphone rings)
- Maybe that's Jack.

431
00:40:28,108 --> 00:40:30,896
- Jack.
- Teri. Hi, it's Nina Myers.

432
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,520
- Oh, hi, Nina.
- l have some important information for Jack.

433
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:38,071
He's not answering his cell.
l know he's with you.

434
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,285
No, he was, but he went to take a call a couple
of minutes ago. l thought it was from you.

435
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,540
No, l haven't spoken to him
in almost half an hour.

436
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:49,462
- Then you don't know where he is?
- No.

437
00:40:49,546 --> 00:40:51,041
Nina, what's going on?

438
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:52,163
Um...

439
00:40:52,257 --> 00:40:56,089
Listen, Teri, if you hear from him first,
can you give him a message?

440
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:58,171
Of course.

441
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:00,968
There's a murder victim he asked me to lD.

442
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,392
Tell him the murder victim's
name is Alan York.

443
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,723
l'm sorry. Could you say that again, please?

444
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:12,652
Alan York. He's an accountant
from the valley.

445
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:15,856
l'll give the details to Jack
when l speak to him.

446
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:19,274
Hello?

447
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:22,073
- Yeah.
- Willyou tell Jack?

448
00:41:22,162 --> 00:41:23,194
Sure.

449
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:26,658
Thanks, and ifyou hear from him,
tell him to call in.

450
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,826
- OK.
- Thanks.

451
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,336
Everything OK?

452
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:37,718
Yeah. That was just someone
from Jack's office trying to find him.
