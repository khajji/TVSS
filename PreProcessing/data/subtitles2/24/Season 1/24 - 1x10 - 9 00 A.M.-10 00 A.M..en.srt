1
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:19,028
(Jack) There are terrorists planning
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,152
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

3
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:26,372
And the people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,782
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer.

5
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:31,663
This is the longest day ofmy life.

6
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:44,464
(radio) This is Dave Thompson.

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,477
lt's 9 o'clock on primary day
in Southern California

8
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:50,100
and the freeways are looking pretty good.

9
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,852
Usual delays in the Sepulveda Pass
southbound, but it loosens up at Culver.

10
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:58,396
We'll have a complete report
in six minutes. Back to you, Bill.

11
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:02,653
(Bill) Thanks, Dave. ln the news, we haven't
learned any more about the incident

12
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:07,370
at the San Clarita power plant where
Senator Palmer was rushed out this morning,

13
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:09,663
but we're told the senator was unharmed.

14
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:13,749
But Secret Service and the FBl
haven't released any new information.

15
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:16,958
- (medic #1) Get the drip.
- (medic #2) l'm on it.

16
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,714
(medic #1) Find me a pulse.

17
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:26,181
(medic #2) l've got a pulse. 140 over 30.

18
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,643
Pupils not reactive.

19
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,137
(medic #1) Respiration shallow. 48.

20
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:36,025
Let's start two large-bore lVs, bilateral.

21
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:41,740
She's lost a lot of blood.

22
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:46,652
- (medic #2) We should start the other line.
- (medic #1) All right.

23
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:50,532
(medic #2) ls it in?

24
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:56,537
(medic #1) Ready? One, two, three.

25
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,798
Ready?

26
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,884
Lift.

27
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:28,320
Excuse me.

28
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:33,996
(medic #1) l've got the door.

29
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:46,046
Everyone, l'm sorry to tell you Jamey Farrell
tried to commit suicide a few minutes ago.

30
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,345
Fortunately, she's still alive,

31
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:52,762
and they're doing everything they can
to keep her that way.

32
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,680
l know it won't be easy to put this out
of our minds, but we don't have a choice.

33
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:00,314
We still believe that Palmer's life is in danger,

34
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:03,321
which means we all have
to get back to work now.

35
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:10,239
- You wanna look at this?
- Not now. Call Jamey's mom.

36
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,497
Explain what happened.
Have her pick up Kyle.

37
00:03:26,346 --> 00:03:28,422
(phone rings)

38
00:03:29,432 --> 00:03:32,006
- CTU, Myers.
- Hey, it's me. Hold on.

39
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,434
- OK.
- Didyou get the car?

40
00:03:35,522 --> 00:03:38,013
Yes, and l got the care package too. Thanks.

41
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:39,899
- Jack, Teri called.
- What?

42
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:42,939
- About 20 minutes ago.
- Where is she? What did she say?

43
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:46,445
l don't know. She barely said her name
before she got disconnected.

44
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:47,612
What happened?

45
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:51,781
She didn't call back, and when l tried
to redial, the number was blocked.

46
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:55,454
- She sounded all right.
- The police have thrown a net over this area.

47
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,293
There's no way l can help Teri
until l get through it.

48
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:02,162
Maybe you should turn yourself in,
tell your side of the story.

49
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:06,301
No. Gaines will keep Teri and Kim alive
as long as he thinks l can be useful to him.

50
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:09,007
ln custody l won't be.
Scan the police frequencies.

51
00:04:09,097 --> 00:04:12,715
- See ifyou can locate any ofthe roadblocks.
- All right.

52
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,637
Just a minute.

53
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:21,436
- OK.
- Jamey give you anything else?

54
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:22,937
Jack...

55
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:25,435
Jamey tried to kill herself.

56
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,449
Jack? Didyou hear me?

57
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:35,410
- Jack?
- Yeah. You said she tried?

58
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:38,832
We sent her to County,
but it doesn't look good.

59
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,212
- Are you sure it was a suicide attempt?
- Yeah. She slit her wrists.

60
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:47,044
- Where is her son Kyle?
- He didn't see anything.

61
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:50,586
We've already called Jamey's mom.
She's on her way to pick him up.

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,381
OK. Send someone down to County
to question Jamey in case she makes it.

63
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:57,809
- She's still our best source ofinformation.
- OK.

64
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,898
- Dammit.
- What? What's wrong?

65
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:08,030
They set up a roadblock at Montana.
Nina, l could have used a heads-up here.

66
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:12,408
l'm sorry. They must have set it up
before l started scanning.

67
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:17,956
- Find me another route.
- Give me a second to pull up LA traffic.

68
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,869
OK. You go to the window.
You let me know if somebody comes.

69
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,039
(dials phone)

70
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:27,791
(ringing tone)

71
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,926
(phone rings)

72
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:43,648
- Tony. Line three. Can you get it?
- Almeida.

73
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:47,976
OK. lt looks like roadblocks
aren't your only problem.

74
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,908
They sent a description ofyou
to all the units in the area.

75
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,662
Nina. lt's Teri Bauer.

76
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:59,159
Jack, hold on a minute.

77
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,661
- Teri.
- Nina. Thank God.

78
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:05,587
- Where are you?
- l don't know, but l got a hold of a phone.

79
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,210
OK. ls Kim with you? Are you all right?

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,969
l'm fine. Kimberly's fine.
You know where Jack is?

81
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:13,887
Listen, l'm gonna connect you
with him right now.

82
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:17,507
Leave the line open as long as you can
so we can do a trace. Understand?

83
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:20,720
- Yeah.
- Have Milo set up the trace on line three.

84
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:25,727
- Jack, l've got Teri.
- Patch her through.

85
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:28,102
Mom, someone's coming.

86
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:31,778
- He's here.
- Teri? Teri?

87
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,823
What do you want from us?

88
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:44,244
l think l left my phone in here.
Have you seen it?

89
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:46,494
No, l haven't.

90
00:06:46,588 --> 00:06:48,794
(Nina) Jack, l've muted our conversation.

91
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:52,251
- Have you set up a trace?
- Yeah. l told Teri to leave the line open.

92
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:55,759
Good. Keep our side muted.
l don't wanna give away this phone.

93
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:02,727
You better not be lyin', bitch.

94
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:21,702
Bitch.

95
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,266
They moved everything around in here!
Dammit! Rick, you seen it anywheres?

96
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:48,724
No. No.

97
00:07:57,826 --> 00:07:59,902
Got anything on that trace?

98
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:04,206
Latitude is north of the 10. l should have
a rough longitude in a couple of minutes,

99
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,335
though triangulating
the longitude is gonna be trickier.

100
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:11,746
(radio) This is Dave Thompson.

101
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,751
We're seeing congestion in North Hollywood
around the Grant Street Elementary School.

102
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:19,550
Senator Palmer is due
to make an appearance there

103
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,882
and quite a few supporters and media are
hoping to catch a glimpse ofthe candidate

104
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:29,189
who is not letting this morning's incident
interfere with his schedule today.

105
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:34,185
(Sherry) l don't understand the rationale
behind it. No, listen to me. Why?

106
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,315
Why defend something
that you don't need to defend?

107
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:39,696
Maureen won't come out with the story today.

108
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:42,026
- She will.
- We don't know that.

109
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,907
Look, if not now, tomorrow.

110
00:08:44,998 --> 00:08:48,663
lf not her, someone else.
Our son is accused of murder.

111
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:51,077
- The story's too big to hide.
- Mike.

112
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:55,465
He's right, Sherry. We need to control
when and how this story comes out.

113
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,215
One hour ago someone tried
to kill my husband.

114
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,009
That bought us time and we should use it.

115
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:07,722
The assassination attempt might even work
for us if we break the story about Keith.

116
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:11,596
lt might put the public
in a more forgiving frame of mind.

117
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:13,814
- You're making a mistake.
- lt's mine to make.

118
00:09:13,902 --> 00:09:17,567
No, it isn't, David,
because you didn't get here by yourself.

119
00:09:17,656 --> 00:09:20,491
Do not go against me on this, Sherry.

120
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,197
Promise me.

121
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,445
l can't promise you anything.

122
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:33,662
(screaming and applause)

123
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,934
Jack, we've got a preliminary read
on the trace. lt's a pretty big area.

124
00:09:57,028 --> 00:10:00,646
- l'm listening.
- lt's north of the 10, east of the 405.

125
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:06,782
Didyou hear me?

126
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:10,245
Jack?

127
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:13,998
Well, that's a start.
Now get me through these cops.

128
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:20,381
Your best bet is east on Thurston.
But l don't think you should be moving yet.

129
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:26,720
l'll get through the net somehow. Just stay on
that trace and help me find my family, please.

130
00:10:32,856 --> 00:10:36,189
Tony, open an extra socket for me on one.

131
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:44,321
- Did you hear me?
- Come here. You gotta check this out.

132
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:57,377
- What is it?
- l checked Jamey's disk for recent emails.

133
00:10:57,464 --> 00:11:01,413
She was pretty careful, but she must
not have had time to get rid of this one.

134
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,175
- That's from this morning.
- Mm-hm. To an anonymous recipient.

135
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:10,174
- What about the encryption?
- l'll get Milo on it. You can see the subject.

136
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:13,186
Ted Cofell? Coffell? Find out who he is.

137
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,183
(phone rings)

138
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,566
l'm busy.

139
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:28,319
(phone rings)

140
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:29,784
Yeah.

141
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:32,907
- l need you to do something.
- l'm working on this trace.

142
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:37,578
You're gonna have to do two things at once.
l need this email decrypted.

143
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,506
(phone rings)

144
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:45,669
CTU, Almeida.

145
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:54,094
OK.

146
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,930
Thanks.

147
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,361
Nina.

148
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:15,073
That was the clinic. Jamey didn't make it.

149
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,687
- Mom, it's clear. They're gone.
- Hello, Jack? Are you there?

150
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:50,155
- Teri? lt's Nina. Are you OK to talk?
- Uh-huh.

151
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:54,241
l'll put you through to Jack.
Jack, l've got Teri.

152
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,703
- Teri?
- Jack. Can you talk? Where are you?

153
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,911
- l'm on my way to get you out. Are you OK?
- l'm hangin' in there.

154
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:04,001
Good. Thank God. Nina's tracing
the cellular signal to your location.

155
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,175
- How long will that take to find it?
- Nina?

156
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:11,261
20 minutes. Milo's narrowed
the signal to four antennas,

157
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:14,847
which is still about 500 square miles.

158
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:18,101
- God.
- (Nina) Don't worry. We're closing in on it.

159
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,307
(siren)

160
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:24,350
Will you please pull over to the kerb?

161
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:26,935
- (Teri) Jack?
- No, l'm still here, honey.

162
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,066
ls there anything you can tell us
that might help us find you?

163
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:33,325
l know we're at least
a few miles out of the city.

164
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,539
Look, this is gonna take me
about a minute, OK? Hold on.

165
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,368
(siren)

166
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:13,131
11-8-19. Code 6 North.

167
00:15:13,219 --> 00:15:16,505
11-8-9. l'm Code 6 South, heading your way.

168
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:18,674
Copy.

169
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:36,190
11-8-19. North sector. Nothing so far.

170
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,074
Jack, are you all right?

171
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:48,493
Jack?

172
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:51,079
Yeah. Yeah, l'm fine.

173
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:55,635
Honey, it'd really help if you could tell us
everything you know about where you are.

174
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,591
l don't know. They blindfolded me
when they picked me up.

175
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:01,683
- Where was that?
- Mulholland, near Coldwater.

176
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:04,852
How long did it take to get from there
to where you are now?

177
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:07,476
l'm not sure. Halfan hour?

178
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,938
- Streets or freeways?
- Freeways, l think.

179
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:12,185
- Milo.
- Already on it.

180
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,279
Anything else? Any sounds or smells?

181
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:19,659
- Can you hear cars or airplanes? Anything?
- No, it's pretty quiet.

182
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:23,196
There's hills and, um, some eucalyptus trees.

183
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:28,328
lt may be in the north valley,
somewhere inland. lt's pretty remote.

184
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,458
That helps. All right, l got it narrowed down
to three sectors, but check it out.

185
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:38,002
OK, the closer we get,
the longer each iteration's gonna take.

186
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:40,552
(Teri) What does that mean?

187
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,799
lt's just techno talk, Teri.

188
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,763
Don't worry. We're making good progress.

189
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:54,227
Jack? Are you there?

190
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,235
Yeah, baby. l'm still here.

191
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,244
Teri, l'm gonna find you. l promise.

192
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,455
l know you will.

193
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:13,204
Nina's tracing the call right now. We'll have
your location in just a couple of minutes,

194
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:18,838
but it's really important you don't hang up,
OK? Even if you can't talk, don't hang up.

195
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:25,099
Sweetheart, are you sure you're all right?

196
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:29,515
They didn't hurt you, did they?

197
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:32,441
l'm fine. So's Kim.

198
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:36,688
- ls she there with you?
- Yeah, she's right here.

199
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,482
Put her on the phone so both of you can hear.

200
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,652
OK.

201
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,034
- Dad?
- Hey, sweetheart.

202
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:53,671
Are you OK?

203
00:17:53,755 --> 00:17:57,338
Yeah. Who are these guys?
Why are they doing this?

204
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:59,751
l don't know, honey, but l'm gonna find out.

205
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:04,637
But right now l just wanna make sure
that you and Mommy get home safely, OK?

206
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,595
Honey...

207
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:12,763
Look, uh... l know l haven't always been there
for you when you've needed me and...

208
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:17,151
- Jack, you don't have to do this.
- l want both of you to know that...

209
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:21,943
l'm here for you now. l love you more
than anything in the whole world,

210
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:25,616
and l promise you l am gonna
getyou both out ofthere. OK?

211
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,534
So no matter what happens, don't give up.

212
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,919
We're a family. We're gonna
get through this like a family.

213
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:36,833
OK?

214
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,503
So don't forget l'm coming to get you.

215
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:49,806
Sweetheart?

216
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:52,812
Stay on the phone. l'm gonna be right back.

217
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:25,259
- You still there?
- Mom, he's coming back.

218
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:30,388
- Jack, l have to go. He's coming back.
- Who's coming? Teri, keep the line open.

219
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:33,301
lt's just a phone!

220
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:36,101
lt's how Gaines gets ahold of me
when he needs me.

221
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,896
You already looked here!

222
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,946
- Where is it?
- l told you. l don't know.

223
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:50,285
- Where's my phone?
- She doesn't know either.

224
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:55,209
- (Eli) Can'tyou speak foryourself?
- (Teri) Stay away from her! Don't touch her.

225
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:58,662
- Can't you speak?
- l don't know where you left your phone.

226
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:03,002
Don't hurt her, man! Come on. Take it easy!

227
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:09,429
(phone beeps)

228
00:20:11,017 --> 00:20:13,224
(phone beeps)

229
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:19,224
- Nina, what's going on?
- l don't know.

230
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:21,893
The signal's dying.

231
00:20:22,904 --> 00:20:24,980
(phone beeps)

232
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,489
(phone beeps)

233
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:40,460
Who'd you call?

234
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:45,882
Who is this?

235
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:51,509
l'm the last thing that you will ever see if
anything happens to my wife or my daughter.

236
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,760
- Where you going?
- To tell Gaines.

237
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,553
What do you think he's gonna do
when he finds out they used your phone?

238
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,982
(Teri) Jack, get us out of here, please! Hurry!

239
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,108
Teri, l'm gonna find you, l promise. Teri...

240
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,023
(phone beeps)

241
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:11,153
Think about it. They called on your phone.

242
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:23,998
Nina?

243
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,928
Tell me you got that trace.

244
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:32,172
We didn't get it.

245
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:47,819
- We've located Bauer's car.
- (radio) The number matches?

246
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,982
That's right.

247
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:23,805
(starts car)

248
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,580
- Nina, it's Jack. You still there?
- What's happening?

249
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:48,918
l got a car. How close
did Milo get with the trace?

250
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:50,467
25-mile radius.

251
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:52,675
- Dammit. That's not good enough.
- Sorry.

252
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:57,638
l've gotta do something. Come on, anything.
Please, help me out. What about Jamey?

253
00:22:57,726 --> 00:23:01,558
- She didn't make it, Jack.
- l don't believe this. Nina, please.

254
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,268
- l've got to find them.
- Hold on.

255
00:23:04,357 --> 00:23:07,394
- Anything yet with that email address?
- lt's coming now.

256
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:10,403
Patch into line two.

257
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:15,399
lt's Tony. l found something
on Jamey's computer that might be a lead.

258
00:23:15,493 --> 00:23:18,613
- What?
- lt's a name. Ted Cofell.

259
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:24,292
l did a search of LA and found him as a CEO
of an investment banking firm in Burbank.

260
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:25,409
That's it?

261
00:23:25,503 --> 00:23:26,535
- So...
- There's...

262
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,500
Hold on. Speak one at a time.
Tony, you go first.

263
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:34,300
So far that's it, but we got Milo decoding the
email right now. We should have more soon.

264
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:38,467
OK, fine. l'm gonna head over
to Cofell's office. What's the address?

265
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,686
- lt's 21500, Riverside Drive.
- 21500, Riverside Drive. Fine.

266
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:46,222
Tony, Gaines'll try and contact Jamey.
He doesn't know she's dead.

267
00:23:46,316 --> 00:23:48,558
You make sure you keep it that way.

268
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:52,067
- Nina, you help me navigate through traffic.
- All right.

269
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,869
(phone rings)

270
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:11,540
- Gaines.
- Hello, lra.

271
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:19,553
- Mr Drazen. Where are you?
- Flying into Los Angeles.

272
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:24,219
l'd like to know why the David Palmer
situation hasn't been taken care of.

273
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:27,515
l don't have to tell you
my brother and l are very disappointed.

274
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:32,483
- We had some bad luck, that's all.
- Bad luck or bad management?

275
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,485
- We have every reason to void the contract.
- There's no need for that.

276
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:40,821
To have Jack Bauer and David Palmer
in the same city on the same day

277
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:45,040
and let them slip through
our fingers would be intolerable.

278
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:48,992
Don't worry. Palmer will be dead
by the end of the day, just as we agreed.

279
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,665
How?

280
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:54,005
We still have Bauer's family as leverage.

281
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,461
We'll find Bauer and use him
just like we did before.

282
00:24:57,554 --> 00:25:03,224
lf plan A doesn't work, you should
have a plan B, not plan A recycled.

283
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,513
Like l said, we still have his family.

284
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,056
lf we sit tight, there's
a good chance Bauer will find us.

285
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:13,435
Then we'll make him the scapegoat
just as before.

286
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:16,814
My brother wants me
to assess the situation personally.

287
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,444
l land in half an hour.

288
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:22,405
- l'll join you by 10.30.
- Suit yourself.

289
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:26,623
lf l don't see a substantial improvement
in things in the next hour,

290
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:30,124
l'm going to ask Mr Cofell
to empty the accounts.

291
00:25:30,211 --> 00:25:32,418
You will get zero.

292
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:35,175
- Mr Drazen...
- lra...

293
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:39,208
you may be in this for the money,
but for my family it's personal.

294
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,551
- l realise that.
- Then realise this.

295
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:48,682
lf things continue to go wrong, the money
isn't all you'll lose. Do you understand?

296
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:54,983
- This is Sherry Palmer.
- Hello.

297
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,189
l'm sure you're as surprised
as l am that l'm calling you.

298
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:03,572
l'm surprised you waited this long. l assume
you're calling because David still plans

299
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:07,161
to make the announcement about Keith
and you can't stop him,

300
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:10,000
so nowyou want me to stop him?

301
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:12,872
You've lost whatever influence
you once had with David,

302
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:18,039
so l'm sure that's gonna be a problem, but
you might be able to stop Maureen Kingsley.

303
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:19,759
- How?
- l don't know.

304
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:23,095
l'm sure she has a weakness somewhere.

305
00:26:23,807 --> 00:26:27,639
Look, Carl, you don't need to ask me
for any advice on stufflike this.

306
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:32,888
As a matter of fact, l'm already taking care
of the evidence against Keith.

307
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:37,942
Taking care of it? How?

308
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,520
That's allyou really need to know.

309
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:46,447
- l'm not sure l'm understanding you.
- You don't have to.

310
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,951
But, Sherry, if we give David
a way out of this, make sure he takes it.

311
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,464
- Got it.
- Send it to me.

312
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,090
There was a wire transfer to lra Gaines
at 2.10am from a Swiss account.

313
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:11,181
- One million dollars.
- What does Cofell have to do with this?

314
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:16,229
- l don't know. Maybe it was his money.
- Makes sense. Cofell's in finance.

315
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:17,978
(phone rings)

316
00:27:18,612 --> 00:27:22,063
- Yeah, it's Jack.
- (Nina) Looks like we have the right Cofell.

317
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:24,482
Good. What have you got on him?

318
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,989
He was born in Philadelphia, went to Colgate,

319
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,116
MBA from UCLA in '88,
worked in investment banking,

320
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:33,829
started his own firm about five years ago.

321
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:36,125
His net worth is in excess of35 million.

322
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:39,249
- OK. Good. Patch me through to his office.
- OK.

323
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:42,628
(phone rings)

324
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:45,175
- Cofell Enterprises.
- Hi. ls Ted there?

325
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,386
He's in a meeting. May l take a message?

326
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:51,471
l'm a friend from business school.
l'm in town. l hoped we could get together.

327
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:54,479
As soon as he's out of the meeting
he's going out of town.

328
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:57,518
That's too bad. How much longer
will he be in his office?

329
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,610
He plans to leave by ten.
Wouldyou like to leave your name?

330
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:02,688
(phone beeps)

331
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,358
Hello?

332
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,497
(Nina) Tell Milo to be ready
in case Teri calls back.

333
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:21,506
Look, Nina, Division gave me a heads-up.

334
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,424
They're sending in
a provisional replacement for Jack.

335
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,764
They didn't waste any time, did they?

336
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,009
Who is it?

337
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:37,563
Alberta Green. Didn't she work for you
when you were over at Division?

338
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,943
- Yes, she did. When's she coming?
- Scheduled to arrive at 9.45.

339
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:43,773
(phone rings)

340
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:45,939
OK.

341
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:51,910
- CTU. Myers.
- Cofell's there, but he's gonna leave at ten.

342
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,832
l'm passing Culver.
How's the traffic moving east?

343
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:55,947
l'll check.

344
00:28:58,628 --> 00:29:01,463
Jack, there's another thing.

345
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:04,714
They're bringing in
Alberta Green to run things.

346
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:08,550
- She's gonna be here in a few minutes.
- Dammit.

347
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,880
Whatever. We'll deal with it.
Now, tell me how to get out of this traffic.

348
00:29:12,976 --> 00:29:16,261
- You'll hit gridlock in about two miles.
- How's Riverside?

349
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:20,138
lt's a little better. You might wanna get off.

350
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:23,068
OK, look. l'll get off
at the next exit and cut over.

351
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:30,407
Mom, tell me what happened
between you and Dad.

352
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:34,700
Why'd he move out?

353
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:39,699
- Kim, let's not talk about this now.
- Why not?

354
00:29:39,794 --> 00:29:42,582
l mean, we both know
there might not be a later.

355
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:44,748
- Kim...
- Please, Mom.

356
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,965
l wanna know.

357
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:02,188
l think your father is
the best man that l've ever known.

358
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:07,269
But he can be... difficult.

359
00:30:09,115 --> 00:30:11,820
And his job doesn't help.

360
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:18,701
You remember a couple of years ago
when he went away for a few weeks?

361
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,452
Uh...

362
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:23,117
for some training thing.

363
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,706
That's what he told us,
but l'm sure it was a mission.

364
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,630
He wouldn't say
and maybe he probably couldn't.

365
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:38,387
Anyway, when he came back,
he was... different.

366
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:43,105
He was distant and... preoccupied

367
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:46,275
and other times he was just angry.

368
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:52,276
He did everything he could
to keep it from you.

369
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:57,701
But things between us weren't so great.

370
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,073
l suppose l could have been more patient.

371
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:10,587
So we decided to try being apart.

372
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:16,172
But it didn't work.

373
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,885
No.

374
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,640
Good.

375
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,523
l just want us to be together again.

376
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:49,211
Cofell's taking a private plane and we got
a copy of his flight plan from the FAA.

377
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:52,715
- He's going to Denver.
- What does that tell us?

378
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:55,969
We're not sure. We're checking
people in the Denver area

379
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:58,262
who have known terrorist connections.

380
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,591
So far we haven't got much.

381
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,860
- Hello, Nina.
- Hello, Alberta.

382
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:22,572
- Nice to see you. You know why l'm here.
- Yes.

383
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,337
Gather everyone around, will you?

384
00:32:28,588 --> 00:32:33,464
OK. Could everyone stop what they're doing
for a moment? l have something to tell you.

385
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,387
l'd like to introduce you to Alberta Green.

386
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:40,469
Jack Bauer's been relieved
of his duties here indefinitely.

387
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,852
ln the meantime, Alberta's been
appointed Acting Director of CTU.

388
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,600
Good morning.

389
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:54,564
Things have been out of control here today.
Starting now, they're back in control.

390
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:59,199
Most of you know that an attempt was made
on Senator Palmer at about 8am.

391
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:04,161
You may not know that Jack Bauer
was apparently involved in that attempt.

392
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,954
The nature of his involvement isn't clear,

393
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:10,412
but he has escaped custody
and is considered a fugitive.

394
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:14,289
We therefore have two objectives:
Find Jack Bauer,

395
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:20,339
and make a quick and accurate assessment
of the threat, if any, facing Senator Palmer.

396
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,801
l know most of you have been up
more than 24 hours.

397
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:29,018
Too bad. Nobody so much as yawns
until we accomplish our objective.

398
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:34,018
lf anybody has a problem with that,
now would be a good time to resign.

399
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:42,238
Good. Let's get back to work.

400
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:46,706
Specific assignments will be confirmed
or revised within the hour.

401
00:33:54,674 --> 00:33:59,135
Obviously this is awkward,
but we'll get through this. We're pros.

402
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,257
- Of course.
- We'll talk later.

403
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,815
(phone rings)

404
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:20,860
Hold on a minute.

405
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:25,162
- (boy) ls it really true you played basketball?
- l sure did. Georgetown.

406
00:34:25,246 --> 00:34:30,952
- My daddy says Georgetown sucks.
- l need to have a little talk with your daddy.

407
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:36,085
My daddy also says there will never be
a black president in this country, ever.

408
00:34:38,218 --> 00:34:41,135
Would you give your daddy
a message for me?

409
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:48,260
Tell him l understand where he's coming
from, but he's wrong, and l'm gonna prove it.

410
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,095
- Tell him that, OK?
- OK.

411
00:34:53,984 --> 00:34:57,068
- l have Frank Ames on the phone.
- What does he want?

412
00:34:57,153 --> 00:34:59,775
- He wouldn't tell me.
- l'll call him back.

413
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,700
He said it was urgent.

414
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,527
He's your biggest contributor.
You can't just blow him off.

415
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:16,787
l'm very sorry.
Would you excuse me for a minute?

416
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,957
(girl) OK.

417
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,383
Frank. This is kind of a bad time.

418
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:31,762
- Well, it's about to get worse.
- What do you mean?

419
00:35:31,855 --> 00:35:35,438
l just got out of a meeting with Carl,
Phil Tuttle and Bob Jorgensen.

420
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:39,570
- About what?
- George Ferragamo, your son's therapist.

421
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:43,237
''The freshman and the transfers
from school are...''

422
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:46,325
The three of you have given
a lot of money to my campaign,

423
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,984
but my son's therapist
is none ofyour business.

424
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,867
He is when he's accusing
your son of murder.

425
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:56,003
He's a problem, and Tuttle
and Jorgensen don't like problems.

426
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:59,421
They told Carl to get rid ofit, permanently.

427
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:04,629
- l've played hardball all my life, but this...
- What are you saying? They told Carl to...

428
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:08,766
Listen, l'm washing my hands of this
and your whole campaign.

429
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,519
- Frank...
- l am out of it, David.

430
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:19,563
What was that about?

431
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:24,570
l need to talk to Carl, now.

432
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:54,181
You wanted to see me?

433
00:36:57,649 --> 00:37:00,140
- Give us five minutes.
- Certainly.

434
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,483
l don't know where Jack is.
We haven't talked since this morning.

435
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:09,112
- Since he escaped with a hostage?
- That's right.

436
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:12,073
l'm not sure l believe you.

437
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:19,702
lf you tell me where he is, l'll do what l can
to make sure nothing heavy falls on you.

438
00:37:19,796 --> 00:37:22,631
l told you. l don't know.

439
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:28,424
From what l've heard, there are
very few secrets between you and Jack.

440
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:32,048
Jack doesn't trust anyone, including me.

441
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:36,186
Getting involved with Jack was one
of the biggest mistakes l've ever made.

442
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:41,610
Not that l'm judging you, Nina, but
there's a right way to do these things.

443
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,943
Let 'em screw you.
Don't let 'em screw you over.

444
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,074
Look, if you don't have any more pearls
of wisdom, l'd like to get back to work.

445
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:51,068
By all means.

446
00:37:55,248 --> 00:37:58,664
- Cofell Enterprises.
- lt's Ted's friend from business school.

447
00:37:58,752 --> 00:38:02,999
l'm sorry, but l'm in the building. l hoped
l could come up and say a quick hello.

448
00:38:03,089 --> 00:38:07,965
- Will Ted be there for a few more minutes?
- l'm sorry, sir. He's on his way out.

449
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,840
- What floor is Cofell Enterprises on?
- 14.

450
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:14,008
Thank you.

451
00:38:21,149 --> 00:38:24,067
- Nancy, could you call my car, please?
- OK.

452
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:28,529
Better head to the airport a little early today.
The radio said the traffic was slow.

453
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:34,618
Of course. Mr Cofell, a friend of yours from
business school is on the way up to see you.

454
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:35,783
On his way now?

455
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:38,707
- l tried to stop him.
- Did he say who it was?

456
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:41,995
He didn't give his name.
He's probably selling something.

457
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,708
- Don't give him my cell number.
- Have a good trip.

458
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:48,214
- Thank you.
- Don't forget your phone.

459
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:52,251
Hey, Lewis, just wanted to let you know
that Mr Cofell is on his way down.

460
00:38:52,347 --> 00:38:54,719
Excuse me. Where's Mr Cofell?

461
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:58,141
Oh, l'm so sorry.
He just stepped into the elevator.

462
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:04,808
Where was he going? Down to
the parking garage? lt's all right, never mind.

463
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,359
(alarm sounds)

464
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:22,701
Nothing to worry about. There's a 30-second
reset, then we continue down automatically.

465
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,128
lt's probably a false alarm anyhow.

466
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:13,215
- Excuse me. Are you Mr Cofell's driver?
- Yeah, that's right.

467
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:17,051
l'm a federal agent.
Where are you going today?

468
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,094
- To the airport.
- On what business?

469
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,972
Look, l'm just his driver.
ls there a problem here?

470
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:25,139
Come with me a second.

471
00:40:39,454 --> 00:40:41,281
Thank you.

472
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:44,290
- Have a nice day, Mr Cofell.
- Thank you.

473
00:40:45,502 --> 00:40:47,578
Valet.

474
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:59,971
Mark, could you turn the air on
back here, please?

475
00:41:23,373 --> 00:41:24,951
''Then they began to laugh.''

476
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:28,706
''They began to say things like
'Oh, you remember him, don't you?'''

477
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:31,582
'''Doesn't he live with you? Sure he does.'''

478
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,090
(Teri groans)

479
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:44,183
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, l'm fine. lt's nothing.

480
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,936
- He hurt you, didn't he?
- No, no, honey. l'm fine.
