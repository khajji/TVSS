1
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:21,628
Authorisation?

2
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:24,049
Bauer, 4393, CTU.

3
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:02,969
- OK, we're on it.
- Get back to me as soon as you get a match.

4
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,772
(phone rings)

5
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,232
- Bauer.
- Jack, l talked to her.

6
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,482
Thank God. What'd she say?

7
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:23,156
- She and Janet went to some party.
- So are you gonna pick 'em up?

8
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,817
- l don't know where she is. She wouldn't say.
- What?

9
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:30,622
Well, l don't know, maybe l'm being paranoid,
but she sounded... different.

10
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,621
l don't know. She told me that she loved me
before she hung up. That's not Kim.

11
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:39,214
She knows she'll get grounded.
She's trying to reduce the sentence.

12
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:43,465
Yeah, you're probably right.
How are you? Are you OK?

13
00:02:43,556 --> 00:02:47,684
Yeah, yeah, l'm fine. Look,
is that guy York still with you?

14
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:52,135
- Yeah, he's gonna take me home now.
- Shouldn't you wait by Janet's car?

15
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:55,434
Who knows what shape the girls
are gonna be in when they get back?

16
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:59,061
Well, no. Alan doesn't seem
to think that's necessary.

17
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:03,069
- Why don't you put Alan on the phone?
- Jack, don't do this.

18
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,994
- Teri, just put him on the phone.
- OK.

19
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:10,741
Alan, my husband
would like to speak with you.

20
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,625
(loud rap music)

21
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,746
- Hi, this is Alan.
- Alan, Jack Bauer.

22
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:19,254
Can't thankyou enough
for helping out with this.

23
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:24,004
- l'm just glad the girls are with each other.
- Me too. Look, l'm stuck at work.

24
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,128
Yeah. Teri said...

25
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:29,635
l would appreciate it if you would hang out
at the store and wait for them to return.

26
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:33,677
Uh, l don't think they're gonna be
back here for at least a couple of hours.

27
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:38,933
lt's a pretty rough neighbourhood and l'd hate
for there to be a problem when they return.

28
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:41,566
- Sure. We'll stay.
- Thank you.

29
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:43,819
Thank you.

30
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:47,403
(Gaines) You gotta be kidding me.
We had a deal, Mandy.

31
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:52,370
You promised to get Belkin's lD in exchange
for $1 million. Now she wants to double it?

32
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:56,041
- She doesn't know how this works.
- No, this is your fault.

33
00:03:56,128 --> 00:04:01,123
- You should never have involved an amateur.
- lf l'm such an amateur, how...

34
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:07,421
- l'm just trying to get us more money.
- There is no money. Not any more.

35
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:11,559
lra, don't turn this into
something else. l will fix it.

36
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:13,268
(phone rings)

37
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,390
What?

38
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:20,559
No, we don't have it yet.

39
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:23,226
Yes. No, of course.

40
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:26,990
l will get back to you as soon as we're ready.

41
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,711
Talk to her. Explain what l do.

42
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:42,041
- l will, but our deal stands.
- Take care of it!

43
00:04:54,186 --> 00:04:56,938
l need to get out of here, my friend.

44
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:59,858
lt'll just be a little longer.

45
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,409
We've been getting death threats ever since
my husband announced his candidacy.

46
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,293
- What is different about this one?
- l'm not privy to that kind of information.

47
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,381
All l can tell you is that my unit is only called
in when the threat becomes more serious.

48
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,257
Then why did you let him
walk out on his own?

49
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,755
We will find him, Mrs Palmer.

50
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,471
l, uh, l'm sorry.
We're grateful to have you here.

51
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:44,607
- He's not in the lobby. l looked everywhere.
- You shouldn't leave the suites.

52
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:48,989
- Let these men do their jobs.
- There's a coffee shop a few blocks down.

53
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:53,701
- l bet he wanted to be by himself. l'll get him.
- No, Keith. You're not going anywhere.

54
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,789
Secret Service knows this city
a lot better than we do.

55
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:59,412
- l'll be right back.
- l'm sorry, son.

56
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:02,419
- We need you to stay here.
- Why?

57
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:06,337
We treat a threat on a candidate's life
as a threat to the entire family.

58
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,881
We need to protect you as well.

59
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,677
Keith...

60
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:14,057
Your father's going to be fine.

61
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:46,170
- (Dan) Yeah?
- Gaines. l need an update on the Bauer girl.

62
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:49,092
Everything's copa. We're just waiting for you.

63
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:53,174
- l'm running a little late.
- We're not going anywhere.

64
00:06:53,264 --> 00:06:56,265
That's right, you're not.

65
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,553
She's in a lot of pain, man.
l think you broke her arm.

66
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:04,437
Think so? Should we take her
to the hospital and get some x-rays?

67
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:08,853
Gaines is running late. l'm gonna
smoke another j. You want one?

68
00:07:08,946 --> 00:07:11,022
Sure.

69
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:15,280
(Janet cries in pain)

70
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,778
My arm... My arm...

71
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,532
Dan, please. She needs to see a doctor.

72
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:35,592
- At least give her something, man.
- l'm not wasting my stash on her.

73
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:41,475
So, what, is Dan the boss
and you do everything he says?

74
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:59,069
Thought l told you...

75
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,080
Don't press me, man.

76
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:12,540
l should never have used you.

77
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:30,606
You're gonna give her that?

78
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:33,102
Want me to take away the pain or not?

79
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:45,803
(whooping)

80
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:06,448
Hey.

81
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,585
Hey, man, this is a private lot, homey.
You gotta pay to park here.

82
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:13,540
l see. And you're the attendant?

83
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:18,626
That's right. And it's gonna cost you
a hundred dollars. So deal it up.

84
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:32,230
You that dude! Uh, Palmer.

85
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:35,815
- No. That's not me.
- Yeah, it's you. lt's him!

86
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,354
Yo, this guy's running for president, dog.
l seen him on TV.

87
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:43,236
Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

88
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,574
Yeah. So what you gonna
do for me, Mr President?

89
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:52,330
See, that's your problem.
You want everyone else to do the work.

90
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:55,203
What are you gonna do for yourselves?

91
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:58,880
See, man? All y'all, y'all got the same rap.

92
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:04,846
Keep going like this...
and you'll be dead in five years.

93
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:09,093
- Man, like you know my life.
- More than you think.

94
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,282
Whoo!

95
00:11:29,707 --> 00:11:31,533
Yeah!

96
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,701
Whoo!

97
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:07,155
- CTU. Myers.
- Hey, it's me.

98
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:10,079
- Jack, where are you?
- About a block away.

99
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:14,826
l need you to print up a hard copy of Tony's
passenger breakdown and put it on my desk.

100
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:18,003
Wait for me. l wanna talk to you,
but not in front of the others.

101
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:21,208
- Sure.
- Great. l'll be there in a minute. Bye.

102
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,873
Keep working. Has Division responded
to the two dead agents yet?

103
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,532
- Yeah, they're picking them up now.
- Good.

104
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,493
- Anyone we know?
- Someone we know.

105
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,122
l'm afraid it was Richard Walsh.

106
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,178
l'm sorry, Jamey,
l know what he meant to you.

107
00:13:10,307 --> 00:13:13,094
What is going on? ls this
anything to do with Palmer?

108
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:18,179
That's what we gotta find out. Look,
l don't have time to go into all the details,

109
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:22,651
but l've got to put you in a difficult position.
You're the only person l can trust.

110
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:24,776
What do you mean?

111
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,656
Walsh said we've got a problem on the inside.
He told me to talk only to you.

112
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:38,409
This is the key card l sent you. On it is
pertinent information to the hit on Palmer.

113
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:42,001
How long is it gonna take you
to pull all the data off it?

114
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,133
Depending on the kind of encryption,
it could take hours.

115
00:13:46,218 --> 00:13:48,424
Palmer's day starts at six.

116
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:54,467
l need it before then.

117
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:04,062
One more thing. l need to be certain that
it was Nina's computer that burnt that card.

118
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:06,394
Why?

119
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:08,730
Because if it was, she's dirty.

120
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:13,328
l'll need a few minutes
alone at her workstation.

121
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,488
Fine. You got it.

122
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:19,114
Did you cut yourself?

123
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:23,953
- Yeah. What are you working on?
- l gave Nina the passenger list.

124
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:26,538
l'm cross-checking everything else we've got.

125
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,089
Good. l'll be down in a sec.

126
00:14:39,771 --> 00:14:43,390
- So why were you at Dunlop Plaza?
- l had a meeting with Walsh.

127
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,354
- ls that the passenger list?
- Yes.

128
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,318
Anything unusual?

129
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:52,485
There's one red flag. A man in first class.
His information is inconsistent.

130
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:56,526
- l'm trying to piece it together now.
- Good.

131
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,074
l don't wanna tell you how to do your job,

132
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,704
but not letting me know where you are,
holding back information...

133
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:08,549
How can l help you without you letting me?

134
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,762
Do you think that it's possible

135
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,849
that someone from within the agency
is behind the hit on Palmer?

136
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,810
Anything's possible. Do you have a lead?

137
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,319
No. Not really.

138
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:36,076
No.

139
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:39,328
Why do l feel like
you're not telling me the truth?

140
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:46,251
lf you've got something, tell me.
l'll work it up with you.

141
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:48,414
No, l'm...

142
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,915
l'm just thinking out loud.

143
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,299
OK. Fine.

144
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,714
ls there anything else?

145
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,304
No.

146
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:05,514
Actually, there is.

147
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,233
Are you seeing Tony?

148
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,317
Why?

149
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:21,954
ls it serious?

150
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,163
What is this, Jack?

151
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:28,201
What do you want to know? Am l over you?
Why are we talking about this now?

152
00:16:28,296 --> 00:16:31,748
l'm trying to understand why
he's been giving me such a hard time.

153
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:34,593
Yeah, well, l can't answer that for you.

154
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,216
(phone rings)

155
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,385
Hold on.

156
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:47,849
- Yeah?
- l confirmed it.

157
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:52,021
The file on the key card definitely
came from Nina's computer.

158
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,360
OK. Thank you.

159
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,866
lt's Division.

160
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,328
They want the passenger breakdown.
Please send it to them.

161
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:11,497
Sure.

162
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,507
By the way, your wife called.

163
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,101
(phone rings)

164
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:38,823
- Bauer.
- This is Data Services.

165
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,993
- You called in a thumbprint an hour ago?
- Yeah.

166
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:45,115
We checked every database we have. Nothing.

167
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:48,789
Either this guy doesn't exist
or his identity was wiped offthe record.

168
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:50,953
Thank you.

169
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:09,309
- This is gonna work out better for both of us.
- l don't care, Bridgit. Where is the lD?

170
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:13,858
This is not some secret l'm keeping
from you. This is for both of us.

171
00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:18,569
- Do you wanna get both of us killed?
- They hired you to blow up a plane.

172
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:21,741
Another million dollars
means nothing to these people.

173
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:26,323
You're wrong. Money is the only thing
''these people'' care about.

174
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,498
Let's do it anyway.

175
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:35,537
You know he can't hurt us.

176
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,960
Baby...

177
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:44,182
Nobody can hurt us.

178
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,469
One million for you,

179
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:52,809
one million for me.

180
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,855
Don't you like the way that sounds?

181
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,160
OK.

182
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,915
We're gonna do this your way.

183
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,712
Great. OK, let's tell him.

184
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:23,803
No. lt'll be better if l do it myself.

185
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,508
You're always looking out for me.

186
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,608
- What happened?
- Do you remember anything?

187
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,943
Yeah.

188
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:51,663
We were at the furniture store...
dancing... Where's Dan?

189
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,038
Shh.

190
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,287
Dan broke your arm.

191
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:59,333
He didn't break my arm. Dan likes me.

192
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,333
Yeah, look at it.

193
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,383
Ow... My arm...

194
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,887
OK.

195
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,049
Come on.

196
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:14,519
Listen to me. This is serious.
We're being kidnapped.

197
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:17,311
We need to escape. Can you walk?

198
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:21,863
- l guess.
- OK. Come on.

199
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:31,204
Get ready. When l say ''go'', we go.

200
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:33,533
Go where?

201
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,950
Just stay with me, OK?

202
00:20:36,044 --> 00:20:38,713
You gotta understand this, OK?

203
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:42,166
We could die if we don't
get out of here. Hold my hand.

204
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,506
Go.

205
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,764
Hey!

206
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,641
- Hey!
- No! Get back here!

207
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,898
- We gotta get them.
- Hey!

208
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,825
- Catch them!
- l am!

209
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:10,614
This is your fault!
This is what l was talking about!

210
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,364
Shut up!

211
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,250
- Get back here!
- We gotta get them. They can not get away.

212
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:21,337
This is good work.
Keep me informed. Thank you.

213
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:23,499
- Certainly.
- Thanks, Jack.

214
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,461
Shut the door.

215
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:34,341
- Are we saying Nina's a traitor?
- Not yet. We need to know more.

216
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:37,602
Should l shut down her confidential access?

217
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:42,018
No, that'll slow everything down. There's
gotta be some kind of explanation for this.

218
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,111
Right now what l really need
is the data off that card.

219
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:49,858
But aren't we obligated to seal off
her channels with this much evidence?

220
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:52,656
Look, you were seeing her, weren't you?

221
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:57,739
- That is none of your business.
- l think in this case it is.

222
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:05,587
Yes. When my wife and l were separated,
yes, l was seeing Nina.

223
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:08,795
- Did you say anything you shouldn't have?
- No.

224
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,008
l don't think so.

225
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:19,479
l trusted her... with everything
that was coming through here, but...

226
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:26,235
- Fine. Shut down her access.
- OK. What's she working on?

227
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:29,606
- 747 passenger list.
- Good. That's not on a secure socket.

228
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:32,617
- l can do it without her knowing.
- Good.

229
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:38,824
- Jamey?
- Don't worry, l won't say anything.

230
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,369
Thank you.

231
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,595
Gotta get them.

232
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:09,570
- Hey, get outta here.
- (Dan) Where'd they go?

233
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:20,826
- Ah, forget it.
- Aw, come on, man. Come on. Don't.

234
00:23:20,917 --> 00:23:23,455
Hey, come back! Scumbag.

235
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:27,579
You just cost me 50 bucks!
You're gonna pay for this.

236
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,711
- Word up.
- Did you see two girls run past here?

237
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:38,178
- Yeah, l seen 'em.
- Which way did they go?

238
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:42,599
- Who are they?
- Did you see 'em or not?

239
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:51,190
- They went down Central.
- (phone rings)

240
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,362
Check it out. l'll look around here.

241
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,490
- Yeah?
- lt's Gaines. How's it going?

242
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:01,826
- Everything's fine.
- Change ofplan. We meet at a new location.

243
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,242
Just let me know. l'll meet you there.

244
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:09,789
- We need to get to a phone.
- No, you need to pay up.

245
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:32,062
ls this real?

246
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:35,189
Thank you very much.

247
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,206
- What couldn't wait till morning?
- Maureen Kingsley called.

248
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,789
Said she had some new information.

249
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:38,387
David, you got me out of bed
at 2am. What did she say?

250
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:41,887
She said the Gibson boy,
the one who... raped Nicole,

251
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,098
didn't commit suicide.

252
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:46,854
That he was thrown out of the window.

253
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:50,978
So, he was thrown out
of a window. Who cares?

254
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,392
She said it was Keith!

255
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:59,490
She's gonna publicly
accuse my son of murder.

256
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:06,864
- OK, there's a couple of ways to handle this.
- lt's a lie, Carl.

257
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,875
lt's dirty politics and l won't stand for it.

258
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:15,376
My family lived through that nightmare
and l won't put Nicole through it again.

259
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:18,716
- And Keith? Keith couldn't...
- This bastard, Hodges,

260
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:21,804
he waits till the day of the primary
so you can't respond.

261
00:26:21,889 --> 00:26:24,725
- l don't care what day it is. lt's a lie...
- l know.

262
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:29,969
But we can't pretend today isn't important.
l'll put a lid on Kingsley until the polls close.

263
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:35,651
- We win the primary then take it from there.
- No. We find the source, make them recant.

264
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:40,778
Oh, l'll figure out where this is coming from
and l'll cut it off, but, David...

265
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:46,412
We go back years. You have your principles,
you don't compromise, blah blah blah.

266
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:50,910
That's why l love you. But you knew
the gloves would come off. Well, they are off.

267
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:53,493
That's why you have me.

268
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:56,505
Go back and forget about this.

269
00:26:56,591 --> 00:26:58,667
l'm on it.

270
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:03,597
l can't let them throw my son to the wolves.

271
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:06,303
David, l'll take care of it.

272
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:08,634
(screeching tyres)

273
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:11,301
- ls that you?
- Yeah. You better get lost.

274
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,687
Call you in an hour.

275
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:22,193
lt's OK, fellas.

276
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:23,897
l'm fine.

277
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:46,590
Dammit.

278
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:55,147
Janet, let's go back to the front
and wait for them to leave.

279
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:00,441
- (Rick) They're not on Central.
- (Dan) Keep looking. We gotta find 'em.

280
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,195
(Rick) OK, l'll take the side streets.
They're around here somewhere.

281
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:07,818
(Dan) Gaines just called me.
We gotta find them!

282
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:18,212
- You're in my space.
- l'm sorry. We'll leave.

283
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:26,262
- ls there a phone around here?
- No.

284
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:29,716
What are you looking for?
You wanna score some dope?

285
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,854
We need to get rid of those guys. ls there
any way you can help us get to a phone?

286
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:36,227
You want me to help you?

287
00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:42,357
What are your little
designer jeans worth? 500 bills?

288
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:46,448
And those kicks, like another, what, 25?

289
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:55,248
You wanna trade places with me for a while?

290
00:28:55,334 --> 00:29:00,874
Wanna turn some tricks while l go snuggle
with your daddy in the Hollywood foothills?

291
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,755
Go away.

292
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:25,186
We've been kidnapped. l don't know...

293
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:27,772
Her arm is broken.

294
00:29:28,242 --> 00:29:31,160
Those guys are still out there.

295
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:40,576
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

296
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:46,416
Well, is there any other way out
besides the front door?

297
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:52,055
- But if we just...
- ''But'' nothing. Get out!

298
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,467
Go!

299
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:26,668
How long have you been playing me?

300
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,760
- Playing you?
- Playing me.

301
00:30:29,845 --> 00:30:31,838
What are you doing?

302
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:35,469
- Why don't you tell me about this?
- Tell you what?

303
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,557
You loaded this card
with intel on the hit on Palmer.

304
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:42,897
l wanna know who you work for
and who you smuggled this card to.

305
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:45,023
You're delirious.

306
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:47,946
- Who are you working for?
- l work for you.

307
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,652
Who are you working for?

308
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:53,411
- Who are you working for?!
- l work for you!

309
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:56,780
Whoever programmed this card
is involved with the hit on Palmer.

310
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:59,577
This came from your computer.

311
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:03,955
l don't care where it came from, l didn't do it.

312
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,838
And l can't believe that you think l did.

313
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:26,814
There it is. One million in your account
in addition to what we already agreed on.

314
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:28,812
Where's the lD?

315
00:31:28,904 --> 00:31:31,277
Let's get it.

316
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:34,532
- No, just the three of us.
- And why do l trust you?

317
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,992
Because you want the lD.

318
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:52,756
l'm gonna miss you, Mandy.

319
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,099
- How's your arm?
- lt's OK if l don't move it.

320
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,271
Then don't move it.

321
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,310
l know you're in here.
l can smell your perfume.

322
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:54,734
Where are you?

323
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:57,397
This is starting to piss me off!

324
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:19,885
(man) He's gonna be ready.

325
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,142
Hey, l'm telling you, you know, l saw him
work out yesterday. He looked good.

326
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:28,306
He's gonna be ready.

327
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,104
- Excuse me.
- Let me call you back.

328
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:36,948
- You looking for something?
- Please, help us. These guys are after us.

329
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:39,274
- What guys?
- l'll pay whatever you want.

330
00:33:39,368 --> 00:33:41,989
Just get us out of here.

331
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:45,283
- Let's see the money.
- l don't have it on me right now.

332
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:48,957
But when you get us home,
my parents will pay whatever you want.

333
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:51,500
Sorry, l run a cash-up-front business.

334
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,507
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Janet.

335
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:02,589
Look, can we just
use your phone at least? Please?

336
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,553
Come here!

337
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:11,062
Go! Take the phone and run! Go! Go! Go!

338
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,894
Go!

339
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:25,531
Run!

340
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:29,323
- lt's cool, man. lt's cool.
- Run!

341
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,146
ls this right?

342
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:56,685
- What?
- They just posted a memorandum.

343
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:59,068
Richard Walsh is dead.

344
00:35:00,407 --> 00:35:03,325
That can't be. l mean,
he was just here an hour ago.

345
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,818
That's what it says.

346
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,206
Oh, my God.

347
00:35:19,802 --> 00:35:22,257
Can you find out what happened?

348
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:25,051
Jack's got me working on something.

349
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,307
Can you open up a socket
on the terminal? l'll check it myself.

350
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,481
Sure.

351
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,643
Thanks.

352
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:50,408
- Farrell.
- l need you up here now. Do you have it yet?

353
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:54,283
- Almost. Another couple of minutes.
- Soon as you're done, come up.

354
00:36:42,885 --> 00:36:44,842
Thank you.

355
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:55,304
(gunshot)

356
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:10,781
That job this summer - you in?

357
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:24,757
Yes.

358
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:27,960
OK, Jonathan, you're done.

359
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:45,275
You had no choice.

360
00:38:03,674 --> 00:38:09,677
The key card was definitely programmed
on Nina's computer. Login time was 10.14pm.

361
00:38:10,139 --> 00:38:13,342
Looks like the next 20 minutes
were spent gathering data,

362
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:19,223
and then another seven to burn it into
the key card. Logout was 10.41, January 14.

363
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:23,893
lt specifies which files were accessed.
lf you want details, there are two screens of...

364
00:38:23,986 --> 00:38:26,358
Wait a sec. What was the date?

365
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:30,943
- January 14, a couple of months ago.
- Second weekend in January, Jack.

366
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:33,111
(Jamey) That's all l got.

367
00:38:34,997 --> 00:38:38,117
Thank you, Jamey, that's all l need right now.

368
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:50,470
That was the same weekend that
we were in Santa Barbara together.

369
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:01,271
So someone from this office has hacked
your login code. They're in your system.

370
00:39:01,356 --> 00:39:03,978
- You were way off on this one, Jack.
- l'm sorry...

371
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:06,393
How could you?

372
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:40,719
- Division.
- lt's Tony Almeida at CTU.

373
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:43,932
Look, you'd better get down here right away.

374
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:49,609
Jack Bauer needs to be
relieved of his command.

375
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,326
(phone rings)

376
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:06,959
- Hello?
- Mom, you gotta come get us.

377
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:11,211
- What's wrong? Are you at the party?
- There was no party. They made us say that.

378
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:14,468
- Who?
- These guys. We're in North Hollywood.

379
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:16,179
- Behind...
- Platt's Auto Body.

380
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:18,506
- Platt's Auto Body.
- They're coming!

381
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,056
- Mom, you gotta come now!
- Kim! Kim!

382
00:40:21,144 --> 00:40:23,054
What's going on? Teri?

383
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:25,602
- 911 emergency.
- My daughter's in trouble.

384
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:30,151
She's in North Hollywood behind
Platt's Auto Body. Someone was chasing her.

385
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,235
(Janet) Come on, Kim.

386
00:40:38,328 --> 00:40:40,404
(tyres screech)

387
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:44,322
(driver shouts in Spanish)

388
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:54,713
No... No... No!

389
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:57,839
No, look at me. (sobs) Look at me!

390
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:00,849
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- (footsteps)

391
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:03,512
No!

392
00:41:03,604 --> 00:41:06,889
- l told you to chill! Why didn't you listen?
- Let go of me! No!

393
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:09,058
- Shut up!
- No!

394
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,480
- What about her?
- Forget her. Let's go.

395
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,648
- Come on!
- No! No!

396
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:19,650
Come on. Let's keep moving.

397
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,369
(Dan) Shut up!

398
00:42:19,262 --> 00:42:20,721
