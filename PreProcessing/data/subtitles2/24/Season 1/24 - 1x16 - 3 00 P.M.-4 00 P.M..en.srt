1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,947
Right now, terrorists are plotting to
assassinate a presidential candidate.

2
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,737
My wife and daughter have been targeted.

3
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:24,694
And people that l work with
may be involved in both.

4
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:27,455
l'm FederalAgent Jack Bauer,

5
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:31,326
and today is the longest day ofmy life.

6
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,952
(Jack) Bob, what just happened?
l can't hear you.

7
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,620
Bob, can you hear me?

8
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,465
Bob?

9
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:55,629
Bob, can you hear me?

10
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,382
Bob, pick up the phone.

11
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,307
Somebody pick up the phone.

12
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,982
Bob, can you hear me?

13
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,448
Whoever's there, just pick up the phone.

14
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,489
Bob?

15
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,786
Can anyone hear me?

16
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,578
Just pick up the phone.

17
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,206
- Pick up the pho...
- (bleep)

18
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,418
(Ellis) At the beep,
leave a message for Bob Ellis.

19
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,587
Oh, God, no.

20
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,723
Think, Jack. Just think.

21
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:54,728
- Routing operator.
- This is Jack Bauer.

22
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:58,273
l want you to transfer me to
Agent Watson in our New Orleans office.

23
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,941
- One moment, please.
- Thank you.

24
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,698
CTU New Orleans. Watson speaking.

25
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:10,247
lt's Jack Bauer at Los Angeles. You've got
an NSA operative in your region, Robert Ellis.

26
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,671
- l think something happened to him.
- What wouldyou like us to do?

27
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:18,550
l'll transfer you to our comm for the address.
Check it. Call me as soon you get anything.

28
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,804
- Jack! Jack!
- l'll transfer you now. Not now, Milo.

29
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,930
- Jack, you gotta see this.
- What?

30
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:28,514
Look. These are surveillance shots
of all three backup shooters.

31
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,769
l cross-referenced the files that Ellis
sent us with our lnterpol records.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,647
- How long ago?
- Just now.

33
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,739
Any or all of them could
still be targeting Palmer.

34
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,651
Or you.

35
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,744
- Right.
- l just sent the photos off to Secret Service.

36
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,530
Make sure they brief Palmer's staff.
l want them to keep their eyes open.

37
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:51,753
Right. There's one more thing, though.
''Johnny-cool guy'' here.

38
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:55,835
His name is Alexis Drazen.
He's Victor Drazen's son.

39
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,424
He was trained in Belgrade. Special Forces.

40
00:03:02,556 --> 00:03:04,633
Good work.

41
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,470
(phone rings)

42
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:13,645
- Hello?
- lt's me.

43
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:16,854
l wanted to tellyou we're not
leaving town today after all.

44
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,030
Well, what made the senator
decide to change his plans?

45
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:24,410
He didn't say and l didn't ask. l was just
happy l would get to see you again so soon.

46
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,200
Well, l'm leaving a meeting right now.

47
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:31,870
But l can be back at the hotel by 4.30.

48
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,748
- OK. l know where to find you.
- OK.

49
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,474
(radio) 10-98, can you give me a delta check?

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,186
This is Daniels. l'm in position.
Touch your ear if you hear me.

51
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,975
(Daniels) Paulson, do you read me?

52
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,146
Yeah.

53
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,113
(Paulson) Breeher, talk to me.
Howyou lookin'?

54
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:09,323
- lt's quiet on my end.
- (phone rings)

55
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,095
Paulson. Yeah, Jack, hold on.

56
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,300
(knock at door)

57
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:30,593
Excuse me, Mrs Bauer.

58
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,182
- lt's Jack.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,489
- Jack?
- How you doing?

60
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,527
l'm doing OK. Just trying to get some rest.

61
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,992
Look, l couldn't help feeling
after l hung up that...

62
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,872
l don't know, that something was wrong.

63
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,039
No, l'm fine.

64
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,500
A lot's happened, and...

65
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,888
- l really need to talk to you.
- Fine, then let's talk.

66
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,094
- No, not now. Now's not the time.
- Why not?

67
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:20,356
You do what you have to do and
we'll talk when this is all over, OK?

68
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,272
OK.

69
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,117
l'm here at CTU ifyou need me.

70
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,278
l know.

71
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,116
OK. Bye.

72
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:44,296
(Pierce) Folks, l know you're all busy,
so l'll be as brief as l can be.

73
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:47,386
- Good. You're just in time.
- (Palmer) What's going on?

74
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:50,556
Bauer sent over photos
of the people targeting you.

75
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,639
The threat against Senator Palmer
remains a high probability.

76
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,521
But we have gotten a significant piece
of heads-up intelligence.

77
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,768
These three men...

78
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,735
are the suspected shooters.

79
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,827
Now, since you're all on
the front line of this campaign,

80
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,913
we're hoping you can expand
our surveillance reach.

81
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,412
We can always use more
eyes and ears in the field.

82
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:23,750
lf you see anyone who you suspect
as being one of these people,

83
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,877
let an agent know immediately.

84
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,972
- (Pierce) Everybody clear on that?
- Elizabeth, what's wrong?

85
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,972
- (Nina) OK, but the fact is, Rick ran away.
- He was scared.

86
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,138
(Nina) Apparently.

87
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,893
Any explanation he has doesn't
change the fact he's a fugitive.

88
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,570
lf you know where he is
and aren't telling us, that constitutes...

89
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,276
- l don't know where he is.
- Are you sure?

90
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,777
What l am sure of is that he helped us escape

91
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:59,036
and if it wasn't for him,
we would have never got out of there.

92
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,537
Kim...

93
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,621
When people are taken hostage,

94
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:12,138
it's not uncommon for them to feel
a certain bond with their kidnappers.

95
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,093
Rick isn't a kidnapper.

96
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,758
And anyway, l don't know where he is.

97
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,312
Oh, l'm sorry, Nina.
l thought you were finished.

98
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,647
Um... whenever you're ready,
we can pick up where we left off.

99
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,481
OK. Um...

100
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:34,785
Why don't you take a break,
and your mother and l can finish up in here.

101
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,743
You OK?

102
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,795
- Sure you're OK to do this?
- Yeah, sure. Are you?

103
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,753
Yeah.

104
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,299
Listen, Nina, um...

105
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,306
l don't want you to have to tiptoe around me.

106
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,475
Jack and l were separated
when you slept with him.

107
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,767
l'm not gonna hold that against you, OK?

108
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,113
OK, um...

109
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,533
You and Kim have both said
that Rick helped you.

110
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:28,710
But talking to Kim, l get the sense
that she's withholding something.

111
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,835
Based on what?

112
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,845
She's protecting Rick.
She seems to have feelings for him,

113
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,889
from what l can tell.

114
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,558
Well, there may have been an attraction
when she met him last night,

115
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,730
but if Kimberly knew anything
l'm sure she'd tell you.

116
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,523
Are you sure about that?

117
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,060
She's my daughter. l think
l know her better than you.

118
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,784
(phone rings)

119
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,788
- Bauer.
- lt's David Palmer.

120
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,791
- Sir, is everything all right?
- l'm not sure.

121
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,785
What's going on?

122
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,247
A member of my advance team,
Elizabeth Nash,

123
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,503
she recognised one of the assassins
in the photos you sent Secret Service.

124
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,050
lt's Victor Drazen's son, Alexis.

125
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,175
- Does she know where he is?
- They're in contact.

126
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,221
''Contact''? What do you mean?
ln which context?

127
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,889
lntimate.

128
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:31,942
Senator, is this person in a position
to endanger your security?

129
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:37,984
l'm afraid so. Look, she's pretty shaken up,
but she wants to help.

130
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,995
Good. We have to bring her in
to CTU and question her.

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,322
We'll get a helicopter over to you.

132
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:49,584
l'll have her ready. Oh, what about Ellis? Did
he retrieve the file on Operation Nightfall?

133
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,337
- l lost contact with Ellis.
- ''Lost contact''? What do you mean?

134
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:59,049
We got interrupted in the middle of our phone
call. Sir, l've got a very bad feeling about this.

135
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,552
- So what are you telling me?
- For now, we have to assume Ellis is dead.

136
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,055
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,271
Milo, get me chopper command.

138
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,949
(phone ringing)

139
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,330
( ''Who's That Kat?'' by the Salads)

140
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,880
- Hello?
- Rick, it's Kim.

141
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,100
- Hey.
- This woman here, she's really pushing me.

142
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,435
- What'd you tell her?
- The truth. That you helped us escape.

143
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,475
Well, that's really gonna save my ass.

144
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,818
l'm sorry. l'm a little edgy right now.

145
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,107
l just think, if you tell her
what happened, it'll work out.

146
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,859
She won't believe me.

147
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,702
l don't know how much longer
l can cover for you.

148
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,622
OK, OK. Can she prove anything?

149
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,782
l don't think so.

150
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,868
Well, that's all that matters.

151
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:14,623
Listen, l appreciate what you're doing and all,
but you probably shouldn't call here.

152
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,123
- At least not for a while.
- How long?

153
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,294
l dunno. l gotta...

154
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,683
- Who's that?
- l don't know. Just a wrong number.

155
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,929
l'm worked. l'm gonna crash for a while, OK?

156
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,295
So is there anything else
you can tell me about Gaines?

157
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,502
Maybe a conversation you overheard?

158
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,724
- Who's Gaines?
- lra Gaines, the leader of the group.

159
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,884
Right.

160
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,184
- Teri...
- Nina, l'm fine.

161
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,065
Maybe we should take a break.

162
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,314
Maybe you should do your job, Nina.
Don't you have a job to do?

163
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,816
l wish it were that simple.

164
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:26,071
Things tend to get complicated
when you screw your boss.

165
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,654
Look, this obviously isn't working.

166
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,825
No, it's not.

167
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:37,919
l'm sorry. l thought l could stay calm and
rational about this, but l can't do it. l'm sorry.

168
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:43,048
There's no apology needed,
but l think Paulson should finish up here.

169
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,234
George. What are you doing here?

170
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,483
- l'm the new quarterback.
- Since when?

171
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,191
- Since right now.
- What about Alberta Green?

172
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,360
Back at District.

173
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:13,205
So Chapelle thought you'd do a better job
keeping an eye on me than she would.

174
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,076
l dunno, Jack. Something like that, l guess.

175
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,595
So, it's really Drazen's boys
that are after Palmer, huh?

176
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,096
This whole thing is a revenge play
for killing their father.

177
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,430
l know why they're gunning for you,
but why are they after Palmer?

178
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:39,978
Senator Palmer was head of the
subcommittee that authorised the mission.

179
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,814
- You got Ellis tracking down the file on that?
- l had Ellis.

180
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,030
l lost contact with him 20 minutes ago.

181
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,656
You think they took him out?

182
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,446
Yes, l do. We got a break
on another front, though.

183
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,666
A Ms Elizabeth Nash,
part of the senator's advance team,

184
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:01,833
identified one of the shooters from
photos l sent over. She'd been dating him.

185
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:06,835
She had no idea who he was. She's shaken up
but she's on her way here for a debriefing.

186
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,337
Which one of 'em was she seeing?

187
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,727
Alexis Drazen. She's supposed to
meet him in his hotel room in an hour.

188
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,303
Good. That'll give us time to stage an arrest.

189
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:23,271
Think about this. What if she keeps her date?
We'd have the upper hand for the first time.

190
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,521
- See what we could learn.
- lt's risky.

191
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:31,320
l'd have a squad across the hall ready to go
into that room before anything could happen.

192
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,368
George, l think this is too big
an opportunity just to pass up.

193
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,457
- What time is she getting here?
- Ten minutes.

194
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,753
- We'll talk to her, then make up our minds.
- Absolutely.

195
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,557
- She's going to the CTU office.
- (man) Why are they taking her there?

196
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,562
They wanna find out all they can
about this Alexis Drazen.

197
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:02,230
- ls that the brother?
- No, it's his son.

198
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,651
- Hey, let me call you back.
- All right. l'll wait foryour call.

199
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,814
Keith, come in.

200
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,035
What's up?

201
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,707
We haven't had much chance to talk since
last night, and it seems like every time we do,

202
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,200
we're at each other's throats.

203
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,415
Everything's OK between you and me.

204
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:29,589
l guess you've noticed that we haven't
been quite on the same page today.

205
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,051
lt has been kinda hard to miss.

206
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,259
The pressure's on. lt's testing all of us.

207
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,638
For sure.

208
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,978
That's what l wanted to talk about.

209
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,810
lt stayed in my head,
what you said a couple of hours ago.

210
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:53,571
About how Dr Ferragamo was always there
when you needed someone, and l wasn't.

211
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,575
l'm sorry. But that's just how it was then.

212
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,914
That's all gonna change.

213
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,955
Starting now.

214
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,757
l know l can't earn your trust overnight.

215
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:15,302
But if you just come to me when
you need to talk, l promise you, son,

216
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,802
l'll always be there.

217
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,475
Thanks, Dad.

218
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:33,021
So what about Dr Ferragamo?
Did the police say anything?

219
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,068
We haven't called yet.

220
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:42,038
- What are we waiting for?
- We're not putting anything off, Keith.

221
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:47,713
lt's just something else has come up. Listen
to me. We have a security breach on our staff.

222
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,206
We have to deal with that first.

223
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,258
What kind of security breach?

224
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,131
- l can't tell you.
- You can't tell me anything.

225
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:02,100
Look, Keith, l have to be able to make
decisions without you challenging me.

226
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:06,649
Look, everything you're feeling...
Now's the time l need you, Dad.

227
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,400
Not just to talk to me,
but to do the right thing.

228
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,951
Keith... Keith!

229
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:21,073
l will do the right thing... at the right time.

230
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,002
Yeah, l'm sure you will.

231
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,085
l've found Bauer's wife and daughter.
They were moved to a safe house.

232
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,549
- Where are you?
- l'm almost in.

233
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,979
How many men are guarding them?

234
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:48,981
l'm handling the situation, Andre. Rest
assured, the women will be dead soon.

235
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,773
Call me the minute it's done.

236
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,290
- Milo, can you help me out with something?
- Yeah.

237
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:51,536
What's wrong with the system? My terminal's
locked. l just downloaded all my files to here.

238
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,374
Dammit!

239
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,586
Whoa, just hold on a second. Let me see.

240
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,973
Why can't l log in?

241
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,509
- What, you mean Mason didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?

242
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:11,561
They downgraded your privileges to 3W.
You're the same as everyone else down here.

243
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,142
l see.

244
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:18,945
Look, here. This should
get you into anything you need.

245
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,527
Thanks.

246
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,034
Jack, don't worry. You'll be back
in your office by tomorrow.

247
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,537
- By tomorrow l'll be in federal custody.
- But why...

248
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:33,663
l'm only on provisional status for the day.
When Palmer leaves the state, l face charges.

249
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,333
Yeah.

250
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,335
l'm sorry. Look, you're all set here. Just...

251
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,506
Thanks.

252
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,183
- Milo?
- Yeah?

253
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,767
Have you noticed anyone accessing
anything unusual on the servers?

254
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,140
What do you mean?

255
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:59,779
l don't know. Anything received
or relating to sensitive intel.

256
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,950
No, but l haven't been looking for it.

257
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,532
Start looking.

258
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:08,570
Wait, you think there's
another mole inside CTU?

259
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,537
l don't know. Just let me know
if you find anything, OK?

260
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,703
OK.

261
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,634
- All l'm saying is, don't test me.
- (Carl) l'm not.

262
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,091
- l will do what l said!
- (sighs) Keith...

263
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,383
l'm serious. l have nothing
left to lose. Not any more.

264
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,266
- You're upset...
- That's right.

265
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,925
- OK, we should talk.
- l'm glad you understand.

266
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,938
- You know the Griffith Park Observatory?
- Yeah.

267
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:35,063
Can you meet me there now?

268
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,354
Yeah, l can be there. 15 minutes.

269
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,314
- Be where?
- Nowhere.

270
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,448
- Keith...
- l'm trying to protect you.

271
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,240
The last time you tried
to protect me, someone died.

272
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,618
Nicole, please.

273
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,376
l'm sorry. That was a terrible thing to say.

274
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,292
- The less you know...
- Who were you talking to on the phone?

275
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,624
- You trust me, don't you?
- Trust goes both ways, Keith.

276
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,671
Carl.

277
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,546
Why?

278
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:10,425
l don't wanna spend my life with the same
regret l've had for the past seven years.

279
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,648
- You didn't kill Gibson intentionally.
- But l kept the truth from coming out.

280
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:17,519
And now, with Dr Ferragamo dead...

281
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,442
Look, l can't do that again, Nicole.
l won't. And l need your help.

282
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,104
For what?

283
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,403
Listen, this Secret Service guy's
been dogging me all day.

284
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,068
- Help me get past him.
- He's here to protect us.

285
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:34,078
Everything that's been happening today,
everything that's still happening.

286
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,703
lt's not too late to change
the way this all plays out.

287
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:43,046
Now, do you trust me or not?

288
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,757
OK. Good. OK.

289
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,925
All right.

290
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,904
Excuse me. l was on the phone
and l heard a clicking sound,

291
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:15,659
and l'm wondering if that's my dad being
bugged or if l'm just being paranoid.

292
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,871
(agent) Well, why don't we
just go check it out?

293
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,885
(TV noise)

294
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,488
Victor Drazen had two sons.

295
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:59,576
We know Alexis Drazen is here. l think we
should assume Andre Drazen is here as well.

296
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,961
- With at least two other shooters, right?
- Potentially a third, assuming Ellis is dead.

297
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,589
Here she comes.

298
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:16,808
Miss Nash? George Mason, District Director.
This is Agent Jack Bauer.

299
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:19,731
Mr Bauer. Senator Palmer told me about you.

300
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,979
He said l should do whatever you tell me
and l could be sure l'd be in good hands.

301
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,945
l appreciate that. l have to tell you if you
wish a lawyer present, you're entitled to that,

302
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:33,244
but we in no way consider you a suspect.
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

303
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:37,457
l don't need a lawyer.
l'll cooperate in any way l can.

304
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,618
Come on in.

305
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:48,003
- Can l have something to drink?
- l'll get you a glass of water.

306
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,421
So...

307
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,719
how did Alexis Drazen
represent himself to you?

308
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,761
He told me he ran
an importing company out of Berlin.

309
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,353
He seemed successful.
He gave me this on our third date.

310
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:11,483
lt must have cost him $10,000. lt's real,
which is more than l can say for him.

311
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,819
- When did you meet him?
- About a month ago, in DC.

312
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,701
l'm with the senator's advance team.

313
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:23,208
We had some downtime
and a few of us went out for drinks.

314
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,869
So you met him in a bar?

315
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:32,292
When you're working on a campaign you
basically put your life on hold for a year.

316
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,389
There's always people around, but it's lonely.

317
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:41,186
You're supposed to meet Mr Drazen
in his hotel room in about an hour?

318
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,395
That's right.

319
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,558
Miss Nash...

320
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:50,526
Would you be willing to keep
your appointment with Alexis?

321
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:54,066
- You want me to spy on him?
- Well, only if you feel comfortable.

322
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,027
- lf you have any doubts at all...
- We'd keep it simple.

323
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:02,701
We want you to plant a tracking device
on him, so we can trace his locations.

324
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,578
lt's just the thought of seeing him again.

325
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:13,135
We would make it so that we could hear and
see everything that took place in that room.

326
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,297
You would be safe.

327
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,688
lt's OK. We understand. Jack, you head over
to the hotel. l'll finish debriefing Miss Nash.

328
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,563
Yeah.

329
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,154
Mr Bauer? You say that this
might help protect the senator?

330
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,069
Yes, l think it would.

331
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,074
The senator is safe. He's got Secret Service
men with him around the clock.

332
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:44,577
That didn't stop Alexis from getting to me,
did it? And if they got to me,

333
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,504
they might have got to somebody else.

334
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:55,470
l'll do it. lf something happened to Senator
Palmer that l might have prevented,

335
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,555
l could never forgive myself. Please.

336
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,799
l have to do this.

337
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:11,443
He looks familiar too.
l think l heard them call him Jenson.

338
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,775
(Paulson) Recognise him?

339
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,536
How about him?

340
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,411
You know this one?

341
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,507
(Kim) Yeah.

342
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:38,086
He was one of the guards.
l think they called him Eli.

343
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:42,257
- Can you tell me anything about him?
- No.

344
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,735
Daniels, this is Breeher.

345
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,527
Daniels, this is Breeher.

346
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:28,688
(Paulson) These rooms with monitors -
they had your father under surveillance?

347
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:31,939
- From what l saw.
- Even at CTU?

348
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,689
- l don't know.
- What about you, Mrs Bauer?

349
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,067
Mrs Bauer?

350
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:46,780
- lt's important we get through the questions.
- Agent Paulson, l think we need a break.

351
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,994
- My mom's very tired.
- Yeah, OK.

352
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,258
Mom, are you OK?

353
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,685
Mom?

354
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:39,042
Ron?

355
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,006
Ron?

356
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:59,191
- Come with me. Go. Go. Shh. Let's go.
- Mom...

357
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,777
- Come on. Go. Go.
- (Kim) Come on.

358
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:14,452
ln here.

359
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,129
Lock the door.

360
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:40,854
(clink)

361
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:45,192
- Come out. Hands where l can see them.
- Don't shoot. l'm coming out.

362
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,451
- Now!
- l'm coming out.

363
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:50,614
Drop the gun.

364
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,742
Get down. Down!

365
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,960
(Teri) Hurry.

366
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,978
(Kim) Go. Go. Go! Go! Go!

367
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:23,812
- (silenced gunshot)
- Get down!

368
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,815
(Kim) Look out!

369
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,329
Honey, get down!

370
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,232
We're ready to go, gentlemen.

371
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:04,150
l'll fill you in with the rest at the hotel.
That's where you'll meet the team.

372
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:07,156
Don't be nervous.
l'll be with you every step of the way.

373
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,901
Jack, l gotta talk to you.

374
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:12,741
Secret Service will take you to the helicopter.
l'll be there in one second.

375
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,945
What?

376
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,417
They just found Ellis's body
in a men's room in the French Quarter.

377
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,751
- Do we have any leads yet?
- No, not yet.

378
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,171
Keep me posted.

379
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,014
What are you doing here?

380
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:40,310
- l'd no reason to stay. Teri and Kim are fine.
- l asked you to stay to make them feel safe.

381
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,815
They are safe. l settled them in.
Paulson's taking care of them

382
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:46,572
and the extra security team is in place.

383
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:14,382
Hang on, Kim.

384
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,961
- You OK, honey?
- Yeah.

385
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:51,296
l think we lost 'em. l'm just gonna go check.
l want you to stay right here, OK?

386
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:54,008
- Yeah.
- Stay right here.

387
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:09,061
Argh!

388
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,040
- He's dead, isn't he? Ferragamo's dead.
- l have no idea.

389
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:12,832
- Don't try to blow me off, Carl.
- The authorities are looking into it.

390
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:16,592
- They won't find anything!
- l've gone through this with your father...

391
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:20,180
My father is his own man, and so am l.
So you can go through it with me!

392
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:23,185
Let's just go. What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

393
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:28,478
Ferragamo was there for me when nobody
else was. l might not be alive if not for him.

394
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:33,229
He also betrayed your confidence, Keith.
He's the one who went to Maureen Kingsley.

395
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:37,237
- That doesn't justify murder.
- What exactly are you hoping to do?

396
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:39,319
- Bring him back to life?
- l want justice.

397
00:34:39,412 --> 00:34:43,160
Justice? Well, justice is a tricky thing, Keith.

398
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:47,575
Take Lyle Gibson, for example.
You want justice for that?

399
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:52,881
- Gibson's death was an accident.
- Maybe so, but let's be objective.

400
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:58,673
He rapes your sister, you pay him a visit, he
ends up dead. Accident could be a tough sell.

401
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:06,224
lf l go public with the truth about Ferragamo,
you'll go public with a lie about Gibson.

402
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:09,101
ls that what you're saying?

403
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:12,607
- Oh, brother.
- There's one catch here, Carl.

404
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:17,274
There are two cover-ups and you're involved
in both. However it plays out, it's bad for you.

405
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,240
- l can take care of myself.
- No.

406
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:22,446
The moneymen behind
my father's campaign take care of you.

407
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:29,075
But if things get ugly they'll make sure you're
the one who takes the fall, won't they, Carl?

408
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:32,879
Or maybe they'll do to you
what you did to Dr Ferragamo.

409
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,373
You are in way over your head.

410
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,469
And you're getting nervous. l can smell it.

411
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:46,299
OK, you listen to me. Whatever you think
you can do, to me or anyone else,

412
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,764
it'll be a hundred times worse for you.

413
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:52,609
- l'm not so sure.
- Well, l am.

414
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:57,651
Because if you push things too far,
they will do whatever they have to do.

415
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,278
Killing David Palmer's son might get messy.

416
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:03,950
Oh, l think they'd be
a little more subtle than that.

417
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:06,114
l'm not following you.

418
00:36:08,376 --> 00:36:12,243
There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office

419
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,746
that leads directly to you.

420
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:18,632
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time.

421
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,637
But with a little help, they'll find it.

422
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:28,391
- So l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder?
- Like l said, whatever it takes.

423
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:32,856
That's why your father backed off,
and that's why you'll back off.

424
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:55,789
(tape rewinds)

425
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,624
(Keith) l'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder?

426
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:01,469
(Carl) Like l said, whatever it takes.

427
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:06,097
That's whyyour father backed off,
and that's whyyou'll back off.

428
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,259
(click)

429
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,596
Hey.

430
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:19,182
Are you OK?

431
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,396
What happened?

432
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:28,781
What's your name?

433
00:39:31,037 --> 00:39:33,278
l don't remember.

434
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,572
You don't even know your name?

435
00:39:43,674 --> 00:39:46,794
Well, you can't stand
in the middle of the road.

436
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:54,558
Come on, get in. l'll give you a ride.

437
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:56,720
Thank you.

438
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:11,868
l'm sorry. Thank you.

439
00:41:31,866 --> 00:41:33,942
Mom!

440
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:37,193
Mom!
