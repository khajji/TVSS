1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,340
Previously on 24

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,950
We need to pick him off to
try to save the president.

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,680
I'll make a run for
the lockdown room.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,750
There are five
canisters of ch-4.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,750
All we need is
one stray bullet.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,790
A suicide play,jack.

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,220
We don't have a choice.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,230
Don't you move!

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,700
We have the president!

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,970
The president is secure!

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,339
I'm so sorry,jack.

12
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,944
I know that he was your friend.

13
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:39,340
It was supposed to be me.

14
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,111
Juma and his men were
not working alone.

15
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,303
And right now,the only lead
we've got is ryan burnett.

16
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:45,101
He knew about the attack
on the white house,

17
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:48,013
And chances are,he's gonna
know who juma was talking to.

18
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:49,450
I'm thinking about

19
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:51,050
Bringing olivia on

20
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:53,652
As a special advisor.

21
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:56,010
Nobody's forgotten what she
did during the campaign.

22
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,820
Leaking damaging
personal information

23
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:59,392
About your opponent
to the press.

24
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:00,893
She's changed.

25
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:02,662
It's not the past
that concerns me.

26
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:03,891
Do you think any of this

27
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,060
Would've happened if my
mother had a chief advisor

28
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:08,322
Who knew what the hell was
going on in her administration?

29
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:10,371
I just got off the
phone with ethan kanin.

30
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,402
He's ordering me to let
bauer interrogate burnett.

31
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,272
Look,i didn't want to
go behind your back,

32
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:16,841
But you didn't
leave me any choice.

33
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:18,341
I want you to clean
out your office

34
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,640
And hand in your badge.

35
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:20,941
I'm suspending you.

36
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:24,181
Jack bauer's on his way to
kennedy memorial hospital.

37
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:25,683
Burnett will tell
him everything.

38
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:27,871
I have already sent
somebody to the hospital

39
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,191
To deal with burnett.

40
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,551
He can take care of
bauer at the same time.

41
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:33,190
You lay one finger
on him,it's over.

42
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:35,861
Right.

43
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:37,692
Juma's attack failed.

44
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,500
He's dead,so are his men.

45
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,371
Somebody get me the
hell out of here!

46
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:43,703
You're not going anywhere.

47
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:44,830
What happened?

48
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:45,942
What's going on?

49
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:57,080
Damn it,bauer,open the door!

50
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:01,721
I want a high-priority
apb issued for jack bauer.

51
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:03,542
Larry,it's jack. listen to me.

52
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:04,793
I'm being set up.

53
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:06,393
Don't let them get
away with this.

54
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:08,031
This threat is not over.

55
00:02:08,137 --> 00:02:13,132
The following takes place between 9 p.m.
and 10 p.m.

56
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:13,421
I dropped my wife off
here five hours ago,

57
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,200
And now no one can
tell me where she is.

58
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:17,382
Mr. o'brian,the white
house has been attacked.

59
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,023
We're in the midst of
an urgent protocol.

60
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:20,552
Exactly. that's why i'd like to

61
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:22,002
know if my wife all right.

62
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:23,233
She is; she's fine.

63
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,271
Where is she?

64
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:26,470
Tell me.

65
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:28,472
She's in a holding room
on the third floor.

66
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:30,171
What...? she's been arrested.

67
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,043
That's absurd.

68
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:33,943
What's she charged with?
i want to see her.

69
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,842
Listen,i've already told
you more than i should have.

70
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,043
When agent moss
returns,he'll tell you

71
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:38,110
Everything you need to know.

72
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:39,373
In the meanwhile,i'm gonna have

73
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,212
To ask you to wait in
the conference room,okay?

74
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:42,050
Please. i'm sorry.

75
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:43,810
Please escort him to
the conference room.

76
00:03:43,926 --> 00:03:43,942
Thank you.

77
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,120
Janis,larry's calling for you.

78
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,192
He says it's urgent.

79
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:50,390
What line? three.

80
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:53,030
Sign here,verifying
you understand

81
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,832
The terms of your suspension,

82
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,230
And again here...

83
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:57,900
Agent walker?

84
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:59,072
Go ahead, i'm listening.

85
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:01,140
Larry,it's janis.

86
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:02,910
Ryan burnett is dead.

87
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,073
How?

88
00:04:04,247 --> 00:04:06,303
Bauer was interrogating
him when it happened,

89
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:07,683
And we're responsible.

90
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,650
You're saying that
bauer killed burnett?

91
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:10,853
I don't know.

92
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,982
He escaped before
i could get to him.

93
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:14,643
He called me,said he was being

94
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,322
set up and he wouldn't come in.

95
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:20,320
I lost him,janis.

96
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:22,492
I lost him,and it's
on me to find him.

97
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,833
Just tell me what you need.

98
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,360
I already sent out a
priority,all-agency apb.

99
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,033
I need you to
follow up on that.

100
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,402
I'm coming back to
the office right now.

101
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:33,001
I'll coordinate the search
operation from there.

102
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:35,043
Okay.

103
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,442
Open an all-agency channel

104
00:04:36,618 --> 00:04:38,830
With flags for immediate
action on jack bauer.

105
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,332
I'll make sure the
local police departments

106
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,240
Are linked in.

107
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,253
On it. thank you.

108
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,613
Janis,what did larry say?

109
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,172
Jack get anything
out of burnett?

110
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:45,971
You're suspended.

111
00:04:46,148 --> 00:04:47,543
I cannot discuss this with you.

112
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:48,850
Janis,this was my case.

113
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:50,851
Tell me if jack got
anything out of burnett.

114
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:53,123
Burnett is dead.

115
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:55,020
Well,tell me what happened.

116
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,033
Bauer was there,and
now he's missing.

117
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,463
Janis,the channel's open.

118
00:05:00,636 --> 00:05:01,531
Thank you.

119
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:03,031
That's all i know,honestly.

120
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,203
So,please,let me get
back to work,okay?

121
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,873
Please attach jack bauer's
profile to the apb.

122
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,933
Got you.

123
00:05:45,017 --> 00:05:46,513
Walker.

124
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:47,512
Renee,it's jack.

125
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:48,953
Don't hang up the phone,please.

126
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:51,152
Whatever they told you,i
did not kill burnett.

127
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:53,280
Renee?

128
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:54,362
Yeah.

129
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:55,232
Bill was right.

130
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:56,940
There are still very
powerful people

131
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,653
Involved in this conspiracy
that were not named

132
00:05:58,766 --> 00:05:59,561
In dubaku's drive.

133
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,480
They're trying to
cover their tracks.

134
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,452
They killed burnett,and
they're framing me for it.

135
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:04,930
Even if i wanted
to help you,jack,

136
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,992
Larry has every law enforcement
agency within 100 miles

137
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,621
Looking for you,and i
have been suspended.

138
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:10,301
All i want you to
do is make an i.d.

139
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:12,490
I got a frame grab from the
hospital's surveillance.

140
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:13,441
I sent you a photo

141
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,941
Of the man who
did kill burnett.

142
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:17,340
It's in your inbox.

143
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,510
Renee,this man is

144
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,779
The only connection i
have to whoever else

145
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,014
Is involved in this thing.

146
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:27,320
Please,i need your help.

147
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:28,663
Look,i know you don't agree

148
00:06:28,766 --> 00:06:30,121
with some of thing i did to the

149
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:34,260
But... i'm telling
you the truth.

150
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,663
Renee?

151
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:40,661
You know what?

152
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:41,932
Forget it. i'm-i'm sorry.

153
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:42,902
I made a mistake.

154
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,831
I'll call you back
at this number.

155
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:52,143
Metro police,

156
00:06:52,316 --> 00:06:53,510
This is the fbi reporting.

157
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:55,983
We have a suspect,jack
bauer,that's escaped custody.

158
00:06:56,157 --> 00:06:57,950
All available
units,please respond.

159
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:07,922
Yes,quinn.

160
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,830
Bauer got away from the fbi.

161
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:10,690
How?

162
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:11,561
Well,bauer is

163
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:13,453
An extremely
impressive operative.

164
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,103
You don't have to tell me that.

165
00:07:15,277 --> 00:07:18,001
But the fbi has launched a
major effort to apprehend him.

166
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,272
He won't be able to
avoid them for long.

167
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,443
Well,we'll see,won't we?

168
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:23,911
Monitor the situation,keep
me apprised.

169
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,242
Yes,sir.

170
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,913
If bauer connects us to juma,

171
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:30,843
It could seriously
impede this operation.

172
00:07:30,956 --> 00:07:32,920
Yes,it could.

173
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,691
Is the shipment on time?

174
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,260
Yes. due into port
in the next hour.

175
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,520
Then I don't foresee a problem.

176
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,060
Once the weapons are deployed,

177
00:07:43,237 --> 00:07:45,591
Then it doesn't matter what mr.
bauer or anyone else knows.

178
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:49,633
Something wrong?

179
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:52,241
No,sir.

180
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,240
Mr. seaton,I get no pleasure

181
00:07:56,416 --> 00:08:01,041
From the knowledge that
people will die at our hands.

182
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:05,083
One single soul,the loss of
one soul is tragic to me,

183
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,482
Let alone the numbers
we're talking about!

184
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,521
But do not forget
that every war

185
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,761
Worth fighting involves
collateral damage.

186
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:13,563
And what we're doing

187
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,960
Is fundamentally and
absolutely necessary!

188
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,963
And I know you understand that!

189
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,532
Of course.

190
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,270
Wake up our colleagues

191
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,240
And have them
assembled in one hour.

192
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,210
And tell them to pack their
pajamas and their toothbrushes.

193
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:37,653
It's gonna be a long night.

194
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,691
Yeah?

195
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:52,601
- I have an I.D. - Who is it?

196
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,760
John quinn.

197
00:08:53,935 --> 00:08:55,202
Black ops combat vet.

198
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,973
Served tours all
over the world.

199
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,541
Now he works for starkwood.

200
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,630
The defense consultant?

201
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,433
Uh,yeah,they started
out as consultants,

202
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:03,230
But over the past few
years,while you were

203
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,933
Out of the country,the
pentagon outsourced

204
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,882
Billions of dollars
in contracts to them.

205
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:07,983
What kind of contracts?

206
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,310
Manpower.

207
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:10,973
Starkwood's basically
a private army.

208
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:12,743
They recruit ex-soldiers
and swat team members

209
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:13,743
From around the world,

210
00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:16,413
Then they hire them back to
the military security teams.

211
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:19,190
We're talking thousands of
men deployed here and abroad.

212
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,520
Starkwood work with juma?

213
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:22,533
Well,if they did,it
wasn't on the books.

214
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,562
But,you know,if anyone
knows,it's senator mayer.

215
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:28,003
Why mayer?

216
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:29,143
After he dismantled ctu,

217
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,823
He launched several
other investigations.

218
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,393
One of them has been
looking at starkwood.

219
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:33,940
What were they accused of?

220
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,441
The hearings are classified,but

221
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:38,311
Supposedly,mayer has enough
to put them out of business.

222
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:39,941
Okay,i'm gonna need
to talk to him.

223
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:41,582
See if you can access
the CIRG logs.

224
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,251
They should have
a location on him.

225
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:46,181
Okay. i'll send you mayer's
location as soon as i have it.

226
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:47,551
Thanks.

227
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,921
Agent walker still here?

228
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:53,180
She was just in her office.

229
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:54,852
But there's somebody
waiting to see you

230
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,530
In the conference room.
they need to...

231
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:23,293
Just have a few more
forms to fill out,

232
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:24,222
Then I'm taking off.

233
00:10:24,396 --> 00:10:25,960
You hear what happened
at the hospital?

234
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,622
After everything that
jack's done today,

235
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:31,611
Do you really believe
that he murdered Burnett?

236
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:33,530
I don't know.

237
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,261
I... I don't care.

238
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:37,372
He's a federal fugitive
and needs to be found.

239
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:40,842
But you think it's
possible that he did this?

240
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,043
I'm not sure I do.

241
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,041
It's been a long day.

242
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:50,282
Go home,get some sleep.

243
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,222
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Okay.

244
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:05,030
Excuse me,Larry.

245
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,632
Morris o'brian is waiting
in the conference room.

246
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:10,870
He wants to know why
his wife is in holding.

247
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,841
Renee talked to bauer.

248
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,771
How do you know?

249
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,642
Access her phone log
for the last 15 minutes

250
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,322
And get into her workstation,

251
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:22,403
find out what she's been doing

252
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:23,982
All right.

253
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:26,522
If we want to catch
bauer,she's our best shot.

254
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,691
Okay.

255
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,030
We've received confirmation
that president taylor

256
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,523
will be making a statement
to the country shortly.

257
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,883
She is expected to address
the attack on the white house

258
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,661
That ended an hour ago
in a startling rescue.

259
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:47,133
Now,based on the
few details we have,

260
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:49,643
We do know the rescue
resulted in the death

261
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,373
Of general juma and
all of his forces.

262
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:55,382
Angela,how much lead time
does the media need,

263
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:57,610
Once I'm finished
with my revisions?

264
00:11:57,788 --> 00:11:59,913
The major outlets will
put us on immediately.

265
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,223
I'll be done shortly.

266
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,682
Thank you,angela.

267
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:07,760
I have a thought

268
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:10,013
About the speech,if
you'd like to hear it.

269
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,090
Of course.

270
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,731
Right now your main
thrust is reassurance.

271
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:15,661
The attacks are behind us,

272
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,500
Everything's going to
be back to normal.

273
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,531
But I think you're missing
an opportunity here.

274
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,302
To do what?

275
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,043
Claim victory.

276
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,943
To say that juma's
death means standing up

277
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:27,010
To tyranny works,and
that your decision

278
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,443
To send troops into
sangala was the right one.

279
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,382
I'm not sure that this is

280
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:33,450
The appropriate time to
sound triumphant,livy.

281
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,921
A lot of lives were lost today.

282
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:39,023
And by addressing those
deaths,you give them meaning.

283
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,892
Those people are heroes

284
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:42,742
Who died in a war that
was worth fighting.

285
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:46,731
Let's work it in.

286
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,970
Come in.

287
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:00,173
Madam president,i have
some troubling news.

288
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,981
May i speak with you alone?

289
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:04,251
You my speak freely
in front of olivia.

290
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:11,251
Just after the attack
on the white house,

291
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:12,690
Jack bauer came forward

292
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,292
With a disturbing claim.

293
00:13:14,466 --> 00:13:15,993
He said there were people

294
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,861
Still at large who were
involved in the conspiracy--

295
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:21,460
Persons unknown
who had helped juma

296
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,302
Plan and execute the attacks.

297
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:25,702
Did bauer have any
evidence of this?

298
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,300
Nothing concrete.

299
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,842
But he promoted the
notion that ryan burnett

300
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:32,413
Was our best chance of
identifying these people,

301
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:35,240
And bauer asked to be
allowed to question him.

302
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:39,351
This was supposed to be
a controlled situation.

303
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:43,882
A ploy to intimidate burnett
into giving up intel.

304
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:48,621
So,I granted bauer's request.

305
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:51,891
It was a terrible mistake.

306
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,232
What happened,ethan?

307
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:55,930
Burnett is dead.

308
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:57,703
My god...

309
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,270
The evidence suggests

310
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,700
That he was killed by bauer.

311
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,502
I don't believe it!

312
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,611
His claim of another party
being involved in the attacks

313
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,613
Appear to have been
a fabrication.

314
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,012
A fabrication.

315
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,582
It may have something to do
with bill buchanan's death;

316
00:14:12,756 --> 00:14:13,910
No one knows.

317
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,281
But madam president,

318
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,683
I take full responsibility.

319
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,091
I was trying to insulate you.

320
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,462
To provide you with deniability

321
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,422
In case anything went wrong.

322
00:14:23,598 --> 00:14:25,872
Or was it because you thought
the president would say no?

323
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:28,931
Olivia.

324
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,302
Where is bauer now?

325
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:33,830
At large.

326
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,871
The fbi is devoting its full
resources to the manhunt.

327
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:39,811
Let me know the
minute they find him.

328
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:41,580
Yes,ma'am.

329
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,183
Madam president...

330
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,951
I'm sorry.

331
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,931
Looks like everything.

332
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:14,143
She's on the move.

333
00:15:23,126 --> 00:15:23,852
Where's bauer?

334
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,091
I don't know.

335
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:26,120
Don't you lie to me.

336
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:27,663
We traced two calls
from your cell

337
00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:29,411
To a phone that was
reported stolen.

338
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:32,293
And we know you accessed a
classified government database

339
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,962
And sent someone's name
and address to bauer.

340
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:38,170
Renee,that makes you an
accessory after the fact.

341
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,372
Now tell me where he is.

342
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:41,971
I can't.

343
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:43,443
Damn it!

344
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:45,342
I still don't believe
that he did this.

345
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,561
Then explain to me why he's
not turning himself in,

346
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:50,033
And letting us help him find
this mysterious third party.

347
00:15:50,146 --> 00:15:51,602
Because he was framed
and he doesn't trust

348
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:52,961
Our ability to work through it.

349
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,543
And,you know,after what
we've put him through,

350
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:55,651
How can you blame him?

351
00:15:56,695 --> 00:16:00,623
You're actually willing To
sacrifice everything to protect him.

352
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:05,530
Once jack finds the
evidence,he will call us.

353
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:09,031
You know,janis is
decrpyting what you sent.

354
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,030
It's not going to
take her a long time.

355
00:16:11,207 --> 00:16:12,500
We are going to find him.

356
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:15,203
Renee,tell me whose
information you sent.

357
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,472
I'll let the A.G.
know that you're cooperating.

358
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:20,541
I'm sorry,larry.

359
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:24,213
Put her in holding.

360
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:26,912
Mirandize her.

361
00:16:47,275 --> 00:16:48,202
Good night,sir.

362
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,701
See you in the morning.

363
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:41,591
Hello?

364
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:50,221
Keep your hands where
i can see them,senator.

365
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:51,933
Bauer.

366
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,033
Take a seat.

367
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:01,282
I know what you did
to ryan burnett.

368
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:04,013
I'm not going to let you
butcher me like you did him.

369
00:18:04,188 --> 00:18:06,280
You want me dead,bauer,

370
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,012
You'll have to kill
me where i stand.

371
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:09,481
If i wanted to
kill you,senator,

372
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,481
You'd be dead already.

373
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:12,053
Now take a seat!

374
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,703
You're a real enigma,bauer.

375
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:27,803
An hour after you save the
president from terrorists,

376
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:30,303
You murder a federal
witness in cold blood.

377
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:32,142
I didn't kill burnett.

378
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:33,513
This man did.

379
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,012
Do you know who he is?

380
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,111
No.

381
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,210
His name is john quinn.

382
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:39,280
He works for starkwood.

383
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:42,123
What in the world does
starkwood have to do with this?

384
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,280
I don't know yet.

385
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,341
But i do know they sent
someone to kill burnett

386
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:46,862
And frame me to cover
up their involvement

387
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:48,083
In everything that's
happened today,

388
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:49,921
Including the attack
on the white house.

389
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,861
That's a hell of
a theory,bauer.

390
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:56,230
But you'll have to spin
a better story than that

391
00:18:56,408 --> 00:18:58,061
If you expect it to
get you off the hook.

392
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:00,102
Senator,i did not come
here to clear my name.

393
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,841
I'm trying to understand

394
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,002
The connection between
juma and starkwood.

395
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:06,041
There isn't one.

396
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,680
I've spent the better
part of six months

397
00:19:09,846 --> 00:19:11,652
Investigating starkwood.

398
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,772
If there was a connection
to juma or sangala,

399
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:14,721
I would know it.

400
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,380
I want to see
every file you have

401
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:18,052
Concerning that investigation.

402
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,950
Look...

403
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,131
Starkwood has let their
security teams run amok

404
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,433
All over the world,with
no oversight.

405
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,653
They've bribed their way
into large contracts,

406
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:32,500
They've tried to
influence foreign policy

407
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,900
To their own benefit--
all good reasons

408
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,871
Why this country should
not be outsourcing

409
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:41,072
Its military operations
to private corporations.

410
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:45,111
And i am going to
shut them down.

411
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:48,551
But there is nothing
to remotely suggest

412
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:51,951
They'd be involved in terrorist
attacks on their own country

413
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:53,821
For any amount of money.

414
00:19:53,995 --> 00:19:56,392
Maybe they have different
reasons for helping juma.

415
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,993
Like what?

416
00:19:58,168 --> 00:19:59,491
I don't know.

417
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,732
Sir,i believe this country
is still under attack,

418
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:03,261
And there has to be a reason.

419
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:07,233
And i'm supposed to believe this, Coming
from a man who's holding me hostage?

420
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,140
I need access to those files.

421
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,683
And if the connection

422
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:17,753
Between juma and
starkwood isn't there,

423
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,912
Will you turn yourself in,then?

424
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,390
Just open the files,sir.

425
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,371
Ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:47,310
The president will be making
a brief statement tonight.

427
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:49,810
Good luck,mom.

428
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,713
I'm sure you'll understand,

429
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,582
Based on the events of today,

430
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:56,282
There will be no opportunity
for follow-up questions.

431
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,652
Ladies and gentlemen,

432
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:00,790
The president of
the united states.

433
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:13,232
Thank you very much.

434
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,933
Thank you.

435
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,201
Thank you.

436
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:25,142
My fellow americans,john adams,

437
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:28,482
The first president to take up
residence in the white house,

438
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:30,723
Once prayed for
heaven to bestow

439
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:32,723
Its blessings on this place.

440
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:36,152
Tonight,those blessings
have seen us through

441
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:39,891
A brutal attack by
a desperate tyrant.

442
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,902
We have lost friends
and loved ones here,

443
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,603
But we have prevailed.

444
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:48,003
I have commanded law
enforcement agencies,

445
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,673
Emergency services
and first responders

446
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:51,431
To keep their
deployment level...

447
00:21:51,548 --> 00:21:52,673
Mr. kanin,ken dellao,cnb.

448
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,973
I'm wondering if you can
confirm some information

449
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,473
I received a short time ago?

450
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,183
Ken,this is clearly
not the time...

451
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:01,711
Yeah,i'm,i'm going to be Reporting
in this evening's broadcast

452
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,782
That a rogue ex-federal
agent named jack bauer

453
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:07,591
Is the prime suspect in
the murder of ryan burnett.

454
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:10,360
...cannot forget
today's events.

455
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:11,522
The lives we lost...

456
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:12,822
Where did you get this?

457
00:22:12,997 --> 00:22:14,760
So,it's true,then?

458
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:16,430
I'm not confirming anything.

459
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:19,930
I'll also be reporting That you
authorized bauer's release from custody

460
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:23,941
And arranged for his
access to the victim.

461
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:27,871
...daughters and
sons,brothers and sisters,

462
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,110
But they have not
taken our spirit.

463
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:32,950
Make no mistake,today's attacks

464
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,713
Were intended to
crush our resolve.

465
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,151
Mr. kanin.

466
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,622
I said no comment.

467
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:40,623
But america is not
so easily broken.

468
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:44,860
Our military action in
sangala has been a success.

469
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:47,342
At this hour,our forces

470
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:49,392
have taken control
of sangala city.

471
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,633
We have won.

472
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,470
I see you're back to
your old tactics.

473
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:55,171
What?

474
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:57,142
You leaked the story
of burnett's murder

475
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:58,671
And my involvement
to the press.

476
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,440
Ethan,i don't know what
you're talking about.

477
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,023
Olivia,don't bother denying it.

478
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:11,980
I can count on one hand
the number of people

479
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:14,421
Who knew i'd authorized
bauer's release.

480
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,692
So another one of
your errors in

481
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:18,763
judgment bites you have

482
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:22,292
And you think you can
lay the blame on me.

483
00:23:22,466 --> 00:23:24,002
Do you realize
what you've done?

484
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,373
In trying to hurt me,

485
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:29,601
You'll have caused tremendous
damage to your mother.

486
00:23:29,778 --> 00:23:32,103
The president has
gone on record

487
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:36,610
That torture is unacceptable
under any circumstances.

488
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:39,440
When this gets out,it will
look like bauer was sent

489
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,513
Exactly for that.

490
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:42,112
It'll be a political disaster.

491
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:43,680
You've gone too far this time.

492
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:45,183
I'm not listening
to you anymore.

493
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:47,482
I'm not going to let
you get away with this.

494
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,253
Get your hands off me.

495
00:23:50,627 --> 00:23:52,960
As americans,

496
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:54,661
We should stand together proud

497
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:55,890
Of what we have achieved.

498
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:59,663
Thanks to the efforts
and the sacrifices

499
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:04,543
Of so many,this
place,our national home,

500
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,411
Stands tall tonight.

501
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:11,382
And all our citizens can sleep
soundly with the knowledge

502
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:16,710
That the blessings of freedom
continue to shine upon us all.

503
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,851
No,there's been no sign of
bauer in the northeast sector,

504
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:22,521
So expand your cordon
to the 25-mile mark.

505
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,593
And be prepared
to back up metro.

506
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,291
I'm directing them to begin
random traffic stops,citywide.

507
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,790
Thank you.

508
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:32,320
I isolated the data
renee uploaded to bauer,

509
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,931
But i can't get past
the file header.

510
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:34,911
What does that mean?

511
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:37,193
She encrypted the name
and address she used,

512
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:38,772
And i can't seem to crack it.

513
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:41,141
You can't?
she used her personal computer.

514
00:24:41,248 --> 00:24:42,541
This is very
serious encryption.

515
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:46,180
I mean,there are some high-level
people who can do it. like who?

516
00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:47,811
Chloe o'brian--
but from what you've

517
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:49,383
told me,she's still
loyal to Bauer.

518
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,222
Is her husband still here?

519
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:53,521
Yeah. He's waiting to see you.

520
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:57,821
According to her file,he's
a level-six analyst,too.

521
00:24:57,925 --> 00:24:59,182
Yeah. He's waiting to see me.

522
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,461
I have no idea how much
longer i'm going to be here.

523
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:04,201
Just do me a favor and
give prescott his babu

524
00:25:04,368 --> 00:25:05,600
Before you put him down.

525
00:25:05,765 --> 00:25:09,903
Yeah,i'm going to have
to call you back. yeah.

526
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:11,741
Mr. o'brian,i'm larry moss.

527
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,543
Yeah,i'd like to see my wife.

528
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:15,870
All right.

529
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,422
What the bloody hell
are you holding her for?

530
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:28,322
Obstruction,evidence tampering.

531
00:25:28,496 --> 00:25:30,262
I think you should be
more concerned about

532
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:32,361
What you can do to
get her out. sorry?

533
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:34,260
Help us find jack bauer.

534
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:38,100
Last i heard from chloe,jack
was working for the bureau.

535
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:39,560
That's you,if i'm not mistaken.

536
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,102
He was.

537
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,403
Until he snapped and
murdered a federal witness.

538
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:44,841
Really?

539
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,133
I find that hard to believe.

540
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:48,303
All that's relevant
here is that your wife

541
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,062
Is going to be prosecuted
for colluding with bauer,

542
00:25:50,178 --> 00:25:51,581
Unless you help us find him.

543
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:53,150
Mr. o'brian,

544
00:25:53,315 --> 00:25:54,480
A short time ago,

545
00:25:54,656 --> 00:25:57,000
One of our agents was in
touch with jack bauer.

546
00:25:57,116 --> 00:25:59,020
She sent a name and address

547
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:00,750
That we assume is
his next destination.

548
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:03,592
Unfortunately,it's encrypted
with blowfish 148.

549
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:06,090
No one here knows
how to crack that.

550
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,130
Therefore,we need your help.

551
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:10,031
Please.

552
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,102
Jack bauer and my wife
have a very long history.

553
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:16,930
I consider him to be a friend.

554
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,600
And he'll have
his day in court.

555
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:20,042
But the case against your wife

556
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:22,070
Is rock solid.

557
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:24,410
I can't.

558
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:28,482
We're talking about her serving
a minimum sentence of 15 years.

559
00:26:28,657 --> 00:26:31,820
Your son will be 19 by the
time she gets out of prison.

560
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:47,471
I want guarantees
of full immunity,

561
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:50,502
No jail time,expulsion of
all charges from her record.

562
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:51,600
You have my word.

563
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,342
You are a witness
to this agreement.

564
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:54,343
Yes.

565
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:56,811
Show me the file.

566
00:26:56,985 --> 00:26:57,943
Original information--

567
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,851
16- or 32-bit word
length? thirty-two.

568
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,052
Native or modified data points?

569
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,521
Native.

570
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:10,991
The designer of this algorithm

571
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,410
Built a backdoor into his code.

572
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,981
Decryption's a piece of cake if
you know the override codes.

573
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:16,132
And you do?

574
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:18,001
Yeah.

575
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,932
Will this take long?

576
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:21,800
Course not.

577
00:27:25,178 --> 00:27:27,140
Mr. o'brian,can you
tell me specifically

578
00:27:27,318 --> 00:27:29,310
When you'll have
the file decrypted?

579
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:31,512
Yes.

580
00:27:34,215 --> 00:27:35,351
Now.

581
00:27:35,517 --> 00:27:37,963
Your agent sent jack to

582
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,521
951 deerbrook
avenue,georgetown,

583
00:27:40,696 --> 00:27:42,721
Residence of senator
blaine mayer.

584
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:44,690
Assemble the field teams.

585
00:27:44,867 --> 00:27:47,993
Tell them we have a
probable location on bauer.

586
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,500
And get metro pd on the way.

587
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,502
No luck reaching
mayer on his cell

588
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:07,593
or at the house.

589
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:08,762
The phone company said

590
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:10,292
The line was
shorted out on-site.

591
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,290
Yeah,that's bauer.

592
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:12,310
Why is he doing this?

593
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:14,182
Because mayer spent
the last six months

594
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:16,350
Trying to send bauer to prison
for the rest of his life.

595
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:20,531
All right,metro pd is closing
in on mayer's residence.

596
00:28:20,707 --> 00:28:21,953
I've authorized them to move in

597
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,932
As soon as they're in
position and at strength.

598
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:28,511
I told them,and i'm telling you,it
is impossible to overestimate bauer.

599
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:30,290
He has more training
and more experience

600
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,601
Than anybody in this room,and
that includes myself.

601
00:28:32,718 --> 00:28:34,923
Okay,let's move.

602
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:37,373
Agent moss will be
running on-point tactical

603
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:38,752
with fbi teams on five.

604
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:41,292
All units must register and
log their com through me,

605
00:28:41,467 --> 00:28:45,533
And i will distribute recognition
codes and credentials.

606
00:28:49,066 --> 00:28:50,501
Chloe... i can't believe you.

607
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:52,072
You're helping them catch jack.

608
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:53,102
I did it for you.

609
00:28:53,276 --> 00:28:55,460
This is the last thing
i would have wanted.

610
00:28:55,575 --> 00:28:57,373
How could you do this?
let's see,for a start,

611
00:28:57,478 --> 00:28:59,241
I thought it might be
nice to spare prescott

612
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:02,313
The inconvenience of having
a convict for a mother.

613
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:05,152
Jack saved your life.
i don't deny that i owe him.

614
00:29:05,316 --> 00:29:09,951
But my child and my
marriage comes first,

615
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,253
And it should for you,too.

616
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,763
Chloe,love,you've helped
jack enough.

617
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:16,622
You have.

618
00:29:16,795 --> 00:29:22,301
And you can't go deciding to
make this sacrifice on your own.

619
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:25,070
But he didn't do what
they're saying he did.

620
00:29:25,236 --> 00:29:27,830
Then he can prove that when
they take him into custody.

621
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:30,673
If they give him the chance.

622
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:50,023
At the hearing this morning,you
said you had no regrets

623
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:51,662
About what you've done.

624
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:55,632
But what i saw was a
man full of regret.

625
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:58,232
Of course i
have regrets,senator.

626
00:30:01,245 --> 00:30:03,970
I regret losing my family.

627
00:30:04,148 --> 00:30:06,971
My wife was murdered
because i was responsible

628
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:12,082
For protecting david palmer
during an assassination attempt.

629
00:30:12,255 --> 00:30:14,180
My daughter can't
even look at me.

630
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:17,323
Every day,i regret
looking into the eyes

631
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,153
Of men,women and children,

632
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:20,552
Knowing that,any moment,

633
00:30:20,725 --> 00:30:22,691
Their lives might be
deemed expendable

634
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,693
In an effort to protect
the greater good.

635
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:29,532
I regret every decision or
mistake i might have made

636
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:33,400
That resulted in the loss
of a single innocent life.

637
00:30:33,577 --> 00:30:36,572
But you know what
i regret the most?

638
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:40,340
Is that this world even
needs people like me.

639
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:43,640
So you think i'm
naive to believe

640
00:30:43,815 --> 00:30:46,570
We need to hold ourselves to
a higher standard of combat?

641
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:48,981
Doesn't even matter
what i think,senator.

642
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:51,270
You just need to
understand where i work,

643
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:54,050
Things get a lot messier than
where you work on the hill.

644
00:30:55,727 --> 00:30:59,260
What you've lost,mr.
bauer,is tragic.

645
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:01,293
What you've been
compelled to do

646
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,931
In the name of saving
innocent life is tragic.

647
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:10,203
Sometimes we need to incur
the most horrible losses

648
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,410
In order to uphold the ideals

649
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:14,371
That this country
was founded on.

650
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:17,240
How can we presume
to lead the world

651
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,080
Unless we set an example?

652
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:23,750
You make it sound so simple.

653
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:25,692
Well,maybe it's
simpler than you think.

654
00:31:25,858 --> 00:31:27,693
Maybe all the things
that you've seen

655
00:31:27,865 --> 00:31:30,341
And all the things that you've
done have cloud of your vision.

656
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:36,702
Look at this.

657
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:41,270
Tell me about this
car accident.

658
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,372
That has nothing
to do with juma.

659
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:44,673
Who was the victim?

660
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:46,010
A source inside of starkwood.

661
00:31:46,177 --> 00:31:47,371
A whistle-blower.

662
00:31:47,548 --> 00:31:48,940
Unfortunately,he was
also a drunk.

663
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:50,530
He was killed when
he wrecked his car

664
00:31:50,705 --> 00:31:52,472
On the way home
from atlantic city.

665
00:31:52,587 --> 00:31:54,913
Blood alcohol off the charts.

666
00:31:59,957 --> 00:32:01,591
Senator,this was no accident.

667
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,621
Your informant was
murdered by the same man

668
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:05,392
Who took ryan burnett
out this evening.

669
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:06,693
What does this mean,bauer?

670
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:08,462
They were scared of
what he had to say.

671
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:10,592
What does your informant
have on starkwood?

672
00:32:10,705 --> 00:32:11,921
He made a lot of
wild accusations,

673
00:32:12,035 --> 00:32:13,873
But not a single one
of them panned out.

674
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,441
Maybe you didn't
dig deep enough.

675
00:32:15,606 --> 00:32:17,540
Senator,i need to know
exactly what he told you.

676
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,613
He alleged that starkwood

677
00:32:19,776 --> 00:32:21,273
Was blackmailing
pentagon officials.

678
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:23,642
That they were involved
in assassination plots.

679
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,253
Even that they were seeking
to acquire their own wmds.

680
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:27,582
Specifically what?

681
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:29,321
Well,i don't
remember,but i'm sure

682
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:31,322
That his interview
transcript should be there.

683
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:35,662
Okay,i got it.

684
00:32:35,826 --> 00:32:37,923
Oh,my god.

685
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:38,860
That's it.

686
00:32:39,036 --> 00:32:39,731
What?

687
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,482
Your informant claims
that starkwood

688
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:43,100
Was trying to
acquire a bioweapon.

689
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,602
That's your connection to juma.

690
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:45,531
I don't understand.

691
00:32:45,706 --> 00:32:47,302
When juma was in
power,it was rumored

692
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:49,371
That he was running an
illegal weapons program.

693
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:51,143
He was developing a bioweapon,

694
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:52,442
But nobody could prove it.

695
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:54,113
But the people that
i knew in sangala

696
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:56,813
Believed he was testing these
weapons on his own population.

697
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:58,083
He used a remote village,

698
00:32:58,255 --> 00:32:59,510
Released some kind of pathogen.

699
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,753
Everyone there was
struck with dementia,

700
00:33:01,928 --> 00:33:04,023
Paralysis and eventually died.

701
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:05,160
Why wasn't this pursued?

702
00:33:05,337 --> 00:33:07,141
'cause juma destroyed
all the evidence.

703
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:08,580
He firebombed the
village before anyone

704
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,221
Could get there,and
un officials

705
00:33:10,396 --> 00:33:12,691
Had a hard time believing
that juma had the technology

706
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,833
Or expertise to
develop such a weapon.

707
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:17,462
But starkwood... they had both.

708
00:33:17,635 --> 00:33:19,573
The technology
and the expertise.

709
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:21,770
And what did juma have
to offer starkwood?

710
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:23,701
A safe haven to
develop the weapon

711
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:26,513
And an endless supply of
victims to test it on.

712
00:33:26,675 --> 00:33:29,843
Even if all this was
true,why in the world

713
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:32,111
Would starkwood
want a bioweapon?

714
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:34,881
Senator,you've been trying
to dismantle starkwood

715
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,523
For the last six months.

716
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:38,552
Maybe they planned
on fighting back.

717
00:33:38,728 --> 00:33:40,651
But regardless,if they
have a weapon like this,

718
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:43,323
You better believe
they intend to use it.

719
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:45,831
Senator mayer!

720
00:33:45,997 --> 00:33:46,832
This is metro pd!

721
00:33:46,998 --> 00:33:49,002
Don't you move.

722
00:33:53,106 --> 00:33:55,270
Hold on. hold on!

723
00:33:56,747 --> 00:33:58,100
You're obviously
on to something.

724
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:59,443
They can help you

725
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:01,643
Find the evidence you
need to prove your case.

726
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:04,043
Right now everyone thinks
i killed ryan burnett.

727
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:06,280
- No one's gonna listen to me.
- i can protect you.

728
00:34:06,388 --> 00:34:07,510
I can order them to help us.

729
00:34:07,687 --> 00:34:09,112
Starkwood infiltrated
the white house.

730
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:11,151
As soon as they find out
you're going after them

731
00:34:11,327 --> 00:34:13,112
For a bioweapon,they'll
bury the evidence.

732
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,862
Then we'll keep
the circle small.

733
00:34:16,027 --> 00:34:17,790
I can make this happen.

734
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,261
It's time for you to start
trusting the institutions

735
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:23,762
That you've sacrificed
so much to protect.

736
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,770
Trust isn't my greatest asset.

737
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:28,540
Son,you have to
start somewhere.

738
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:31,573
Senator!

739
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:33,313
This is metro pd!

740
00:34:33,476 --> 00:34:35,513
You really think
you can do this?

741
00:34:35,688 --> 00:34:37,481
I know i can.

742
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:41,451
Let 'em in.

743
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:46,252
Coming!

744
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:56,661
No!

745
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:54,663
You wanted to see me?

746
00:35:54,838 --> 00:35:57,260
Yes,livy.

747
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:00,621
Ethan just come to me with
something very disturbing.

748
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:03,570
I assume it's about the press
leak regarding jack bauer.

749
00:36:05,178 --> 00:36:08,112
Ethan seems to think you
had something to do with it.

750
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:09,512
I didn't.

751
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,211
I already told him that.

752
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:12,881
Well,given the past experience

753
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:15,210
Between the two of
you,he's not convinced.

754
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:17,381
And what do you think?

755
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:20,293
I think i need to hear
what you have to say.

756
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:22,221
There's nothing she can
say,madam president.

757
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:24,060
She was one of the few people

758
00:36:24,228 --> 00:36:25,620
Who knew all the details.

759
00:36:25,797 --> 00:36:28,560
More people knew
than you think.

760
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:30,520
I just got off
the phone with the

761
00:36:30,626 --> 00:36:32,132
white house secretary producer

762
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:33,303
At cnb.

763
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:34,900
He won't give me
the source's name,

764
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:36,231
But he's willing to confirm

765
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:38,403
That the leak came from
someone inside the federal

766
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:39,772
Marshal's office.

767
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:42,313
He'll guarantee it didn't
come from the white house,

768
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:43,880
Or from me.

769
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:47,281
This is verifiable?

770
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:50,983
Producer's name is
charlie isakson.

771
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:52,682
Here's his number.

772
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,623
You can call him
yourself if you'd like.

773
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:03,052
I offered isakson some

774
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:05,291
Exclusive time with you
if he killed the story,

775
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:07,000
And he agreed.

776
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:09,003
So as long as we get
bauer in custody,

777
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:11,173
We should be able to keep
the fallout contained.

778
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:14,110
Ethan,under the circumstances,

779
00:37:14,278 --> 00:37:16,010
I think it seems clear

780
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,180
That you were mistaken.

781
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:21,481
I'm satisfied.

782
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,652
Are you?

783
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:25,122
Yes,madam president.

784
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,623
I'm sorry,olivia,

785
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:28,520
If i misjudged

786
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:30,222
The situation...

787
00:37:30,397 --> 00:37:31,691
And you.

788
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:34,131
I want to know

789
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,463
If the fbi's any closer
to finding bauer.

790
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:38,063
Yes,ma'am.

791
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:40,530
That's all.

792
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:50,582
I'm sorry

793
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:53,312
- I put you on the spot like that.
- i understand.

794
00:37:53,485 --> 00:37:55,312
Ethan didn't give
you much of a choice.

795
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:56,512
I just hope

796
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,280
They find bauer before
this gets any worse.

797
00:41:17,788 --> 00:41:19,283
You're dying.

798
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:20,920
Just tell me where

799
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,191
The weapons are coming in.

800
00:41:23,368 --> 00:41:25,361
When are they getting here?

801
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:28,190
They're already here.

802
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,902
Janis,it's larry.

803
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:07,800
We got here too late.

804
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:09,631
Bauer murdered senator mayer.

805
00:42:09,808 --> 00:42:12,270
Escalate the search
for him to region-wide.

806
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:14,411
I want reinforcements
from every branch
