<i>[Jack Bauer]</i>
<i>Previously on</i> 24.

2
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:17,274
Agent Walker told me that there's a chance-

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,443
a small chance that I could help you.

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,653
<i>I'm dying, and whatever small chance there is</i>
<i>to stop that from happening...</i>

5
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,693
it is not worth the <i>pain...</i>

6
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:30,127
for me to let you sit there and watch me die.

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,563
Daddy, I don't wanna lose you.

8
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,430
- Come here.
- I don't.

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,834
- [Grunts]
- What is it?

10
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,932
Sweetheart, I'm sorry. But you need to go.

11
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,477
Hodges was behind everything that happened
today, from the planes going <i>down...</i>

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,672
- <i>to the attack on the White House.</i>
- What?

13
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,874
He's also responsible
for the death of my brother.

14
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,782
<i>All you need to know is Hodges worked a deal.</i>

15
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,481
Witness protection.
My mother approved it, and he's going free.

16
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,649
Unless someone intervenes.

17
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,989
I'll get you contact information, a <i>price...</i>

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,655
and instructions on how to transfer the funds.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,493
<i>Martin, it's Olivia Taylor.</i>

20
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,830
<i>I spoke to the contact,</i>
<i>but I couldn't go through with it.</i>

21
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,534
Listen to me, Jibraan.

22
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,011
<i>If you don't do exactly as I say...</i>

23
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,549
you're gonna watch your younger brother die
right in front of your eyes.

24
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:28,815
And then, I'm gonna kill you. Hmm?

25
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,822
It was the Americans
who killed our parents, Hamid.

26
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,358
- <i>I'm going to make them pay.</i>
- What have you done to my brother?

27
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,451
You've poisoned his mind. This isn't my brother.

28
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,155
We're looking for a man who worships here.

29
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,494
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.
Do you know him?

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,198
<i>I know him, but he is not a terrorist.</i>

31
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,204
We did not come here to debate this with you!
Where does he live?

32
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,400
You come into a house of worship
with information you should not <i>have...</i>

33
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,412
an outrageous accusation,
no legal warrant and threaten me.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,246
- I have not threatened you.
- Not yet.

35
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,512
But we both know where this is going.

36
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,851
Jack, it's Chloe. I found something weird
about these hits on Jibraan Al-Zarian.

37
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,583
You know how I said the two million <i>dollars...</i>

38
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,625
was deposited into his account
over a period of six months?

39
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,354
That wasn't right. They were backdated.

40
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,055
What about the extremist
Web sites he was visiting?

41
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,566
Same thing with the time stamps.
The hits were backdated 30 minutes ago.

42
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,692
Jibraan could be innocent.

43
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,363
- What do you have, Agent?
- Armed hostile in the back room,
holding a hostage.

44
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,272
- What about Almeida?
- He's not in there. See for yourself.

45
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,276
- <i>[Man] Is that who you're looking for?</i>
- No.

46
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,175
It's Jibraan's brother, Hamid.

47
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,578
They're using him as leverage
to makeJibraan do what they want.

48
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,673
- How can you be sure?
- That's what I would have done.

49
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,084
- <i>Hamid, stop!</i>

- <i>Your casualty estimates are holding up?</i>
- I think they're conservative.

57
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,275
A significant portion of the <i>pathogen...</i>

58
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,317
will escape into
the station's ventilation <i>system...</i>

59
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,046
which will circulate it for us.

60

Between 8,000 and 10,000

<i>Tell me about Mr. A l-Zarian.</i>
<i>Is he compliant?</i>

62
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,494
Yes. His primary concern at
this point is for the safety of his brother.

63
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,658
And what's his level
of awareness regarding the plan?

64
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,964
He won't know anything
about the canister until it's too late.

65
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,972
- Good. We'll talk once it's done.

Talk about what?

72
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,811
You still haven't told me
what you want me to do.

73

Right now I just want you
to get on the <i>subway...</i>

the way to Washington Center.

- I'll let you know then.

You are going to hurt people?

Jibraan, the only person you
need to worry about right <i>now...</i>

81
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,711
is your brother.

You follow my instructions,

He didn't overhear anything

Right now, he's our only lead.
