<i>[Jack Bauer]</i>
<i>Previously on</i> 24.

2
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:22,421
TheJustice Department is investigating
theJonas Hodges car bombing.

3
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,784
<i>I changed my mind.</i>
<i>I didn't transfer the funds.</i>

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,556
Why would he go ahead
and kill Hodges if he wasn't paid?

5
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,097
Because it's what you wanted. Am I right?

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,134
Jack, I unlocked Tony's location data.

7
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,828
<i>[Jack]</i>
<i>Okay, we've got him.</i>

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,778
Where's the canister?

9
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,906
I am not gonna stop
until you tell me where it is.

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,855
- Jack.
- It's all right. It's all right.

11
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,360
- You need to give yourself a shot.
- I already did, 20 minutes ago.

12
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,887
- It's not working.
- You heading home?

13
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,297
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Us too.

14

<i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

15
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,533
- This is Bauer.
- I'm sending a link to your phone.

16
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,301
It's something I think you should see.

17
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,173
Your daughter's in the company
of our operatives.

18
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,644
Put this call on your earpiece
and keep the line open.

19
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,874
I'm gonna be listening to everything you say.

20
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,407
<i>You will help Tony Almeida escape,</i>
<i>or my people will murder your daughter.</i>

21

<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

23

The Deputy Attorney General
is ready for you, ma'am.

24

<i>Network is secure. Go ahead.</i>

26
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:51,001
Good morning, Ms. Taylor. Thank you for
giving up your time for this investigation.

27
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,011
Of course.

28
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,877
Mrs. Rollins, Mr. Hock
are from theJustice Department.

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,315
They'll be conducting your interview.

30
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,842
Let the record show that this is to be
the testimony of Olivia <i>Taylor...</i>

31
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,048
<i>acting White House chief of staff...</i>

32
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,389
regarding the homicide
of federal witness Jonas Hodges.

33
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,191
Let it also show that I am present to ensure
that strict protocols be <i>followed...</i>

34
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,198
for Ms. Taylor's protection.

35
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,292
- Why would I need protecting?
- Uh, poor choice of words.

36
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:20,066
I merely meant that your questioning
is just a formality.

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,701
<i>We have to go through everyone</i>
<i>who had knowledge of Hodges's</i>
<i>whereabouts until the bombing.</i>

38
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,710
I see.

39
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:29,077
Mrs. Rollins,
you have the floor. Let's begin.

40
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,142
<i>[Chattering]</i>

41
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,449
I wanted Olivia in this briefing.
Where is she?

42
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,289
I'm sorry, ma'am, but she's tied up
with the Deputy A.G. And <i>investigators...</i>

43
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,022
Iooking into the Hodges murder.

44
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:47,032
- Have they made any progress
on who leaked Hodges's location?
- Not yet.

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,264
But they agree that the list of people
who knew Hodges was alive and at F.B.I. Is short.

46
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,033
The leak had to come from inside.

47
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,334
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Madam President.

48
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,404
- Madam President.
- Please take your seats.

49
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,548
I realize that we are all
in dire need of <i>sleep...</i>

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,986
but I felt that it was <i>vital...</i>

51
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,253
to bring you all up to speed on the events
of the past few <i>hours...</i>

52
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,784
and a greater crisis we face
on the horizon.

53
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,321
Less than 30 minutes ago,
the F.B.I. Managed to <i>recover...</i>

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,301
the last canister of the bioweapon.

55
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,600
But I'm afraid that the danger
is far from over.

56
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:30,439
Before his death, Jonas Hodges told <i>us...</i>

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,947
that there were other parties involved with him
in the creation of this bioweapon-

58
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:39,917
a highly secret and extremely powerful group
of private military <i>firms...</i>

59
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:43,319
collaborating to undermine
the government of this country.

60
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,323
<i>Excuse me, Madam President...</i>

61
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,951
but which military firms
are we talking about?

62
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,688
We don't know, Admiral.

63
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:54,199
Hodges gave us no names
or idea of which companies are <i>involved...</i>

64
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:59,830
but whoever they are, they represent
a very real and ongoing threat.

65
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,377
Now, we don't have much
actionable intelligence at this point.

66
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:10,314
However, the F.B.I. Has apprehended
former C.T.U. Operative Tony Almeida.

67
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,476
He is a key figure in this <i>plot...</i>

68
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:17,182
someone we hope will be able
to help us uncover who these people are.

69
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,117
Agent Walker, this is air support Bravo 3.

70
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,687
- <i>We're in position. Your convoy's in sight.</i>
- <i>Roger that, Bravo 3.</i>

71
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:29,701
Metro will be controlling traffic and setting up
a secure corridor through downtown.

72
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,966
We'll be bringing Almeida in to headquarters
through the west entrance.

73
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,906
[Cara On Earpiece]
It's almost time, Mr. Bauer.

74
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,705
The convoy you're traveling with
is about to get off on the l-70.

75
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,008
You'll need to break off
before you reach the downtown <i>exit...</i>

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,243
or you'll lose your chance
to facilitate an escape for Tony.

77
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,377
For your daughter's <i>sake...</i>

78
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,648
you don't want that to happen.

79
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,655
Now listen carefully.

80
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,659
You'll need to commandeer the <i>van...</i>

81
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,594
and peel onto the Taft Street exit
in about four miles.

82
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,100
I'll direct you further
once you've managed this.

83
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,933
Remember, my operatives
are with your daughter.

84
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:09,236
In fact, I'm looking at her right now,
so don't try to be a hero.

Something wrong?

00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,520
It's starting to look like the flight
is gonna be full. And I'm on standby.

88
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,928
Oh, no, you're gonna get on. There have to be
some people that are too spooked to <i>fly...</i>

89
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,523
after those planes went down yesterday.

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,898
Bob, did you have to bring that up?

91
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,803
I'm just saying! Look, I think it makes us safer.
They're gonna take extra precautions.

<i>Excuse me. A re those yours?</i>

93
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:50,378

could sit down, please?

Oh. Sure.

- I'm getting worried.

101
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,826
It's only a matter of time
before that F.B.I. Agent's body's <i>discovered...</i>

102
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,200
and I think Bauer's daughter
is getting suspicious.

103
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,502
Look, I gave Bauer a short window
to deliver Tony to me.

104
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,372
It won't be long.
Just stand by until you hear from me.

And what if Kim Bauer
makes us before then?

106

You can't allow yourselves to be taken.

- They've got my daughter.

That's not possible. I deployed Agent Franks
to watch over her like you asked.

Tony, I've done everything you've asked.
Just let Kim go.

- Let her go!
- Get in the car.

We don't need a hostage, okay, especially not him.

Shoot him already, and let's get out of here.

Why do you think I had you
put those operatives on Kim Bauer?

167
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,061
Your people are still gonna need proof
thatJack's viable.

Take a moment to look that over.

- Thank you again for coming.
- You can thank me, Agent <i>Pierce...</i>

174
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,862
by telling me what this is all about.

175
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,455
All right, sir,
but we don't have much time.

176
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,467
- You implied it had something
to do with Olivia Taylor.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,699
A few hours ago, Jonas Hodges
was killed outside F.B.I. Headquarters.

178
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,707
My God.

179
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,643
Now, authorities believe he was murdered
to keep him from implicating <i>others...</i>

180
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:30,204
who were involved
in the bioweapon <i>attacks...</i>

181
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,375
but I suspect
there may be another <i>scenario...</i>

182
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,353
and I have reason to believe
that Ms. Taylor might be involved.

183
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,691
That is an outrageous accusation,
Agent Pierce.

184
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,161
Olivia is capable of many <i>things...</i>

185
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,790
but I can't believe
committing murder is one of them.

186
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,800
Mr. Kanin, please just hear me out.

187
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,531
After the president agreed
to a witness protection deal for <i>Hodges...</i>

188
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,039
Ms. Taylor made a comment to <i>me...</i>

189
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,075
about wanting to see Hodges dead.

190
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,340
He was responsible for her brother's death.
She was venting.

191
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,277
I thought so <i>too...</i>

192
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,580
until she met in her office with an old colleague
of hers, a man named Martin Collier.

193
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,917
- I know Collier.
- Then you know the sort of man he is.

194
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,720
I do, but none of this
constitutes proof of complicity.

195
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,160
No, sir. That's why I need you to access
the digital recording system-

196
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:21,666
to see if their conversation was recorded.

197
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,703
Agent, you're asking me to break into an office
that's no longer <i>mine...</i>

198
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,002
and access classified recordings
of the acting chief of staff.

199
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,771
Mr. Kanin, if my suspicions
prove <i>correct...</i>

200
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,576
you, of all people, understand how grave
these consequences would be.

<i>Sir, Ms. Taylor's behavior over the past</i>
<i>several hours has been erratic at best.</i>

Now, she's with theJustice Department
investigators now, and we don't have much time.

203
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,358

They're our only lead
to finding your father and Tony.

293
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,740
There was a man
that was staring at me <i>earlier...</i>

294
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,779
but I haven't seen him in a while.

295
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,507
- Describe him.
- He was Hispanic.

296
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,745
Medium build. He had short brown hair.
He was wearing a suit.

297
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,343
That was Agent Franks.
Your father had me deploy him to the <i>airport...</i>

298
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,184
to make sure you got on the plane safely.

299
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,656
He was killed by the people
following you. Listen, Kim.

300
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,285
Whoever these operatives are,
they're in close proximity to you.

301
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,990
Your father told me they sent him
a live feed to prove they had you in their sights.

302
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,034
Have you noticed anyone
with a camera or cell phone?

303
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,332
- Or a laptop?
- What?

304
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,339
There's a couple that I've been talking to.
They're sitting right next to me.

305
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,432
The man has an open laptop
right in front of me.

306
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:48,343
- Can you give me a description?
- Yeah. He's got long hair, he's tall-

307
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,150
- Kim? Kim, what's wrong?
- Oh, well, I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you.

308
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,518
Please let baggage claim know that
I will be much more careful next time.

309
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,523
Kim?

310
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,684
- Chloe, do you read me?
- <i>I'm here.</i>

311
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,992
<i>The operatives may be moving on Kim. A lert</i>
<i>airport police. Have them lock down the terminal.</i>

312
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,999
Tell airport security to maintain patrols.
Do nothing to arouse suspicion.

313
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,625
Okay.

314
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,499
Okay. Bye.

315
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,870
We saw you were on the phone. We thought
there might be a problem. You need some help?

316
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,569
No. There's no problem.
I left my electric toothbrush on in my luggage.

317
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,010
So the airline called
and said they broke my lock.

318
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,344
- Nice. You get your boarding pass?
- Oh, yeah. It's right here.

319
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,652
There was a little security problem
with her luggage.

320
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,320
[Kim]
Guess they can never be too careful.

321
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,938
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

322
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,206
This is the first time
that I've been apart from my little girl.

323
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,511
I'm just a little anxious
to get back to see her.

324
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:02,519
- Would you like to see a picture of her?
- Sure.

325
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,385
Got one in here.

00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,757
Yeah.

00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,990
Where is... Here. Yeah.

329
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,262
- Her name's Teri.
- She's adorable.

330
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,135
Thank you.
Look at this. So cute.

331
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,705

Where are the airport police?

342
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,977
They're mobilizing to you now.
What about the operatives?

343
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,884
The woman is dead.
The man is getting away.

344
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,946
Kim, we need him to find your father.

352

I always liked that about you, Ethan.

353
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,327
Even when I was a little girl, you always
stood up when I came into the room.

354
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,392
Old habits die hard.

355
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,734
You removed something from my office.

356
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,434
- I want it back.
- I told you before, you're welcome to them.

357
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,775
- You know damn well
I'm not talking about those files.
- Do I?

358
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,748
Ethan, I found the digital recorder.

359
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,580
<i>Now give me what you took...</i>

360
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,144
or I'll order the security officers
outside this door to strip-search you.

361
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,026
All right. I do have a recording.

362
00:24:56,094 --> 00:25:00,531
<i>It's a personal account of my last days</i>
<i>in service to this administration...</i>

363
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,726
and I think I'm entitled to it.

364
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,202
No one is entitled to take sensitive
material out of the White House.

365
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,205
<i>Oh...</i>

366
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,868
now it's national security
you're worried about.

367
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,204
As a matter of fact, yes.

368
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,348
Well, I still have my clearances.

369
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,816
Why don't we listen
to the recording together?

370
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:24,287
You're in no position
to dictate terms, Ethan.

371
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,291
You're in violation
of at least 10 federal laws.

372
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,123
What are you so afraid of, Olivia?

373
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,220
What's on there that's so incriminating?

374
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,695
I'm not the one facing incrimination.

375
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:37,632
You are.

376
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,569
<i>But give me the recording right now...</i>

Last chance, Ethan.

379
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,682
Search him for a data card.

I'm being held without cause.
I demand to speak to President Taylor.

00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,324
It was the president
who ordered his detention.

382
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,458
If that's true,
I want to hear it from her directly.

383
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,833
Well, this is a criminal matter now.

384
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,670
Considering her personal relationship
with Mr. <i>Kanin...</i>

385
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,643
the president doesn't deem it appropriate
to intrude on the investigation.

Please stand up, Mr. Kanin.

Nothing. It's blank.

On the levels of pathogen
in his spinal fluid.

- Give me a time frame.
- Fifteen minutes.

- I don't think that would be the right approach.
- Why not?

Because he's careful to a fault, <i>Tony...</i>

and he's very protective of his anonymity.

I can appreciate that.

But the bottom line is,
without me this operation never happens.

438
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,553
Now, you have influence over him.

439
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:12,435
He trusts you. You can convince him.
I've seen you do it before.

Couple of hours, give or take.

And what happens if he dies
before we extract the pathogen?

Obviously, it's optimal
to keep the host <i>alive...</i>

is by exposure to extreme temperatures
above 500 degrees Celsius.

with the proper <i>equipment...</i>

529
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,976
the actual extraction and bioengineering
is fairly straightforward.

if we don't make a significant <i>gesture...</i>

I don't even know this man, Cara.

541

Then you should get to know him.

Are you suggesting I meet with him?

543
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:53,323
Look, all I'm saying is that he would be
a very useful voice in the mix.

544
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,158
His field experience fills a knowledge gap
in regards to our logistics and planning.

00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,164

I could be there, where you are,
