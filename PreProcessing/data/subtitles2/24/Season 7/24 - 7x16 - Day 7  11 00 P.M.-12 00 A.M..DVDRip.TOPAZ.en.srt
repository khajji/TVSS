<i>[Jack Bauer]
Previously on 24.</i>

2
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:20,319
- No!
- Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

3
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,321
<i>He's dead.</i>

4
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:26,291
<i>Are you telling me thatJack Bauer
just killed a United States senator?</i>

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,724
How could you have let this happen?

6
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:29,989
Mr. Kanin, you are not gonna
lay this one at my feet.

7
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,793
What is it, Ethan? What's wrong?

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,324
<i>Madam President, I'm afraid I have no choice
but to resign as your chief of staff</i>

9
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,166
You're taking this too far.

10
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,899
Where's Jack?

11
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,634
<i>[Larry]
We don't have him.</i>

12
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,642
<i>The man who framed Jack
for Burnett's murder...</i>

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,144
was John Quinn, a Starkwood contractor.

14
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,840
Jack went to Mayer
to get the evidence to prove it.

15
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,509
Starkwood was involved
with everything that's happened today.

16
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,712
They helped Juma and his men bring down
those planes and attack the White House.

17
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:59,282
In exchange, they were allowed
to develop and manufacture a W.M.D. In Sangala.

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,589
<i>The text message I got
off their agent's cell phone...</i>

19
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,687
said " Port of Alexandria,
Lot C, 10:15 p.m."

20
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,528
- Go red! Go red!
- Engage. Engage!

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,536
<i>- [Stokes] Get that truck outta here, now!
- Tony! The truck-</i>

22
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,171
<i>I'm going after it! Cover me now!</i>

23
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,957
I'm in possession of a biological weapon
interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.

24

<i>[Machine Gun Fire]</i>

27
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,604
What's your status?

28
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,374
<i>The package is secure. We're inbound.</i>

29
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,177
- What about Bauer?
- He's at the scene, sir, but he sought cover nearby.

30
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,650
<i>We have to assume that
he contacted the authorities...</i>

31
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,017
so we better be on
an accelerated timetable.

32
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:05,251
- Get over here.
- Starkwood reacquired the bioweapon.

33
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,920
They airlifted the freight right outta here. They
were headed due west from my current position.

34
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:12,988
Jack, I can't assault a private compound
unless I have proof that a weapon exists.

35
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,034
- Where's the C.D.C.
- They're scrambling a team right now.

36
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,194
Send 'em to me.
You'll have all the proof you need.

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,001
- Jack, what happened?
- I was exposed.

38
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:27,013
<i>[Jack Bauer] The following takes place

We're ready for, you, sir.
Come with me.

41

<i>[Sirens Wailing]</i>

42
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,034
Mr. Bauer, Dr. Macer, C.D.C.
We need you to get undressed.

43
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,648
You're the one that talked
to Agent Moss?

44
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,743
He brought me up to speed. Said you had
some information about the bioweapon.

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,288
All I know is that
it was developed in Sangala.

46
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,450
<i>According to rumors from the village
that it was tested on...</i>

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,926
all the victims suffered
from dementia and paralysis.

48
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,556
Check neurological vectors and pathogens.
How much was released?

49
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,964
I'm not exactly sure.

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,731
The weapon was stored
in a pressurized canister.

51
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,604
It was breached for maybe two minutes
before I could seal it off.

52
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,444
This is not a reaction.
I've had these scars.

53
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,009
This is a full-spectrum antibiotic. It should
counteract a wide range of known pathogens.

54
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,057
[Injector Hisses]

55
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,149
[Man]
Step inside, sir.

56
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,697
Raise your arms, close your eyes.

57
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,510
- Janis, where are we?
- Metro closed down a six-mile
stretch of Highway 236.

58
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,611
The C.D.C. First responders are on site.
What the hell's going on?

59
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,316
One of the bioweapon
canisters was breached.

60
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,325
- Jack may have been exposed.
- Oh, my God.

61
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,725
Starkwood took the canisters.

62
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,195
<i>They're probably flying 'em
back to their main compound in Virginia...</i>

63
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,495
- along with Tony Almeida.
- Almeida?

64
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,900
He was working with Jack. We think he might
have been taken captive. Hang on one second.

65
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,904
I need you to put together
a briefing packet on Starkwood.

66
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,566
I want every division caught up to speed
on what we might be dealing with.

67
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,702
Planning to move on Starkwood? That place
is enormous. It's practically a military base.

68
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,976
We're not gonna do anything until we have
concrete evidence on the bioweapon from C.D.C.

69
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,075
Then I'll inform the president,
and she'll decide how to proceed.

<i>[Man Shouting]

<i>Easy! Easy!</i>

72
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,088
Almeida's not going to talk.

73
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,756
He's not the type.
He's the brave type.

"Know the psychology of your subject."
That's in our manual.

<i>Mr. Hodges.</i>

77
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,782
We isolated the damaged canister.
We got lucky.

78
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,545
They know we have the weapons.
That's not so lucky.

79
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,552
How fast can you have them ready?

80
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,589
- It's gonna take me at least two hours.
- Too long, Tom.

81
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,648
- Sir, we don't know what the government knows.
- They're coming.

82
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,388
And they'll be coming
with everything they've got.

83
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,421
And the only thing that's gonna stop them
is getting these weapons ready to deploy.

84
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,592
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

85
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,136
I know you will.

86
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:18,075

[Hodges]
Okay.

91
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,104
You're a good man, Tony.

92
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,013
I know your profile.
You've had some hard breaks.

93
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,882
I don't want to see you hurt.

94
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,683
<i>So you just tell me what the F.B.I. Knows...</i>

about what we're doin' here.

96
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,724
And I can't say
you'll walk away smiling.

97
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,854
That would be unrealistic.

98
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,897
But you'll be alive.

99
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,961
You hear me?

100
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:30,413
But I don't know anything, Mr. Hodges.

101
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,257
I'm giving you a way out, Tony.

102

<i>Sir. May I speak to you for a moment?</i>

103
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,433
- Not now, Greg.
- Please, sir. Just for a moment.

104
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,845
[Exhales]

105
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,482
What is it?

106
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:10,488
This was supposed to be a covert operation.
That is not the case anymore.

107
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,490
<i>The government knows
that we have these weapons...</i>

108
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,652
and they're not just gonna
sit on that information.

109
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,356
What are you suggesting, Greg?

110
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,459
Maybe we should destroy the evidence
while we still have some time.

111
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:29,607
I can't believe that
I'm hearing this from you.

112
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,701
<i>I'm just trying to help, sir. I care about
this company as much as you do.</i>

113
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,542
Oh, I doubt that.

114
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:39,016
<i>We've invested a lot of blood
and treasure to get these weapons...</i>

<i>and I'm not gonna give them up.</i>

116
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,991
Think about what you're
risking, sir- everything.

117
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,049
Everything you built.

118
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,096
You say you're trying to help.
You know what I think?

119
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:56,100
I think you're worried about your own ass.
Get him out of here and do what you have to do.

120
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,228
Think about what I said, young man.

121
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:03,366
You're a little nervous, Greg.
We'll, I've got a news flash. We're all nervous.

122
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:07,173
Keep your doubts to yourself.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

123
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,177
We're gonna need more blood and saliva samples,
and I'd like to collect a spinal fluid specimen.

124
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,814
Until we know what we're dealing with,
we need to keep you under quarantine.

125
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,256
How long till you know whether
or not I've been infected?

126
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,318
We should have the preliminary results
in the next 15 minutes.

127
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,330
- Okay.
- Dr. Macer.

128
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,457
- Yeah?
- We've detected trace amounts
of an airborne pathogen.

129
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,467
It's concentrated near the truck.

130
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,504
We're also picking it up from the surrounding
environments in much lower concentrations.

131
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,006
- Can you identify it?
- No. But we're analyzing a sample now.

132
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,043
<i>These levels shouldn't present any danger
to the nearby population...</i>

133
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,238
but I still want
atmospheric monitors set up.

134
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,341
It's a good thing you sealed off the canister,
Mr. Bauer. You saved a lot of lives.

135
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,283
You're gonna have
to transport me back to F.B.I.

136
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,981
I'm still material evidence
in an ongoing terrorist threat.

137
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,492
- Those were our orders.
We can run our tests from there.
- Okay.

138
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,828
BobJustman's been associate counsel
for the past three years.

139
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,870
He and Ethan worked
very closely together.

140
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,337
He's certainly qualified
to be chief of staff.

141
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,500
But?

142
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:14,478
After what's happened today, I think you
should be looking outside your administration.

143
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,811
An insider has a leg up.

144
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,841
Chief of staff has a steep learning curve.

145
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,720
I think you're underestimating
the value of a fresh perspective.

146
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,849
You have someone in mind.

147
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,155
I do. Rick Berman.

148
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,662
Would Rick even consider
leaving the private sector?

149
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,899
He's made his fortune. I think he'd jump
at the chance to serve his country.

150
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,497
- Let's sit down with him.
- Great.

151
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,409
But keep Bob on the list.
I still have a good feeling about him.

152
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,175
I'll start to set up meetings tomorrow.

153
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:55,212
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

154
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,951
In the meantime, I'm going to
need a provisional chief of staff.

155
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,586
I'd like that to be you.

156
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,098
<i>- Um-
- [Intercom Beeps]</i>

157
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,427
<i>- [Woman] Madam President?
- Yes?</i>

158
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,434
Tim Woods is here to see you.

159
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,563
<i>- Just give me a minute, please,
and then send him in.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

160
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,573
<i>Livy, I need someone I can trust...</i>

161
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,576
especially after everything
that's happened today.

162
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,512
You're not going to say no
to your mother, are you?

163
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,918
Of- Of course not.

164
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,046
<i>- Good.
- [Knocking]</i>

165
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,115
Madam President,
I have Larry Moss at F.B.I. Calling for you.

166
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,593
<i>- What's this about?
- I don't know the specifics...</i>

167
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,995
but he says it involves
an imminent homeland threat.

168
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,967
Put him through.

169
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,937
It's all right, Tim.
I've made Olivia acting chief of staff.

170
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,741
Agent Moss, you're on with the president.

171
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,404
Madam President,
we have a situation developing.

172
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,811
<i>First of all, you need
to know thatJack Bauer...</i>

173
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,714
did not kill Ryan Burnett
nor Senator Blaine Mayer.

174
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,981
- He was framed for their murders.
- I knew it. Who framed him?

175
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,285
Our operational theory is that
he was set up by Starkwood.

176
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,791
I don't understand.
Why would Starkwood frameJack?

177
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,354
<i>To cover up the fact that they helped
Juma stage the terrorist attacks today.</i>

178
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,333
<i>- What?
- Ma'am, we have evidence
that Starkwood provided Juma...</i>

179
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,131
with technological support
and intelligence.

180
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,866
<i>In return, Juma allowed Starkwood
to use Sangala...</i>

181
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,000
as a base to operate without having
to worry about any oversight.

182
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,944
- A base for what?
- To manufacture weapons of mass destruction.

183
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,176
<i>Specifically, biological weapons.</i>

184
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,127
What kind of bioweapons
are you talking about?

185
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,688
We're not sure, but it could be
some kind of neurological pathogen.

186
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,962
C.D.C. Obtained a sample.
They're analyzing it now.

187
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,367
Agent Moss, you said there
was an imminent threat?

188
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,963
Yes. A large shipment of bioweapons
was delivered to Starkwood.

189
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,133
We believe they're
in possession of them now.

190
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,143
Are you saying these weapons
are on U.S. Soil?

191
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,873
We suspect they're at the Starkwood
headquarters in Virginia.

192
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,384
<i>You're not suggesting Starkwood intends to use
those weapons to attack this country?</i>

193
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,387
<i>We don't know.
But given their actions today...</i>

194
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,549
we need to move on
Starkwood immediately.

195
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,529
Madam President?

196
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,929
Assemble the cabinet
and theJoint Chiefs.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,729
Yes, ma'am.

198
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,873
<i>[Beeping]</i>

199
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,051
Jack was right about Starkwood.

200
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,186
You find evidence that
they've been supporting Juma?

201
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,526
Yeah.

202
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,362
Did you find out why?
What could Starkwood possibly get from Juma?

203
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,800
The infrastructure to develop
and test biological weapons.

204
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,237
We think they're holding 'em somewhere
on the Starkwood compound.

205
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:04,208
Okay. Where's Jack?

206
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,744
<i>He's... on his way over here.</i>

207
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,076
What, Larry? Larry?

208
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,346
<i>He managed to secure the weapons...</i>

209
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,083
but then, uh, Starkwood got 'em back.

210
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,593
<i>And when that happened, um...</i>

211
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,191
Jack was exposed.

212
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,927
He may have been infected.
He's being placed under quarantine.

213
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,333
<i>Listen, he's on his way here,
and we need to find out...</i>

214
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,735
<i>everything that he learned
about these weapons...</i>

215
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,003
and I think you should be
the one who debriefs him.

216
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,437
And I owe you an apology.

217
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,277
I was wrong not to trust you.

218
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,810
L-I let my prejudice
about Bauer get in the way.

219
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:54,622
But, Renee, you should have
kept me in the loop.

220
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,257
<i>You should have trusted me.</i>

221
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,002
I know.

222
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,496
I should have.

223
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,474
When are we moving on Starkwood?

224
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,716
Aaron. Uh-

225
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:25,587
I'll check in with you guys later, okay?
Thank you.

226
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,557
- May I speak with you for a moment?
- Of course.

227
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,358
I heard you finished your debrief
and were on your way out.

228
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,867
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, I need you to stay.

229
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,133
- Ma'am?
- I've been appointed acting chief of staff.

230
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:44,471
The Secret Service is going to assign
an agent to handle my security detail.

231
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,273
I'd like that to be you.

232
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:52,749
Well, I'm truly flattered, ma'am,
but as you know, I'm retired.

233
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,514
I can have you reinstated.

234
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,556
There are plenty of fine agents
on the roster.

235
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,684
But I don't want them. I want you.

236
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,390
I can't go into the details now,
but the threat to this country isn't over.

237
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,526
We're in the middle of a crisis,
and I need people around me I can trust.

238
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,536
[Sighs]

239
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,663
I trust you, Aaron.

240
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,208
I can't say that
about a lot of people.

241
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,939
I'm running into a meeting
with the president.

242
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,106
I'll assume your answer is yes.

243
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,923
[Chattering]

244
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,451
- Gentlemen, ladies, please take your seats.
- Yes, ma'am.

245
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,654
Here's the packet.

246
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:45,432
<i>Now those of you who haven't had a chance to
finish your briefing packets, please keep reading.</i>

247
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,632
As we've all just learned,
this day is not over.

248
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,873
<i>Our national security
is still being threatened...</i>

249
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,711
and we are here
to consider our options.

250
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,808
Mr. Woods.

251
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,012
<i>Your briefing materials
include F.B.I. Intelligence...</i>

252
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:07,218
about a cache of biological weapons
on Starkwood's main compound
in Northern Virginia.

253
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,193
This is a recent satellite
view of the compound.

254
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,822
<i>Over three square miles, 259 structures.</i>

255
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,128
<i>The weapons could be hidden
anywhere on the facility.</i>

256
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,464
<i>What kind ofbioweapons
are we talking about?</i>

257
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,295
<i>This is Ben Landry.
He's director of C.D.C.</i>

258
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,207
<i>He's here to answer any questions you
may have in regards to the pathogen. Ben?</i>

259
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,973
I've just received a preliminary report
from our agents in the field.

260
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,984
They've identified the pathogen as
a prion variant indigenous to the East Congo.

261
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:37,318
<i>It's a form of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.
It attacks the brain and the nervous system...</i>

262
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,619
<i>causes dementia, physical deterioration...</i>

263
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,454
ultimately death.

264
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:45,588
Now, standard C.J.D. Kills within several months,
but this strain kills more quickly.

265
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:48,258
- How long?
- A day. Maybe two.

266
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,302
<i>There's no treatment
for this disease. There's no cure.</i>

267
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,136
If dispersed over a populated area,
the results would be catastrophic.

268
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:59,940
<i>But it goes without saying we cannot allow
a private military force, these killers...</i>

269
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,980
to possess weapons
of mass destruction.

270
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,381
<i>We need to find these weapons
and arrest those bastards in Starkwood...</i>

271
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,114
who are responsible
for bringing 'em here.

272
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,349
<i>Uh, Madam President.</i>

273
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:18,996
Given the size of the compound, it would take
a considerable force to locate these weapons.

274
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:24,627
<i>Not to mention the fact that there are
1,500 highly trained mercenaries on that base.</i>

275
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,830
<i>God forbid they decide to resist.</i>

276
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,738
<i>We could have a small war
in our own backyard.</i>

277
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,436
<i>I share those concerns, Madam President.
We also have to consider...</i>

278
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,677
the possibility that Starkwood might use
these biological weapons against our own forces.

279
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,844
What about an air strike?

280
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,650
A facility that large would
require multiple bombing runs.

281
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,817
<i>We'd be looking at massive casualties
on the Starkwood base...</i>

282
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,828
<i>with no guarantee
of destroying the bioweapons.</i>

283
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,160
For all we know, they've been buried
underground or in fortified facilities.

284
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,530
<i>There's also a risk
that hitting these weapons...</i>

285
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,297
with insufficient force could release
the bio-agent into the atmosphere.

286
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,897
<i>We can'tjust ignore the law here.
All these scenarios...</i>

287
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,410
would be in violation
of the Posse Comitatus Act.

288
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:10,073
<i>I mean, we can't deploy military personnel
in a law enforcement capacity...</i>

289
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,516
not without congressional approval.

290
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,749
Now, what I'm hearing
is that there are no good options.

291
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,690
I don't accept that.

292
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,627
<i>Until we find a way
to contain this threat...</i>

293
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,756
<i>we are risking another attack
on this country...</i>

294
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,894
and that is an option
I won't consider.

295
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,898
<i>[Door Clatters]</i>

296

447
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,852
<i>He's been working with Jack Bauer
to recover these weapons.</i>

448
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,050
He was taken captive,
but then released by someone on the inside.

449
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,491
His name is Greg Seaton.
He's part ofJonas Hodges's inner circle.

450
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,520
Ma'am, he says he's willing to tell us where
the weapons are in exchange for immunity.

451
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,931
<i>I've already started mobilizing
for a targeted raid.</i>

452
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,527
<i>We can catch 'em by surprise
and lock down these weapons.</i>

453
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,095
But I'm gonna need you to sign
an immunity agreement for this man.

454
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,642
How confident are you
of Seaton's intel?

455
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,075
We believe it's genuine, ma'am.

456
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,670
Madam President,
we may not get a chance like this again.

457
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,911
- Admiral Smith?
- I concur.

458
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,509
But I would suggest we supplement
the F.B.I. With a SEAL squad.

459
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,521
They're ready to move on my order.

460
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:28,047
<i>The Attorney General will raise hell about us
involving the military in this operation.</i>

461
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,356
We'll deal with him later.

462
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:34,694
Agent Moss, you have my direct authorization
to move on Starkwood.

463
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,825
How soon can you be ready?

464
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,234
We've already drafted an executive pardon
and set it up via WebEx.

465
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,274
<i>You'll be able to give a secure digital
signature, and we're good to go.</i>

466
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,741
We have the document set up
at your assistant's computer.

467
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:58,522
Agent Moss,
the president is prepared to sign.

468
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,854
<i>[Larry]
Go ahead, ma'am.</i>

469
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:07,053
All right, it's done.

470
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,497
- Did you get a signature?
- Yeah, we're good.

471
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:13,435
- When can you be at Starkwood?
- We can be there in 10 minutes.

472
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:17,565
Agent Moss, thank you, and good luck.

473
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,110
Thank you, ma'am. Let's go.

474
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,169
Madam President,
we may have just caught a lucky break.

475
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:26,741
Until this plays out, I want everyone
to keep looking for other options.

476
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,253
All right, Mr. Seaton, go ahead.

477
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:43,699
The weapons are in a warehouse on
the northeast quadrant of the compound.

478
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,862
<i>3244.23 North...</i>

479
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,805
11710.42 West.

480
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,904
Mr. Seaton, it would help to have someone
on the ground doing recon.

481
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,209
<i>- Can you get Tony to that warehouse?
- I think so.</i>

482
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,274
See if you can get ahold of a hand radio.
We'll be on 480 kilohertz.

483
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,875
All right. We'll be there.

484
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,649
We land here, we'll be
within 50 yards of the warehouse.

485
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:09,125
Yeah. Support teams here and here,
shore us up. Coordinate with the navy.

486
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,320
- Get moving. I'll meet you upstairs.
- Let's move.

487
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,489
[Chattering]

488
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,226
You're mobilizing. What's going on?

489
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,328
We got a call from Tony. He's working
with an informant inside Starkwood.

490
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,806
We got a location on the weapon. We're getting
ready to stage a raid on the compound.

491
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,139
- I want to go.
- I can understand why. But I'm sorry.

492
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,678
<i>- I can't allow it.
- Larry, I can help you with this.</i>

493
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:31,715
I'm the only one who's seen the canisters.
I know exactly what we're looking for.

494
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,081
I read your debrief.
You gave us all the details we need.

495
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,549
Larry, please. I've earned this.

496
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,155
<i>Jack, I know what you've done today...</i>

497
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,855
the sacrifice you've made.

498
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,558
Under any other circumstances,
I'd want you out there with us.

499
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:52,433
But you're sick. We have no idea
when you're gonna start showing symptoms.

500
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,631
<i>I cannot risk that happening
out in the field.</i>

501
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,471
I need my best men for this operation.

502
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,642
I hope you can understand that.

503
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:08,151
[Exhales]
You're right.

504
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,311
You're right.

505
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:18,885
Yeah. [Chuckles]
I always knew eventually we'd agree on something.

The weapons are inside there.

<i>[Tony] How many men inside?</i>

513
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:47,844
Hodges, munitions team, security-
I'm guessing a dozen or more.

514
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,950
Wolves are
at the door, Tommy.

515
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:58,018
- How much longer?
- We're still an hour away from being armed, sir.

516
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,726
We just intercepted a government transmission.
F.B.I. On the way.

517
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,167
Sir, we haven't even run
the sequence checks yet.

518

Let's do it. Damn it.

- Two minutes, sir.

- Tony, it's Larry Moss. Are you in position?
- Affirmative.

<i>- I'm about 50 yards north of the warehouse.
- What can you tell me?</i>

522
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:32,458
We've got two entrances,
north and south. Heavy steel doors.

523
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,464
Two guards, armed with automatic weapons.

524
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,296
Seaton says there's probably
about a dozen inside.

525
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,531
- I think we have to assume they're armed as well.
- All right, we're almost there.

526
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,631
I'm gonna need your eyes on the ground
in case there's any resistance.

- Copy that.
- Aerial 1 to home base.

Target has been confirmed.
We are go for tac plan alpha.

Copy that, Aerial 1. All feeds are live.

<i>We have an executive order

F.B.I. I'll need to get authorization
from my superiors.

We have sent you a digital copy
of the executive order.

536
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:22,369
Check your wireless frequency.
That is all the authorization you will need.

537
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:26,382
Make no attempt to interfere,
or you will be arrested. Do you understand?

538
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,909
- Do you understand?
- Understood, F.B.I.

539
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,286
Take us in.

Aerial 1 to home base.
We are good to go.

00:41:29,873 --> 00:41:30,839
Jack.

598
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:33,041
(engines revving)

599
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:34,042
MOSS:
Hold your fire!

600
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,779
Hold your fire.

601
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:39,714
(tires squeak)

602
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,117
Hold your fire.

603
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:43,752
Stay in position.

604
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,954
(mumbling softly)

605
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:47,555
Tell Larry to have
his men stand down.

606
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:50,058
Are you kidding me? They just
drew on federal forces.

607
00:41:50,126 --> 00:41:51,359
If you don't want to lose
your men, you'll get them

608
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:52,560
to stand down now. Now!

609
00:41:52,628 --> 00:41:54,596
(tires squeal)

610
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:56,665
MOSS:
Hold your fire!

611
00:42:02,672 --> 00:42:03,738
That's far enough.

612
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:11,613
We cooperated
with your demand

613
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:13,548
to search this building.

614
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:14,716
Now, we're asking you to leave.

615
00:42:14,784 --> 00:42:15,884
MOSS:
There are biological

616
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:17,052
weapons on this facility.

617
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,720
We're not going anywhere
without them.

618
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:20,259
Now, tell your men
to stand down.

619
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,090
Those charges are absurd,

620
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:24,592
and we're not going to
let you keep searching.

621
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,228
You're on private property,

622
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:28,610
and we're prepared
to defend it if necessary.

623
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,066
You are threatening
federal agents.

624
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,068
Stand down! Now!

625
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:34,336
We're protecting our rights

626
00:42:34,403 --> 00:42:35,904
against a hostile government
that's using

627
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:38,640
false charges to
try to shut us down.

628
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,542
Now, we don't want
any bloodshed.

629
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:46,414
But if you try
to advance any farther,

630
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,951
you will be fired upon.
