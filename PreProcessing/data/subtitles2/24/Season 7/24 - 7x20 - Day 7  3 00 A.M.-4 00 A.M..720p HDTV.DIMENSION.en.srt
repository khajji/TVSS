1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,560


2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,560


4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,090
Previously on 24

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,840
You want me to blow up a couple of dozen FBI agents?

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,580
You got a problem with that?

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,310
Agent Walker, this is Jack.

8
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,180
Get your men out of the building... It's a trap.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,050
You got the canister?

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,420
Clearly, Hodges is behind this.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,390
I want him taken to the FBI for interrogation.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,240
He's a sociopath, mom.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,720
He's not going to talk... he's going to want

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,960
To make some kind of deal in exchange for his cooperation.

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,500
- Mom, you're not considering that. - Olivia...

16
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,070
You know what this man is, what he did to Roger.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,610
I've upset the cart, have I?

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,410
That bioweapon that you developed

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,580
For us was not intended for personal use.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,710
I think we can both agree

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,550
That there's no reason for your family

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,910
To pay for your mistakes.

23
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,780
This will induce a cardiac arrest

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,420
And leave no trace in your system.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,660
We are rerouting to west arlington hospital.

26
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,900
Have you heard from Almeida?

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,800
I called him before I met with Hodges.

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,600
Has he secured the canister?

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,600
- Soon. - He's your guy.

30
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,900
He better not screw this up.

31
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,140
I have faith he'll come through.

32
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,740
Why don't you go back to FBI medical and let them treat you?

33
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,240
There is no treatment.

34
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,680
There is no cure.

35
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,010
Almost like they knew, Jack.

36
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,010
They would have needed time

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
To wire this building with explosives.

38
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,880
This is the last sector we were due to search.

39
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,590
Jack, what is it?

40
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,220
What is your involvement?

41
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,420
You're not thinking straight.

42
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,460
The toxin's starting to affect your judgment.

43
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,430
- Now, why don't you put the gun down. - Don't you move!

44
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,060
I never wanted to hurt you, Jack.

45
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,600
I told you to stay out of it.

46
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,700
We get some help here?

47
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,300
This man's having a seizure.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,260
The following takes place between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m.

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,330
Mr. Bauer, you should be feeling better already.

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,470
I'm giving you five CC's of intravenous Pendopamine.

51
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,740
It'll de-constrict your muscles.

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,910
Just hang in there.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,890
Don't talk. Your vocal cords are in spasm.

54
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,180
What the hell happened?

55
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,550
Tony Almeida found him in full seizure.

56
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,980
What about the medication pack you gave him?

57
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,350
Wasn't carrying it.

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,650
S-s-stop.

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
Mr. Bauer,please don't speak.

60
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,190
Stop...

61
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,390
Tony...

62
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,520
Tony?

63
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,820
I don't understand.

64
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,060
He's second man.

65
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,990
- Jack, what... - Put out an APB.

66
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,530
How do you know this?

67
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,360
Do it!

68
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,790
Attention, all patrols and perimeter teams,

69
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,750
This is Alpha one.

70
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,930
I'm issuing a priority APB on Tony Almeida.

71
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,870
Approach with extreme caution.

72
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,040
He's colluding with Galvez

73
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,110
And should be considered hostile.

74
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,140
All units who engage the suspect should do so with extreme caution.

75
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,830
You really need to give yourself more time to recover.

76
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,340
Here's another med pack.

77
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,900
Make sure he doesn't lose it.

78
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,610
I need to go tend to the other wounded.

79
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,780
All right,tell me what the hell is going on.

80
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,880
Tony was working with Galvez all along.

81
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,290
He used us, all of us, so that he could get to the canister.

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,630
So, wait, what are you saying, that...

83
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,360
Tony killed larry?

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,900
Yeah.

85
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,370
They must have ambushed him as the chopper was setting down.

86
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,600
Tony stayed behind so he could monitor our search,

87
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,640
Set the trap and make sure Galvez could get beyond the perimeter.

88
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,240
Oh, god.

89
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,980
I'm so sorry.

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,450
This is my fault.

91
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,620
I vouched for him to you, to the president.

92
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,420
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

93
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,190
I felt that something was wrong.

94
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,630
Things weren't adding up.

95
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,330
I just...

96
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,660
I just wanted to believe him.

97
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,100
Alpha one, this is agent Kilner.

98
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,730
Alpha one... go ahead.

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,370
Agent Walker, I'm at checkpoint Delta.

100
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,410
I've got two agents dead, shot point-blank.

101
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,640
Their vehicle is missing.

102
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,410
Okay, he's made it past the perimeter.

103
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,010
Tracking on the vehicle has been disabled. Position is unknown.

104
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,010
Widen the perimeter, and keep looking for almeida.

105
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,850
If we lose him, we lose the canister.

106
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,420
You're not gonna find him... he's gone.

107
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,090
We need to phone the president.

108
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,290
Let's go.

109
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,900
You made it.

110
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,470
You sound surprised.

111
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,400
After bauer called you out, I wasn't sure you would.

112
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,610
You don't have to worry about Jack Bauer.

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
He's not gonna be a problem.

114
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,980
So, where is the canister?

115
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,280
Where's the money?

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,450
Hey, that was our agreement.

117
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,320
Money first.

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,700
There you go.

119
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,600
It's all there, wired into your account.

120
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,200
You can check it if you want.

121
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,340
I want.

122
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,080
Everything okay?

123
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,620
Yeah.

124
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,250
So, where is the canister?

125
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,590
Right here.

126
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,970
So, what are you planning on doing with it?

127
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Not really your business, is it?

128
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,970
You gonna sell it?

129
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,720
You don't want to do this.

130
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,620
Hey, who's the damn buyer?

131
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,910
Where's the canister?

132
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,710
Where is the damn canister?!

133
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,120
One of the marines that was guarding Hodges

134
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,080
Noticed he was trying to swallow something.

135
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,690
He intervened, got him to the hospital

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,890
Before the poison could be completely ingested.

137
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,290
So, he'll survive?

138
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,560
Yes, ma'am, but the doctors are surprised he pulled through.

139
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,800
That's because they never met the son of a bitch.

140
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,530
How did Hodges get this poison?

141
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,400
We suspect from a woman who claimed to be his attorney.

142
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,470
Claimed to be?

143
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,770
She was an impostor.

144
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,560
DC police found the body of Hodges' real attorney

145
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,010
About five minutes ago.

146
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,270
We're still trying to determine

147
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,010
How she managed to breach security.

148
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,280
Madam president, agent Walker and Jack Bauer.

149
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,850
- Put them through. - Yes,ma'am.

150
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,720
This is president Taylor.

151
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,020
I'm here with tim woods.

152
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
Madam president...

153
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,850
Have you secured the canister?

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm afraid not, ma'am.

155
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,060
Our suspect escaped beyond the perimeter.

156
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,560
I was told that the area was locked down.

157
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,690
What happened?

158
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,560
He had help, madam president.

159
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,960
From Tony Almeida.

160
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,660
Almeida?

161
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,900
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,500
He was working for us.

163
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,900
It only appeared that way.

164
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,670
Apparently, he was pursuing his own agenda,

165
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,300
Trying to get his hands on the canister.

166
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,210
Madam president, I know I vouched for him.

167
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,780
All I can tell you right now

168
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,480
Is that I was wrong and I'm sorry.

169
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,780
Now that we know he has the canister,

170
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,710
Do we have any idea what he intends to do with it?

171
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,720
- No, not yet. - Or where he is?

172
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,520
We're all hands on deck here, sir, regrouping to develop leads.

173
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,190
I may have one.

174
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,290
As Hodges was taken into custody,

175
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,490
He yelled at me about some larger group

176
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,660
That would continue on after his arrest.

177
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,700
Something that I wouldn't be able to stop.

178
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,100
What do you think he meant?

179
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,400
Well, all I know for sure

180
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,330
Is that someone doesn't want Hodges to talk.

181
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
Shortly after he was arrested,

182
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,640
Hodges was visited by a woman impersonating his lawyer.

183
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,940
She apparently gave him some kind of lethal drug,

184
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,240
Because ten minutes later,

185
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,340
He tried to commit suicide.

186
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,140
Tried to commit suicide?

187
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,710
Oh, he's still alive.

188
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,350
Jonas Hodges was completely unrepentant.

189
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,730
Now, this suicide attempt must have been coerced.

190
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,220
Well, obviously, they're holding something over him,

191
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,420
Most likely his family.

192
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,620
If that's the case, madam president,

193
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,890
We need to talk to him.

194
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,630
Jack, even after everything that's happened today,

195
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,830
I will not allow any kind of coercive interrogation.

196
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,930
Madam president, that won't be necessary. He'll talk.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
How can you be sure?

198
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,570
Because we can offer Hodges something that he needs.

199
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,350
And what's that?

200
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,380
Proof of death.

201
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,100
We can convince the people that wanted him dead

202
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,070
that they succeeded.

203
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,540
It's the only way Hodges can protect his family.

204
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,010
Madam president, right now,

205
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,610
He's the only lead we've got.

206
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,270
I'll assume that was necessary.

207
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,800
Don't start with me.

208
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,570
I'm not in the mood.

209
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,070
All right.

210
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,010
Mr. Galvez decided to hide the canister from me,

211
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,210
So, uh, I had to find out where it was.

212
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,150
We've got a delivery to make.

213
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,420
Shall we go?

214
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,150
No, I don't think we should.

215
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,360
They're expecting us.

216
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,690
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,030
They're gonna take this canister that I sweated blood for

218
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,400
And sit on it for six months.

219
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,150
Not sit on it.

220
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,720
They're gonna use it to make more pathogen.

221
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,750
We had 27 canisters; now we have one.

222
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,420
Yeah, and I say one's enough.

223
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,750
Look...

224
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,820
The government's reeling.

225
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,720
The FBI is stretched thin...

226
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,150
Scrambling, making mistakes.

227
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,190
Another attack today is all we need

228
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,160
To push this thing right over the edge.

229
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,990
This is no time to pull back.

230
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,600
I say we take that canister,

231
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,770
And finish the job off today.

232
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,170
I don't disagree with you

233
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,410
But it's not our decision to make.

234
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,970
Fine.

235
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,140
Then run it by your group or your gang or whatever the hell they are.

236
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,540
But they'll know one thing.

237
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,050
You finish your enemy off when he's down.

238
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,920
You don't let him get back up and reload.

239
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,850
I guarantee you,this thing's gonna be

240
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,520
A hell of a lot harder

241
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,220
To pull off six months from now.

242
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,390
And you can say what you want about Jonas Hodges,

243
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,390
The fact is,

244
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,360
He gave us an opportunity today.

245
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,970
Let's take it.

246
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,270
I'll contact the group.

247
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,310
Good.

248
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
What did she say exactly?

249
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,570
Only that she needs to see you

250
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,830
And that it's urgent.

251
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,840
I heard rumors about the fbi operation.

252
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,700
I'm sure your mother will fill you in

253
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,010
Olivia.

254
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,040
Is it true the FBI perimeter was breached?

255
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,350
I'm afraid so.

256
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,810
The canister is now outside the cordon.

257
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,320
What are we doing to get it back?

258
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,550
Tim,would you excuse us for a moment?

259
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,120
Of course.

260
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,160
What is it?

261
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,660
I need you to call the attorney general

262
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,000
And draft a witness protection agreement for Jonas Hodges.

263
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,640
Witness protection?

264
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,100
You can't be serious.

265
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,310
Less than an hour ago,

266
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,480
Hodges tried to kill himself.

267
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,810
And we all believe that he must've been coerced.

268
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,010
By whom?

269
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,950
You remember his rant...

270
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,380
That he is a cog in a larger conspiracy,

271
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,020
That there are others who will carry on.

272
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,650
You think they're the ones who took the canister?

273
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,860
Well,we need to find out.

274
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,430
Which is why we need to get hodges to talk.

275
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,700
Olivia,we feel confident that he will

276
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,970
If we can assure him that these people will believe

277
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,510
That his suicide attempt actually succeeded.

278
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,010
We need to make him disappear.

279
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,350
Which is why I need the protection agreement.

280
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,220
There is no other way he'll talk.

281
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,020
Designate him an enemy combatant,

282
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,190
Then treat him like one.

283
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,620
We don't do that.

284
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,060
Not in this administration.

285
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,130
And it's not as if he's getting a free pass.

286
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,130
He'll be under federal supervision

287
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,130
For the rest of his life.

288
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,300
Oh,yeah,

289
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,100
On a hundred acre ranch in colorado!

290
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,500
This man murdered your son!

291
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,530
My brother.

292
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,040
Not to mention

293
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,010
Hundreds of innocent civilians.

294
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
I don't need you to tell me what he's done.

295
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,180
Apparently you do.

296
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,720
Olivia,stop it!

297
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,080
What would dad say?

298
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,320
I bet you're afraid to ask.

299
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,890
I said stop!

300
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,660
You think it doesn't tear me apart?

301
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,700
I'm Roger's mother.

302
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,610
But I am also the president of the united states

303
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,440
And I placed my hand on a Bible

304
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,480
And swore to protect and defend the constitution.

305
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,550
You are my chief of staff.

306
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,780
I need you to act like one.

307
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,720
Now,Jonas Hodges

308
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,560
Is at the FBI,and Jack Bauer will be there shortly.

309
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,460
I need an agreement drafted.

310
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Do that please.

311
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,840
The plan is straightforward...

312
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,510
An attack today this morning

313
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,340
During rush hour using the bioweapon

314
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,680
That tony almeida retrieved from starkwood.

315
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,510
You should have each received a data pack

316
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,010
When you logged on to this call.

317
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,780
Please open it now.

318
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,280
The attack will be attributed to this man,

319
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,290
Jibraan al-zarian.

320
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,490
Whose body will be left at the scene.

321
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
The evidence trail implicating him

322
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,820
Will include fabricated e-mails,

323
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,060
Phone records,

324
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,160
And a large wire transfer to his account

325
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,930
Via our favorite yemini bank.

326
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,970
I'm looking at the briefing materials

327
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,130
And I'm not seeing how this man is actually connected

328
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,540
To any terrorist group.

329
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,870
He isn't.

330
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,140
As previously discussed,

331
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,970
There are considerable tactical advantages

332
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,310
To using an innocent.

333
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,880
But what about his unpredictability?

334
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,010
Al-zarian has no agenda of his own.

335
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,150
He'll in fact be easier to control and manipulate

336
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,150
Than a real terrorist.

337
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,150
So what are The casualty estimates?

338
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,990
Page three describes the casualties estimates

339
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,360
As well as secondary effects.

340
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,090
As you can see,we've listed

341
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,190
Hold on Forget about

342
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,830
What casualties may or may not be.

343
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,000
We're talking about launching a new operation

344
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,500
In the next few hours.

345
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,970
Without any planning.

346
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,530
And with only one canister.

347
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,070
The plan for this operation was already in place.

348
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,870
We'd just be accelerating the timetable.

349
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,610
We were going to have six months to prepare.

350
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,880
There's no way to pull it together in a few hours.

351
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,510
I believe there is.

352
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,510
With the support of this group.

353
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,680
Support for whom?

354
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,480
This tony almeida we barely know?

355
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,850
And what about postattack plans?

356
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,250
How's this group going to end up where we need to be?

357
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,790
I agree. How we handle ourselves politically

358
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,830
In the aftermath of this event

359
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,890
Is just as important as the attack itself.

360
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,060
It always has been in your opinion

361
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,900
Is there time then to achieve

362
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:31,030
All our objectives in the current scenario?

363
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,840
Not with the same level of certainty.

364
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,240
Or anonymity.

365
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,500
That's right.

366
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,770
Well,then,maybe it's,uh,definitive.

367
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
What do you mean?

368
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,240
There's no downside to waiting.

369
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,280
There's a huge downside to going in unprepared.

370
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,710
Things go wrong,

371
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,720
We're looking at exposure for all of us

372
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,290
No,no,I still don't see it that way.

373
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,290
Gentlemen.

374
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,320
Ladies.

375
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,490
I've listened to your comments

376
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,530
And there's wisdom in what I've heard.

377
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,600
But there's also wisdom in something I haven't heard.

378
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,600
Jonas hodges was a loose cannon,

379
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,200
And the group is well rid of him.

380
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,240
But,in his lunacy,he did us a favor.

381
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,140
He did half our job for us.

382
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,140
More than half.

383
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,710
He pushed this country to the brink.

384
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,620
You don't get many gifts like that.

385
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,650
I say we take it.

386
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,260
We have a quorum,I'd like to call for an immediate vote.

387
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,710
Tony.

388
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,650
How'd it go?

389
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Take a look.

390
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,030
We're a go.

391
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,610
- Where's Hodges now? - Down the hall.

392
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,610
We've set up a medical suite in secure.

393
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,110
And the death certificate?

394
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,480
Done.

395
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,520
As far as the world knows,he's molding on a slab

396
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,520
- At the coroner's. - Keep it that way.

397
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,020
No one knows he's alive unless they have to.

398
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,890
No,just the ambulance driver,

399
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,320
The medical team and three security.

400
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,490
All trustworthy.

401
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,520
Wait.

402
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,960
Are you sure he's up for this?

403
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,090
I know what happened out there.

404
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,430
Medication worked. He'll be okay.

405
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,730
I'm not talking about the seizure.

406
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,730
I'm talking about the tony almeida situation.

407
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,170
What about it?

408
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,240
His former partner betrays him,

409
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,670
He tries to have you all killed...

410
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,070
Jack must have some feelings about that.

411
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,570
Yeah.

412
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Yeah,I think it's what's keeping him going.

413
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,510
Listen to me.

414
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,850
Listen to me.

415
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,850
Is anyone listening?

416
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,850
I know you're watching.

417
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,850
I see the cameras!

418
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,590
I know you're watching.

419
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,090
Do you realize what you people have done?

420
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,130
You didn't save me,

421
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,960
You killed my family!

422
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,230
You killed my family!

423
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,960
You killed them!

424
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,060
Killed them.

425
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,630
- How long has he been conscious? - Ten minutes.

426
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,470
He's been talking about his family ever since.

427
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,870
Biometrics are over here.

428
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,670
Cardiac,respiratory,plus dermal infrared.

429
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,240
Good. We'll know if he's lying.

430
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,240
Jack,

431
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,110
The president is monitoring this.

432
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,610
Sergeant,I'm asking you,

433
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,780
Soldier to soldier,let me have your firearm.

434
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,950
I'll use one... one bullet on myself.

435
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,990
Please.

436
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,390
Relax,Mr. Hodges.

437
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,960
You're already dead.

438
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Sergeant.

439
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,070
Who are you?

440
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,600
My name is Jack Bauer.

441
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,640
And right now,I'm the only chance

442
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,970
Your wife and children have to stay alive.

443
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,010
Explain that to me.

444
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,340
The people that wanted you dead don't know you survived.

445
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,410
Tell us who they are,

446
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,280
And we'll keep it that way.

447
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,180
The president has agreed to provide you with a death

448
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,350
Certificate and witness protection in exchange

449
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,350
For actionable information.

450
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,990
I can't watch this anymore.

451
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,360
If you refuse,it'll be released

452
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,690
To the press that you are alive and in our custody

453
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,960
And that you're cooperating.

454
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,090
We'll let your friends take care of the rest.

455
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,100
My family is innocent.

456
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,660
The president would never allow that to happen.

457
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:39,330
She doesn't have the stomach for it.

458
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
You might be right about that.

459
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,640
But make no mistake about it,sir.

460
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,910
I do.

461
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,010
Trust me.

462
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,610
Do your family a favor.

463
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Just tell me who you've been working with.

464
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,060
I am...

465
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,560
I was...

466
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,900
Part of a larger group of like minds.

467
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,230
You mean,other companies like starkwood.

468
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,970
I mean people who can protect this country

469
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,500
Better than any government ever could.

470
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,340
There are hundreds of private military companies

471
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,540
In this country,we're talking tens of thousands of people.

472
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,540
But only a handful

473
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,680
With the guts and the vision to do what was necessary.

474
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,840
And what is that?

475
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,210
The plan was to launch simultaneous attacks

476
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
Early next year.

477
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,720
Multiple cities.

478
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,220
So the public would finally see

479
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,720
That the government can't protect them.

480
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,160
They'd demand drastic measures and we'd step in.

481
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,160
How would you justify that to the American people?

482
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,320
Simple.

483
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:37,660
Offload the blame.

484
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,090
We were going to supply the enemies

485
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,830
That want to destroy this country.

486
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,560
Muhammed this,achmed that.

487
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,070
From sleeper cells the apologists say don't even exist.

488
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,070
You of all people should understand.

489
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,940
Understand what?

490
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,110
I watched the senate hearing yesterday,

491
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,110
And I was disgusted with how you were treated.

492
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,110
You should be regarded as a hero,

493
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,950
Not a criminal.

494
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,920
I broke the law.

495
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,890
You were following

496
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,020
Your instinct to protect your country,just like me.

497
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,320
Mr. Hodges,I need the names

498
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,020
Of the people that you are working with.

499
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,390
I have spent my entire life protecting this country

500
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,630
From enemies large and small.

501
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,660
I created Starkwood from the ground up.

502
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,600
And the government used us to great effect.

503
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,000
And now they think they can just throw us away.

504
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,940
Are you telling me that this has been

505
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,410
About protecting your contracts,about money?

506
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,540
I tried to tell the politicians how vulnerable we are,

507
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,010
And they wouldn't listen.

508
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,580
So we decided to show them.

509
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,580
By attacking your own country with a biological weapon?

510
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,180
By killing innocent people?

511
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,020
Yes,a few innocent lives would be lost,

512
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,990
But only to save the greater number.

513
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,490
Having the courage to make those hard choices

514
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,960
Gives us a lot in common,Mr. Bauer.

515
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,230
Let me explain something to you.

516
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,660
You and I have absolutely nothing in common.

517
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,300
All that you have done today is create a scenario

518
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,600
By attacking your own country

519
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,170
That has made you valuable again.

520
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,670
Today has been nothing short

521
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,310
Of a desperate grab for power,

522
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:58,440
And it has failed.

523
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,970
You have failed,and unless

524
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,140
You want me to go public

525
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,410
With the fact that you are still alive,

526
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,710
You are gonna give me the names

527
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,180
Of the people that you've been working with.

528
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,450
- I-I don't have them. - I want the names.

529
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,450
- I don't have any. - I want the names!

530
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,290
I don't know any!

531
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,690
Fine.

532
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,370
Patch me through to Amy at the washington post.

533
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,170
No.

534
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,540
Amy,it's jack. I have a statement I need to make.

535
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,770
Wait!

536
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,940
- Wait! wait! wait! wait! - Give me the names!

537
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,040
I swear... I swear I don't have them.

538
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,110
This whole project was... was based on anonymity.

539
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,510
We never met in person.

540
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,620
Everything was handled through an intermediary,a woman.

541
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,980
She never told me who she was.

542
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,150
She never told me her name.

543
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,320
I never asked her.

544
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,950
The same woman that gave you the poison?

545
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,060
Yes,yes.

546
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,770
Amy,I'm sorry. something's come up.

547
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,340
I've got to call you back.

548
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,540
You tell yourself whatever you want.

549
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,310
You are a traitor.

550
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,510
Witness protection was your promise.

551
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,450
Yeah.

552
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,650
Madam president,did you hear everything

553
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,120
That Hodges had to say?

554
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,490
Yes. Is any of it even credible?

555
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,320
All of it is. Biometric monitors here indicate

556
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,690
That he was telling the truth.

557
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,260
Whoever they are,this group just went

558
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,630
Through an awful lot of trouble

559
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,400
To get their hands on that last canister.

560
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,030
It seems very clear to me that their plan is still on.

561
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,670
- You mean another attack? - Yes,ma'am.

562
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,470
I think you should proceed under the assumption

563
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,570
That they might strike immediately.

564
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,740
Hold on.

565
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,170
Hodges said some time next year.

566
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,870
No. Hodges said that was the plan.

567
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,440
Given the chaos that he created today,

568
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,550
The smart strategic move would be to act right now.

569
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,680
Now,I believe the canister is still in this area,

570
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,180
So we're gonna have to alert homeland,

571
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,680
Have them start identifying and raiding targets.

572
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,990
Hodges said that the plan was

573
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,290
To enlist parties with terrorist ties.

574
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,920
At this point,I think that might be our most solid lead.

575
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,460
Madam president,I agree with agent Walker.

576
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,190
We need to make an immediate threat assessment

577
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,630
With focus on all known terrorist activity.

578
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,600
The fastest way for us to get that information

579
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,600
Is to gain access to the CTU servers

580
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,330
That have been sealed as a result

581
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
Of senator Mayer's investigation.

582
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,140
I'll have them recommissioned immediately.

583
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,070
And consider the resources of this government

584
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,140
At your disposal,Jack.

585
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,210
Thank you,ma'am.

586
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,610
I need those servers right away.

587
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,550
They're in doj evidence lockers on the third floor.

588
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,920
I'll have I.T. break them out.

589
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,290
Okay,good.

590
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,400
We have a new shift of analysts coming in,

591
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,510
If you can tell them what you're looking for.

592
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,790
No,we don't have time.

593
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,820
We need someone who already knows the protocols.

594
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,790
I'll take care of it.

595
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,460
Just get me those servers.

596
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,650
Who is it?

597
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,780
Hey,it's me Jack.

598
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,780
Jack,where the hell are you?

599
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,320
The FBI headquarters.

600
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,850
I've been trying to reach you all night.

601
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,120
No one will tell me anything.

602
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,160
Is it true about Bill?

603
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,390
Yeah,I'm afraid so.

604
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,970
What happened?

605
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,640
He was killed during the white house siege.

606
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,710
Chloe,you should know,

607
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,540
Bill sacrificed his life to save the president.

608
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,090
Listen to me. This threat is not over.

609
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,810
We believe that there's going to be a biological attack somewhere in the area.

610
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,420
Soon. I need your help to stop it.

611
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,950
How?

612
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,490
I need you to reconstitute the CTU servers.

613
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,150
They were seized when the CTU was decommissioned.

614
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,430
I don't have access to them.

615
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,730
You will by the time you get here.

616
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,300
Who's doing this?

617
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,870
We don't have all the players.

618
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,500
I'll fill you in with as much as I know when you get here.

619
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,910
I'm sending a car over to your hotel.

620
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,250
Chloe?

621
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,250
Send a car.

622
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,320
Thank you.

623
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,190
Morris,wake up.

624
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,120
What? Are you speaking to me again now?

625
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,890
I have to go.

626
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,140
I need you to take Prescott and get out of the city.

627
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,470
Why? I just spoke with Jack.

628
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,730
There's going to be another attack.

629
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,600
This time,it's biological.

630
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,030
Okay,then we'll all get out of here together.

631
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,130
I can't. FBI needs me.

632
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,700
But the last time you worked for these people,

633
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,040
They arrested you.

634
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,170
I know.

635
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,910
But I'm the only one that can get the servers back online.

636
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,310
Well,I'm not gonna leave you here.

637
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,450
Not with the possibility of a biological attack.

638
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,220
Please.

639
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,030
I'm the only one that can do this.

640
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,760
And Jack needs me.

641
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,300
And I just need for you and Prescott to be safe.

642
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,770
Okay?

643
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,970
I'll see you back at home.

644
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,670
Just... be careful.

645
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,990
I will.

646
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,090
All right,before we begin,everyone make sure

647
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,500
You have your updated briefing packets,

648
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,190
And the latest CDC abstract.

649
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,440
Jack,whenever you're ready.

650
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,850
Thank you.

651
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,720
I know many of you have lost friends and colleagues today.

652
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,350
I have,too.

653
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,460
Unfortunately,the time to mourn these brave men and women

654
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
Is going to have to wait.

655
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,830
'cause,as many of you are already aware,

656
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,230
We are facing the threat of a terrorist event

657
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,530
Somewhere on the eastern seaboard.

658
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,000
We don't have specific intel

659
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,330
As to the time table of this attack,

660
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,100
But we do have reason to believe that

661
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,610
The people that are behind this will want to strike immediately?

662
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,820
Excuse me.

663
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,500
Tim Moran,field ops.

664
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,240
Who are the people behind this?

665
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,640
Right now,we only have two confirmed suspects.

666
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,980
Tony almeida

667
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,710
And the woman he's been working with.

668
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,250
We're still trying to identify her.

669
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,980
The assumption is,the two of them are part of a broader

670
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,920
Conspiracy as outlined in your briefing material.

671
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,490
And the nature of the attack?

672
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,090
All it says here is biological.

673
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,760
The actual pathogen is a prion variant,designed to attack

674
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,960
The central nervous system and ultimately destroy it.

675
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,390
Do we know what the target is?

676
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,230
No,not yet. We're also unclear

677
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,000
On the specifics of the delivery device.

678
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,400
Well,what leads do we have?

679
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,370
Right now,

680
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,470
We are solely working off an operational theory

681
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,240
That the people that are behind this

682
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,500
Will need to manufacture evidence

683
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,540
In an effort to offload the blame for this attack

684
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,970
To either another group or an individual

685
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,140
With terrorist sympathies.

686
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,480
During the ensuing panic,

687
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,610
These people will move in and seize power

688
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,580
Under the guise of creating and maintaining stability.

689
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,980
So,our job here is to look for traces

690
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,040
Of that manufactured evidence.

691
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,860
How exactly?

692
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,090
Pattern searches of suspicious financial transactions.

693
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,430
Keyword intercepts of existing wiretaps,

694
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,590
Websites and e-mails.

695
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,760
And data-mining all

696
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,530
NSA and CIA intelligence

697
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,900
On jihadist activities over the past six months.

698
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,520
Excuse me.

699
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,740
Not only is that type of blanket surveillance illegal.

700
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,370
We don't have the capacity to pull it off.

701
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,540
The search algorithms

702
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,670
- Simply don't exist.- yes,they do.

703
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,410
- At CTU. - Those servers were decommissioned.

704
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,370
Not anymore. They're here.

705
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,610
We're in the process of installing them now.

706
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,550
Well,what does that make us,CTU-lite?

707
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,690
Last I heard,

708
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,190
The bureau was a federal entity bound by federal statute.

709
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,190
Janis, do this or I will find someone else who will.

710
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,460
I do not have time to argue.

711
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm not arguing. I'm asking.

712
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,500
Moving on.

713
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,800
I've got her from here. Thanks.

714
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,670
Jack. Hey.

715
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,610
Thanks for coming.

716
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,780
You look like hell.

717
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,350
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

718
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,510
You don't look fine.

719
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,680
Maybe a little tired.

720
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,620
Did you get the report I sent you?

721
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,520
Yeah. I read it on the way over.

722
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,190
- It's terrifying. How real is this? - Real.

723
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,690
We're getting access to the CTU servers, right?

724
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,990
Yeah. They're coming online now.

725
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,290
Shouldn't I be supervising this?

726
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
Yeah. Look,

727
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,530
There's something I need to talk to you about before we get started.

728
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,530
There's no easy way for me to say this.

729
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,240
But tony's been responsible for these attacks.

730
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,410
That's not possible.

731
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,410
He was using you and Bill all along.

732
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,380
He's really been working for a group of private military firms

733
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,450
Trying to destabilize this country in an effort to seize power.

734
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,850
So far today,

735
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,490
His actions have cost the lives of hundreds of people.

736
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,150
But he's threatening thousands more.

737
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,190
It doesn't make any sense.

738
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,890
I know he was devastated over michelle, but...

739
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,590
Chloe, he's not your friend.

740
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,030
The Tony that you knew... he doesn't exist anymore.

741
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,600
There has to be a reason.

742
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,070
A reason for what?

743
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,070
Bringing down two passenger planes?

744
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,740
Trying to ambush 25 federal agents?

745
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,040
Chloe, he tried to kill me.

746
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,680
He betrayed us all... you, me,

747
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,680
And Bill,

748
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,050
And right now our only responsibility

749
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,180
Is to stop him.

750
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,390
Now, I need to know that you can treat him

751
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,290
As an enemy combatant, that you are with me on this.

752
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,430
Okay, I'll do whatever you say.

753
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,400
No, I need to know that you are with me on this.

754
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,440
I'm with you.

755
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,870
Okay.

756
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,940
Let's go.

757
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,160
His name is jibraan al-zarian.

758
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,990
27 years old.

759
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,930
He's a day laborer at cabrera granite construction.

760
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,130
Immigration status?

761
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,130
Illegal.

762
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,530
His visa expired as of january.

763
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,130
Ties to any extremist groups?

764
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,000
No, none, but there's definitely anger there.

765
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,340
Both parents were killed in a U.S. Air strike by the pakistani border.

766
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,910
He was 11 at the time.

767
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,410
Fits the psych profile.

768
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,580
Bit of a loner, a mystery to his coworkers,

769
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,010
And we build the rest.

770
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,820
What about the family?

771
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,590
One younger brother, who he's pretty much raised on his own.

772
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,650
It's perfect, huh?

773
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,330
Though it is doubtful that anyone sleeps very well in D.C. tonight,

774
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,130
A certain calm was set over the streets.

775
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,560
After an unprecedented series of terror attacks

776
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,470
Left people all over the country shaken and demavery hungry.

777
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,770
In her speech, president taylor went a long way...

778
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,770
Morning.

779
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,770
Pour yourself some orange juice.

780
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,010
I'm not really very hungry.

781
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,620
Sit down,eat some breakfast for once.

782
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,120
It's unhealthy not to.

783
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,450
What are you doing up anyway?

784
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,450
I,uh,

785
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,650
Couldn't sleep.

786
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,030
Listen,uh,I want you to come

787
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,530
home straight after the work today?

788
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,360
Okay?

789
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,330
No delaying.

790
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,330
Why?

791
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,530
Just in case.

792
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,200
In case of what?

793
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,070
These attacks,this terrorism...

794
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,240
It's all over the news.

795
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,710
Okay,it's not a good day to be a muslim.

796
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,810
Jibraan,muslims had nothing to do with it.

797
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,680
Doesn't matter.

798
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,120
Nobody cares,believe me.

799
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,190
Most of the guys at my work think I'm puerto rican anyway.

800
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,960
It's about time.

801
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,470
Come in.

802
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,100
Excuse me,Ms. Taylor.

803
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,410
What is it?

804
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,080
The attorney general asked me to check in with you.

805
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,110
He is waiting to sign off on a document

806
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,750
I was told you were reviewing.

807
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,150
Anyone happen to mention to you

808
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,820
What this document is about?

809
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,820
No,ma'am.

810
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,720
No,I imagine they wouldn't.

811
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,850
It's a secret,Highly classified.

812
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,960
Not that I give a damn.

813
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,030
It's a get-out- of-jail-free card

814
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,360
For Jonas Hodges,

815
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,400
The bastard responsible for my brother's death

816
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,140
And so many others.

817
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,570
I don't understand.

818
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,440
Mr. Hodges died in the hospital.

819
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,050
I wish that were the case,but no,

820
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,610
And once the A.G. Signs this witness protection agreement,

821
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,850
Hodges is going

822
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,150
To live out his days in comfort and anonymity

823
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,090
While my brother lies in his grave in arlington cemetery.

824
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,830
Does that sound like justice to you,aaron?

825
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,170
No,ma'am,it does not.

826
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,000
And yet my mother saw fit

827
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,700
To reward this monster for his cooperation.

828
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,470
Well,I'm sure it was a difficult decision

829
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,910
For the president to make.

830
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,210
Not difficult enough.

831
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,910
My mother may be able to live with it,

832
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,110
But I'm not sure I can.

833
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,090
Ms. Taylor,I have seen the guilty walk free many times.

834
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,990
I understand your anger and frustration,

835
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,930
And I am genuinely sorry.

836
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,200
Tell the A.G. I've reviewed the agreement

837
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,170
And we can move ahead.

838
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,740
Thank you,ma'am.

839
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,780
Is there anything else that I can do for you?

840
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,750
Other than kill Jonas Hodges,no.

841
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,220
I'm sorry,aaron.

842
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,490
I didn't mean that.

843
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,260
I was just venting.

844
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,660
Ma'am.

845
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,460
Hello?

846
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,460
Martin?

847
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,700
It's olivia taylor.

848
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,700
Did I wake you?

849
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,140
Well,as a matter of fact,yes.

850
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,140
What time is it?

851
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,570
Almost 4:00.

852
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,370
Actually I didn't expect to catch you at home.

853
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,470
I thought you were in Florida

854
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,710
Doing opposition for the Gainor campaign.

855
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,580
No,that didn't really work out.

856
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,980
Why not?

857
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,680
Let's just say that my methods were a little hardball

858
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,890
For the governor's taste.

859
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,930
So... what can I do for you,Olivia?

860
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,390
You heard about the attack on the white house?

861
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,300
Yeah,I watched your mother's address to the nation.

862
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,600
Really impressive.

863
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,230
She continues to surprise,doesn't she?

864
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,800
Listen,martin,I need your help.

865
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,040
Can we meet?

866
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,770
- Now? - Yeah.

867
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,240
Well,what's this about,Olivia?

868
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,040
I can't talk about it over the phone.

869
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,910
Well,it's the middle of the night,you know?

870
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,980
Y-you got to do better than that.

871
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,790
We were in a dive hotel bar in Atlanta

872
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,920
Right after we picked Hayworth

873
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,860
To be the running mate on the ticket.

874
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,760
There was an issue regarding his abuse of a certain prescription drug

875
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,130
And a local reporter who couldn't be persuaded to shut up about it.

876
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,900
I remember you turned to me and said

877
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,940
There was no problem

878
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,110
That couldn't be handled or eliminated.

879
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,640
Well,I was drunk.

880
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,350
You were serious.

881
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,920
You know,you're right.

882
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,950
We shouldn't be talking about this over the phone.

883
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,150
How soon can you be at the white house?

884
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,950
How's 15 minutes sound?

885
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
Good.

886
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,130
You done with that yet?

887
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,700
I'm not familiar with these commands.

888
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,070
Oh,you don't want to boot the subnet with server two.

889
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,800
It has a faulty bus that we weren't able to fix

890
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,940
Before you guys impounded it.

891
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,740
Well,maybe you'd like to take over.

892
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,710
Only if you want it to work right.

893
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,710
I don't like this either.

894
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,250
- Is there a problem? - Yes,there is.

895
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,920
I'm not comfortable doing this.

896
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,920
I agreed to it,but I don't like it.

897
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,890
What exactly aren't you comfortable with?

898
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,720
Uh,well,the bill of rights being violated,for one,

899
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,960
So if you're going to be doing anything

900
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,960
Grossly illegal,please...

901
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,990
We'll make sure we notify you

902
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,760
So you can leave the building.

903
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,780
Hello,big brother.

904
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,750
Look,if you think your need

905
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,220
To complain is more important than the lives of the people

906
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,580
That are counting on us,go whine somewhere else!

907
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,620
President David Palmer recommissioned these servers

908
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,890
Because he felt it was vital to national security!

909
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
President Palmer made the call!

910
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,830
Is that going to be good enough for you?!

911
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,300
Answer me!

912
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
Yes.

913
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,860
There's something really wrong with him.

914
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,490
He said president Palmer.

915
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,190
He meant taylor.

916
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,330
He said it twice.

917
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,860
What is this now?

918
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,890
Probably a fuse.

919
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,300
Here,you do what you can to finish up.

920
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,470
I'm gonna go check the box.

921
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,050
Jibraan!

922
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,520
Hamid?

923
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Jibra...

924
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,760
Hamid?

925
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,600
Keep your mouth shut and no one gets hurt.

926
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,530
- Who are you? What do you want? - Shut up!

927
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,670
What did you do to my brother?

928
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,900
- Hamid! - One more word,

929
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,870
I put a bullet in your brain.

930
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,870
Understand?

931
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,770
- You understand?! - Yes!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
