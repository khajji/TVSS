00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,281
That was bob cornell at nsa.    

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,317
    They've detected            
another firewall breach.        

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,419
 There's been another attack?   

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:23,188
 Not yet, but they believe the  
 cip device is being utilized.  

7
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:26,959
We have to assume dubaku        
is initiating another attack.   

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,528
        Madam president.        
        What is it, tim?        

9
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,963
I've just been forwarded        
    a scrambled call.           

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,765
                      It's from 
                colonel dubaku. 

11
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,600
                 He's demanding 
             to speak with you. 

12
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,834
 The deadline for your forces   

13
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,536
To begin their withdrawal       
          has passed.           

14
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,771
    Go to the window.           

15
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,005
    See what you have done.     

16
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,542
    Comply with my demands      
    within the hour,            

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,744
Or 10,000 more americans        
        will die.               

18
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,616
     She's on her way up.       

19
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,217
 I'll call you when it's done.  

20
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,653
Mr. Taylor,                     
are you okay?                   

21
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,257
        (groans)                

22
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,163
        (grunts)                

23
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,300
Audio forensics                 
cleaned up the recording.       

24
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,502
Nichols (over computer):        
     walker is extraneous.      

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,339
 Kill her before you get here.  

26
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,773
Larry, I don't think            
it's worth it.                  

27
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:15,808
There's nothing here.           

28
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:16,975
            All right. Fine,    

29
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,310
          Help janis coordinate 
                      with nsa. 

30
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,545
I'm sorry                       
about renee.                    

31
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,746
She was a good agent.           

32
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,048
         We don't know          
     that she's dead yet!       

33
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,883
     I've devoted my life       
         to the bureau          

34
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,318
            And you just expect 
                  me to believe 

35
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,087
That the entire government's    
                been corrupted. 

36
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,455
             Jack:              
     <i>not all of them.</i>           

37
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,990
  But until we find out who,    
    we can't trust anyone.      

38
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,926
      And the four of you       
really think you can stop this? 

39
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,928
                    We have to. 

40
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,063
        It's as simple as that. 

41
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,298
Dubaku wants you and your wife. 

42
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:40,332
    That's the deal.            

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,434
    You're asking us            
    to risk our lives           

44
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,370
        To be delivered into    
                dubaku's hands. 

45
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,005
      Listen to him, ule.       

46
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,973
But how can we                  
trust this man?                 

47
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,008
                        Because 

48
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,176
He has no reason                
to lie.                         

49
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,378
        Nichols:                
how are you doing, tony?        

50
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,412
          All right.            

51
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,680
                      Buchanan: 
            where's emerson?    

52
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:55,681
          He's dead.            

53
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:56,815
You want matobo                 
or not?                         

54
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,452
        (gunshot)               

55
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:05,891
  You got what you came for.    

56
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,128
Now, get the hell               
out of here.                    

57
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,596
  Did everything go smoothly?   

58
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,598
     We have the matobos,       
     that's what matters.       

59
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,933
I heard about the planes        
         on the radio.          

60
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,803
        The white house         
    still has not complied.     

61
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,771
What do you intend to do?       

62
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,739
Exactly what we promised.       

63
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,774
We're ready, sir.               

64
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,108
             Where's the target 
                    located?    

65
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,777
Kidron, ohio.                   

66
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,812
                 Population?    
30,000.                         

67
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,080
Casualties will be high.        

68
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,582
            Begin.              

69
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,262
                         Larry. 

70
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,331
  We think this is the truck    
 the matobos were abducted in.  

71
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,667
        Where was this          
         image taken?           

72
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,668
                Near northwoods 
                      airfield. 

73
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,803
         Were you able          
         to track it?           

74
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,037
        Not beyond this sector. 

75
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,806
          But they were heading 
    east on mckinley avenue.    

76
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,040
All right.                      
Make sure the vehicle I.D.      

77
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,875
        Is disseminated         
      to all search teams       

78
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,310
      And local agencies.       
Yes, sir.                       

79
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,146
     Larry, I think I found     
        something.              
Yeah?                           

80
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,816
 I've been working nsa, trying  
 to back-trace the cip attack   

81
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,084
That took down the two planes.  

82
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,919
  And I found a code fragment   

83
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,755
Which I think could be residue  
    from the cip intrusion.     

84
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,223
I'm running a pattern           
match right now.                

85
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,558
With any luck at all,           

86
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,727
We may be able to anticipate    
    where in the infrastructure 

87
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:15,828
They're targeting next.         

88
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,995
And I need sean.                

89
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,597
             Janis, I don't want
             to waste personnel 

90
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,965
      On some wild-goose chase. 

91
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,734
    Dubaku's threatened to kill 
          10,000 more americans 

92
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,968
                 In the next 30 
                    minutes.    

93
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,169
      I understand that,        

94
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,938
      And I will drop it        
the minute it feels cold.       

95
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,040
        All right, I'm going to 
         brief the white house. 
        Keep me in the loop.    

96
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,109
    Sean.                       

97
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,349
Are you sure he's up to running 
        this operation?         

98
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,351
                Larry's fine.   
        Is he?                  

99
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,687
  You're the one who told me    
     about him and renee.       

100
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,689
This has got to be hitting      
him pretty hard.                

101
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,358
    If I don't think            
     larry can do his job,      

102
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,760
      I'll let you know,        
          all right?            

103
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,796
     In the meantime, I need you
     to open up a fresh socket. 

104
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,772
        (phone ringing)         

105
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,108
        (phone ringing)         

106
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,113
      (ringing continues)       

107
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,250
        Gedge's voice:          
        you've reached          
      agent brian gedge.        

108
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,285
    Please leave a message      
and I'll get back to you.       

109
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,287
             (beep)             
          agent gedge,          

110
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,690
  I expected to hear from you   
            by now.             

111
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,858
It's urgent that I speak        
with the first gentleman        

112
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,260
     As soon as possible.       

113
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,228
    (intercom beeps)            

114
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,064
  Call me back, agent gedge.    

115
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,799
 This is extremely important.   

116
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,801
             Yes?               

117
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,469
          Secretary:            
larry moss with the fbi.        

118
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,737
     Where are we, larry?       

119
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,072
    We've I.D.'d a vehicle      

120
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,907
That we believe was used        
  in the matobos' abduction.    

121
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,375
      We're still trying        
    to track it down.           

122
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,177
     And how long is that       
        going to take?          

123
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,245
 I wish I could tell you, sir.  
  I don't have a time frame.    

124
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,247
That's not good enough, larry.  

125
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,017
 Unless you get some results,   
 we're going to get hit again.  

126
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,652
            A lot of people are 
                going to die    

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,986
                If you don't    
                find dubaku.    

128
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,321
         With all respect, sir, 

129
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,989
        I don't need to be told 
            what's at stake.    

130
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,691
We're giving everything we can. 

131
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,393
    One of our agents           
      has given her life.       

132
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,062
  Yes, I was told about that.   

133
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,164
    I'm... I'm sorry.           

134
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll call you the minute        
      we have something.        

135
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,068
    We'll be waiting.           

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,640
        (sighs):                
            god....             

137
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,080
Chloe:                          
the matobos have been taken     
into a building.                

138
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,582
          546 adams.            

139
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,650
Okay, pull up the stats         
on that address.                
                          On it.

140
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
It's the ritter building,       
      four stories high.        

141
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,489
The building                    
is two years old.               

142
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,190
  Give me the security specs.   
Give me a minute.               

143
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,760
    We're coming up on it.      

144
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,829
I'm going to need               
your help.                      

145
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,100
        (beeping)               

146
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,655
                I see you've    
            chosen a target.    

147
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,657
    The boyd chemical plant     
      near kidron, ohio.        

148
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,393
                 The cip device 
                 has enabled us 

149
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,262
             To take control of 
                 the main tank. 

150
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,597
We're about to cause the        
primary safety valves to fail.  

151
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,808
 Do you remember the last time  
    we saw each other, ule?     

152
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,312
It was at a state dinner        
      in your residence.        

153
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,482
We shared an excellent          
bottle of wine.                 

154
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,150
    I offered my hand           
         in friendship          

155
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,987
  And you... Slapped it away.   

156
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,923
  You gave me an ultimatum--    

157
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,958
    To be the puppet            
      for your military.        

158
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,960
You could have had a long       
     and prosperous career      

159
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,695
      As prime minister.        

160
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,197
But now you're going back       
          to sangala            

161
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,465
 As a traitor to your people.   

162
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,300
     I am prime minister.       

163
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,135
 I was elected by the people.   

164
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,070
    It's you and juma           
     who are the traitors.      

165
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,845
No.                             

166
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,980
 We brought order to sangala,   

167
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,149
But you are trying              
to destroy                      

168
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,817
Everything                      
that we've built.               

169
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,024
     You'll be taken back       
    to sangala, ule,            

170
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,393
And you will give               
general juma                    

171
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,695
    The names of all            
     your fellow traitors.      

172
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,730
     I will never do that.      

173
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,599
            Never.              

174
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,707
            Hmm...              

175
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,743
     Believe me, you will.      

176
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,880
          Take them.            

177
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:37,056
Any response                    
from the president?             

178
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,791
    Not yet.                    

179
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,726
But once she sees               
dead americans                  

180
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,996
Lying in the street,            
she will be less stubborn.      

181
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,944
    I'm inside, jack,           
  approaching the front desk.   

182
00:07:59,012 --> 00:08:00,379
          Copy that.            

183
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,350
        Are the motobos         
still on the third floor?       

184
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,818
      Affirmative, jack.        

185
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,753
     They're being moved.       
 I'm just not sure where yet.   

186
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,954
          Copy that.            

187
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,797
            Good afternoon.     

188
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,733
            I'm agent walker    
                  with the fbi. 

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,701
                I don't have    
                an appointment, 

190
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,737
But I'm here to see             
mr. Roane of roane              
and associates.                 

191
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,872
I'll let them know you're here. 
            Actually, I don't   
        want to be announced.   

192
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,374
 I'm here on official business. 

193
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,641
          All right.            

194
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,076
So as far as you're concerned,  

195
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,212
 I was never here, understand?  

196
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,180
Yes, ma'am.                     

197
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:39,818
Past security.                  

198
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,353
Heading toward                  
the elevator.                   

199
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,123
            We're on our way to 
          the service entrance. 

200
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,835
Chloe, I'm on the third floor.  

201
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,170
Law firm is                     
on your left.                   

202
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,439
On your right is a suite        
of offices where matobo's       

203
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,573
          Being held.           

204
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,808
        I see it.               

205
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,877
 Stairwell's down the hallway   
         to your left.          

206
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,961
        (hissing)               

207
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,963
Agent walker, we're at the door.

208
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,673
There's one guard outside       
  the suite, probably armed.    

209
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,414
  Bill, take the third floor.   

210
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,682
      Wait for my signal.       

211
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,555
                 Go on.         

212
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,503
Chloe, we're on the fourth floor

213
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,171
      In what used to be        
      the computer room.        

214
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,207
                 What now?      
In the center                   
of the room                     

215
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,975
There are two                   
removable panels.               

216
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,710
This should give you            
access to the crawlspace.       

217
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,512
            Copy that.          

218
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,962
             Okay, we're clear. 
                      Let's go. 

219
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,749
                      We're in. 

220
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,130
  I should never have allowed   
     you to come with me.       

221
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,132
    It was a mistake.           

222
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,635
It was not your decision, ule.  

223
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,708
     We will be all right.      

224
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,844
                Jack bauer will 
                  be here soon. 

225
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,651
Okay.                           

226
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,919
We're at the heating unit.      

227
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,153
          Okay, jack,           
      there's an airduct        

228
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,822
    Leading off that unit;      
        do you see it?          

229
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,490
             Yeah.              

230
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,359
Follow that for about 30 yards  

231
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,793
         Until you see          
    an electrical junction.     

232
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,795
         Make a left,           
     then another 20 yards      

233
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,963
You'll come to the vent.        

234
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,499
This will give you a view       
of the entire floor.            

235
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,667
    And the matobos?            

236
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,836
They've been moved              
into a adjacent room            

237
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,004
Just off the main area.         

238
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,171
            Okay, copy that.    

239
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,507
        Come on.                

240
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,976
             Sean:              
    the entire nsa has been     
     combing the firewall       

241
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,212
         Searching for the next 
             cip device breach. 

242
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,646
    If this were something,     
        don't you think         

243
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,781
 They'd already know about it?  

244
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,616
    I can live without your     
    negativity today, sean.     

245
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,720
      There it is again,        
that same code fragment.        

246
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,291
                "kidron, ohio." 
        what's in kidron, ohio? 

247
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,359
Any sensitive installations?    

248
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,594
Something dubaku                
might want to hit?              

249
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,595
                 I don't know.  

250
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,330
Homeland has a high-value       

251
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,732
    Target database;            
  I'm cross-checking it now.    

252
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,103
          Okay. Okay,           
nothing in kidron itself,       

253
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,439
    But in the neighboring      
    county there's...           

254
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,074
                  Boyd chemical.
Boyd chemical.                  
What do they make?              

255
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,009
            Insecticide. Please 
            get me that number. 

256
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,484
            Hello?              

257
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,987
  This is janis gold at fbi.    
        I need to speak         

258
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,157
     To your plant manager      
     immediately, please.       

259
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,392
    Ma'am, as I just stated     
    I'm with the fbi.           

260
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,429
    Does that sound vaguely     
    important to you?           

261
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,431
                Now, connect me 
            to john brunner.    

262
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,638
  Fbi? Uh, yeah, put her on.    

263
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,008
     This is john brunner.      

264
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,076
    Janis (on phone):           
            hello.              

265
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,178
         Mr. Brunner,           
this is janis gold, fbi,        

266
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,312
         D.C. Bureau.           

267
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,580
    What can I do for you?      

268
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,048
      We've been tracking       
         some possible          

269
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,249
  Breaches in the government    
        firewall.               

270
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,752
    The firewall's designed     
to protect installations        

271
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,420
         Like yours...          
  I know what it does, honey.   

272
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,456
      Um, we have tracked       

273
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,391
         And isolated           
     one of these breaches      

274
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,559
In the kidron area.             

275
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,194
I need to know                  
are you experiencing            

276
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,729
Any problems right now?         

277
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,997
As a matter of fact, we're      
dealing with one right now.     

278
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:21,734
          What is it?           
             Three of our safety
              valves just failed

279
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,402
 On the primary storage tank.   

280
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,937
     We're having trouble       
        resetting them.         

281
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,406
What's in that tank?            
              Methyl isocyanate.

282
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,942
              It's concentrated 
     insecticide, highly toxic. 

283
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,744
    Can you-- what the hell     
      is this all about?        

284
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,381
  Mr. Brunner, I have reason    

285
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,749
        To believe that         
  this is a terrorist attack    

286
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,984
    On your facility.           

287
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,252
    Terrorist attack?           

288
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,687
            Yes, sir, I need    
                you to initiate 

289
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,122
              On-site emergency 
                     procedures 

290
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,390
         And stay on this line. 

291
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,592
      Shut down the tank.       

292
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,127
        What's going on?        
         Do it! Do it!          

293
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,228
         My authority.          

294
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,565
                        Damn.   
          What is it?           

295
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,668
      It's not responding.      
What do you mean?               
Try it again.                   

296
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,637
        Nothing.                

297
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,443
                Pressure in the 
        primary tank is rising. 

298
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,714
        Son of a bitch.         
          Mr. Brunner?          

299
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:10,883
            We cannot shut down 
            the primary tank    

300
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,685
            And the pressure    
                is building.    

301
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,753
              If we cannot stop 
        this, we are looking    

302
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,955
    At atmospheric release.     

303
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,957
                 Okay.          

304
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,125
          Get larry.            

305
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,994
      Dubaku has targeted       
        that facility.          

306
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,562
            We need to alert    
                 the president. 

307
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,764
         Mr. Brunner,           

308
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,834
 You need to begin evacuating   
    people right now.           

309
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,015
    All right, agent moss,      
    keep me apprised.           

310
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,150
 I'll speak to the president.   

311
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,585
        I just received         
     an interagency alert.      

312
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,954
        The fbi just discovered 
          dubaku's next target. 

313
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,089
    A chemical plant, yeah.     

314
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:51,990
I just got off the phone        
    with larry moss.            

315
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,325
                 I need to brief
                 the president. 

316
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,561
Has the first gentleman         
spoken with the president?      

317
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,229
                  Not yet.      

318
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,631
        I talked to agent gedge 
                40 minutes ago. 

319
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,967
Mr. Taylor is                   
the only person who             
can talk the president          

320
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,635
Into withdrawing                
our troops in sangala.          

321
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,571
And that is our best way        
    to prevent this attack.     

322
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,805
            I know we need him. 

323
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,273
 I'm waiting for a call back.   

324
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,976
  The middle section's still    
 bothering me; read it again.   

325
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,445
                        Angela: 
        "colonel dubaku and the 
        juma regime have killed 

326
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,381
     "countless thousands       
     of their own people,       

327
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,249
    "and now hundreds           
    of our fellow citizens.     

328
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:20,252
      They deserve your prayers 
             and your outrage." 

329
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,021
  I think the word "outrage"    
      might be too strong       

330
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,622
            If you're trying    
                      to convey 

331
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,757
Calm authority.                 

332
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,258
  "outrage" is the only word    

333
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,160
 To describe how I'm feeling,   
     and how every person       

334
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,495
In this country will be feeling.

335
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,263
      The american people       
      deserve the truth.        

336
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,199
Dubaku's already                
killed 300 americans.           

337
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,535
God knows what else             
he has planned.                 

338
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,736
      (knocking on door)        

339
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:38,937
        Come in.                

340
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,009
 Could you excuse us, angela?   

341
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,217
            What is it?         

342
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,153
    The fbi believes            
    they've detected            

343
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,354
     Where the next attack      
    will take place.            

344
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,159
        Dubaku's infiltrated    
            a chemical plant    

345
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,727
                Just outside of 
                  kidron, ohio. 

346
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,896
He's causing the pressure       
    on the facility's           

347
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,397
 Primary tank to go critical.   

348
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,000
If the tank erupts,             
over 3,000 gallons              

349
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,069
Of methyl isocyanate will       
be released into the atmosphere.

350
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,137
  Given the prevailing winds,   

351
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,573
                  A very large, 
            very toxic cloud    

352
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,908
Will sweep into town.           

353
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,643
              Methyl isocyanate 

354
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,278
Is a concentrated insecticide.  

355
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,680
      Even brief exposure       
causes severe lung damage       

356
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,682
             And chemical burns 
                of the skin.    

357
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,217
    What's our time frame?      

358
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,985
    The tank could rupture      
in less than 15 minutes.        

359
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,721
They've begun evacuating?       

360
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,556
        We've already contacted 
        emergency responders    

361
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,857
On the ground in kidron.        

362
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,492
It's just not enough time       
     to get everyone out.       

363
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,696
     Kidron's population's      
    just over 30,000.           

364
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,432
This projection says that       

365
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,368
    We could lose over 50%?     

366
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,673
    Oh, dear lord...            

367
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,609
Ethan:                          
right now, our only chance      
of stopping this                

368
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,445
    Is finding dubaku           
      and the cip device.       

369
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,121
    You ready?                  

370
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,956
      Quietly.                  

371
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,290
      Chloe (on earwig):        
jack, I just intercepted        

372
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,260
An fbi alert identifying        
     dubaku's next target.      

373
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,995
A chemical plant                
near kidron, ohio,              

374
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,064
12 minutes from going           
critical. There are 30,000      

375
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,366
  People in that town, jack.    
    We have to hurry.           

376
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,101
        Jack (quietly):         
          copy that.            

377
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,937
    Give me the scope           
        out of the bag.         

378
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,141
         (bag unzips)           

379
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,858
         Turning scope          
     over to night-vision.      

380
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,930
      I don't see dubaku.       

381
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,967
We've got nichols.              

382
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,869
Three men with                  
automatic weapons.              

383
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,572
Three more over                 
at the control station,         
most likely armed.              

384
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,307
          Copy that.            

385
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,844
That's dubaku.                  

386
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,113
We got dubaku.                  

387
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,514
  Chloe, are you seeing this?   

388
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,551
Yes. The control station        
looks like an s-dart.           

389
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,919
's a really                     
powerful processor.             

390
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,722
             It could be driving
                 the cip device.
 Copy.                          

391
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:12,157
    Nsa's classified            
      infrastructure team       

392
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,626
Is trying to plug               
the firewall breach.            
        Any luck so far?        

393
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,729
          None so far,          
but they're staying on it.      
             They have less than

394
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,263
    Ten minutes left.           
     They're aware of that, sir,

395
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,099
    But they're doing           
        what they can.          

396
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:21,266
    Not now.                    

397
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,501
What's going on                 
at the plant?                   

398
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,602
          I'm on with them now. 

399
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,972
              John? Did you try 

400
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,707
Flashing the memory cards?      
         (alarm blares)         

401
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,142
        Brunner:                
      three times, honey.       

402
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,211
     We're not in control       
    of the computer system.     

403
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,646
  I've already told my people   
 to get the hell out of here.   

404
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,248
              Normally, I don't 
                allow people    

405
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,350
        To call me "honey," but 
     we can discuss that later. 

406
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,220
     Yeah, well, it sounds      
 like you need to lighten up.   

407
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,821
(alarm continues blaring)       
          good, good.           

408
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,257
          I'm heading           
to the primary tank room.       

409
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,326
 I'm going to try to manually   

410
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,460
                Release some    
            of the pressure.    

411
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,762
 That's not going to stop it.   

412
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,997
    No, but it might buy us     

413
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,700
      A few more minutes        
    so people can evacuate.     

414
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:57,002
  I've got a thousand workers   
    at this facility.           

415
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,104
     And I am responsible       

416
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,273
    For their safety.           
         (door buzzes)          

417
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,842
 Now look, I need you to stay   
         on the phone.          

418
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,811
I'm going                       
to need some help.              
                     Absolutely.

419
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,680
                  What can I do?
I don't have access             

420
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,715
  To the override schematics.   

421
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,016
    See if you can pull up      

422
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,052
The operating procedures        
         for tank one.          

423
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,654
Yeah, yeah, yeah.               
I got it.                       

424
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,656
      I got it right here.      
        All right.              

425
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,725
        Now look                
    for the emergency valve     

426
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:21,660
    Release sequence.           

427
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,195
    Okay.                       

428
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,330
             Uh, valve release. 
          I have it right here. 

429
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,570
          This, wait,           
    this procedure is going     

430
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,906
 To release the chemical right  

431
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,075
  Into the primary tank room    
where you are right now.        

432
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,309
         I know that.           

433
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,044
  I have respiratory gear on.   

434
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:41,447
         I'll be okay,          
  just give me the sequence.    

435
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,550
              But how long will 
              that protect you? 

436
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,251
 Don't worry about it, honey.   

437
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,222
     Uh, okay.                  

438
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,858
Are you looking                 
at the routing board?           
             I am.              

439
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:54,226
        Go ahead.               

440
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,228
        Set the bus switches    

441
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:59,565
            To this sequence    
            from left to right: 

442
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,567
                            Two.
              Two.              

443
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,768
                          Eight.
             Eight.             

444
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:04,770
                          Seven.
             Seven.             

445
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:06,071
                        Four.   
             Four.              

446
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:07,940
                          Three.
             Three.             

447
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,242
             Done.              

448
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,177
The secondary flow valve        

449
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,880
Should be behind you            
and to your right.              

450
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,816
             I need you to turn 
         that clockwise please. 

451
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,089
        (steam hissing)         

452
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,591
        (grunts)                

453
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,560
          All right.            
     All right, I got it.       

454
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,030
 Okay, that's one valve down,   

455
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:32,264
    Three more to go.           

456
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,166
          (groaning)            

457
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,874
          (coughing)            

458
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,376
     (electronic beeping)       

459
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,146
Pressure inside the tank        
    is approaching 400 psi.     

460
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,847
        How long before         
      the tank ruptures?        

461
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,416
Seven minutes.                  

462
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,617
                    Nichols:    
        we've got a problem.    

463
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:53,385
         What is it?            
                    An alert.   

464
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,654
Our hidden surveillance camera  
         on the roof.           

465
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,990
             Almeida and bauer. 

466
00:20:58,058 --> 00:20:59,258
     When was this taken?       

467
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,592
        20 minutes ago.         

468
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,662
     I thought you killed       
      almeida and bauer?        

469
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,631
Damn it! You said               
this location                   

470
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,232
Was kept secret                 
from everyone!                  
                 It was.        

471
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,801
Then what are they doing here?! 

472
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,235
                I don't know.   
     How did they find us?!     

473
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,403
         I don't know!          

474
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,138
            600 psi and rising. 

475
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:16,809
         (low beeping)          

476
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,479
Disengage the cip module.       

477
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:21,547
Begin the offload.              

478
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,419
            What are you doing? 
            We're almost there. 

479
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:30,322
 We will continue this attack   
    from another location.      

480
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:33,792
Let's finish this.              

481
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,827
            We can handle them. 

482
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,695
We need to get out of here now. 

483
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,432
 The cip module's disengaged,   
      starting off load.        

484
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,301
             Sean:              
  hey, what the hell is that?   

485
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,736
        What the hell is that?! 

486
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,337
      What's the matter?        

487
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,875
The firewall breach just closed.

488
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,877
Larry:                          
what?!                          

489
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:53,045
  What are you talking about?   

490
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:55,948
    No cip intrusion,           
    the firewall is secure.     

491
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,317
         How? Nsa?              

492
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,618
         I don't know.          

493
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:00,853
     Bring the cip module.      

494
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,222
Get motobo and his wife!        

495
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,125
             Bill, we should go 

496
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,559
With the second option          
on the assault.                 

497
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,029
Two-prong attack. You and tony  
come through the main entrance. 

498
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,497
     We'll go in from here.     
        Copy.                   

499
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,500
                 Give me the c4 
                 out of the bag.

500
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:39,958
                    Go!         

501
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:48,834
             Move.              

502
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:51,203
                          Move! 

503
00:22:51,271 --> 00:22:52,805
        (gunshot)               

504
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,893
            Get the cip device! 

505
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:29,942
            Clear!              

506
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,781
     All clear over here!       
          Get dubaku?           

507
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,249
        Negative!               

508
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,553
Jack, I've got the cip device.  

509
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:43,288
     It's been destroyed.       

510
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:45,424
    Jack, it's renee.           
     The motobos are safe.      

511
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,692
  I'm taking them to the van.   

512
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,127
     Copy that. I want you      

513
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,896
    And bill to do a sweep.     
  See if you can find dubaku.   

514
00:23:50,964 --> 00:23:52,331
  I'll cover the south side.    

515
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,678
John? John, are you still there?

516
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,781
        (weakly)                
             yeah.              

517
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:09,848
      John, listen to me.       

518
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,050
    The terrorists are out      
        of the system.          

519
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,552
Please tell me what is happening
          right now.            

520
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,754
        (steam hissing)         

521
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:21,927
    Automatic shutdown mode     
        has kicked in.          

522
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,729
     Pressure's dropping.       

523
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,132
    I think we're gonna be      
          all right.            

524
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,567
      Okay, that's great.       

525
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,070
Now you-you gotta get out       
      of there right now.       

526
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,405
      (labored breathing)       

527
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,710
        (coughs)                

528
00:24:37,777 --> 00:24:39,144
             John?              

529
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:41,080
      (labored breathing)       

530
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:43,816
I can't make the door...        

531
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,417
 I'm sending the rescue team.   

532
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,752
A rescue team                   
is on its way.                  

533
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,420
                John, please    
                stay with me.   

534
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,222
                  Stay with me. 

535
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,393
      (people clamoring)        

536
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,649
    Have they found dubaku?     

537
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,118
Still searching.                

538
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,653
            Renee:              
first responders are five       
      minutes away, jack.       

539
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:22,788
          Copy that.            

540
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:33,098
            Get up.             

541
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,202
(gasping)                       
             I said get up!     

542
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,506
         (whimpering)           

543
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:56,088
          (quietly):            
        they're coming.         

544
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:58,924
Please don't make               
me do this.                     

545
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:01,960
I will go to your home, michael.

546
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,929
I'll make you wife watch        

547
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,097
                      As I kill 
                 your daughter, 

548
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:06,331
                And then I will 
                      kill her. 

549
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,233
                So do as I ask. 

550
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,536
    Save your family.           

551
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,923
    Let me see your hands!      

552
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,391
                It's latham.    

553
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,693
    Where's dubaku?!            

554
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,994
          I'm sorry.            

555
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:39,498
    (device beeping)            

556
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:40,733
            Cover!              

557
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,774
          Tony! Bill!           

558
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:51,210
Yeah!                           
                  You all right?

559
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,611
                          Jack? 

560
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,546
             Jack?              

561
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,182
    Jack, can you hear me?      

562
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,317
    Yeah, yeah, we're okay.     

563
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,318
                 What happened? 

564
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:02,054
    Latham was wired            
    with explosives.            

565
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,556
  We still don't have dubaku.   

566
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:05,624
             What?              

567
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,626
                 The cip device 
            has been destroyed. 

568
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,395
             I want you to stay 
              with the motobos. 

569
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:10,496
        Make sure they're safe. 

570
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,630
     (sirens approaching)       

571
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,065
Jack the police are almost here.

572
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,401
If you get arrested,            
this entire operation           
goes out the window.            

573
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,369
 You have to get out of there.  
                      Copy that.

574
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:19,905
He's gone.                      
                    Buchanan:   
             we need to get back
              to the safe house.

575
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,507
Let's go.                       

576
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:24,109
     (sirens approaching)       

577
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,522
Sean, this stays both nsa       
and homeland have no idea       

578
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,791
Why the breach at the kidron    
plant was stopped.              

579
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:39,792
         They're still looking. 

580
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,660
We're working on it here also.  

581
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,028
     Janis is coordinating      
 with a digital forensics team  

582
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,363
That she sent over to the plant.

583
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,532
 This doesn't make any sense.   

584
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,500
Why... Why would dubaku suddenly
        stop an attack          

585
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,903
When he was minutes away        
 from causing mass casualties?  

586
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,238
 Maybe there was a malfunction  
      in the cip device.        

587
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:55,407
 No, no, I don't want maybes,   
  all right? I want answers.    

588
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:56,875
We're doing everything we can,  
             sir.               

589
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,178
    That's not good enough      
      right now, is it?!        

590
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,680
    I don't know what else      
    to tell you, sir.           

591
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,949
            I know you're upset 
                about renee,    

592
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,719
But getting angry at me is not  
going to make it go any faster. 

593
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,987
If you think I'm yelling at you 
     because of my history      

594
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,956
      With agent walker,        
    you are mistaken.           

595
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,758
 There are thousands of lives   
        at stake here.          

596
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,126
That's what concerns me.        

597
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,529
          Sorry, sir.           

598
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:21,066
I want you and janis            
to work with nsa.               

599
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,936
Find out where that cip device  
is being used.                  

600
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:26,772
    If we find the device,      
        we find dubaku.         

601
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,654
    I appreciate the call.      
         Thanks a lot.          

602
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,623
Janis, larry wants              
you to interface with nsa.      

603
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:47,860
See if you can back-trace       
that cip code fragment          
to its source.                  

604
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,461
        I'll try.               

605
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,497
Who were you talking to?        

606
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:53,966
 The head of the response team  
         at the plant.          

607
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:55,401
    What did he say?            

608
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:56,835
    Facility's clean.           

609
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:59,071
A trace amount of the chemical  
 was released, but not enough   

610
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,939
    To do any damage,           
and the site has been secured.  

611
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,107
         That's good.           

612
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,475
What about                      
the plant manager?              

613
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:04,743
         John brunner.          

614
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:06,245
          Is he okay?           

615
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:07,846
              No.               

616
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,415
                    Will you do 
                    me a favor? 

617
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:10,749
          It depends.           

618
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,584
    I'd like to track down      
     mr. Brunner's family.      

619
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:13,919
I was the last one              
to speak with him,              

620
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,455
  And I feel they should know   
    how brave he was.           

621
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:17,756
I'll see what I can find.       

622
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,191
                     Thank you. 

623
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,960
Janis, before you start         
sending flowers,                

624
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,263
  You need to find out where    
that cip device was being used. 

625
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,832
      I know. I'm on it.        

626
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,384
Cleanup crews                   
are already on site             

627
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:47,453
And we're continuing            
our evacuation of               
a one-mile radius               

628
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,821
Around the chemical plant.      

629
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,089
                    Casualties? 

630
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,557
There was, in fact,             
one casualty,                   

631
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:52,591
             The plant manager. 

632
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:54,360
            13 other workers    
            are being treated   

633
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:56,795
             For chemical burns 
                 and inhalation 
                of toxic fumes. 

634
00:29:56,863 --> 00:29:59,498
         And there haven't been 
        any other intrusions    
            in the firewall?    

635
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:01,266
No, ma'am.                      

636
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:03,002
     It appears the crisis      
    has been averted.           

637
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:04,536
Except that no one's been able  

638
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,271
  To explain how the firewall   
    break disengaged.           

639
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,639
        Not yet.                

640
00:30:07,707 --> 00:30:10,342
    The fbi has no idea how     
it happened... It just happened.

641
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,212
                 And that's not 
                 an explanation.

642
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,047
Perhaps dubaku was firing       
     another warning shot.      

643
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:17,316
No, dubaku's already down       
          two planes.           

644
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:19,084
        He's not afraid         
      to take more lives.       

645
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:22,187
         In any event,          
    we should be grateful.      

646
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,656
I'm not one to accept good news 

647
00:30:24,724 --> 00:30:26,425
         Unless I know          
     where it comes from.       

648
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:30,796
  Until we have more answers,   
I want to maintain alert levels.

649
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:31,797
         (phone rings)          

650
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:33,032
                    Yes?        

651
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,501
    Madam president, I have     
  admiral smith on line two.    

652
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:38,904
    Put him through.            
        Thank you, tim.         

653
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:40,639
        Admiral?                

654
00:30:40,707 --> 00:30:45,110
I've been trying to reach agent 
gedge, and he hasn't picked up. 

655
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,579
     Yes, I'm sure I have       
    the right number.           

656
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:49,815
      I just spoke to him       
    over an hour ago.           

657
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:52,584
He said he was outside          
samantha roth's apartment       

658
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:54,086
Waiting for the first gentleman.

659
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:57,423
            (sighs)             
        just find him.          

660
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,460
        I don't care who you    
        have to pull off shift. 

661
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:02,895
Still can't reach gedge.        

662
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:05,431
The secret service doesn't know 
      where he is either.       

663
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:09,968
            (sighs)             
 I need to tell the president.  

664
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,236
  Maybe you should hold off.    

665
00:31:11,304 --> 00:31:12,938
  The domestic threat's been    
        lifted for now          

666
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,107
And she's on the phone          
with admiral smith.             

667
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:20,112
              I can't authorize 
                the air strikes 

668
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,114
        Until our post-invasion 
            plans are in place. 

669
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:26,418
Finding a politically viable    
replacement, until that happens,

670
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:29,822
You need to keep                
your forces at full readiness.  

671
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,358
    The joint chiefs            
    are getting impatient.      

672
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:36,362
Madam president, we need        
  to talk about your husband.   

673
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,767
          His theory            
    about your son's death,     

674
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,969
He hasn't let it go.            

675
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,638
  What are you talking about?   

676
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:49,541
      He's been harassing       
      roger's girlfriend,       

677
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:53,912
     Accusing her of complicity 
         in the death of roger. 

678
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,214
Henry and I went over it        

679
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,749
                Again and again 
                  with the fbi, 

680
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:57,816
             And he swore to me 

681
00:31:57,884 --> 00:32:00,052
     He was past all that.      

682
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,187
  Well, he's found a private    
  investigator who's feeding    

683
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:03,389
    His conspiracy theory;      

684
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:05,457
            Taking advantage    
                        of him. 

685
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,794
            Please get henry    
                  on the phone. 

686
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:11,830
I'm afraid                      
I can't do that.                

687
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:14,800
     Henry's unreachable.       

688
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:17,903
      I don't understand.       

689
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,406
    Agent gedge hasn't been     
     answering his phone.       

690
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:24,176
            Now, I wouldn't get 
            too worried yet.    

691
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:27,646
You're telling me my husband's  
         gone missing?          

692
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:31,850
        Secret service          
      has put out an apb.       

693
00:32:31,918 --> 00:32:35,087
            They're going to    
          ms. Roth's apartment. 

694
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:39,458
         Whatever's going on, I 
     will find out soon enough. 

695
00:32:44,831 --> 00:32:48,500
  Secret service dispatcher:    
 this is a priority order code  
     charlie zero charlie.      

696
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:51,370
    We need an immediate 20     
        on agent gedge.         

697
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:53,505
         All available          
     field agents proceed       

698
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:56,975
  To his last known location:   
     404 wilkinson drive.       

699
00:32:57,043 --> 00:33:01,180
        I repeat:               
  code charlie zero charlie.    

700
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,916
        (phone ringing)         

701
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,424
      (ringing continues)       

702
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:29,942
      (phone snaps shut)        

703
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,868
    (breathes deeply)           

704
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:11,283
You're making a mistake.        

705
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,119
Think about it.                 

706
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,154
                    Shut up!    

707
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,188
You haven't killed              
anybody yet.                    

708
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:17,556
    You don't need              
      to do this.               

709
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,194
Gedge's plan to frame me        
    is already blown.           

710
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,630
If you kill me,                 

711
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:26,732
  They'll know it was murder,   

712
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,701
     And they'll trace it       
         back to you.           

713
00:34:31,771 --> 00:34:34,039
         (phone rings)          

714
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,611
        Go ahead.               

715
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,181
     Where's agent gedge?       
      I can't reach him.        

716
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,283
        Gedge is dead.          

717
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,484
        What happened?          

718
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:47,820
     Everything was going       
     according to plan...       

719
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:49,154
But something                   
went wrong.                     

720
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:51,290
Taylor killed gedge;            
I don't know how.               

721
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:53,625
        Where's mr. Taylor now? 

722
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:54,993
He's right here.                

723
00:34:55,061 --> 00:34:58,030
        Don't kill him,         
    bring him to me.            

724
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,298
        Yes, sir.               

725
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:17,116
         Prime minister matobo, 
    ma'am, please come with me. 

726
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,252
Chloe, pull up the ritter       
building on a satellite grid.   

727
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,155
Look for any sign of dubaku     
leaving the site.               

728
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:24,623
We've got to find him.          

729
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:26,992
It's going to take me 20 minutes
to task the satellite.          

730
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,427
     Then don't waste time      
    talking about it.           

731
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:30,929
              Pull up satellite 
              and traffic cams, 

732
00:35:30,997 --> 00:35:32,297
                 Street corners 
            and metro stations. 

733
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:33,332
What's the priority?            

734
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,167
 I can only do one thing        
    at a time.                  

735
00:35:35,235 --> 00:35:36,769
                      Satellite!
      Fine.                     

736
00:35:36,836 --> 00:35:38,203
Bill, we need to rethink this.  

737
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:39,605
              What do you mean? 

738
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:42,041
  You were set up to surveil    
an undercover operation.        

739
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,108
Your cover's been blown.        

740
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:44,510
The police are after us.        

741
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:47,312
We are not equipped to look for 
one man in a city of millions.  

742
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,014
We need additional              
resources.                      

743
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:50,182
    What are you suggesting?    

744
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,384
        It's time               
 to contact outside agencies.   

745
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,721
                The government? 
          Yes.                  

746
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,489
         I thought you said the 
government couldn't be trusted. 

747
00:35:57,557 --> 00:35:58,657
Right now,                      
we don't have a choice.         

748
00:35:58,725 --> 00:35:59,692
                    Almeida:    
        it can't be trusted.    

749
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,859
    We can't trust anybody,     

750
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:02,161
That's why we're working        
        on the outside.         

751
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:04,063
    President taylor            
        can be trusted.         

752
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,831
            I'm not questioning 
          that, prime minister. 

753
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,833
It's the people around her      
who can't be trusted.           

754
00:36:07,901 --> 00:36:10,235
  Mr. Buchanan, jack's right.   
         We need help.          

755
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:11,503
      It's too dangerous.       

756
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:14,006
We can limit the flow           
of information.                 

757
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:15,507
Prime minister matobo           
can get us past                 

758
00:36:15,575 --> 00:36:17,743
The president's outer circle--  
that way, we can at least       

759
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:19,011
Explain to her                  
why and what we're doing.       

760
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,079
Renee:                          
I think jack's right.           

761
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:21,947
    We left a lot of clues      
    in that building.           

762
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,215
    We're vulnerable;           
    we can't do this            

763
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:24,350
            On our own anymore. 

764
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:26,418
    Am I supposed to remain     
      in hiding with you,       

765
00:36:26,486 --> 00:36:27,820
  Pretend that my wife and I    

766
00:36:27,887 --> 00:36:29,788
        Are still being         
     held hostage or dead?      

767
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:33,592
    I need to return            
      to the white house        

768
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,661
  And help the president save   
  what's left of my country.    

769
00:36:35,729 --> 00:36:37,229
Let my husband do this.         

770
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:39,198
Let him call president taylor.  

771
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:41,300
    She will listen to him.     

772
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:49,441
Bill, you want to find          
dubaku, make the call.          

773
00:36:58,518 --> 00:37:00,619
          All right.            

774
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:01,987
    Get me the white house.     

775
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,094
Reporter: representatives       
      from boyd chemical        

776
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,696
Have assured local authorities  

777
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:12,831
That the immediate crisis       
          has passed.           

778
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,933
 However, this has done little  
      to calm the nerves        

779
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:17,770
Of the citizens of kidron, ohio,

780
00:37:17,837 --> 00:37:21,440
Many of whom have taken shelter 
  in neighboring communities.   

781
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:23,409
        Again, we have          
    confirmed one fatality      

782
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:24,777
Inside the plant itself.        

783
00:37:24,844 --> 00:37:26,912
13 others, all boyd employees,  

784
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,681
    Are being treated           
  at local medical centers...   

785
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,315
        (intercom beeps)        
                      yes?      

786
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:33,185
Madame president, I have prime  
minister matobo calling for you.

787
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,219
                Matobo?!        

788
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:35,220
          Yes, ma'am.           

789
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:36,555
             You're tracing it? 

790
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:39,058
  We tried, madame president,   
    but it's a secure line.     

791
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:40,859
            Put him through.    

792
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:43,162
             Prime minister?    

793
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:44,630
Yes, madame president.          

794
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:45,831
        Are you all right?      

795
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:47,666
      Thank god my wife and I   
          are both fine.        

796
00:37:47,734 --> 00:37:48,734
    We were rescued.            

797
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:50,235
        By whom?                

798
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:51,437
        Where are you?          

799
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:53,172
            In a safe place.    

800
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:57,376
        Madame president,       
    you need to listen to me.   

801
00:37:57,444 --> 00:38:00,679
The people who rescued us, they 
have acquired the cip device.   

802
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:02,147
    It has been destroyed,      

803
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:05,484
 And your country is no longer  
    under immediate threat.     

804
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:08,787
     Who are these people,      
and tell me how this happened.  

805
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,923
  I will tell you everything    
          in person,            

806
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,225
        But, uh,                
  this must happen privately.   

807
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:14,460
  I must speak to you alone.    

808
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:16,495
          Why alone?            

809
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:19,365
They will bring me to you,      
madame president.               

810
00:38:19,432 --> 00:38:21,166
 We will arrive in ten minutes. 

811
00:38:21,234 --> 00:38:22,901
I'll be waiting for you.        

812
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:27,439
 They tried to trace the call,  
      but the line held.        

813
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:33,112
Ethan, I need to see you        
          right now.            

814
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:42,321
    Yes, madame president?      

815
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:45,391
         I just spoke           
to prime minister matobo.       

816
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,126
            What?!              

817
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:48,293
          He's safe.            

818
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,895
      How? What happened?       

819
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:51,897
    He'll let us know           
      when he gets here.        

820
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,799
He's on his way now.            
He wants a private meeting.     

821
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:56,035
         Bring him in           
  through the south entrance,   

822
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:58,237
         And keep this          
 to as few people as possible.  

823
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,305
          All right.            

824
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:07,713
Jack, I've mapped a route       
  for you to the white house.   

825
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:08,814
      It's mostly side streets, 

826
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:10,282
              But there will be 
            fewer traffic cams. 

827
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,917
          Okay, good.           
     Send it to my phone.       

828
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:13,352
We're ready. Let's go.          

829
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,821
 As soon as we set the vehicle  
in front of the building,       

830
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,356
    Agent walker will move      
          mr. Matobo.           

831
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:18,857
                  Jack... Jack! 

832
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:20,359
             What?              

833
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:22,161
        I'm not going.          

834
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,330
  What are you talking about?   

835
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:27,132
    If the government           
gets their hands on tony,       

836
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,367
      They'll arrest him.       

837
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:29,968
        I already told you--    

838
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,805
I did some pretty bad things    
before I teamed up with bill.   

839
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:34,940
Tony, take it from me...        

840
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:37,076
     You need to deal with      
    the consequences.           

841
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:38,877
        And believe me, I will. 

842
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:40,779
                But not yet.    
        Not till we get dubaku. 

843
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,214
         I'm working on a lead. 

844
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,383
                 I've got a guy 
              on emerson's crew 

845
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,285
            Who might have some 
              intel we can use. 

846
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:47,553
Let him do this, jack.          

847
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,322
                He's the reason 
            we got this far.    

848
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,293
             Fine.              

849
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,729
But you give me your word       
as soon as this as over,        

850
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:58,030
You turn yourself in.           

851
00:39:58,098 --> 00:39:59,331
We'll stand behind you.         

852
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,435
                     All right, 
              you have my word. 

853
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:08,140
Good luck. Be careful.          

854
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:42,908
        (keys jangling)         

855
00:40:51,818 --> 00:40:52,951
      (knocking on door)        

856
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:01,960
                        Hey.    
         Hey.                   

857
00:41:02,028 --> 00:41:03,862
             I was on my way to 
             work, so I thought 

858
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,997
    I'd stop in and see you.    

859
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,699
I tried calling you earlier.    

860
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:08,167
          I'm sorry;            
        I've been busy.         

861
00:41:08,234 --> 00:41:10,336
      Are you all right?        
      You look exhausted.       

862
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:12,638
  It's just been a long day.    

863
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:14,940
      Well, I hope you're still 
        coming over for dinner. 

864
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,642
            I'm making lasagna. 

865
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,712
  And my sister promises not to 
 give you any more dirty looks. 

866
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,048
    You haven't forgotten,      
        have you?               

867
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:24,550
            No. No.             

868
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:26,685
    It's just that I've got     
  some business to attend to.   

869
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,954
  Samuel, you work too much.    

870
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:30,856
            Every time you come 
                into the diner, 

871
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:32,391
    You're always on the phone. 

872
00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:33,625
    I have to, maria,           

873
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:35,694
    So that, one day,           
  I can finally take you away   

874
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:37,329
     From that awful place      
    that you work in.           

875
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:39,398
         Well, we met           
     in that awful place.       

876
00:41:39,466 --> 00:41:40,566
             Don't forget that. 

877
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:43,869
             I'll see you later.
Okay.                           

878
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,817
        (line ringing)          

879
00:41:58,885 --> 00:41:59,818
        Vossler:                
        go ahead.               

880
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:01,520
Have you got mr. Taylor?        

881
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:03,722
             Yes.               
 I'm about three minutes away.  

882
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,759
    There's a korean grocer     
     opposite my building.      

883
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:09,061
         One of my men          
    will meet you out back.     

884
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:10,229
     Bring taylor inside.       

885
00:42:10,296 --> 00:42:12,398
 What are you gonna do to him?  

886
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:14,800
        Just make sure          
     you weren't followed.
