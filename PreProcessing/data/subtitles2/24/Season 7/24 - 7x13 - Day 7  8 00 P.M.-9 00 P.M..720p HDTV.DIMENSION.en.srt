Season 7 Episode 13

2
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:17,016
Mr. Burnett you are a traitor
and a terrorist.

3
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,717
<i>Where's the target?

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,785
Where's the target?!

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,453
(loud bang)

6
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,089
Take Mr. Bauer away.
He's under arrest.

7
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,157
Have you learned anything
else about the attack?

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,926
Renee Walker followed
a lead on her own.

9
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,794
Got a visual on a heavily
armed commando unit

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,363
lead by Juma himself.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,630
Bill Buchanan.

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,099
Renee Walker says the target
is the White House.

13
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,201
<i>BUCHANAN:
Condition red.

14
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,535
Secure the president.

15
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,803
There's no safe path out.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,772
Weeed to secure her in
the first floor lockdown.

17
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,276
(gunfire)

18
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,147
Hostage rescue teams
are moving into place.

19
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,448
They'll be prepared
to storm the building

20
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,117
as soon as
the order's given.

21
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:54,353
Mr. Vice President,
terrorists are in control
of the White House.

22
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,488
<i>HAYWORTH:
Until you can provide me
more intel

23
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,757
on what's going on in there,

24
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,594
you are instructed to refrain
from launching any action.

25
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,264
President Taylor is
locked in the safe room.

26
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,832
What is it I can do for you?

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,168
I need you to find me
another way in.

28
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,137
<i>Well, I'm looking
at the White House manifest,

29
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,739
and according to this,
Olivia Taylor

30
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,774
is presently in the building
with you.

31
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,110
You find Olivia Taylor,
and you'll get the president

32
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,912
to open that door.

33
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,280
JUMA:
President Taylor...

34
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,748
(softly):
God, no.

35
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,217
...if you don't open the door,

36
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,686
I'm going to cut out
your daughter's eyes

37
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,388
one by one.

38
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,190
Open the door.

39
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,159
Madam President...
No, open the door.

40
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,561
Open the door!
I can't do that.
I can't!

41
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,296
<i>TAYLOR:
Do you have children, Jack?

42
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,730
I have a daughter.

43
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,067
Could you do
what you're asking me to do?

44
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,169
Just stand by
and watch her butchered?

45
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:47,139
No, ma'am, but I am not the
President of the United States.

46
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:50,676
Well, I am the president,
and I am ordering you

47
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:53,112
to open that door.

48
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,988
All right, General,

49
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,189
you've got me now.

50
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,757
There's no reason
to hold anyone else.

51
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,226
Let them go.

52
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,902
Now, what we do know
is that the president

53
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,205
was in the building
when the attack took place,

54
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,407
and she may have
been taken hostage

55
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,310
along with numerous other
White House personnel.

56
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,379
Vice President Hayworth
was not in the building,

57
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,515
and we're told he was moved
to a secure location.

58
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,585
The FBI has cordoned off
a nine-block perimeter...
Mr. Vice President,

59
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,786
that was Agent Moss.

60
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,926
What does he have to say?

61
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,457
He's still requesting that you
authorize a rescue operation.

62
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,192
Does he have any more intel

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,127
about what the hell's
going on in there?

64
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:43,095
No, sir. He deployed two units

65
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,963
with deep-band parabolics,
but all they were able
to get what static.

66
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:47,533
They think Juma's using some
kind of jamming equipment.

67
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,269
They've also got spotters
at every possible angle
around the building,

68
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,904
but they haven't
been able to see inside.

69
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:55,241
we still don't know
whether Juma has the president,

70
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,010
or whether the president
is locked inside the safe room?

71
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,232
No, sir, we don't.

72
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:00,476
(sighs)

73
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,122
I will not authorize
any action

74
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:05,179
until I know
the status of the president.

75
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,952
Relay that to Agent Moss.

76
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,087
Yes, sir.

77
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,395
(Livia sobbing)

78
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,564
Mom, I know
that I hurt you.

79
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,533
I'm so sorry for cutting
you out of my life.

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,102
It's okay...
No, it isn't.

81
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,871
You were right to fire me
off the campaign.

82
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,607
I felt so betrayed,
I turned my back on you.

83
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,443
Olivia, don't
worry about it.

84
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,578
It all seems
so stupid now.

85
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,347
I hope you can forgive me.

86
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:39,151
Darling, I forgave
you a long time ago.

87
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,988
Livy, you have
to listen to me.

88
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,591
We really are going
to be okay.

89
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,893
Just keep your eyes
open and be ready.

90
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,664
Abo.

91
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,665
No, no.
Get up.

92
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,933
Leave her alone!

93
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,702
Get away from her!
Get back!

94
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,637
OLIVIA: I said leave
her alone! Please!

95
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,707
TAYLOR: Olivia, it's okay,
darling. It's okay!

96
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,442
Bill, we need to me

97
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,876
to try to save
the president.

98
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:05,877
How?

99
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,213
In the lockdown room,

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,116
there were five canisters
of CH-4.

101
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,918
Before we surrendered
ourselves over to Juma,
I opened the valves.

102
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,253
Within the next few minutes,

103
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,188
that room is going to be
saturated with natural gas.

104
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,505
It's going to take
one spark to set it off.

105
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,567
I think the explosion

106
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,325
is going to be large enough
to take out most of Juma's men.

107
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:23,462
That's when you
can make your move

108
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,963
How do we set it off?

109
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,698
I'll me a run
for the lockdown room.

110
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,966
Try and draw their fire.

111
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,502
All we need is one stray bullet.

112
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,737
That's a suicide play, Jack.

113
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,572
We don't have a choice.

114
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,906
Just make sure you can
get to the president

115
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:35,645
and get her
out of here.

116
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:38,444
She knows about the
plan; she'll be ready.

117
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,579
What are you planning?

118
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,080
Are you going to do something?

119
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,082
When it happens,
you'll know about it, Senator.

120
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,551
Damn it, if you're
planning something,

121
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,320
I want to know what it is.
Senator, shut up.

122
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,555
JUMA:
Read this statement.

123
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,291
It is a confession
of your crimes

124
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,959
against my country.

125
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,629
The atrocities that
you have committed

126
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:59,398
will now be seen
by the whole world.

127
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,768
I'll read your statement,
General,

128
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,103
but I need you to release

129
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,505
the other hostages.

130
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,143
You got what you came for.

131
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,779
You have the President
of the United States.

132
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,583
As a sign of good faith...

133
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,453
I will release one
of the hostages.

134
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,928
You...

135
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,431
Stand up.

136
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,879
(hostages screaming)

137
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,192
Do you want me to release
any more hostages, President Taylor?

138
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,661
You son of a bitch.

139
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,663
You will read this statement

140
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,600
or I will do the same thing
to everyone here...

141
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,869
starting with
your daughter.

142
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,279
General, the uplink is complete.

143
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,949
All right.

144
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,285
JUMA:
The world is waiting,

145
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,420
Madam President.

146
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,533
"This is the president
of the United States."

147
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,970
"Six hours ago,
I ordered our armed forces"

148
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:49,642
"to invade Sangala without
warning and without provocation."

149
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,211
"This attack was a criminal act
motivated solely"

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,980
"by America's desire"

151
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,516
"to exert its power
and influence."

152
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,519
Tell me you're
shutting this down.
We can't, sir.

153
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,621
It's a live feed straight
to the Internet.

154
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,094
I don't care.
Shut it down.

155
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:05,946
It's going out
on multiple servers, sir.

156
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:07,893
It would take hours
just to trace them.

157
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,662
(phone ringing)

158
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,430
This is Derek Watts.

159
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,932
Hold on.

160
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,433
Sir, it's agent Moss
on teleconference.

161
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,567
Put him on.

162
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,405
Sir, are you getting this?

163
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,207
Yes. So is the rest
of the damn world.

164
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,942
Mr. Vice President,
I believe Juma came here

165
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,846
to humiliate the president
and stage a public execution.

166
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,448
We have a rescue operation
in place.

167
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,882
All we need is
your authorization.

168
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,418
You don't know what Juma's
intentions are.

169
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,386
This could be a prelude
to a set of demands.

170
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,921
There are no demands here, sir.

171
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,623
This is about revenge.

172
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,792
Juma knows he'll never get out
of the White House alive.

173
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,259
You're speculating,
Agent Moss.

174
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,461
My advisorare telling me

175
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:43,895
the most prudent course
of action

176
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,417
is to try to initiate
communication with Juma.

177
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,600
We've been trying to do that.
He hasn't responded.

178
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,537
Sir, Juma has no desire
to negotiate anything.

179
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,771
Hes going to kill
the president.

180
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,740
Sir, we have a tactical plan
in place.

181
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,643
It's a two-pronged assault,
and we're confident that
it stands a good chance

182
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,845
of catching Juma off guard,
but we're losing time.

183
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,213
We have to initiate now.

184
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,981
I can not authorize any action

185
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,650
at might result
in the president's death.

186
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,319
Keep trying to open dialogue
with Juma.

187
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,154
Hold your position
till you're told otherwise.

188
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,122
I will keep this feed open.

189
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,958
TAYLOR:
"General Juma has demonstrated"

190
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,494
"that even a tyrant state
like the U.S..."

191
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,928
Be ready.

192
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,597
Jack, listen to me.

193
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,866
Juma's not solely
coordinating this attack.

194
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,234
What do you mean?

195
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,535
I heard him talking
on his sat phone.

196
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,738
He's coordinating with someone
on the outside.

197
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,373
They were giving him
real-time intel.

198
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,140
You think it's someone
in the White House?

199
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,809
I don't know.

200
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,845
But even if we take Juma down,

201
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,980
the president may
still be in danger.

202
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:38,000
You're the only one I know

203
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,818
who can do this, Jack.

204
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:43,555
Find out
who Juma's working with.

205
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,664
(loud explosion)

206
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,300
(panicked screams)

207
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,703
Agent Moss, a device
has been detonated

208
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,371
in the West Wing.

209
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,373
Mr. Vice President, there's been
an explosion at the White House.

210
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,708
An explosion?
Yes, sir.

211
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:03,909
The president's Internet
feed has gone dark.

212
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:04,976
We saw that. What's happening?

213
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,412
I don't know, sir,

214
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,547
but we're going in
under my authority. Let's go.

215
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,482
That is not your decision.
All teams, Attack Plan Delta.

216
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,018
Agent Moss, you're under orders!
Agent Moss!
Code Green.

217
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,254
Go, go, go, go!

218
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,089
(automatic gunfire)

219
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,193
(gunfire)

220
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,798
Pierce, get to the president!

221
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,139
Madam President,
are you okay?
Mm-hmm.

222
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,441
We need  get out
of here right now.

223
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,875
Both of you,
come with me.

224
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,044
Let's go. This way.

225
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,913
(Olivia whimpering)

226
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:51,256
(gasping)

227
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,625
Madam President,
get down.

228
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,226
Stay low till
I know we're clear.

229
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,498
Ngozi...

230
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,232
kill the hostages.

231
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,969
The president is mine!

232
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,138
Udo...

233
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,674
Udo?

234
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,242
No, no, no, no!

235
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,750
Don't move!

236
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,353
Don't you move!

237
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,698
(gunfire)

238
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,370
Clear.

239
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,506
We're clear!

240
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,642
PIERCE: Secret Service!
I have the president!

241
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,444
Aaron Pierce,
Secret Service.

242
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,481
Let's go, ma'am.
(whimpering)

243
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,697
Madam President, this way!

244
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,133
We have the president.

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,467
The president is secure!

246
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,602
Repeat: We have
the president.

247
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,670
This way, ma'am.

248
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,681
Renee! We gotta get
the president out of here now!

249
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,949
This way, ma'am.

250
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,517
It's all right, darling.

251
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,853
It's gonna be all right.

252
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,621
Move! Move! Move!

253
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,790
This way. This way.

254
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:03,306
Madam President...

255
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,275
we're still sweeping
the West Wing.

256
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:07,745
but we do believe
all the hostiles have
been accounted for.

257
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,212
Now you and your daughter

258
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,047
will stay here until we
finish securing the building.

259
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:12,048
TAYLOR:
I understand.

260
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:13,384
Now once we get the all clear,

261
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:15,218
we're going to move you
to Andrews Air Force Base.

262
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,187
No, I'm staying right here.

263
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:18,856
Ma'am, it's for
your own safety.

264
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:21,224
TAYLOR:
Do what's necessary to make sure
this building is safe

265
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,926
because I'm not going anywhere.

266
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:24,428
The American people
need to know

267
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,797
that the president
is in the White House.

268
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:28,031
Yes, Madam President.

269
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:31,268
How many people did we lose?

270
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:32,669
It's too early
to tell.

271
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:33,904
Medical teams
are on their way

272
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:34,905
to treat the wounded.

273
00:12:34,972 --> 00:12:35,939
We're going to set up

274
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:37,741
a triage unit in the East Wing.

275
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:38,742
All right.

276
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,076
I'd like to speak

277
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:42,780
to the vice president
as soon as possible.

278
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:44,281
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,182
And I need to know
how my husband's doing.

280
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,885
Would you please contact
Dr. Lee Schulman

281
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:50,253
at West Arlington Hospital?

282
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,288
Yes, Madam President.

283
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,956
Thank you.

284
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,099
How's Agent Pierce?

285
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,769
They said he's gonna be okay.

286
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,607
What about you?

287
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:15,846
I'm not sure.

288
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:21,117
I still can't believe
this happened.

289
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:23,320
I thought
they were gonna kill all of us.

290
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:27,691
I was so scared.

291
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,129
It's over...

292
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:35,966
and we're safe...

293
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,902
thanks to a lot
of brave people.

294
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,705
Excuse me, Madam President,

295
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:44,007
the vice president
is on a secure line.

296
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,142
I'll be right there.

297
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:52,683
Did you mean
what you said

298
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,352
about putting
the past behind us?

299
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,387
Of course I meant it.

300
00:13:57,455 --> 00:14:00,757
I don't ever want
to lose you again.

301
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,453
You won't.

302
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,294
(indistinct conversations)

303
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,238
The president's safe, Jack.

304
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:54,011
She's in the residence.
She's secure.

305
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,380
I'm so sorry, Jack.

306
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:00,017
I know that he was your friend.

307
00:15:00,084 --> 00:15:02,553
It was supposed to be me.

308
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:08,191
I was supposed
to set off the explosion

309
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:11,261
so that he could
secure the president.

310
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,734
He died protecting his country.

311
00:15:17,802 --> 00:15:20,437
Yeah.

312
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:31,114
This isn't over yet.

313
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:33,383
Agent Moss...

314
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:38,521
Juma and his men were
not working alone.

315
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,890
What are you
talking about?

316
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,992
When I was in the lockdown
with the president,

317
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,227
Bill said he heard Juma
talking on a sat phone.

318
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:45,562
Said he was getting
real-time intel

319
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,797
from someone on the ouide.

320
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,065
Who?
I don't know.

321
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:49,800
The point is, I don't think
this threat is over,

322
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,234
and I don't think
the president is safe.

323
00:15:51,302 --> 00:15:53,369
You sure Buchanan
heard this right?

324
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,100
He wouldn't told me unless he was sure 

325
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,875
And right now the only lead
we've got is Ryan Burnett

326
00:15:58,943 --> 00:15:59,977
He knew about
the attack

327
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,411
on the White House,
and chances are,

328
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:03,313
he's gonna know who Juma
was talking to.

329
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,881
All right, all right,
I'll talk to him.

330
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:07,517
No, the president already
offered him immunity.

331
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:08,785
He turned it down.

332
00:16:08,853 --> 00:16:10,420
He's not gonna
tell you anything,

333
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:12,656
but he will talk to me.

334
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:14,925
Why is that, Jack,
'cause you tortured him?

335
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:16,860
I don't need to touch him.
I just need him to think

336
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,095
I'm there to finish
what I started.

337
00:16:18,162 --> 00:16:19,295
And I promise you

338
00:16:19,363 --> 00:16:20,998
he will tell us
everything we need to know.

339
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,284
Larry, please,

340
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:25,354
the last thing Bill asked for
before he died

341
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:28,571
was for me to follow
this through. I owe him that.

342
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,440
Look, I give
you my word.

343
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:32,743
I will not
touch Burnett.

344
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,044
Jack, look, I understand
about your friend,

345
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:35,512
I do, but I got standing
orders from the president

346
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,513
to take you into custody.

347
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,048
I gotta get you
back to FBI,

348
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:39,659
but I promise you
I'll look into this, all right?

349
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,452
Agent Powell,
handcuff Mr. Bauer.

350
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,687
Take him down
to Staging Area B.

351
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:45,122
Sir, put your hands
on top of your head.

352
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:48,309
Larry...
If you're gonna tell me
he's right about this

353
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:49,123
I don't want to hear it.

354
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:51,028
Yes, that's the problem.
You're not listening
to what he's saying.

355
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:52,529
When are you gonna
stop defending this guy?

356
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,864
I'm not defending him,

357
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,460
I'm defending a good idea.

358
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,500
I just said
I will look into this!

359
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:58,348
Now do your job:

360
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,336
finish locking down
the building.

361
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,918
Agent Reynolds.

362
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,354
I need to speak with
the president. It's urgent.

363
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,556
She's in a secure location.

364
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,891
You'll need to go
through Ethan Kanin.

365
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,893
Where is he?
He just arrived.

366
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,294
He's on his way
to see the president.

367
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:25,562
Thanks.

368
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:28,965
The president's in the
residence with her daughter.

369
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,266
They've both been
checked over

370
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:31,835
and they're in
good condition.
Thank God.

371
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,305
I want a conference
with the SECNAV

372
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:36,973
and the Joint Chiefs
as soon as possible.

373
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,975
We're routing all White House
communications to the residence,

374
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:40,811
and we're setting up
a temporary command post.

375
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,378
Good.

376
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:44,214
Mr. Kanin,
I need to speak with you.

377
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:45,916
I'm on my way
to see the president.

378
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,851
Yes, I know, sir,
but it's extremely urgent.

379
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,385
It'll only take
a few moments.

380
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,021
(sighs)
All right.

381
00:17:52,023 --> 00:17:53,190
What is it, Agent Walker?

382
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:54,657
Some new intel has just
come to our attention

383
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:56,126
and we need to act
on it immediately.

384
00:17:56,194 --> 00:17:57,828
I tried to reach the president,
but I couldn't get through.

385
00:17:57,895 --> 00:18:00,597
I'm listening.
Sir, the threat to the
president may not be over.

386
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,229
We've reason to believe
that General Juma

387
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,867
was not acting alone.

388
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:05,301
Before Bill Buchanan died,

389
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:06,569
he saw General Juma
communicating

390
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:08,638
with someone on a sat phone.

391
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,143
NEWSMAN:
At this point, we can confirm

392
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:16,279
that FBI agencies entered
the White House moments ago,

393
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:19,249
and there were reports
of sustained gunfire.

394
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,717
It appears that authorities

395
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,552
are now in control
of the West Wing,

396
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,488
and we are expecting word
from our FBI source

397
00:18:25,556 --> 00:18:27,023
of the status of the hostages.

398
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,658
While there has been
no official comment...

399
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:30,827
So what have we got?

400
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,329
The president's alive.

401
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:35,031
Are you sure?

402
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:38,568
We've been monitoring
interagency servers.

403
00:18:38,636 --> 00:18:41,037
Word just went out.
Juma's dead, Taylor survived.

404
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:44,007
What happened do you think?

405
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,475
We don't know
any details yet,

406
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,512
but we'll keep monitorg.

407
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,847
(sighs)

408
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:55,351
Well... you gotta admire
the damn bitch.

409
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,053
She doesn't give up easily.

410
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:58,454
I'm sorry, sir.
We, uh,

411
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:01,792
just didn't have enough control
over the situation.

412
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,261
Greg, you look tense.

413
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,998
Do me a favor.

414
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,101
Have a drink, relax.

415
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:12,669
NEWSMAN:
Our FBI source speculated

416
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:16,472
that thereere as many as 20
terrorists, all heavily armed...

417
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,574
Juma held up his part
of the bargain.

418
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:20,076
We're getting what we wanted.

419
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:22,179
As far as I'm concerned,
everything's still on track.

420
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:24,314
NEWSWOMAN:
The shocking events
of this day...

421
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:25,682
Where are the weapons now?

422
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:29,452
A shipment should ready
for pickup

423
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,921
in the next couple of hours.

424
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:33,456
Good.
Get Chapman on the phone.

425
00:19:33,524 --> 00:19:35,692
I want to nail down
some targets.

426
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:52,530
Sir, the chopper
you requested is on its way.

427
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:53,932
It'll be here
in ten minutes.

428
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:55,533
You'll be escorting Mr. Bauer 
back to FBI.

429
00:19:55,601 --> 00:19:56,801
Hold him in the
command center.

430
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,002
Yes, sir.

431
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,904
(phone rings)

432
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:02,941
This is Larry Moss.

433
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:05,209
This is Ethan Kanin.
I understand

434
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:07,311
you're taking Jack Bauer back
to FBI?

435
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:08,813
Yes, sir.
He's gonna be debriefed

436
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:10,448
and remanded
into federal custody.

437
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:12,149
I want you
to put that on hold.

438
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:13,150
Sir?

439
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:15,319
I just spoke
with Agent Walker.

440
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:17,421
She told me Juma may have
been working with someone

441
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,223
on the outside,
and that there may be

442
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,860
an ongoing threat
to the president.

443
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,362
Yes, that's true.

444
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:30,602
I want you to send Jack Bauer
to question Ryan Burnett.

445
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:32,570
Agent Moss?

446
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:34,539
Sir, I think
that's a mistake.

447
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,001
Yes, Agent Walker shared
your concerns with me,

448
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,904
and I've given this
some thought.

449
00:20:39,024 --> 00:20:40,444
If Burnett does know

450
00:20:40,513 --> 00:20:41,880
who Juma was working with,

451
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:44,849
Bauer's approach may be our best
chance to get that information.

452
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:47,819
With respect, sir,
Bauer almost killed this man.

453
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,621
I was there, Agent Moss,

454
00:20:49,688 --> 00:20:52,323
but this will be
a controlled interrogation.

455
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,693
We're gonna play
on Burnett's fears.

456
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:57,028
Bauer's presence alone
should be enough

457
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,129
to intimidate him into talking.

458
00:20:58,196 --> 00:20:59,706
Sir, Bauer is a wild card.

459
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:00,932
We have no idea what he'll do

460
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,299
when he gets in that room
with Burnett.

461
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,902
I realize there's a risk.

462
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,704
That's why you're going to
do this under my authority

463
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:08,172
and my authority alone.

464
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,441
You're not taking this
to the president?

465
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,911
No. If something
does go wrong,

466
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:16,047
I want to make sure
the president is protected.

467
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:18,382
With respect, sir,
I think you're not
telling the president

468
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,552
'cause you know
she'd never allow this.

469
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:22,787
You've made your objections
clear, Agent Moss.

470
00:21:22,855 --> 00:21:25,356
I'm not going
to debate this with you.

471
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:28,092
I want you to take Bauer
to question Burnett.

472
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,861
That's a direct order.
Do you understand?

473
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:32,163
I understand.

474
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,431
And I'm counting on you

475
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:35,533
to supervise every second
of that interrogation.

476
00:21:35,601 --> 00:21:37,869
I'll expect a full report
as soon as you're done.

477
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:39,904
Yes, sir.

478
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:48,145
I want to speak personally
to the families of everyone

479
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:50,381
we lost tonight, so...

480
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:52,717
keep me informed
as they're notified.

481
00:21:52,785 --> 00:21:54,218
Absolutely,
Madam President.

482
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:56,588
And the minute
Angela Nelson

483
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,222
gets here,
send her straight up to me.

484
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,893
We need to start working
on the speech to the country.

485
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:04,428
Of course,
Madam President.

486
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:08,232
Patrick,

487
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,134
you have just
been through

488
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:12,136
a terrible ordeal.

489
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:14,405
Are you sure you're okay?

490
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:16,975
I'll be fine.

491
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:19,310
It helps to focus on work.

492
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:21,378
I understand.

493
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,247
(knocking on door)

494
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:27,085
Thank you, Patrick.

495
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:30,622
(both sighing)

496
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,925
Thank God you're all right.

497
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:40,231
How you feeling?
(sighs)

498
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:43,768
Like I just woke up
from a nightmare.

499
00:22:43,836 --> 00:22:45,803
It was unbelievable,
Ethan.

500
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:48,472
I can't even imagine it.
How's Olivia?

501
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,408
She's shaken up,
but she's going to be okay.

502
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:52,977
I'm glad to hear it.

503
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,079
We lost some good people
tonight, Ethan.

504
00:22:55,147 --> 00:22:57,782
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

505
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,252
I'm thinking
about bringing Olivia on

506
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,221
as a special advisor.

507
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:05,757
Madam President,

508
00:23:05,824 --> 00:23:08,325
I can understand your
not wanting to be separated

509
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:10,094
from your daughter
after what's happened.

510
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:11,896
<i>Especially after
what's happened,

511
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:13,230
we need people
who can do the job.

512
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:15,199
I'm not disputing
Olivia's competence,

513
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:17,101
we need people
but she's also a political

514
00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:18,536
liability.

515
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:21,205
Nobody's forgotten what
she did during the campaign,

516
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:23,507
leaking damaging
personal information

517
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:25,109
about your opponent
to the press.

518
00:23:25,177 --> 00:23:27,111
Olivia knows
what she did was wrong.

519
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,546
She almost cost you
the election.

520
00:23:28,613 --> 00:23:30,048
She's changed.

521
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,483
We talked
about it, Ethan,

522
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:34,719
and she is accepting
full responsibility.

523
00:23:34,787 --> 00:23:36,154
She has learned

524
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,655
from her mistakes.

525
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:39,456
I'm willing

526
00:23:39,524 --> 00:23:41,392
to put the past behind us
so we can move ahead.

527
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,794
I still think it's a mistake.

528
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,896
I don't care what you think!

529
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:53,971
I am so sorry, Ethan.

530
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:56,440
You know I
don't mean that.

531
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:59,210
But I've made
up my mind.

532
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:01,412
I want Olivia
to join my administration.

533
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:04,782
And I want it
to come from you.

534
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,584
Me?

535
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:08,886
Your offering
her this position

536
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:11,355
would be a good way
to extend an olive branch.

537
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:17,461
I need the two of you
to make peace.

538
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:20,531
All right, Madam President.

539
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:23,201
I'll talk to her.

540
00:24:23,268 --> 00:24:25,569
Thank you, Ethan.

541
00:24:25,637 --> 00:24:29,273
I understand Agent Walker
was trying to reach me.

542
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,209
That's right,
but I spoke to her.

543
00:24:31,276 --> 00:24:32,877
What did she want?

544
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:34,478
Just some procedural matters,
Madam President.

545
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:36,180
I took care of it.

546
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:07,444
Larry, you wanted
to see me?

547
00:25:12,017 --> 00:25:15,086
I just got off the phone
with Ethan Kanin.

548
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:21,425
Look, I didn't want
to go behind your back,

549
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:22,726
but you didn't
leave me any choice.

550
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,361
I didn't leave you a...?

551
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:26,230
How about you choose
to follow orders?

552
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:27,965
I'm sorry, Larry.

553
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,433
No. I don't think you are.

554
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:32,770
Larry, I've seen Jack
do some terrible things today.

555
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:34,571
Things that
I still can't justify.

556
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,073
But he has been right
every time.

557
00:25:36,074 --> 00:25:37,574
And you know what?
I can't help but think

558
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:39,076
that maybe if we had just
stayed out of his way,

559
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:40,477
none of this
would have happened.

560
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:43,414
Look, I am sorry

561
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:44,615
that I went behind your back,

562
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:46,851
but I... I promise you
this play with Burnett

563
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,820
will go down
just the way Jack says.

564
00:25:51,824 --> 00:25:53,157
If you think
you're going with Bauer,

565
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:54,425
you are out of your mind.

566
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:55,960
You may have gotten

567
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:58,896
a White House order, but I'm
still running this operation.

568
00:25:58,964 --> 00:26:01,632
I'll take Bauer
to see Barnett.

569
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,567
You're going back to FBI.

570
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:06,670
I want you to clean out your office

571
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:08,339
and hand in your badge.

572
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:11,008
I'm suspending you indefinitely.

573
00:26:11,076 --> 00:26:13,577
Okay. I know that you're upset
Larry, but this isn't over.

574
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:14,778
You're going to need me.

575
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,981
What I need are people
that I can trust.

576
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,016
I thought that was you.

577
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:45,676
Look, you may think
you got what you wanted,

578
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:47,245
getting Renee
to go behind my back,

579
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:49,981
but Ethan Kanin ordered me
to let you question Burnett.

580
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:52,283
I'm going to be watching you
every second you're in there.

581
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:53,951
You do one thing I don't like,
you're finished.

582
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,420
You understand me?
Understood.

583
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,657
You should leave Renee
out of this.

584
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:03,027
She was just doing
what she thought was right.

585
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:04,962
Yeah? Well,
she may lose her job over it.

586
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,663
She's the best agent you've got.

587
00:27:06,731 --> 00:27:07,999
She circumvented
my authority.

588
00:27:08,066 --> 00:27:10,201
I can't just
ignore that.

589
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,103
I've known this woman
for nine years,

590
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,071
and I've never seen her do
the kind of things she's done

591
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:15,706
in the last nine hours.

592
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,576
We've narrowed the list down

593
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:41,745
to 12 targets
along the eastern seaboard.

594
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:43,781
They're all within
300 kilometers of the base.

595
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:45,115
How many people?

596
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:47,318
10,000 to 15,000
in each target zone.

597
00:27:47,385 --> 00:27:49,620
And our kill ratio
would be what?

598
00:27:49,688 --> 00:27:52,289
Well, we've chosen
these areas for maximum
population density,

599
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:54,525
so the ratio could
be as high as 80%.

600
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:56,760
Let's hope
we never have to find out.

601
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:59,530
Get these coordinates down
to the boys in Tac-Ops.

602
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,332
Have them start
programming them in.

603
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:02,795
Yes, sir.

604
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:08,639
We just intercepted

605
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:11,107
a flash memo
from the FBI.

606
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:14,845
Jack Bauer is on his way
to Kennedy Memorial Hospital

607
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:16,347
to question Burnett.

608
00:28:16,414 --> 00:28:18,349
Bauer was arrested.
How is this possible?

609
00:28:18,469 --> 00:28:20,784
There was an executive order
from the White House

610
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:23,404
giving Bauer access to Burnett.

611
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:25,121
Bauer will finish
what he started.

612
00:28:25,189 --> 00:28:26,724
Burnett will
tell him everything.

613
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:27,858
No, he won't, sir.

614
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:30,193
I have already sent
somebody to the hospital

615
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:31,395
to deal with Burnett.

616
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:34,197
He can take care of Bauer
at the same time.

617
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:35,733
Who did you send?

618
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,234
Quinn.

619
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,536
Oh. Quinn's good.

620
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:42,172
Bauer's good, too.

621
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,141
Agent Moss, we've locked
down the entire floor.

622
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:46,243
We equipped
Burnett's room

623
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,211
with two cameras and
audio surveillance.

624
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,135
Where is he?

625
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:50,100
Down the hall.

626
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,153
It's going to be a moment.

627
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:52,464
Doctor has to
revive him.

628
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,184
Why? What happened?

629
00:28:54,252 --> 00:28:55,440
He was given a
heavy sedative.

630
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,320
He was in pretty bad shape
when he got here.

631
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,723
Dr. Wyndam,
Special Agent

632
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,358
Larry Moss,
Jack Bauer.

633
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:02,559
I understand you're here

634
00:29:02,627 --> 00:29:03,727
to interrogate my patient.
That's right.

635
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,396
Well, he's still
recovering from his last

636
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:07,030
interrogation, so if you're here
to brutalize him again,

637
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:08,499
I won't be party to it.
Doctor, your patient

638
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,934
was involved in a terrorist
attack against the White House

639
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,669
in an effort to kill the
President of the United States,

640
00:29:12,737 --> 00:29:14,671
and I believe
the people he's working with

641
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:16,373
want to try it again,
so if you've got a problem...

642
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:18,475
We won't harm him,
Doctor.

643
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:20,076
This will be a controlled
interrogation. Please,

644
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:21,612
we need your cooperation.

645
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,720
It's going to take him a couple
of minutes to come out of it.

646
00:30:11,496 --> 00:30:13,029
Who are you?

647
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:14,631
Shh. I'm a friend.

648
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:15,766
What's your name?

649
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,200
Robert.

650
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:18,769
Robert?
Yeah.

651
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:20,571
You're recovering
from heart surgery?

652
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:21,705
Yeah.

653
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:23,774
Do you have a wife, Robert?

654
00:30:23,842 --> 00:30:26,443
No. She passed away.

655
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:27,711
Children?
Grandchildren?

656
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,279
No.

657
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,750
What about this man?

658
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:35,118
Does he have family?

659
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:36,820
(chuckling):
Yeah.

660
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:38,154
Lots of grandkids.

661
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:40,791
Make a hell of a noise
when they visit.

662
00:30:44,963 --> 00:30:46,497
(mfled screaming)

663
00:30:50,902 --> 00:30:52,870
(muffled screaming)

664
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:56,507
(muffled protests)

665
00:31:07,318 --> 00:31:09,820
(monitor beeping rapidly)

666
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,497
(monitor beeping rapidly)

667
00:31:49,527 --> 00:31:52,162
(beeping)

668
00:32:22,794 --> 00:32:24,828


669
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:55,158


670
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:17,514
How's your arm?
I should be back on my feet
in a couple of hours.

671
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,016
And you, ma'am?

672
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:22,019
Oh, it's nothing a little
aspirin won't take care of.

673
00:33:23,387 --> 00:33:25,689
I want to thank you
for what you did.

674
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:30,160
You took a bullet for me.
You saved my life.

675
00:33:30,227 --> 00:33:33,130
There is no need
to thank me, ma'am.

676
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:34,998
Right, you were just
doing your job.

677
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,332
Only in this case,

678
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,501
it wasn't really your job
since you retired

679
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:39,836
four years ago.

680
00:33:39,904 --> 00:33:41,471
Yes, ma'am, that's true.

681
00:33:41,539 --> 00:33:44,007
Do you mind
if I ask you why?

682
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:49,379
Did it have to do
with Martha Logan?

683
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:54,184
Martha and I were... close.

684
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:57,222
It must have been hard for you--
what happened to her.

685
00:33:57,342 --> 00:33:59,312
I'd prefer not to talk about it.

686
00:33:59,432 --> 00:34:01,257
I'm sorry.

687
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:03,794
You don't have to apologize.

688
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:09,666
I hope you won't be a stranger,
Agent Pierce.

689
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:10,867
Thank you.

690
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:13,457
And, uh...

691
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:15,438
it's Aaron.

692
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:19,576
Okay, Aaron.

693
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,845
You get some rest.

694
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,415
I'd like to head back
to the residence now

695
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:27,084
if that's okay?

696
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:28,384
KANIN:
Olivia...

697
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:29,886
I was just coming
to see you.

698
00:34:29,954 --> 00:34:33,223
I'm glad you're all right.

699
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,391
Thank you.

700
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:36,928
you have a moment to talk?

701
00:34:37,048 --> 00:34:38,962
Sure.

702
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:44,434
(sighs)

703
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:50,207
The blunt fact
of the matter is...

704
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:54,044
this administration has just
suffered some terrible losses,

705
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,746
and we need help.

706
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:58,808
The president and I would like
you to consider coming on board

707
00:34:58,928 --> 00:35:01,451
as special advisor
to the president.

708
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:05,088
I, uh...

709
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,403
I have to say
I'm a little surprised.

710
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:12,229
Surprised?
Oh, that you'd
sign off on this.

711
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:15,866
You mother said she's ready
to put the past behind her...

712
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,935
and so am I.

713
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:23,439
I overstepped my bounds during the campaign
and I was wrong.

714
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:25,742
I'm glad you see it that way.

715
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,378
But it's not the past
that concerns me, Ethan.

716
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:30,647
It's what's happening right now,

717
00:35:30,648 --> 00:35:33,416
and what's been happening ever
since my mother took office.

718
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:36,653
Excuse me?

719
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,388
Do you think any of this
would have happened

720
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:40,023
if my mother had a chief advisor

721
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:43,093
who knew what the hell
was going on in her
administration?

722
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,460
What are you talking about?

723
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:47,330
Her government was corrupted
on every level,

724
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:49,365
and it all happened
right under your nose.

725
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:52,202
Even you have to admit,
it's an unconscionable

726
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,904
failure on your part.

727
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:57,640
Frankly, I'm surprised

728
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,475
you haven't tendered
your resignation.

729
00:35:59,543 --> 00:36:03,379
You have no right to speak
to me that way.

730
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:06,216
You don't know what
you're talking about.

731
00:36:06,284 --> 00:36:08,051
You don't have the facts.

732
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:10,353
I intend to get the facts.

733
00:36:10,421 --> 00:36:12,923
I'm going to
find out exactly

734
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,490
who failed my mother,

735
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:16,159
and I am going to make sure that

736
00:36:16,227 --> 00:36:19,229
that person never is
in a position to do it again.

737
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,633
Excuse me.

738
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:44,013
Okay, let's go.

739
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,316
I'll be watching.

740
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:49,285
You lay one finger
on him, it's over.

741
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,290
Right.

742
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:22,852
He's coming around.

743
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
Good.

744
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,941
Wake up.

745
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:47,777
Wake up.

746
00:37:52,716 --> 00:37:53,983
Remember me?

747
00:37:57,521 --> 00:37:59,288
Oh, my God.

748
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:02,759
What the hell are
you doing here?

749
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,861
I've just come
from the White House.

750
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:06,495
Juma's attack failed.

751
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,898
He's dead,
and so are his men.

752
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:10,366
A lot of innocent people
died today.

753
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:11,467
Good people.

754
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:13,402
Including a friend
of mine-- Bill Buchanan.

755
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,637
You might have met him.

756
00:38:14,705 --> 00:38:16,806
You stay the hell away from me.

757
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:19,308
And I want to talk
to a lawyer right now.

758
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:21,443
Do you hear me?
I want to talk to a lawyer!

759
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:23,079
Somebody get me
the hell out of here!

760
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,080
You're not
going anywhere.

761
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,782
It's just you and me, pal.

762
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:26,983
Did you really think

763
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:29,052
you were going
to get away with it?

764
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,820
Somebody please,
help me!

765
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:34,290
JACK:
You're wasting your breath.
They're not coming for you.

766
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:36,592
Please don't hurt me.
I'll tell you anything you want.

767
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,594
Do you hear that--
I'm ready to talk.

768
00:38:38,662 --> 00:38:39,929
I'll tell you anything

769
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:42,431
you want to know!
Just get him out of here!

770
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:44,734
I'm ready to talk!
They're done talking to you.

771
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:46,836
That's why they sent me.

772
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,671
Please, you can't do this!
You have no right!

773
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:51,340
This isn't legal!
(transmission static)

774
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:52,341
What happened?

775
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:53,342
I don't know.

776
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,844
Looks like we lost
the sound feed.

777
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,579
Give me a second.

778
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:00,516
There are no laws
in here, Mr. Burnett.

779
00:39:00,584 --> 00:39:02,384
You aided
and embedded terrorists,

780
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:05,121
who then tried to kill the
President of the United States.
You have no right...

781
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:06,956
Now you have
to answer for that.

782
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:08,691
The rules don't apply
to you anymore.

783
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:10,993
No, please, please, you
can't let him touch me!

784
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:13,062
Please, you can't
let him do this...!
Shut up!

785
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,897
(static crackling)

786
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:18,467
It could be a glitch
in the trunk line.

787
00:39:20,503 --> 00:39:21,904
(metallic clatter)

788
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:24,306
(shrill hissing)

789
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:29,045
(yells and groans)

790
00:39:29,113 --> 00:39:30,679
(gasps)

791
00:39:38,088 --> 00:39:40,422
(Jack and Burnett
gasping for air)

792
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:46,796
(static crackling)

793
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,770
(static cracklg)

794
00:39:53,837 --> 00:39:55,337
(breathing heavily)

795
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:18,861
Damn it,
fix the thing!
I'm trying, sir.

796
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:27,170
(flatline tone)

797
00:40:27,237 --> 00:40:29,338
(static crackling)

798
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:38,181
(gasping)

799
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:40,516
(coughs and gasping)

800
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,552
Bauer?

801
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,154
He jammed the
electronic bolt.

802
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:46,789
Is there another way in?
No.

803
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:49,425
Jack! Jack!

804
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,228
Damn it, Bauer, open the door!

805
00:40:52,296 --> 00:40:54,763
(loud banging)

806
00:41:05,608 --> 00:41:09,846
(kicking door)

807
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,353
Have security
lock down the hospital.

808
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,022
I want a high-priority APB
issued for Jack Bauer.

809
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,458
All agencies.

810
00:41:49,486 --> 00:41:51,087
(phone rings)

811
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,893
It's done.

812
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,161
Good. Thank you.

813
00:41:59,229 --> 00:42:02,464
It's done.

814
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:04,666
Burnett's dead.

815
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:05,902
And Bauer?

816
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:07,603
They'll think, he killed Burnett.

817
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,804
So, nobody will know

818
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:10,306
that we we're involved.

819
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:12,775
Good.

820
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:14,110
Yeah.

821
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:17,446
Now 're having some fun.

822
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:19,248
(phone ringing)

823
00:42:19,316 --> 00:42:20,917
Agent Moss.

824
00:42:20,984 --> 00:42:22,484
Larry, it's Jack.
Listen to me.

825
00:42:22,552 --> 00:42:24,086
Where are you?

826
00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:26,422
I didn't kill Burnett.
I'm being set up.
Set up?

827
00:42:26,489 --> 00:42:29,025
A man released some
kind of nerve agent
into the room.

828
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:30,426
It immobilized me.

829
00:42:30,493 --> 00:42:31,827
He came through the ceiling
and killed Burnett.

830
00:42:31,895 --> 00:42:33,529
I swear to you, I'm not lying.
I watched him do it.

831
00:42:33,596 --> 00:42:35,497
Get back in here,
we'll work this out.

832
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:37,766
I can't, you know that.
You can if you're innocent.

833
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:40,636
Look, there is a reason
why they wanted me framed
and didn't kill me.

834
00:42:40,703 --> 00:42:42,771
They're trying to keep
you distracted by
dealing with me

835
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,440
so they can finish
what they started.

836
00:42:44,507 --> 00:42:46,042
Don't let them
get away with this.

837
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:47,376
This threat is not over.

838
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:48,444
(sirens wailing)

839
00:42:48,511 --> 00:42:49,745
Jack...

840
00:42:49,813 --> 00:42:51,647
(sirens wailing)

841
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:54,550
Jack?!

842
00:42:54,618 --> 00:42:56,252
Damn it!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
