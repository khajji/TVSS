1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,604
<i>[Jack Bauer]
Previously on 24.</i>

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,910
Tanner, Emerson spoke
to his man inside the Bureau.

3
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,643
<i>- He says you're clear.
- Good.</i>

4
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,709
<i>I need to prep my men on the nextjob.
Tell me what we need.</i>

5
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:23,278
I'll give you the specs
when I get there.

6
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,654
<i>[Renee]
I'll engage him. Cover my flank.</i>

7
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:28,216
I can handle it.

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,565
I don't understand.
Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.

9
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,159
If he doesn't have the C.I.P. Device,
who does?

10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,967
Almeida's working for theJuma regime.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,976
<i>[Over Speaker] This is Colonel Iké Dubaku.
We demand an immediate withdrawal...</i>

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:48,606
<i>of the U.S. Naval strike force
by this time tomorrow.</i>

13
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,707
The American troops are still
in position near our country.

14
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,980
<i>President Taylor
just received your demands.</i>

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,023
Then perhaps it is time for
a more forceful demonstration.

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,993
<i>- I know about Samantha Roth.
- She's hiding something about my son's murder.</i>

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,122
- Roger wasn't murdered.
- I wasn't completely honest with you.

18
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,531
- What do you mean?
- Roger didn't commit suicide, Mr. Taylor.

19
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,535
He was murdered.

20
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,367
Jack, Tony is not a terrorist.
He's working with me.

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,204
<i>We're working outside the government.</i>

22
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,710
<i>That's why we have to get Tony
back undercover.</i>

23
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:21,008
Bauer, you're not
gonna make it out of here.

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,981
<i>Shut up! I said shut up!</i>

25
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,783
[Jack]
Get down!

26
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,482
We gotta get you out of here
and back undercover. Go!

27
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,219
<i>[Gunshots]</i>

28
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,124
<i>[Tires Squealing]</i>

29
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,533
- Tony, let's go!
- [Groans]

30
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:01,349
<i>[Jack Bauer] The following takes place
between 11:00 a.m. And 12:00 p.m.</i>

31
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,989
<i>Renee. Security
saw Bauer and Almeida...</i>

32
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,689
getting into a dark-colored panel van.

33
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,390
- What direction were they heading?
- West.

34
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,399
What's happening with D.O.T. Cameras?

35
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,128
I've been trying.
Traffic images aren't loading.

36
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,863
What do you mean, not loading?

37
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,962
Just what I said.
The server's not responding.

38
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,837
- The hacker must be jamming the transmission.
- How the hell can they do that?

39
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,070
If I knew, I'd be able to get around it.

40
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,545
Continue checking ancillary security cams-
A.T.M., parking garages.

41
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,605
There has to be something.

42
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,515
Well, keep canvassing the area.
Someone else may have seen the vehicle.

43
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,280
<i>- [Man] That's what we're doing.
- Fine.</i>

44
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,720
- Let me know.
- No luck on municipal cameras.

45
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,849
- Looks like they have someone
running interference for them.
- Damn it.

46
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,690
Bauer must've worked out this escape
with Almeida's people.

47
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,663
I'm so sorry, Larry.
That son of a bitch played me.

48
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,393
<i>Had me believing
the Bureau was compromised...</i>

49
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,128
someone on the inside
working against us.

50
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,863
I realize now it was him all along.

51
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,734
<i>Don't... put this on yourself.</i>

52
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,932
- He played us both.
- No. I should have seen it.

53
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,669
This is fine.
Take it downstairs, will you?

54
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,870
<i>Bauer's facing a federal indictment,
years in prison...</i>

55
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,413
and Almeida must have
offered him a way out.

56
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,915
<i>Agent Moss?
The White House is on line one.</i>

57
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,077
Yeah, I'll take it in the conference room.
Thanks, Erika.

58
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,553
I'm gonna make this right, Larry.

59
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,750
Whatever it takes,
I will find Bauer and Almeida.

60
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,623
Throw in the C.I.P. Device
and maybe we'll be off the hook.

61
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,629
Janis, what's the status
of that shooter?

62
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,793
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.
But a print match is just coming up now.

63
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,337
His name is Alan Tanner.

64
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:29,307
He was former Special Forces,
discharged after Desert Storm.

65
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,536
- Discharged why?
- Medical reasons.

66
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,546
He made claims to having
Gulf War Syndrome.

67
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,378
Tried to sue the government.
Case was dismissed.

68
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,749
- I wanna be informed the minute he's awake.
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,617
[Woman]
Sir, I'm connecting you now.

70
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:50,357
Agent Moss, this is Ethan Kanin.
I'm here with the president.

71
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,489
What are you and your folks
doing about this situation?

72
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,499
<i>We put out an all-agency alert.</i>

73
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,161
Everyone understands apprehending
Almeida is our top priority.

74
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,637
How did he escape?

75
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,301
He had the help of a former C.T.U. Agent
that we mistakenly trusted.

76
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,743
<i>- A man by the name ofJack Bauer.
- Bauer?</i>

77
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,509
Thought he was in the middle
of a Senate investigative hearing.

78
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,449
<i>Uh, yes, sir. That is correct. We issued
a subpoena a few hours ago...</i>

79
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,545
excusing him from the hearings in order
to enlist his help in apprehending Almeida.

80
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,059
- Now you're saying that these two men are allied?
- It would appear so.

81
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:25,189
My God. You and your people have
royally screwed up, Agent Moss.

82
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,790
<i>Without Almeida, we have
no way of finding Dubaku...</i>

83
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,392
<i>and no chance of recovering
the C.I.P. Device.</i>

84
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,497
<i>Ethan, let's stay on point.
Agent Moss, are you working any other leads?</i>

85
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,873
Yes, Madam President- a confederate
of Almeida's who was wounded earlier today.

86
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:41,471
Uh, he's just out of surgery. We're waiting
for him to regain consciousness.

87
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,675
Do we have a time frame from the hospital
on when that might happen?

88
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,878
No, ma'am, not really.

89
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,887
Let me be clear, Agent Moss.

90
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,480
Recapturing Almeida and Bauer
isn't just your top priority.

91
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,219
<i>- It's your only priority.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

92
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,024
<i>- Keep us posted, Agent.
- [Switch Clicks]</i>

93
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:00,930
Bottom line, the Bureau is not going to
be the answer to our prayers here.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,094
I'm afraid not.
How much time does that leave us?

95
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,900
Less than two hours.

96
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,876
Dubaku's demand is that our forces retreat
behind the 23rd meridian within 24 hours.

97
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,105
<i>Now, in order to meet that timetable...</i>

98
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,514
the fleet and carrier air wing must start
withdrawing by 1:00 at the latest.

99
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,144
<i>Which would effectively
end our mission in Africa...</i>

100
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,020
and condemn another 100,000 Sangalans
to a certain and brutal death.

101
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:29,050
<i>On the other hand,
if you authorize the invasion...</i>

102
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,791
<i>Dubaku will undoubtedly
engage the C.I.P. Device.</i>

103
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,269
How far has the F.A.A. Gotten
with grounding aircraft?

104
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,070
Still over a thousand planes in the air
across the country, waiting for clearance to land.

105
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,976
<i>Dubaku could bring down
any one of them at any moment...</i>

106
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:51,483
or use the device
for something far worse.

107
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:56,250
I ran for office on the principle
of non-negotiation with terrorists.

108
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,156
How can I abandon that now,
the very first time I'm tested?

109
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,285
<i>And if I do so,
won't I be telling Dubaku...</i>

110
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,490
and the rest of the world
that blackmailing America works?

111
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,001
Madam President,
those are questions for the future.

112
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,128
<i>We have a decision to make now.</i>

113
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,084
What do you call this place?

114
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:29,713
We like to think of it as C.T.U.
What's left of it, anyway.

115
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,695
- Jack.
- Chloe.

116
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,700
It's good to see you.

117
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,998
It's good to see you too.

118
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,129
I'm glad you're with us.

119
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:49,936
I'm not with anyone until someone
starts answering some questions.

120
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,467
Might as well start with you.
Why the hell are you not dead?

121
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,471
<i>I was dead, Jack.</i>

122
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,007
<i>For almost 10 minutes,
or so I was told.</i>

123
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,987
- By who?
- By him.

124
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,991
<i>[Tony] His name's David Emerson.
I don't know who he paid off at C.T. U...</i>

125
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,122
<i>but it was his people who injected
my body with a hypothermic compound...</i>

126
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,030
<i>was able to revive me.</i>

127
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,501
- Who is he, and what does he want?
- Independent contractor.

128
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,165
<i>Enlists ex-military and intelligence operatives,
jobs 'em out to clients.</i>

129
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,403
- Apparently, I fit the profile.
- What profile?

130
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:28,413
<i>Former employees with grievances
against the federal government.</i>

131
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,848
<i>Emerson had been keeping tabs
on me ever since I left C.T.U.</i>

132
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,379
<i>After Michelle was killed,
he figured I'd make a good recruit.</i>

133
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,915
And everyone else thinking you're dead,
so much the better.

134
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,052
Yeah.

135
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,495
And since then you've been working
undercover to expose his operation?

136
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,730
- No, Jack.
- What?

137
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,367
I was really working for him.

138
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,679
<i>I was angry.</i>

139
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,512
I hated the federal government
for what it took from me.

140
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,548
<i>I ran Emerson's crew
for more than three years...</i>

141
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,683
and I did some pretty bad things.

142
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,932
What made you turn against him?

143
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,937
The C.I.P. Device.

144
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,271
<i>Emerson had my crew stealing components
to breach the firewall.</i>

145
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,607
I knew what that meant.

146
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,205
<i>- Innocent Americans would die,
and I didn't sign up for that.
- Damn it, Tony.</i>

147
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,477
- Why didn't you call the authorities?
- He couldn't, Jack.

148
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,078
- Why not?
- He found out Emerson's client was Dubaku.

149
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,460
That's who you believe
has agents inside the government.

150
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,224
TheJuma regime controls
Sangala's vast diamond wealth.

151
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,231
<i>Dubaku hasn't been shy
about throwing it around.</i>

152
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,767
<i>- How widespread is the corruption?
- Pervasive.</i>

153
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:59,771
That's why Tony came to me. He didn't know
how far or high up this thing went.

154
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,670
Dubaku's the key to this thing, Jack.

155
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,606
<i>If we're gonna uncover the conspiracy...</i>

156
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,906
we have to get to him
before he leaves the U.S.

157
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,913
<i>That's why I have to get back under
as soon as possible.</i>

158
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:12,940
<i>There's a new job in the pipeline for me
and my crew. I don't have all the details...</i>

159
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,011
but I do know that it'll get me
in the same room with Dubaku himself.

160
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,114
Challenge is going to be
reinstalling Tony with Emerson.

161
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,787
We have to assume Emerson knew Tony was
in F.B.I. Custody and somehow managed to escape.

162
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:29,028
- Emerson's gonna think
Tony made a deal with the U.S. Attorney.
- That's right.

163
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:41,272
- I can help you with this.
- Yes, you can.

164
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,817
Outside of the three of you,
who else is involved in this operation?

165
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,219
It's just us. This is it.

166
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,859
Please at least tell me that you've got
some proof that this conspiracy exists.

167
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,366
Yes, we do.
But only at the lowest level.

168
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,199
At this point, we've just begun
to scratch the surface.

169
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:17,206
Okay. I'll work with you.

170
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,650
But only because right now,
you are the only people that I trust.

171
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,159
<i>You give me one reason to question that,
and I swear I will turn you in.</i>

172

You understand?

173
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,994
All right. Chloe,
set up the call with Emerson.

174
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,859
I found two freelancers
who might work- ex-Rangers.

175
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:39,598
- Trust 'em?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,573
I've worked with them before.
They're close. Litvak knows them too.

177
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,907
- Okay.
- They may want to know more about
the job before they sign on.

178
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,208
Only thing they need to know
is what it pays.

- Yeah, I heard.

who broke you out.

- That doesn't make any sense, Tony.

Bauer's working for them.
He helped capture you.

188
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,267
It's only because he didn't have a choice.
He's on board now.

Tanner's place, and we're good to go.

I'll do what has to be done.

- David.
- Good to see you.

299
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,200
Take Mr. Bauer downstairs.
I need to talk to Tony.

300
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,720
- What's going on?
- Bringing in Bauer is not worth the risk.

301
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,058
What are you talking about?

302
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,969
Have a seat.

303
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,596
Mr. Emerson'll be right with you.

304
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,580
I'd still be in F.B.I. Custody
if it wasn't for him.

305
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,413
- Tony, you already made your case.
- We can use him.

306
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,182
I considered it.
But I'm going a different way.

307
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,357
I owe him, David.
You understand that?

308
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,123
<i>[Emerson On Speaker] Yeah,
I appreciate your sense ofloyalty. I always have.</i>

309
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,131
<i>But this is business, Tony.</i>

310
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:32,193
You can't have a- an unknown factor like
Jack Bauer comin' in and messing things up.

311
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:39,574
So what?
You're gonna kill him?

312
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,812
No, you are.

313
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:49,318
- They're gonna kill him.
- He'll get out of it.

314
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,322
What if he can't?

315
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,723
Then Jack's death solidifies
Tony's position in the crew.

316
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,159
Tony was in F.B.I. Custody.

317
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,666
If he'd gone back in there by himself,
suspicion would have rested on him alone.

318
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,758
So by deflecting it ontoJack-

319
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,826
We keep Tony's cover viable.

You are recalling the invasion force.

Well, that determination
has yet to be made.

<i>And this device over
which Dubaku has control...</i>

it poses a significant risk
to your people?

366
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:41,784
Yes. It's a technology that has
the potential for mass civilian casualties.

367
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,321
And it puts the infrastructure
of my country in grave jeopardy.

00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,323
What of Sangala?

Believe me. No one is more aware

So you've been informed of the situation
in Kasanga Province?

371
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,564
Juma's troops are advancing
on a refugee camp.

Over 2,000 lives are threatened.

Mostly women and children.

who have, on the promise of American support...</i>

00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,237
deserted the regime and joined
my freedom fighters on the ground.

376
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:17,221
Please, provide us the weapons
we need in order to defend ourselves.

Madam President, I implore you.

381
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:36,565
- Do not abandon my country.
- Mr. Matobo, I will do everything that I can.

382
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:42,270
I count on you. Thank you.

383
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,587
You didn't think that I would want to know
about the refugees in Kasanga?

384
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,599
Madam President, you have enough to
think about without being burdened with details.

385
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,068
Especially details that might push me
toward proceeding with the invasion.

386
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:12,042
Ma'am, you have to start focusing
on alternatives to the invasion.

387
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,977
Give me a good alternative
and I'll consider it.

388
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:18,413
I'm not saying it's a good alternative,
but it's the only one.

389
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,385
Comply with Dubaku's demands.

390
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,581
Stand down the task force.

391
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:28,956
- That's your recommendation- back down?
- It is.

392
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,757
Damn it, Ethan.
You heard Matobo.

393
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,594
He has fighters on the ground
counting on us.

394
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,134
Do you want me to be responsible
for another Bay of Pigs?

395
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:41,138
Kennedy survived the Bay of Pigs,
and you'll survive this.

396
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:48,575
A superpower has to act first and foremost
in its own best interests.

397
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,411
- Always?
- Always. No apologies.

398
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,941
What about allowing a third party
to dictate its foreign policy?

399
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,954
Does a superpower do that?

400
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,320
Yes, if there's no other option.

401
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,484
And right now, there's not.

402
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,755
What have we heard from the F.B.I.
About the search for Almeida and Bauer?

403
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:12,132
- Nothing, ma'am.
- Check with them anyway.

404
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,773
No hard feelings, Jack.

405
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,314
Forget it.

406
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,510
Have to be careful in our profession.
I'm sure you understand.

407
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,112
- Yeah.
- We all know the drill.

410
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,558
I've heard a lot of guys say that.

411
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,691
Good to know you mean it.

412
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:51,808
Before you were subpoenaed, you traveled
the world, place to place, for more than a year.

413
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,071
Why?

414
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:59,081
- What were you looking for?
- Doesn't really matter.

415
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,084
Whatever it was, I didn't find it.

416
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,883
You must have known what was waiting.
Why'd you come back?

417
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,390
Wanted to know what it was like
to walk into a propeller.

418
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,189
That's funny.

419
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,752
But no, really.

420
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,891
Why?

421
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,237
This is my home.

422
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:25,434
That doesn't explain why you turned yourself in
to theJustice Department.

423
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,879
Tony said you were
in Beirut and Mogadishu.

424
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,341
And Afghanistan, two tours.

425
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,614
Went back a third time
as a private contractor.

426
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,680
<i>Be polite, professional...</i>

427
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,953
and have a plan
to kill everyone you meet, right?

428
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,222
Pretty much.

429
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,991
That's the question, isn't it-

430
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,761
where do the rules of engagement end
and the crimes begin?

431
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,736
You wanna know why I came back.
That's why.

432
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,035
I'm not sure I follow.

433
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,042
Just got tired of talking to myself.

434
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,237
See, I actually believe
everything I did was right.

435
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:06,113
So I wanted to start a dialogue,
come clean, set the record straight.

436
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,286
- First mistake.
- So I found out.

437
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:15,952
No one who hasn't been to the edge
and looked over could ever understand.

<i>Okay, let me check.</i>

442
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,179
What was that about?

443
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:39,978
He's just trying to get a handle on me.

444
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:44,283
<i>Watch yourself around him, Jack,
and do not underestimate him.</i>

445

Excuse me. Uh-huh.

593
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,399
We're trying to find our client, Mr Alan Tanner.

594
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,020
Just a minute.

595
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,460
I've got a ventilator malfunction.

596
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,010
Damn it! He's coding!

597
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,439
Get a team and a crash cart over here, stat!

598
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,110
Room 421, tanner.

599
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,719
It's blocked or something.

600
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,859
We have to get in there! I'm trying to!

601
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,999
It won't push. Hello?! Open this door!

602
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,809
This is an emergency!

603
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,819
I can't get the door open. It's jammed!

604
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,950
Is somebody in there with him?

605
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,479
He's all yours, counselor.

606
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,359
Wait a minute.

607
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,589
We need to talk to you!

608
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,439
Renee... You don't want to know, janis.

609
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,589
Don't ask.

610
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,960
Have agent alves drive you back to the office.

611
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,629
Hillinger.

612
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,989
Let me speak to larry.

613
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,510
Sir, I've got walker on the line.

614
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,909
Did you get anything?

615
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,219
I may have a lead on almeida.

616
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,279
Apparently, there's a plot in place

617
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,069
Against the former prime minister sangala. Matobo?

618
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,509
Tanner says almeida's crew has a plan to abduct him.

619
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,169
When

620
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,249
Pretty much now.

621
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,959
Listen, larry, if almeida's still a part of this

622
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,909
And we can get there before him, we can set a trap.

623
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,449
All right. I'll alert the prime minister's

624
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,629
Security detail and scramble a tac team.

625
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,379
Matobo's housed

626
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,949
Is in the state department residence

627
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:04,519
167 Foxhall road.

628
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,339
I'm on my way.

629
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,649
Renee, do not go in alone. Wait for backup.

630
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,910
Right.

631
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,699
Yes.

632
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,029
Is this major etolo?

633
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,789
It is.

634
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,609
This is special agent larry moss, fbi.

635
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,549
This is not a drill.

636
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,619
Alpha alpha delta. Lock the prime minister down.

637
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,399
I repeat, lock him down.

638
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,309
Yes, sir.

639
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,030
We're clear. Go.

640
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,449
Where's Matobo?!

641
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,469
I don't know...

642
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,250
Where is he?! Where is he?!

643
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,720
I got him!

644
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,889
Drop the weapon! Now!

645
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,319
Put the gun down!

646
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,800
On your knees!

647
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,639
Where is Matobo?

648
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,570
You will not be able to get to him now.

649
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,089
What is happening, Ule?

650
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,200
Who is doing this to us?

651
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,719
Stay calm.

652
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,650
It's going to be all right.

653
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,320
It's dead.

654
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,049
What you got?

655
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,650
It's a safe room; reinforced concrete.

656
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,450
Why the hell didn't we know about this?

657
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,959
You have three seconds to open the door.

658
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,620
One... I can't.

659
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,909
Two...

660
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,689
It can't be unlocked from the outside.

661
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,700
It can only be opened from the inside.

662
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,029
Jack, if we leave here without matobo,

663
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,760
We lose our only chance of getting at Dubaku.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
