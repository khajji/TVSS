<i>[Jack Bauer]</i>
<i>Previously on</i> 24.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,581
Without you, Sangala has no leader.

3
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,413
These people- they work
for Dubaku, don't they?

4
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:23,582
Mr. Matobo. We've accessed
the air intake to your safe room.

5
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,817
We're now feeding in
ammonium distearate gas.

6
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,725
- <i>If you do not open the door, you will die.</i>
- Ule.

00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:31,389
[Coughing]

8
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,932
Alama, no!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,969
Get him out of there!
Get the woman too.

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,698
- Mr. Taylor.
- Sam.

11
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,572
I can't stay long. They killed Roger
and made it look like a suicide.

12
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,974
- <i>[Taylor] Who are they?</i>
- I don't know who they are.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,240
They just said they would kill me
if I said anything.

14
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:51,044
Roger was tasked with auditing the brokers
in his department.

15
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:55,747
It's all here- account numbers,
trading records, everything that he knew.

16
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,223
Roger was looking into things
he shouldn't have.

17
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,593
<i>You killed my son.</i>

18
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,824
Tetradiazene, sir.

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,992
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

20
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,870
<i>Situation here is in control.</i>
<i>Are you tracking Ms. Roth?</i>

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,135
- Yeah.
- Time to get her back to her apartment.

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,340
- Ms. Roth. Henry Taylor sent me.
- Yes?

23
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,540
Mr. Taylor's been looking into
the matter you discussed.

24
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,674
- My God.
- He believes you're in imminent danger.

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,050
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

26
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:34,315
<i>Larry, it's Renee. I've got a visual on them</i>
<i>loading Matobo and his wife into a truck.</i>

27
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,487
- Where the hell is SWAT?
- They're still about five minutes out.

28
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,465
Drop the gun.
Far as I can tell, she's alone.

29
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,525
Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.

30
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,504
<i>Nichols wants her out of the way</i>
<i>before we deliver Matobo.</i>

31
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,508
- Kill her.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,009
Turn around.

33
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,341
If you trust me,
I will get you through this alive.

34
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,389
<i>[Jack Bauer] The following takes place</i>
<i>between 1:00 p.m. And 2:00 p.m.</i>

35
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:14,160
I want three more teams combing the site
where Matobo was abducted.

36
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,067
Pull 'em in from Regional if you have to.
We're gonna expand the search.

37
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:21,369
Coordinate with Metro Police
to set up a point-by-point grid
encompassing a 10-mile radius.

38
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,933
And talk with N.S.A. I wanna back all of
this up with synchronized satellite sweeps.

39
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,036
- I'll do what I can.
- What does that mean?

40
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,605
Well, every time I ask for something,
they pull that cloak and dagger nonsense.

41
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,776
I have to get approval
for every little scrap of data.

42
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,752
Janis, this isn't easy for anybody.

43
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,516
- Just please, make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,520
We know that another attack
could be imminent.

45
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:45,428
The only way to stop it is to find Almeida and
Bauer and take control of the C.I.P. Device.

46
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:53,597
Um, for those of you who haven't <i>heard...</i>

47
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,574
Renee Walker was abducted by these people.

48

[Murmuring]

49
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,881
We're the only chance she's got.

50
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,582
Well, let's get to work.

51
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:15,256
- What've you got?
- Audio forensics cleaned up the recording.

52
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,820
[Nichols's Voice] Walker is extraneous.
Kill her before you get here.

53
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,628
- <i>[Emerson's Voice] Okay. We'll be with you soon.</i>
- <i>Be quick about it.</i>

54
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,431
<i>Dubaku's anxious to get his hands</i>
<i>on the prime minister.</i>

55
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,337
We've been combing through it, looking
for a tag that'll give up their location.

56
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,571
- So far, nothing.
- Is there anybody else you can put on this?

57
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,135
Larry, I don't think it's worth it.
There's nothing here.

58
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,581
- All right. Fine. HelpJanis coordinate with N.S.A.
- I'm sorry about Renee, Larry.

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,609
- <i>She was a good agent.</i>
- We don't know that she's dead yet!

60
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,249
- All right?
- All right.

61
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,429
Just-

62
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,146
Are you sure this is it?

63
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,708
She's gonna run out of air.

64
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,380
[Buchanan]
Tony said near the backhoe.

65
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,447
Here.

66
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,817
I got her, Chloe. I got her.

67
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,059
All right. Here she is. Here she is.

68
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,966
She's not breathing.
Give me the adrenaline.

69
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,529
- [Gasping, Coughing]
- It's all right.

70
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,939
You're okay. You're okay.

71
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,571
- Who are you?
- We're working with Jack.

72
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,172
He told us where to find you.
It's gonna be okay.

73
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,118
Take deep breaths.
You're gonna be okay.

74
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,122
<i>[Emerson] We're close to the</i>
<i>rendezvous point. What's your E.T.A.</i>

75
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,762
Good.

76
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,438
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

77
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,673
It's all set.

78
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,311
Nichols is on his way with the diamonds.

79
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,589
Something bothering you, Jack?

80
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:08,800
You know, I was wondering why you never
told Tony how you got him out of C.T.U.

81
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,800
How did you do it?

82
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,344
Christopher Henderson.

83
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,575
Christopher Henderson tried to kill him.

84
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,483
Henderson had no intention
of killing Tony.

85
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,522
He purposely missed the artery
when he injected him.

86
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,253
It was just enough to slow his heart to the point
where you'd think that he was dead.

87
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,627
My job was to extract and revive <i>him...</i>

88
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,690
and use him against you.

89
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,599
And?

90
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,974
By the time I stabilized him,
you'd already killed Henderson.

91
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,636
<i>The mission had failed,</i>
<i>so my team went dark.</i>

92
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,272
Why didn't you just let Tony go?

93
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,374
Tony chose to stay with us.

94
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:08,522
He was consumed with hatred and anger over
what the government had done to Michelle.

95
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,260
Anyway, I talked to him.

96
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,337
<i>More importantly, I listened to him.</i>

97
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:28,304
Pretty soon,
he came to realize that I was right.

98
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,947
About what?

99
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,009
That the rules had changed.

100
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,089
That there was nothing such as honor left.

101
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,824
That we would have to
take care of each other.

102
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:56,174
- Like brothers.
- <i>[Litvak] Mr. Emerson.</i>

103
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,403
- Yeah?
- <i>We're almost there.</i>

104
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,375
How's the deal gonna go down?

105
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,850
Don't worry, Jack.
You're about to find out.

106
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,123
Are you ready?

107
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,865
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

108
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,237
Yeah.

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,230
Go help Litvak with the door.

110
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,840
- Go get the Matobos.
- Yeah.

111
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,921
- You better tell me what the hell's goin' on.
- Drop the gun, David.

112
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,517
I just couldn't figure out your <i>play...</i>

113
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,152
so I tried to give you some time
so you'd come clean.

114
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,629
- <i>'Cause we are like brothers, right, Tony?</i>
- Put the gun down, David.

115
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,826
You actually think that I would let you
steal those diamonds from me?

116
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,960
It's not about the diamonds.

117
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,301
It's about killing innocent people.
I can't let you finish this.

118
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,272
Take the shot.

119
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,504
- Put down the weapon, or I will kill him.
- Tony, take the shot!

120
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,705
- Shut up, Jack!
- <i>[Emerson] Put it down, or he's dead!</i>

121
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,011
- David, I don't want to kill you, but I will!
- Damn it, Tony! Drop the-

122
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,856
- <i>[Gagging]</i>
- You okay?

123
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,332
Yeah. David?

124
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,880
Okay, you say Bauer and Almeida are working
undercover, but C.T.U. Has been shut down.

125
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,043
So, I mean, if you're telling the truth,
who's running this operation?

126
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,883
We are.
We're not working with any agency.

127
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,220
We believe there's been widespread
infiltration of the <i>government...</i>

128
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,420
by Dubaku and theJuma regime.

129
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,827
Okay. I need to contact my boss.

130
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,695
- He needs to know that I'm okay.
- You can't do that.

131
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,065
- Why not?
- Dubaku has informants in the F.B.I.

132
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:42,039
If they found out you're alive,
they'll know Jack is working against them.

133
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,599
- You don't know who you can trust.
- I can trust Agent Moss.

134
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,238
You're not listening to me.
You cannot contact the F.B.I.

135
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,181
You will jeopardize this operation,
and I won't let you do that.

136
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,276
Well, I don't work for you.
I work for Larry. Now, give me a phone.

137
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:58,517
- Sit still, please.
- We're nearing the endgame.

138
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:04,257
Dubaku is the key to finding out who
in the government has been corrupted.

139
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,096
Luckily,
we have something he wants.

140
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,260
Matobo?

141
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,737
He's our best chance to locate Dubaku,
reacquire the C.I.P. <i>Module...</i>

142
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,933
and get to the bottom
of the government corruption.

143
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,636
Until all that happens,
you have to stay dead.

144

<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>

145
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,244
- Yeah?
- [Jack] Did you find Agent Walker?

146
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,408
Yeah, we got her, Jack.
She's fine. Where are you?

I need you to get over here now.
- Have you talked to Matobo?

149
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,717
- Not yet.
- He needs to agree to this.
We can't do it without him.

150
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,252
I'll get him to agree.
Just get over here.

151
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,063
It's all right.

152
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,139
What the hell is going on?

153
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,009
Mr. Matobo, I'm not gonna
hurt you or your wife.

154
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:59,142
I know how scared you are, and I know what
you've been through, but we are here to help you.

155
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,846
What in God's name are you talking about?
You kidnapped us!

156
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,617
We had to, to gain Dubaku's trust.
That's the man we're after.

157
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,284
We're trying to stop him.

158
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:11,352
- I want to call my people.
- I can't let you do that.
Not until you hear me out.

159
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,127
Sir, we have a plan to stop Dubaku,
but we can't do it without your help.

160
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,831
We don't have much time.
Please, come with me.

161
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,375
<i>[Nichols]</i>
<i>Mr. Dubaku.</i>

162
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,480
I'm heading to the meeting place.
They're bringing Matobo now.

163
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,778
- And his wife?
- Both of them.

164
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,512
Once you have Matobo,
you know what to do.

165
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,216
Emerson's team is now a loose end.
Tie it off.

166
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,383
Are you sure about this?

167
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,257
We may need their services again.

168
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,321
I would rather keep my diamonds.

169
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,492
And Almeida has proved to be a liability.

170
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,369
<i>So...</i> any response from the White House?

171
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,843
Not the one we wanted.
American forces are still in position.

172
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,175
President Taylor
must know we have Matobo.

173
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,238
She can't attack Sangala without him.

174
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,943
The country would collapse.

175
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:10,682
Taylor may be holding out hope
that she can somehow retrieve Matobo.

176
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:15,284
Or she doesn't believe we are willing
to carry out our threats.

177
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,057
She will only respond
when there are dead Americans.

178
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,394
I'll call you when I have Matobo.

179
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,458
These gentlemen
are at your command.

180
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,141
There are still 1,300 planes in the air.

181
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,475
Which region do you want targeted?

182
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,780
Washington, D.C.

183
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,877
[Beeping]

184
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,525
<i>[Beeping]</i>

185
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,238
Yeah.

186
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,969
Yeah. I understand, Bob.

187
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,375
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

188
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,913
That was Bob Cornell at N.S.A.

189
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,382
- They've detected another firewall breach.
- There's been another attack?

190
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,148
Not yet, but they believe
the C.I.P. Device is being utilized.

191
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,623
We have to assume Dubaku
is initiating another attack.

192
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,388
It's safe to say this won't be
another warning shot.

193
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,397
This time, Dubaku's gonna
make sure that people die.

194
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,933
I want to speak personally with all
first responders across the country.

195
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,805
They need to know to brace for the worst
and that they have our full support.

196
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,867
Instead of preparing for <i>it...</i>

197
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,778
maybe we should be trying to preempt
this attack, Madam President.

198
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:47,717
The deadline Dubaku gave us for withdrawing
our troops from Sangala has passed.

199
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,777
But if we made some kind of <i>gesture...</i>

200
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,519
<i>began an immediate pullback, it might</i>
<i>keep Dubaku from pulling the trigger.</i>

201
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,460
We've discussed this, Ethan.
It's not an option.

202
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,997
I won't be dictated to
by this madman.

203
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,592
<i>Madam President, we can't</i>
<i>invade Sangala without Matobo.</i>

204
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,161
<i>And there's very little chance</i>
<i>ofhim being recovered.</i>

205
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,173
Why are we risking American lives?

206
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,210
I've told you my reasons.

207
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,112
I implore you, withdraw our forces
before it's too late.

208
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,779
You asked me to be your adviser because you
trust my opinion. I'm givin' it to you now.

209
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,051
- <i>We're out of options.</i>
- We're not, Ethan.

210
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,026
The N.S.A. Is attempting to <i>localize...</i>

211
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,858
what part of the infrastructure
is being <i>targeted...</i>

212
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,197
and the F.B.I. Is still trying
to track down the C.I.P. Device.

213
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,405
I'll keep an open channel
with both agencies.

214
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,136
- I'll keep you apprised.
- Good.

215
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,478
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

216
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,519
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,178
[Panting]

218
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,225
Let me see it. Let me see it!

219
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,990
This wasn't about the diamonds, David.

220
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,727
You crossed a line
I wasn't willing to cross.

221
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,296
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,363
You're looking for forgiveness.

223
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,110
Go to hell.

224
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,374
You live with it.

225
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,018
<i>[Gagging]</i>

226
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,353
<i>[Matobo]</i>
<i>You are asking us to risk our lives...</i>

227
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,622
to be delivered into Dubaku's hands,
based on nothing but what you have told us.

228
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,720
<i>Everything I have told you is the truth.</i>

229
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,766
Dubaku is in this country,
and we need to find him.

230
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,826
You have as much at stake as we do.
He's attacked both our countries.

231
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,837
Listen to him, Ule.

232
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:50,739
You told me yourself President Taylor
will not commit forces to <i>Sangala...</i>

233
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,970
until these attacks are stopped.

234
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:58,381
- But how can we trust this man?
- Because he has no reason to lie.

235
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,752
I will do what you ask,
but I will go alone.

236
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,796
Dubaku wants you and your wife.
That's the deal.

237
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,799
No. I will not put my wife
in the hands of that monster.

238
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,893
I will be honest with you, sir.
He wants your wife as leverage.

239
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,598
If I don't deliver both of you,
he will back out.

240
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,640
Leverage?

241
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,769
You mean he want to torture her to make me tell
him what I know about the resistance in Sangala?

242
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,905
Yes, sir. And we won't let that happen.
We'll be following you.

243
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,076
Still, you can't promise me that
she won't be harmed, can you?

244
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,520
Can you?

245
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:40,492
I won't do it.

246
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:46,256
- May I speak with my husband?
- Of course, ma'am.

247
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,263
- I want to do this, Ule.
- What?

248
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,500
I am ashamed that I opened
the door to the safe room.

249
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,304
I want to do what is right
for our country.

250
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:02,541
- Absolutely not.
- You can't stop me, Ule.

251
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,549
Sangala is my country too.

252
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:09,280
I have been by your side for 22 years.

253
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,881
I am not going to leave it now.

Mr. Bauer.

255
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,634
We will do this together.

00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,007
Thank you.

257
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,569
You are both very brave.

258
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,048

Excuse me for one moment.

Yeah.

264
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,588
We're locked onto the F.A.A. Node.

265
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,131
Begin rerouting the targets.

266
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,494
R.S.A. 471,
turn right, heading 2-7-4.

267
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,769
Descend and maintain
flight level 2-7-0.

268
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,709
Call the White House.

<i>The latest report from the N.S.A.</i>

271
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,917
They've had no luck
in localizing the firewall breach.

272
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,894
Dubaku's attack could hit anywhere.

- And what about the F.B.I.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

274
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,799
They've dedicated every available agent
to the manhunt for Matobo.

275
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,772
- <i>They're no closer to finding him.</i>
- Excuse me.

We're at a dead end,
Madam President.

277
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,513
You need to order the pullback,
and you need to order it now.

00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,609
<i>Can it be traced? Yeah.</i>

279

<i>Hold on. Madam President?</i>

What is it, Tim?

281
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,620
I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.
It's from Colonel Dubaku.

<i>He's demanding to speak with you.</i>

I'll take it.

This is President Taylor.

Madam <i>President...</i>

I'm disappointed that you have not
taken my demands seriously.

Your forces are still in position

Colonel Dubaku, I assure <i>you...</i>

00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,581
we've had very serious discussions
regarding your demands.

290
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,887
The time for discussions is over.

291
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:05,191
<i>The deadline for your forces to begin</i>
<i>their withdrawal has passed.</i>

<i>Look to the southwest, Madam President.</i>

00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:51,430
He's dead. So's Litvak and Bauer.

449
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:55,240
I got 'em in a back room.
You wanna say hi?

You better start telling me
what the hell is going on.

451
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,686
I decided I'd rather not split the cut.

00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:06,450
Well, I don't understand.
I thought you and Emerson were friends.

00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:11,188
Yeah, that's before
he left me to rot with the F.B.I.

- Close.

456

All right?

463

Okay then.
