<i>That orderly you were looking for-</i>

296
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,610
One of our parking lot cameras
picked him up getting into his car.

297
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,122
- When?
- <i>Uh, about 15 minutes ago.</i>

298
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,624
I've got a screen grab of his license plate.

299
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:12,391
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

300
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:16,491
This is Agent Walker.
Put me through to our D.M.V. Contact.

301
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,342
Are you busy?

302
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,901
I'm just reformatting the server,
so, yeah, I guess I am busy. Why?

303
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,176
Well, I was cross-referencing
Dubaku's offshore <i>accounts...</i>

304
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,480
- and I came across an orphaned header fragment.
- What are you talking about?

305
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,543
Take a look.

306
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:43,817
Okay. See? There it- Right there, right there.
It's a remnant file header.

307
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,660
It's probably just a phantom data string.

308
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,599
No, it isn't. I ran a system analysis.

309
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,694
The coding is not random.
It can be traced back to one of the accounts.

310
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,298
<i>Also, it looks like a name</i>
<i>was deleted from the list.</i>

311
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,536
- Why don't I run a recovery program?
- <i>Well, you're very busy...</i>

312
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,544
with the reformatting and all.

313
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,672
So why don't I just upload it to my station
and take care of it there?

314
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,877
Oh, that's okay. I can do it faster.

315
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:11,048
No offense. L-
I'll let you know if I retrieve anything.

She's a woman in a highly emotional state.
Her husband's been shot.

Yeah, that's fine.

She's supposed to be this

356
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,596
which is actually what tipped me off

I ran a systems check on her <i>work...</i>

and it turns out
there's evidence of file tampering.

360
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,673
Plus, she's been scrambling
all her out-of-office phone calls.

361

Let me just remind you, Madam <i>President...</i>

you supported the effort

These past 10 hours, <i>Senator...</i>

Well, there's nothing gray aboutJack Bauer.

The man has committed atrocities.
Prisoners have died in his custody.

382
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:11,026
Mr. Bauer has served under the aegis
of three presidents, not just me.

383
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:16,193
Is it any more lawful or any less repugnant
if it's authorized at the highest level?

384
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,203
A state of war is not a blank check
for the president or for anyone.

Oh, don't lecture me, Senator.

386
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,037
I am well aware of the limits of my power.

387
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:28,045
Due respect, Madam President,
your power is great.

388
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,748
Just be careful that you use it
to send the right message.

389

All I'm asking you to do
is excuse Mr. Bauer as a witness.

390
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:41,648
It's not a message. It is an expression
of gratitude for what he's done today.

<i>You're asking me to excuse him</i>
<i>as a target of the investigation.</i>

Under certain circumstances,

Some would argue that they are.

395
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:01,738
And they would be wrong
under any military or moral standard.

America has been down this road before,
Madam President.

00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,035
I know it sounds crazy,
but I swear that I just saw him.

585
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,041
What? Here? Are you sure?

586
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,806
- Unless he has an identical twin.
- All right, I'll alert Homeland.

587
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,370
Good work. Any idea what the next target is?

588
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,973
- Negative.
- See if you can get a fix on that.

589
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,645
But listen. Don't take any chances, all right?

590
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,211
I won't.

00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,267
- [Man] They're running a check now, sir.
- Okay, thank you.

594
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,542
<i>Sir, you should have an E.M.T.</i>
<i>Take a look at you.</i>

595
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,674
I'm fine. Is Bauer in custody?

596
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,718
- Yes, sir. He's in holding.
- That'll be all.

<i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>

599
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,294
- Tony, it's Bill.
- Bill.

600
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,697
Jack's under arrest. They've got him
locked down in a holding cell here.

601
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,462
- Listen to me, Bill.
- No, <i>you</i> listen.

602
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,335
- We still don't know
where this attack's taking place.
- Burnett didn't break?

603
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,239
No. They stopped Jack before
he could get the information.

604
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,336
And Burnett didn't go
for the president's immunity deal.

605
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,904
- You were the one who brought
Jack the intel, right?
- That's right.

606
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:07,246
- How real is it?
- Very.

607
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,252
Who was your contact?

608
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,811
He was a guy in Emerson's crew
with a direct line toJuma.

609
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,550
Any chance we get another crack at this guy?

610
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,854
That's highly unlikely,
to say the least.

611
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:20,329
- What are you telling me? He's dead?
- That's right.

612
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,563
I wish to God you'd brought me in on this.

613
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,568
Jack didn't wanna put you in that position.

614
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,695
For what it's worth,
he was trying to protect you, Bill.

615
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,899
Did you have a fallback plan, at least?

616
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,204
Immunity for Burnett <i>was</i> the fallback.

617
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,369
That's it? Nothing else?

618
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:38,347
No. Nothing.

619
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,753
I keep trying Renee.
I keep getting her voice mail.

620
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,948
- What the hell's goin' on?
- There's something wrong with her phone.

621
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,287
What do you mean, something's wrong?
I spoke to her five minutes ago.

622
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,724
Can you triangulate her position?

623
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:51,625
- I can't.
- Why not?

624
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:56,724
There's no signal. Either the battery's dead,
or her cell got damaged somehow.

625
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,237
All right, keep trying.
Get back to me when you know something.

626
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:02,636
Okay.
