1
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,695
Ken Dellao, CNB.

2
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:17,864
I'm wondering if you can
confirm some information.

3
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:21,768
I'm gonna be reporting in
this evening's broadcast

4
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:23,870
that a rogue ex-federal
agent named Jack Bauer

5
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:26,673
is the prime suspect in
the murder of Ryan Burnett.

6
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:30,576
You leaked this story of Burnett's
murder and my involvement to the press.

7
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:34,380
So another one of your errors in
judgment bites you on the ass.

8
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,815
You've gone too far this time.

9
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:38,450
Renee, it's Jack.
Don't hang up the phone, please.

10
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:40,510
Whatever they told you,
I did not kill Burnett.

11
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,729
I sent you a photo
of the man who did.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,723
All I want you to
do is make an ID.

13
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:47,364
John Quinn,
Black Ops combat vet.

14
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:48,923
He works for Starkwood.

15
00:00:49,095 --> 00:00:50,192
Starkwood work with Juma?

16
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:51,762
If they did,
it wasn't on the books.

17
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:53,833
You know, if anyone knows,
it's Senator Mayer.

18
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,032
Renee, where's Bauer?

19
00:00:57,205 --> 00:00:59,003
I don't know.
Don't you lie to me.

20
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:01,302
We know you accessed a
classified government database

21
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,442
and sent someone's name
and address to Bauer.

22
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:04,542
Tell me where he is.

23
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:05,713
I can't.

24
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:06,911
Put her in holding.

25
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:08,913
Mirandize her.

26
00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:11,951
If Bauer connects us to Juma, it
could seriously impede this operation.

27
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,951
Yes, it could.

28
00:01:14,127 --> 00:01:15,952
Is the shipment on time?

29
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:18,851
Yes. Due into port
in the next hour.

30
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:22,223
Once the weapons are deployed,
then it doesn't matter what Mr. Bauer

31
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:23,731
or anyone else knows.

32
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:25,390
I didn't kill Burnett.

33
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:26,433
This man did.

34
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:27,763
His name is John Quinn.

35
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:29,733
He works for Starkwood.

36
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:31,933
And what does Starkwood
have to do with this?

37
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:33,993
Your informant claims
that Starkwood was trying

38
00:01:34,168 --> 00:01:36,573
to acquire a bioweapon,
and that's your connection to Juma.

39
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:39,470
You've been trying to dismantle
Starkwood for the last six months.

40
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:42,713
If they have a weapon like this, you
better believe they intend to use it.

41
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:45,851
No!

42
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:50,983
Just tell me where the
weapons are coming in.

43
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:53,153
You're too late.

44
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:55,693
They're already here.

45
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:34,832
(sighs) Sir?

46
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,603
Preliminary sweep of the
immediate area's done.

47
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:40,600
There's no sign of Bauer.

48
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:41,821
All right, widen the grid.

49
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,241
And run down security cameras
around the perimeter, witnesses.

50
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,143
Somebody must have seen him.

51
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:48,583
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,162
Yes?

53
00:03:04,335 --> 00:03:05,961
Mr. Kanin, it's Larry Moss.

54
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:10,270
Agent Moss, please tell me you
have Jack Bauer in custody.

55
00:03:10,436 --> 00:03:14,270
I wish that were the case, Mr.
Kanin, but the truth is...

56
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,773
Sir, it's Senator Mayer.

57
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,540
He's dead.

58
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:22,410
What?!

59
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:24,012
He was murdered at his house.

60
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:27,033
We only found out that Bauer was on
his way over here a short time ago.

61
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,651
Unfortunately, we
got here too late.

62
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:29,720
Wait a minute.

63
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:35,163
Are you telling me that Jack Bauer
just killed a United States Senator?

64
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:37,660
That's the assumption that
we're working under, yes, sir.

65
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,202
How could you have
let this happen?!

66
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,303
He had us all fooled, sir.

67
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,873
I released Jack Bauer
into your custody!

68
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:49,540
I ordered you to keep
him on a short leash!

69
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,410
No, no. Mr. Kanin, you are not
gonna lay this one at my feet.

70
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:54,913
It was your decision to give
Bauer access to Burnett.

71
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,381
I advised you against it.

72
00:03:59,427 --> 00:04:01,421
Mr. Kanin?

73
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:09,023
I'm sorry.
Uh, what did you say?

74
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:13,390
I said,
I advised you against it.

75
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:16,333
Yes, you did.

76
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:20,941
Sir, I have teams
sweeping the area.

77
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:23,102
Just find him, Agent Moss.

78
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:24,240
Yeah, I will.

79
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,762
Starkwood was involved with
everything that happened today.

80
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,660
They were the ones that
helped Juma and his men

81
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,403
bring down those planes
and attack the White House.

82
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:55,472
In exchange, they were allowed to
develop and manufacture a WMD
in Sangala.

83
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:56,672
It's a bioweapon.

84
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,540
Apparently, it's
already here in the US.

85
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,842
Who else knows about this?

86
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:02,841
No one. Senator Mayer and I were
piecing together the information

87
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:04,252
right before he was killed.

88
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:05,851
You said the weapon's
already here.

89
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,151
Are they in possession of it?

90
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:08,983
I don't think so.
The text message I got

91
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:12,323
off their agent's cell phone said,
"Port of Alexandria, Lot C, 10:15 p.m."

92
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:15,123
Why don't we just call the FBI
and lock the whole place down?

93
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,292
Because we're fugitives, Tony.

94
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:17,593
No one's going to believe us.

95
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:20,802
We need to know exactly where that
weapon is before we call anyone else in.

96
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:23,302
Tony, I need to know if
you're with me on this.

97
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:25,930
Yeah, I'm with you.

98
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,833
Okay. Meet me at the
north end of the port.

99
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,640
There's an access road right
before the main entrance.

100
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,273
All right, I'll be there.

101
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,352
It's over.

102
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:39,883
Dubaku and Juma are dead.

103
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:44,293
Everyone responsible for
the terrorist attacks...

104
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:47,563
responsible for Roger.

105
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:51,391
Thank God for that.

106
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:54,202
And there's...
there's something else.

107
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:57,832
Something good that's
come out of all of this.

108
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:01,643
Olivia is here at
the White House.

109
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:03,200
Olivia?

110
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:06,470
She's come home, Henry.

111
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:11,080
The crisis--
it brought us together.

112
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:15,953
I've asked her to stay on as Special
Advisor, and-and she's agreed.

113
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,050
Ally...

114
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,093
I can't begin to tell you
how happy that makes me.

115
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,862
Me, too.

116
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,103
Sweetheart, I know
that you're tired.

117
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,862
You should get some rest.

118
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:33,003
Olivia and I will come to the
hospital just as soon as we can.

119
00:06:33,178 --> 00:06:35,040
When you can.

120
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,913
I'm not going anywhere.

121
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:41,182
Give Olivia my love.

122
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,913
Love you.

123
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:46,111
We love you, too.

124
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:56,492
The doctors expect him
to make a full recovery.

125
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:01,003
Henry's a lot tougher
than anyone thought.

126
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:07,142
Oh, maybe, maybe, maybe, just maybe,
this day will end on a positive note.

127
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,382
What is it, Ethan?
What's wrong?

128
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:24,493
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Madam President, but Senator Mayer
is dead.

129
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,952
What happened?

130
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:32,663
All evidence points to the fact
that he was murdered by Jack Bauer.

131
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:34,731
Bauer?

132
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:37,073
It's hard to believe, I know.

133
00:07:37,235 --> 00:07:38,932
It-It doesn't make any sense.

134
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:41,941
After everything
he has done today,

135
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:43,841
why on earth would he do this?

136
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:48,743
We'll know more
when we find him.

137
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,841
My God.

138
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:57,550
Madam President,
in light of what's happened,

139
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,252
and for the sake of
your administration,

140
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:03,323
I'm afraid I have no choice but
to resign as your Chief of Staff.

141
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:04,491
Ethan!

142
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:09,261
Madam President, please,
you need to hear this.

143
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:15,340
Inevitably, it'll come to light that I
sanctioned Bauer's release from custody.

144
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:21,019
Unless I step down immediately, the
damage to your office, and
you personally,

145
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,353
will be extensive.

146
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:28,624
Ethan, Olivia has already
killed this story once today.

147
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:31,192
We can control the damage.

148
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,390
No.

149
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:36,990
No, not even Olivia
can control it now.

150
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,992
Not after the senator's murder.

151
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:49,002
The truth is, Madam President,
I didn't do enough to protect you.

152
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,612
The truth is, I failed you.

153
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,280
And I should shoulder the
blame for what's happened.

154
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:57,851
Ethan, really, you're...

155
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,252
you're taking this too far.

156
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,250
Am I?

157
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:04,323
I'm not so sure.

158
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:09,561
As your daughter has made abundantly
clear, I have a lot to answer for.

159
00:09:09,738 --> 00:09:14,260
You have done nothing but be
an invaluable advisor to me

160
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:15,730
and an even better friend.

161
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:21,573
I appreciate you saying that,
Madam President, but Olivia's right.

162
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:24,511
The political
knives will be out.

163
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:27,482
Every decision I've made
will be scrutinized.

164
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:31,710
There will be calls for
a special prosecutor.

165
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:38,053
You're a great woman, Allison.

166
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:42,893
You have great work yet to do.

167
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:47,262
I'm a liability to you now.

168
00:09:47,437 --> 00:09:51,430
Don't let me compromise your
next three years in office.

169
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:55,303
Don't let me sink your agenda.

170
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:57,772
<i>Our agenda, Ethan.</i>

171
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:04,011
Yes.

172
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,210
Our agenda.

173
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:15,721
Trust me, Madam President,
it's the right thing to do.

174
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,791
Accept my resignation.

175
00:10:31,678 --> 00:10:34,742
I'll have a letter on
your desk in the morning.

176
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:52,763
They're gonna be
here any minute.

177
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,603
We need to narrow
down the search.

178
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:58,002
If they offloaded it today,
it should still be on the storage dock.

179
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,132
That's still a needle
in a haystack, Jack.

180
00:11:00,306 --> 00:11:02,970
There must be over a thousand
containers in there.

181
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:05,043
We need to access
the yard's manifest.

182
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:06,540
What's the security?

183
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:09,040
I've spotted one Port Authority officer.
That's it?

184
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:10,780
That's it.

185
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,210
There's got to be more.

186
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:13,712
Come on, let's go.

187
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:16,382
Honey, it'll be fine.

188
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,123
I get relieved in a few hours.

189
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,553
Carl, you know I don't like
you working double shifts.

190
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:22,293
Well, it was my choice.

191
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:23,821
And we could use the overtime.

192
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:24,960
How are the girls?

193
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:26,892
Kicking like a
chorus line tonight.

194
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:28,762
They miss their daddy.

195
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,132
What'd the doctor say?

196
00:11:30,307 --> 00:11:31,972
That I'm lucky
it's not triplets.

197
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,572
Honey, let me call you back.

198
00:12:08,448 --> 00:12:11,203
Don't even think about
going for your weapon.

199
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,740
I need the port's manifest.
Where is it?

200
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:18,381
I'm just a PA cop.

201
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:19,953
Where is it?

202
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:22,120
Customs House.

203
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,493
That way.

204
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,991
Let's go.

205
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,200
We on schedule?

206
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:40,192
STOKES (on phone):
We're at the staging area

207
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,191
near the port, sir,
but we're still waiting on Quinn.

208
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:43,631
He should have
been there by now.

209
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:44,762
Have you heard from him?

210
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:46,862
We've tried his cell,
but he's not answering.

211
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:52,472
If Bauer took out Quinn, he might
have knowledge of the operation.

212
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,071
Mightn't he?

213
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:56,243
Should we stand down, sir?

214
00:12:57,748 --> 00:13:01,982
No. Give Quinn five more minutes,
then go in.

215
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:06,422
Do so with extreme caution
then contact me the minute

216
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,991
that you've secured
the container.

217
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:09,420
Yes, sir.

218
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:11,923
SEATON: Everybody on
the board is here, sir.

219
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,060
You have a worried look, Greg.

220
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:17,263
It's very tense in there, sir.

221
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:19,430
They're six-year-olds, Greg.

222
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:21,431
And they need to
eat their carrots.

223
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:34,943
It's been a rough day for
the United States of America.

224
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:38,520
The White House under siege,
the President taken hostage...

225
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:41,221
It's especially painful because
we know this didn't have to be.

226
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:46,791
Fact: the United States military
is strained to the breaking point.

227
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:52,861
Fact: reinstatement of the draft is
off the table for political reasons.

228
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:55,901
Fact: the people in this room,
you all control

229
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,302
the largest private army
in the Western hemisphere.

230
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:01,510
Now, could we have
been of help today?

231
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:04,710
You bet your ass we
could've been of help!

232
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,380
But they didn't call us,
did they?

233
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,381
No. Instead, we sit here,
our contracts are canceled,

234
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:13,382
our soldiers vilified,
our corporate sovereignty

235
00:14:13,558 --> 00:14:15,552
is threatened by
congressional fiat.

236
00:14:15,725 --> 00:14:17,963
Doug, you brokered the
deal with this government.

237
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:21,363
You were short-sighted and they
don't understand that the global war

238
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:24,600
on terror can only be
won by forces like ours.

239
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,202
So as of this minute,
we sit for no more depositions.

240
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:29,703
We volunteer no more documents.

241
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:32,801
I don't even want us to take any phone
calls. Is that what this is about?

242
00:14:32,975 --> 00:14:35,370
With the security of our country,
Is that what this is about?

243
00:14:35,476 --> 00:14:37,073
we cannot afford to
let them take us down.

244
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:38,511
Is that what this
is about then?

245
00:14:38,617 --> 00:14:44,051
You came here to ask the board
to risk a federal indictment?

246
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:45,853
It won't work, Jonas.

247
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:47,521
We got a deal.

248
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:50,521
It's a good deal and
we're lucky to have it.

249
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,921
With an administration
that wants to destroy us.

250
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:54,462
Wants to take us
out of business.

251
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:56,530
No, it's all different now.

252
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:57,701
Today was a game-changer.

253
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:01,932
No, institutionally,
we are in compliance with the subpoena.

254
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:04,402
Documents have been filed,
depositions taken.

255
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,571
Not anymore.

256
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:10,112
Jonas, we have to stay engaged with this
administration. No, we don't, Doug.

257
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,142
So look,
you and I can talk this out.

258
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:15,280
If you guys have any questions,
any further questions, Greg, you will

259
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,900
stick around and
you'll answer them.

260
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,180
Thank you for coming everyone.

261
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,583
Thank you.

262
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,991
Your way was a mistake, Doug.

263
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,702
You have to acknowledge that.

264
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:34,600
Maybe. But you and I both know
that Starkwood cannot survive

265
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:36,730
an all-out war against
the subcommittee.

266
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,101
Let me worry about that.

267
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,312
No, you should worry
about Senator Mayer.

268
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:43,211
He's not going to
let go of this.

269
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,711
He's got his teeth in it.

270
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,853
Senator Mayer's dead.

271
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:54,221
He was killed by a rogue federal
agent not one hour ago, tragically.

272
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:59,520
Jonas.

273
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:07,103
Tell me you had nothing
to do with this.

274
00:16:08,737 --> 00:16:13,601
Are you accusing me of complicity
in the murder of Senator Mayer?

275
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:16,212
I want a personal assurance.

276
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:22,580
Starkwood is not in the business
of political assassination, Doug.

277
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:25,923
Though maybe we
should look into it.

278
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,092
I hear it's a growth market.

279
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:42,773
Jack, you finding anything?
12 ships were unloaded here today.

280
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:46,773
Any from Sangala? There's no deepwater
port in that area of West Africa.

281
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,441
If the weapon
originated from there,

282
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:51,882
it would've had to overland
into Pointe-Noire.

283
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,043
Where...

284
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:58,423
two of the 12 ships acquired cargo from
that port within the last four weeks.

285
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,422
Come on.

286
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:04,963
Come on. Damn it!

287
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:06,860
What is it? I can't access

288
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:09,191
their manifests;
their database is password protected.

289
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:15,402
What's your name, officer?

290
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:16,501
Gadsen.

291
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:17,732
Carl Gadsen.

292
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:20,170
I don't have any information
about a password.

293
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,273
Carl, I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

294
00:17:22,448 --> 00:17:24,641
The same terrorists who took
down two planes earlier today

295
00:17:24,748 --> 00:17:27,242
and attacked the White House are trying
to acquire a weapon of mass destruction.

296
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,083
They're coming here to
pick up that weapon.

297
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:32,320
It's somewhere out there in your
yard in one of those canisters.

298
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:34,223
Look, I understand
this might be hard

299
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:36,493
for you to believe.
No, actually, it's not.

300
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,092
You don't have a lot of time.

301
00:17:38,268 --> 00:17:39,593
What do you mean?

302
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:40,893
They are coming.

303
00:17:41,065 --> 00:17:42,930
In fact,
they should be here already.

304
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:44,533
Keep talking, Carl.

305
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:47,831
They told me they were smuggling
in electronics from South Korea.

306
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:48,872
I swear.

307
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,670
I had no idea they
were terrorists.

308
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,473
What'd you agree
to do for them?

309
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,202
Open the front gate.
Look the other way.

310
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,342
Is that it?

311
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:57,713
Disable the security cameras.

312
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:00,013
A yard this size should
have more police officers.

313
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,881
Where are they?
I'm the supervisor.

314
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,383
I do the shift schedules.

315
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:05,722
I made sure I'd be
the only one here.

316
00:18:05,886 --> 00:18:07,251
That's enough
confirmation for me.

317
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,051
I'm making the call. Untie him.

318
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,092
Who's he calling?

319
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,792
The FBI.
Now that we're confident

320
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14,293
the weapon's here,
we're calling in the authorities.

321
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:20,873
Tony? My cell is down,
so is the landline.

322
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:23,002
Someone's jamming
communications.

323
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:31,911
It's them.

324
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,380
They gave me that radio;
told me they'd be

325
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,472
contacting me. Answer the call.
Just play along.

326
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:41,293
Answer the call.

327
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:45,322
Hello?

328
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:46,323
Where are you?

329
00:18:46,498 --> 00:18:48,333
I didn't think you were coming.

330
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:51,532
You're late.
Well, we're here now and we're waiting.

331
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,031
Okay.

332
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,400
They're at the front gate.

333
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:56,870
Put your belt back on.

334
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,300
I want you to resume your post.

335
00:18:58,475 --> 00:18:59,940
Pretend like
everything's normal.

336
00:19:00,115 --> 00:19:01,402
Just let them in.
And then what?

337
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:03,440
We're going to follow them
as soon as they pick up

338
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:04,832
their container;
once we're past

339
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,610
the jamming grid, we'll make our call.
I don't know.

340
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,483
What do you mean
you don't know?

341
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:11,921
You're a part of this, Carl,
whether you want to be or not.

342
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:15,792
You became a part of it this the second
you said "yes" to these people. Jack!

343
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:17,750
What do you got?
I got three vehicles.

344
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:21,831
Eight hostiles, heavily armed; got to
assume there's more inside the trucks.

345
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:25,302
Carl, if you don't open that gate,
they're going

346
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,562
to come in here looking you,
you understand me?

347
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:30,733
Let me put it to you this way.

348
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,770
These men have killed
over 300 people today.

349
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:35,971
If they get ahold
of that weapon,

350
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:38,413
they're going to make that
look like child's play.

351
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,281
You've only got
one choice here.

352
00:19:44,628 --> 00:19:46,323
I just open the gate
and let them in.

353
00:19:46,488 --> 00:19:47,993
That's all you've got to do.

354
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:50,152
And you guys got my back,
right? Yeah.

355
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:52,320
Promise me.

356
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:58,260
I promise you.

357
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,532
Okay.

358
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:05,240
Tony, get the
surveillance package.

359
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:06,771
Don't worry.

360
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,580
It's just so we can
hear what's going on.

361
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:11,713
Turn around.

362
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:13,942
I need to put this
on your back.

363
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:18,580
Listen, the money--
it wasn't about greed or anything.

364
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,550
It's my wife, Linda.
She's having twins.

365
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:23,392
They say it's the most natural
thing in the world, right?

366
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:24,460
Getting pregnant?

367
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,791
Well, it took us three years,
cost an arm and a leg.

368
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:32,162
No excuses,
but insurance doesn't cover a dime.

369
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:33,962
I just always wanted
to have a family.

370
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,372
You know what I mean?

371
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,531
Put this in your pocket.

372
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,342
You got him?

373
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,311
Yeah.

374
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:49,512
Remember, it's just
another day at the office.

375
00:20:49,686 --> 00:20:51,853
You're going to be fine.

376
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,222
Let's go.

377
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:16,681
What took you so long, Carl?

378
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,221
You got the routing documents?

379
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:19,392
Sure.

380
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:21,893
I need to see them in order
to locate the container.

381
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:24,162
Relax, Carl.
They're right here.

382
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,203
Okay.

383
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:31,402
Center section.

384
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:34,742
Row 36, Q-block.

385
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:36,352
It's that fourth
stack on your left.

386
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:39,471
I know where the
container is, Carl.

387
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:42,713
Did you disable the
security cameras?

388
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,750
They've been off since 10:00,
just like you said.

389
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,052
How's your wife?

390
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:51,892
She's fine.

391
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:55,661
You didn't tell her anything about this,
did you?

392
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,863
No, of course not.

393
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,031
Did you tell anybody else?

394
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,631
No, no, why would I?

395
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:03,760
You tell me, Carl.

396
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:07,573
Why are you so nervous?

397
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:11,211
Okay, um, you want to know the truth,
Mr. Stokes?

398
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:16,211
Uh... I was expecting a simple pickup,
but you show up

399
00:22:16,386 --> 00:22:18,580
with a small army here, and, um...
And what?

400
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:22,621
It's just...
not w-what I was expecting, that's all.

401
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:24,891
I just don't want
to get caught.

402
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:28,990
Nobody's gonna
get caught, Carl.

403
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:30,462
Let's go, we're moving.

404
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:32,662
You too, Carl, take a ride.

405
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:34,931
I told you,
it's the fourth stack on your left.

406
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:35,751
Q-block, row 36.

407
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:37,231
I'd feel better
if you showed us.

408
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:38,931
I really should stay here,
Mr. Stokes.

409
00:22:39,105 --> 00:22:40,301
I got to finish my patrol.

410
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:41,372
Why, Carl?

411
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:42,740
You expecting somebody?

412
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:45,040
No. Then get in.

413
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,441
Okay.

414
00:22:55,657 --> 00:22:56,750
Damn it.

415
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:59,221
Forget about him, Jack.

416
00:22:59,396 --> 00:23:01,391
He was dead the minute he
stepped out that door.

417
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:04,331
You and I both know that.

418
00:23:23,286 --> 00:23:25,180
Ethan, I just came to
say how sorry I am.

419
00:23:25,356 --> 00:23:30,021
Well, I appreciate the
courtesy if not the sincerity.

420
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:36,490
As much as I may feel this is what's
best for my mother, on a personal level

421
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:38,892
I'm sorry you have to
go through this...

422
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:44,330
and for some of the harsher
things I said to you in anger.

423
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:48,742
Well, I suppose I owe you an apology,
too, for accusing you

424
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:53,773
of leaking my role in this
Bauer fiasco to the press.

425
00:23:53,948 --> 00:23:56,581
I really believed you were
trying to blindside me.

426
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:00,331
Considering the impression I gave you,
I'm not surprised.

427
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:06,853
Olivia, as someone who's
known you most of your life,

428
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,862
I'd like to offer some advice.

429
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:10,990
Of course.

430
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:19,531
Ambition can be a valuable
quality here in Washington

431
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:27,070
as well as in life, but unchecked,
it can be unhealthy, if not dangerous.

432
00:24:27,248 --> 00:24:29,583
What I'm trying to say is...

433
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:33,412
you got yourself a seat
at the president's table.

434
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:36,481
She listens to you.

435
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:41,721
But running a country is
not like running a campaign.

436
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,432
It's not about doing
whatever it takes to win.

437
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:49,031
It's about doing what's right
for the American people.

438
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:54,902
Sometimes those things
aren't mutually exclusive.

439
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,611
Well...

440
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:07,053
good-bye, Olivia.

441
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:09,220
Good-bye.

442
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:23,301
MAN: Hello.

443
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:24,702
It's Olivia.

444
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:27,301
You can go with that story now,
Ken, and it just got better.

445
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:29,141
Tell me.

446
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:30,940
Ethan Kanin's resigning.

447
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:31,811
What happened?

448
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:34,713
I thought the plan was to let him
twist in the wind for a while.

449
00:25:34,817 --> 00:25:36,043
His hand was forced. Thank you.

450
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:39,950
It seems Jack Bauer just
murdered Senator Mayer.

451
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:41,352
(whispering): What?

452
00:25:41,527 --> 00:25:43,521
You're kidding me.

453
00:25:43,697 --> 00:25:44,990
Anybody else have this yet?

454
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:47,621
Not yet,
it's all yours in time for the 11:00.

455
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:49,492
Told you I'd take care of you,
didn't I?

456
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:50,962
You are too good to me, Olivia.

457
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,532
You just hold up your end.

458
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:55,532
Make sure Kanin's the fall guy.

459
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,503
My mother is nowhere
near this, understand?

460
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:58,372
No problem.

461
00:25:58,536 --> 00:26:00,672
She really doesn't have any
idea that you're the leak?

462
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:02,870
No, and it'd better
stay that way.

463
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:06,741
She won't hear it from me.

464
00:26:06,915 --> 00:26:09,211
When are we having that
dinner you promised?

465
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:12,083
Maybe next week.

466
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:13,351
It's always next week.

467
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:16,352
You'd better get to work if you're
going to make that broadcast.

468
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:37,850
So these files on the computer--
presumably Senator Mayer was looking

469
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:39,182
at 'em before he was killed?

470
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:40,081
Someone was, sir.

471
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,623
They were opened and viewed
within the last hour.

472
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:44,923
So if the sen...

473
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:48,460
if the senator was
killed point-blank

474
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:50,693
in the entry hall,
how are we explaining the slugs

475
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:52,630
in the door frame
and the railing?

476
00:26:52,806 --> 00:26:53,801
I don't know, sir.

477
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,702
Get the crime lab guys on it.

478
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,870
Yes, sir.

479
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:13,280
Agent Walker,
it's Larry Moss for you.

480
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:17,051
Hello.

481
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:18,390
Senator Mayer is dead.

482
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,091
Where's Jack?

483
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:25,462
Don't know; we don't have him.

484
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:27,642
Okay, but what,
you think that he did this, Larry?

485
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:29,030
First Burnett and now Mayer?

486
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:30,403
Well...

487
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,131
it looks that way.

488
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:34,170
What do you mean
"looks that way"?

489
00:27:34,347 --> 00:27:36,140
Well, that's why I'm calling.
Senator Mayer

490
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:38,240
was killed with a UMP
40 submachine gun.

491
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:42,183
If Bauer was on the run, where'd he
get ahold of a weapon like that?

492
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:44,280
Also, there's evidence to
suggest that the, uh--

493
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,051
there was a third
party in the house

494
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:48,021
when the senator was killed.
What kind of evidence?

495
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,420
Unexplained slugs...

496
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,421
...a broken set of French doors,
a chair where it doesn't belong.

497
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:55,720
Okay, so are you saying that
this third party killed Mayer?

498
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:58,702
Well, you know, Renee, I might be
saying that if I knew what the hell

499
00:27:58,865 --> 00:28:01,800
Bauer was doing here
in the first place.

500
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:03,131
All right, Renee, listen.

501
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:06,191
I want to meet you halfway, I do,
but if you expect me to even entertain

502
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:08,300
Bauer's innocence,
you have got to help me here.

503
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:09,211
I can't, Larry.

504
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:12,373
If Jack is still underground,
he is underground for a reason.

505
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:14,941
There were files open
on Mayer's computer--

506
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:17,881
documents relating to his
investigation into Starkwood.

507
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,953
All right, so just tell me that,
tell me that.

508
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:23,321
Did Starkwood ever come up in
your conversation with Bauer?

509
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:30,993
Renee.

510
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:35,502
Look, maybe, maybe I should
have trusted you before, okay,

511
00:28:35,675 --> 00:28:39,141
but you have got
to trust me now.

512
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:42,372
What role does Starkwood
play in all this?

513
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,512
The man who framed Jack

514
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:54,921
for Burnett's murder was John Quinn,
a Starkwood contractor.

515
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:58,991
Jack believes that they were behind Juma
and all of the terrorist attacks today.

516
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:01,361
He went to Mayer to get
the evidence to prove it.

517
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:04,761
I have to assume that
Quinn followed him there.

518
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:06,531
That's all that I know,
Larry, I swear.

519
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:09,003
Okay, I believe you.

520
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:10,103
Thank you.

521
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:12,942
Just sit tight,
I'll be in touch soon.

522
00:29:13,106 --> 00:29:14,113
Well, let me help, Larry.

523
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:15,372
I mean,
Jack could still be out there.

524
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:16,370
He may be in trouble.

525
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,112
No, no, I can't release you,
not yet.

526
00:29:33,365 --> 00:29:34,462
Reese, what's the status?

527
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,692
Just getting the chassis on,
sir, I'll be a minute.

528
00:29:36,795 --> 00:29:37,762
Hurry it up.

529
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:43,101
Hold up, hold up,
I don't have my truck.

530
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:44,870
Put it down there,
I want it there.

531
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:00,451
Mitch, get up there.

532
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:02,180
Let's run a diagnostic now.

533
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,153
I want to be ready to roll as soon as
Reese gets here with that flatbed.

534
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:07,793
Yes, sir.

535
00:30:18,076 --> 00:30:19,670
All right, there's the package.

536
00:30:19,846 --> 00:30:21,103
We should get back to the car.

537
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,071
We want to be in position to follow
that container once they move out.

538
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:28,980
Jack.

539
00:30:29,157 --> 00:30:31,781
Just give me one second.

540
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,082
Cooper.

541
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:35,751
Now's as good a time as
any to settle up with Carl.

542
00:30:35,926 --> 00:30:37,591
COOPER: Yes, sir.

543
00:30:37,756 --> 00:30:38,691
Thanks, Carl.

544
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:41,190
Good luck.

545
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:43,333
Let's go.

546
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:44,891
Where we going?

547
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,763
Your money's in my truck,
just one aisle over.

548
00:30:51,948 --> 00:30:53,703
Jack, we should get going.

549
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:54,941
No.

550
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:04,310
What are you doing?

551
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,321
I thought you said the
money was in the truck.

552
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:11,822
What the hell's going on?

553
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:14,061
Just keep moving.

554
00:31:14,225 --> 00:31:18,793
Listen, I don't know what Stokes
told you, but I didn't tell a soul.

555
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,602
Damn it, Jack,
what the hell are you doing?

556
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:25,470
Don't do it.

557
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:27,873
You're gonna turn a surveillance
job into a firefight.

558
00:31:27,976 --> 00:31:29,210
It'll be two against ten.

559
00:31:29,377 --> 00:31:30,612
Two against nine.

560
00:31:30,776 --> 00:31:33,613
Right, and we lose our best
chance at getting this weapon.

561
00:31:33,785 --> 00:31:35,240
Don't break your own rules.

562
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:37,753
You may save one man,
but what about the thousands of people

563
00:31:37,927 --> 00:31:39,283
who could die in a
biological attack?

564
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:42,290
Is this about you,
Jack, or about them?

565
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:46,061
You want to prevent another disaster
or ensure that it's going to happen?

566
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,330
That's far enough.

567
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,232
Turn around.

568
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:03,240
You're going to kill me, you're
going to have to look me in the eye.

569
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:05,471
Okay.

570
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:09,510
Damn it.

571
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:14,220
Thank you, thank you.

572
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:17,291
We've got about 30 seconds before
they figure out what happened.

573
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:18,623
Okay, what's our fallback?

574
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:20,121
Steal the truck. Strong?

575
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:22,893
I'll make the direct assault,
you cover the east flank.

576
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:25,860
All we need is a big enough firefight
to get one of us behind the wheel.

577
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:26,963
You ready? Yeah.

578
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:29,230
Go.

579
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:34,343
How do we look?

580
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:37,940
Diagnostics check out, sir.

581
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:39,943
The package is stable.

582
00:32:40,118 --> 00:32:42,212
Good.

583
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:45,383
All right,
let's get her on the chassis!

584
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:04,433
Cooper, come on.

585
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:06,643
Let's roll.

586
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:08,640
Cooper, do you copy?

587
00:33:16,915 --> 00:33:17,612
Dolen.

588
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,312
Check the next aisle over.

589
00:33:19,428 --> 00:33:21,220
Find Cooper.

590
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:26,721
Hold your position.

591
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:28,062
Wait for my signal.

592
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:34,960
Cooper's down, Cooper's down.

593
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,032
Go red, go red!

594
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:37,631
Let's move out... Greer.

595
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,702
Engage... engage.

596
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:36,160
Reese, get the truck
out of here now!

597
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,331
Go, go, go!

598
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:39,432
Tony!

599
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:40,902
The truck-- I'm going after it.

600
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:42,031
Cover me now!

601
00:35:12,165 --> 00:35:16,172
Two shooters--
fan out and find them.

602
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:36,450
??

603
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,601
Tony, this is Jack--
do you copy?

604
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:05,710
Drop it.

605
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:11,790
Tony?

606
00:36:11,955 --> 00:36:13,460
I know you.

607
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,032
You're on Emerson's crew.

608
00:36:17,198 --> 00:36:19,230
You're Almeida, right?

609
00:36:24,336 --> 00:36:25,503
I know Bauer's with you.

610
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:26,772
Now, where is he?

611
00:36:53,247 --> 00:36:55,000
(phone ringing) Larry Moss.

612
00:36:55,175 --> 00:36:57,443
Larry, it's Jack.
Jack, where the hell have you been?

613
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,183
I need you to scramble
multiple teams

614
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:01,612
to a weigh station on Highway 236,
exit 29.

615
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,850
I'm in a big rig
about ten miles south.

616
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:05,013
What's going on?

617
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:06,952
You also need to send
a CDC recovery unit.

618
00:37:07,055 --> 00:37:07,983
Why?

619
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:11,312
I'm in possession of a biological weapon
interdicted at the Port of Alexandria.

620
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:13,001
A biological weapon?

621
00:37:13,176 --> 00:37:14,292
Larry, just listen to me.

622
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,422
I don't care if you arrest me.

623
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:16,562
I don't care if you shoot me.

624
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,391
Just get your teams out here.

625
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:20,760
I fully expect to be
pursued by hostiles.

626
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:22,033
Starkwood?

627
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,532
How do you know
about Starkwood?

628
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:24,360
I talked to Renee.

629
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:26,232
And I saw what was
on Mayer's computer.

630
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:27,770
Larry, they're coming
after this weapon.

631
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:28,940
You can count on it.

632
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:32,171
Now, be advised, I believe that
Tony Almeida is being held hostage.

633
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:34,311
All right,
I'll call out an interagency alert.

634
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,910
We'll secure both locations.

635
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:36,913
Larry, hurry.

636
00:40:41,737 --> 00:40:43,672
Damn it!

637
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,480
Sir, this is Stokes.

638
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:58,010
What's your status?

639
00:40:58,187 --> 00:40:59,983
The package is secure--
we're inbound.

640
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:01,553
What about Bauer?

641
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,552
He's at the scene, sir,
but he sought cover nearby.

642
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:08,120
Well, we have to assume that
he contacted the authorities,

643
00:41:08,296 --> 00:41:11,233
so we better be on an
accelerated timetable.

644
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:12,460
Get over here.

645
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,001
It will be there
in ten minutes.

646
00:41:14,168 --> 00:41:15,061
We're right behind.

647
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:16,260
Good.

648
00:41:17,906 --> 00:41:21,140
I've got teams on the ground
prepping for your arrival.

649
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:27,142
Larry Moss.

650
00:41:27,316 --> 00:41:28,312
Larry, it's Jack.

651
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,912
I'm still on Route 236, but I had
to stop approximately seven miles

652
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:33,381
before the weigh station.

653
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:35,403
Jack, I got two units
moving to you right now.

654
00:41:35,508 --> 00:41:37,223
Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to redirect them.

655
00:41:37,326 --> 00:41:38,121
Why?

656
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,860
Starkwood reacquired
the bioweapon.

657
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:42,661
They managed to access one of
the dock's freight helicopters.

658
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:46,162
While they had me pinned down, they
airlifted the freight right out of here.

659
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,661
They were headed due west
from my current position.

660
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:51,372
West... they got a large
military facility in that area.

661
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:53,330
Okay, good--
redirect the teams there.

662
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:56,340
Jack, I can't assault a private
compound unless I have proof

663
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:57,441
that a weapon exists.

664
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:58,540
Okay, where's the CDC?

665
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:00,212
They're scrambling
a team right now.

666
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:01,840
Send them to me.

667
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:03,413
You'll have all
the proof you need.

668
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:04,653
Jack, what happened?

669
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:08,323
One of the canisters was breached
during the interdiction.

670
00:42:08,427 --> 00:42:11,192
Some of the bio-agent
was released.

671
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:13,051
I...

672
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:14,722
I was exposed.

673
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,863
Okay.

674
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,363
Jack, just sit right.

675
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:20,862
CDC's on the way.

676
00:42:21,036 --> 00:42:22,603
They're going to be there soon.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
