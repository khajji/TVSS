<i>Previously on</i> 24.

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,782
What the hell is this? All our screens
for the eastern quadrant are locked.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,150
I took out your control units.
I want you to see what we can do.

4
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,587
Get ready to make the course change.

5
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:27,558
- G.S.A. 117, this is Northeast Three Control.
- Go ahead, Air Traffic Control.

6
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,492
We have a new runway assignment for you.

7
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:33,726
Sid, there's another plane landing on 4 Right.
It crosses 31 Left.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,064
G.S.A. 117, pull up.
4 Right, pull up.

[Passengers Screaming]

10
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,406
That was just a warning shot.
Whatever we do next, it'll be the real thing.

11
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:47,572
- Get the module ready.
- [Emerson] As promised.

12
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:51,083
GeneralJuma will be pleased.

13
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,780
<i>Perhaps now would be a good time to make</i>
<i>your demands known to President Taylor.</i>

14
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,345
Make the preparations.
Your government is about to <i>pay...</i>

15
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,485
a very steep price
for interfering in our affairs.

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,086
They assumed my son killed himself.

17
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,098
<i>They didn't look deeply enough</i>
<i>at anything.</i>

18
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,760
The authorities have already questioned
your son's girlfriend, sir.

19
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,632
<i>You're not going anywhere</i>
<i>till I get the truth.</i>

20
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:13,263
- Sir.
- You know who murdered my son.

21
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,000
He killed himself.

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,102
I'm gonna find out what you're hiding.
And when I do, God help you.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,305
You're right.
He's not one of ours.

24
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:26,079
- <i>We'll follow him, see if</i>
<i>he leads us to Almeida. Dornan!</i>
- That's not the right move.

25
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,883
<i>You can't bring anyone else into this.</i>
- What the hell's goin' on?

26
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,323
We're following up on a lead, and
I will fill you in if and when we find something.

27
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,487
I do not like this.
I just flat-out lied to my boss.

28
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,624
I told you I would help you find Tony Almeida,
but you're gonna have to let me do it my way.

29
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,403
Tony! Stop!

30
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,679
<i>The device is gone.</i>
<i>The locator files have been deleted.</i>

31
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,374
Where is it?

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,355
What the hell happened to you?

33
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,721
<i>[Jack Bauer] The following takes place</i>
<i>between 10:00 a.m. And 11:00 a.m.</i>

34
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,156
- Where's Almeida now?
- He's in transit to F.B.I. Headquarters.

35
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,794
- He'll be formally interrogated there.
- I don't understand.

36
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,997
Almeida was orchestrating these attacks.

37
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,303
<i>Lfhe doesn't have the C.I.P. Device,</i>
<i>who does?</i>

38
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,867
[Kanin] The F.B.I. Has learned that Almeida
handed off the device to someone else.

39
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,381
- They don't know who.
- I may have an answer to that question,
Madam President.

40
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,010
- I'm listening.
- Almeida's working for theJuma regime.

41
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:37,386
Approximately five minutes ago, an audio message
was routed to the State Department subnet.

42
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,620
It's from Colonel Iké Dubaku.
He's Juma's right-hand man.

43
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,627
<i>He's known as the Butcher of Sangala.</i>

44
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:45,255
- <i>Over 300,000 people were murdered.</i>
- I know who he is.

45
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,232
What did the message say?

46
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,668
Think you should hear it yourself.

47
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:56,539
President Taylor,
this is Colonel Iké Dubaku.

48
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,510
<i>As you have no doubt confirmed...</i>

49
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,278
<i>the near collision atJ.F.K.</i>
<i>International was no accident.</i>

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,719
<i>We have the C.I.P. Device.</i>
<i>We have the capability...</i>

51
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:13,225
<i>to kill tens of thousands of Americans...</i>

52
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,091
<i>and we are prepared to do so.</i>

53
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:22,067
<i>We demand the complete and immediate</i>
<i>withdrawal of the U.S. Naval strike force...</i>

54
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:27,368
<i>to a position west of the 23rd meridian</i>
<i>by this time tomorrow.</i>

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,431
<i>In order to meet this timeline...</i>

56
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,878
<i>we require satellite confirmation</i>
<i>within three hours...</i>

57
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,849
<i>that the carrier air wing</i>
<i>is in full retreat.</i>

58
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:43,419
<i>Don't sacrifice your fellow countrymen...</i>

59
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,821
<i>Madam President.</i>

60
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:51,125
<i>Allow the people of Sangala</i>
<i>to determine their own destiny.</i>

61
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,189
<i>Stand your forces down.</i>

62
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,725
<i>Voiceprint's an 89% match.</i>
<i>It's Dubaku.</i>

63
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,205
- There's little doubt.
- Looks like your suspicions were correct,
Madam President.

64
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,072
- This is about Africa.
- My God.

65
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,341
Dubaku should have been tried
for war crimes years ago.

66
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,279
Now he's giving us ultimatums.

67
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,150
We cannot let this monster hold our country
hostage. Where do we stand on the planes?

68
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,017
There's still 2,500 planes in the air.

69
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,455
We have got to shore up the <i>firewall...</i>

70
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,617
<i>so that the C.I.P. Device</i>
<i>will be rendered useless.</i>

71
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,526
We now think we can reengineer
the code in six days.

72
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,531
Six days? We don't have
the luxury of six hours.

73
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,933
I'm sorry, Madam President, but there's no way
we can rebuild the firewall in that time frame.

74
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,475
I want you to instigate
a series of restricted alerts.

75
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,705
Keep it to first responders only.

76
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,010
We want people to be ready
in case we're attacked <i>again...</i>

77
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,676
- but we don't want to start a panic.
- Yes, Madam President.

78
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,918
And gentlemen, Almeida is our only lead.

79
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,981
Make sure the F.B.I.
Is aware of the demands.

80
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,550
They need to work Almeida
from the Africa <i>side...</i>

81
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,496
- and they need to know
we don't have a lot of time.
- Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,182
Come on.

83
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,887
Keep your head down.

84
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,708
<i>Get him ready for questioning.</i>

85
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,711
I want an explanation.

86
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:58,314
You went after that shooter without backup
or authorization, and then refused to tell me why.

87
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,224
- Now, I wanna know.
- Look, we didn't know who might be listening.

88
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,821
- Someone in this office is helping Almeida.
- What?

89
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,990
The F.B.I. Has been compromised, Larry.
There's a leak.

90
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,263
Based on what?
Excuse me! This is private.

91
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,999
Tony knew we were going to Schector's
office before we even got there.

92
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,234
<i>That's how he managed</i>
<i>to get a sniper in position.</i>

93
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,436
<i>The tip had to come from your office.</i>

94
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,139
<i>And whoever it was helped Schector's</i>
<i>assassin get out of the building.</i>

95
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,115
He's right, Larry.
That's why we couldn't tell you.

96
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,583
<i>You had a full perimeter, right?</i>
<i>Covered every exit?</i>

97
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,212
How else do you think he got out of there?

98
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,420
All right. Assuming this is true,
you got any idea who it could be?

99
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,792
No. We didn't see it.
But we know that it went down.

100
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,058
It could be anyone in the Bureau.

101
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,464
<i>You need to tighten</i>
<i>your circle around Tony.</i>

102
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,129
You can't let any information that he gives you
get back to the people he's working <i>with...</i>

103
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,105
otherwise you will never
get that C.I.P. Device.

104
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,970
- All right.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

105
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,708
We'll limit access to
Level Four clearance and above.

HaveJanis run the security protocols.

107
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,348

- <i>[Cell Phone Beeps]</i>

108
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,151
- It's Moss.

- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

110
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,160
- Yeah.
- <i>[Cell Phone Beeps]</i>

111
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,220
It's the White House.

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,127
From now on, keep me in the loop.

113
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,196
And he doesn't do a damn thing
without telling me.

[Exhales]

115
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,673
- We had to tell him. We had no choice.
- <i>You trust him?</i>

116
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,151
No question.
There's no one I trust more.

117
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,047
Where are they gonna hold Tony?

118

<i>I am gonna have to lift up your shirt.</i>

119

Is that comfortable for you?

120
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,948
Take that as a yes.

121
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,186
- <i>[Renee] Is he hooked up?</i>
- <i>[Janis] Yeah, we're ready to go.</i>

122

<i>Janis, I'll run this session.</i>
<i>I want you to handle something else.</i>

123
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:25,226
- What else?
- Plugging a security leak.

124
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,965
What?

125
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,371
We think someone in this office
has been helping Almeida.

126
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,104
They've kicked this up
to Level Four clearance.

127
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,045
I want you to vet all communication
and information flow.

128
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,378
Red tag every data point
that has to do with Almeida.

129
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,283
<i>[Janis] Okay. Well, do we have</i>
<i>any idea who it is?</i>

130
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,551
- No, we don't.
I'm hoping you can help us find out.
- Okay.

131
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:49,152
[Exhales] Okay, there's a 0.2 deviation
on the blood pressure <i>monitor...</i>

132
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,196
and you're gonna have
to compensate for that.

133
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,255
Thanks, Janis.

<i>[Door Closes]</i>

Sorry about your friend, Jack.
I know you were <i>hoping...</i>

136
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:15,049
he wasn't capable
of doing something like this.

137

Why are we in Level Four lockdown?
- Don't worry about it.

140
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,772
- Just do your job.
- How am I supposed to do my <i>job...</i>

141
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,439
when I can't get through to half
the server nodes in the building?

142
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,006
You're sifting through the evidence
gathered at Almeida's arrest site.

143
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,984
That does not require
Level Four clearance.

144

You have everything you need

Then we should move on.
There's nothing we can do.

No. We have assets inside the Bureau.
We use them to help get him out.

- They're from Colonel Iké Dubaku.
- Dubaku?

Looks like he contracted Almeida

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,125
She wanted to. But she also wanted
to protect your memory of your son.

295
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,638
- You were in so much pain-
- Damn it, Ethan, he was my son.
I deserved the truth.

296
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,935
And keeping it from you
was a terrible mistake.

297
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,774

But the president and I both <i>thought...</i>

Mr. Kanin.
The president wants to see you.

300

Does she know you're telling me this now?

301

No. And I think it best
we keep it that <i>way...</i>

at least till this crisis is resolved.

Admiral Smith laid out the timeline
for withdrawing our forces.

He's saying to meet Dubaku's <i>demands...</i>

we need to order the pullback

- <i>No, it isn't.</i>

311
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,308
Well, maybe this man Almeida will tell us
where to find the C.I.P. Device.

312
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,781
No. Tim Woods
<i>just heard from the Bureau.

So far, Almeida's
refusing to cooperate.

00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,447
- Well, maybe he's just positioning for a deal.
- Tim doesn't think so.

<i>I'll be condemning</i>
<i>innocent Americans to death.</i>

And now, to have to decide
between two impossible choices.

Well, at least one of those <i>choices...</i>

of preserving American lives.

You don't know the whole story.
It's part of an ongoing operation.

Jack, please. You need to listen.
Our government is corrupted.

There are people on the inside who are
actively aiding Dubaku and theJuma regime.

344
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:00,475
Point is, Tony was supposed
to be near the C.I.P. Module the whole time.

345
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,777
With him in custody, we've lost our ability
to control it and to attack this conspiracy.

Who's a part of the conspiracy?
Give me names.

347

We don't know the extent of it,
but we have reason to <i>believe...</i>

348
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,022
that members of the president's
inner council are on payroll.

349

Which agency?

350

That's just it, Jack.
There's no shepherd.

351
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:20,164
There's no agency.
This corruption runs deep and wide.

We're working outside the government.

That's why we have to

You don't understand, Bill.
I trust her.

If you think you need to use her to get Tony
out of F.B.I. Headquarters, then do it.

00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:43,109
<i>Security, this is Agent Moss.</i>
<i>Suspects are in the southwest stairwell...</i>

586
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,910
descending past the fifth floor.

587
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:50,147
Lock down the building perimeter and deploy
two teams in the first floor service corridor.

588
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,416
Be aware. The suspects are armed.
We need 'em alive.

589
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,086
- Okay, I'm back up, Jack.
- Copy that.

590
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,462
- What was that?
- Hacker's back in.

591
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,627
- Whoever this is, they're very good.
- Well, lock 'em out.

592
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,637
I'm trying!

593
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,265
- Jack, hold up.
- What is it?

594
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,175
You're heading into an ambush.
It's a six man team.

595
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,713
- They're heading up toward you on the stairwell.
- Understand. We'll evade.

596
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,079
- They're coming up the stairs.
- <i>[Man Shouting, Indistinct]</i>

597
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,175
Pass me that fire extinguisher.

598
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,791
- We're on the roof of the parking lot.
- I see you. Good work.

599
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:41,360
Go to the north end, Jack.
Bill's almost there. He's in a blue van.

600
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,203
Copy that.

601
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,869
They're outside. They went through
the third floor window. Let's go!

602
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,878
Perimeter teams,
they're in the parking garage.

603
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,040
Notify Metro Police. I want them
to cordon off a five-block perimeter.

604
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,916
On our right!
Get down!

605
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,719
We gotta get you out of here
and back undercover.

606
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,989
I'll be right behind you.
Go!

607
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,741
Go! Go!

Get in.

<i>Let's go, Bill!</i>

618
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,921
Agent Moss, they're gone.
They got outside the perimeter.

<i>All right, Chloe, I got 'em.</i>

621
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,597
- Any sign of pursuit?
- Not so far. They must still be mobilizing.

622
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,139
- We caught them off guard.
- <i>Traffic cams?</i>

I'm cycling frequencies

Good. Are you all right?

- I'm fine. Where are we going?
- It's not far.

Bill, I did what you wanted. I got Tony out
of there. Tell me what the hell is going on.
