1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,700
PREVIOUSLY ON 24

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,303
The fbi believes They've detected
where the next attack will take place.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,000
The chemical plant just outside kidron, ohio.

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,600
What's our time frame?

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,500
The tank could rupture in less than 15 minutes.

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,400
Right now our best chance to stop this

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
Is by finding dubaku and the cip device.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,700
400 psi.

12
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,700
How long before the tank ruptures?

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Seven minutes.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
We've got a problem.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought you killed almeida and bauer.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,300
Damn it! how did they find us?!

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,300
I don't know!

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,800
They're in the building.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,100
Disengage the cip module.

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,300
Begin the offload.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,900
Jack, I've got the cip device!

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,500
It's been destroyed.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,900
The matobos are safe.
I'm taking them to the van.

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,000
Copy that.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
You and bill do a sweep.
see if you can find dubaku.

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,300
We are not equipped to look for one man

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,600
In a city of millions.

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,500
We need additional resources.

29
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,900
- The government?
- they can't be trusted.

30
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,800
We can't trust anybody.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,400
That's why we're working on the outside.

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
President taylor can be trusted.

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,100
Madame president, you need to listen to me.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,300
The people who rescued us,
they have acquired the cip device.

35
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,200
It's being destroyed,

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
And your country's no longer under immediate threat.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,000
Who are these people?

38
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,700
I'll tell you everything in person,

39
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,900
But I must speak to you alone.

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,000
Please get henry on the phone.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Henry's unreachable.

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,600
I've been trying to reach agent gedge,

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
And he hasn't picked up.

44
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,100
He said he was outside samantha roth's apartment

45
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,800
Waiting for the first gentleman.

46
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,400
You're telling me my husband's gone missing?

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,100
Gedge is dead.

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,100
What happened?

49
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,700
Something went wrong.
taylor killed gedge,

50
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know how.

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,900
Don't kill him.

52
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,000
Bring him to me.

53
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,700
THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE
BETWEEN 3 PM AND 4 PM.

54
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,100
You ARE CERTAIN
YOU weren't followed?

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,900
Yes. come on. help me get him inside.

56
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,200
We can confirm at this point

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,500
The tragedies that unfolded in the skies over washington

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,700
And in kidron, ohio,
were indeed acts of terrorism.

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
But I am here to assure you that those responsible

60
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,500
Are no longer a threat to this country.

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,500
Their attempts to stop us from intervening

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,200
In the Sangalan genocide have failed.

63
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,700
We will not give in to terrorists.

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,100
A short time ago, I gave the order

65
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,900
For our troops to begin operations

66
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,500
That will liberate the people of Sangala.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,200
We are confident
that the juma regime will collapse swiftly,

68
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
And that democracy will be restored

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,416
Under the leadership Of prime minister ule motobo.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,500
You, you, come.

71
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,100
Well done, agent vossler.

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,200
I've got to go now.

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,100
I've got a shift that starts at 4:00.

74
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,300
Then go.
your money will be wired to the usual account.

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,400
The room is soundproof, mr. taylor.

76
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,300
There's no point in screaming or trying to call for help.

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,300
Elimu, remove mr. taylor's gag.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,700
You son of a bitch.

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
You're behind my son's death.

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,500
He was poking his nose where it did not belong.

81
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,400
You'll never get away with this.
you must know that.

82
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Everyone in the city is going be looking for me.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You should be concerned
with just one question, mr. taylor.

84
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,800
Does your wife love you enough

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,500
To call off the invasion of my country?

86
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,700
For your sake,

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I hope the answer is yes.

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Activate the scrambling device.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,100
Our law enforcement agencies

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Will hunt down the people responsible

91
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,000
And bring them to justice.

92
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,500
I ask now that your thoughts and prayers

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,400
Go to those who lost their lives today,

94
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,000
To their families and loved ones,

95
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,600
And to our troops who are putting their lives

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,800
On the line in the name of freedom.

97
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

98
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,600
Good afternoon.

99
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,800
Motobo's arrived.

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
He and the others have been brought in secretly

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,700
Through the underground entrance

102
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,600
By agents I personally know and trust.

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Motobo told me the people he's bringing in

104
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,200
Are responsible for saving his life

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,800
And recovering the cip device.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,100
Who are they?

107
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,900
Bill buchanan, whom I believe you met

108
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,200
When he headed up ctu l.a.,

109
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,400
Fbi agent named renee walker

110
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,200
And jack bauer.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Bauer...

112
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,000
He was one of motobo's kidnappers.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Doesn't make sense.

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,900
I know.

115
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,500
Motobo asked me to listen to what they have to say,

116
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
And I'm willing to do so.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,500
Send them in.

118
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,900
The president's ready.

119
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,100
Ule.

120
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,700
I can't tell you

121
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,900
How thankful we are that you and alama are safe.

122
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you.
she's with mr. buchanan's people now,

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,300
Recovering.

124
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,600
That you were subjected

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
To such an ordeal

126
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,900
On our soil
is a source of shame both to me

127
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,800
Personally and to my country.

128
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,100
Madame president,

129
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,800
My chief concern is for Sangala, not myself.

130
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,800
May I ask what your timetable is

131
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,100
For the invasion?

132
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,174
I've issued the order To our military to proceed.

133
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,000
I thank you with all my heart.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,400
You're doing my people a great service,

135
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,100
Much as these people have done for your country.

136
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,200
Now forgive me, prime minister,

137
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,600
But I'm finding that hard to believe.

138
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,200
I assure you, none of this is as it seems.

139
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,800
But they're here to explain themselves.

140
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,800
Now, if you'll excuse me, madame president,

141
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,914
I must meet with my people 
To discuss post-invasion plans.

142
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,500
Of course.

143
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,800
I want an explanation and I want it now.

144
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
What the hell is going on?!

145
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Madame president,

146
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
Six weeks ago, bill buchanan discovered

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,700
That key members of your government

148
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,657
Were working with general juma
And colonel dubaku in an effort

149
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,500
To undermine this nation's foreign policy--

150
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,000
Your foreign policy with regards to Sangala.

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,200
You realize that that is an outrageous accusation?

152
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,100
Unfortunately, it's the truth.

154
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,000
It explains why during this crisis,

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Every effort you made to stop dubaku
failed.

156
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,100
Bill, why didn't you come to me?

157
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,400
I didn't know who I could trust
or if you'd even believe me.

158
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:09,900
So I formed

159
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,200
A small group to locate and neutralize dubaku.

160
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,300
Tony almeida and ultimately, jack,

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,900
Joined me.

162
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,500
Tony almeida was the one who put the cip device

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,649
Into dubaku's hands In the first place.

164
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,300
Using the cip device as bait was necessary

165
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,900
To the undercover operation.

166
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,800
We had to follow it back to dubaku.

167
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,600
A lot of people

168
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,500
Died on those planes, never mind what

169
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,300
Could have happened at the chemical plant in kidron!

170
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Madame president, if I may,
I was part

171
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,500
Of the fbi task force
assigned to recover the cip device,

172
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,000
And I can personally vouch
for what they're telling you.

173
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,000
The loss of life was tragic, yes,

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,800
But in my opinion,

175
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,300
Everything these men have done
saved the lives of thousands.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,700
If I choose to believe everything you're telling me,

177
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,300
Where would you go from here?

178
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Dubaku is the only person

179
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,783
With the names of the people who betrayed you
Within your government.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
It's imperative that we find him.

181
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,700
We would have to work under the radar.

182
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,100
Any word of an investigation,

183
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,500
People would start running for cover.

184
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,400
You're saying we can't even involve

185
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
The fbi and homeland?

186
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,400
Yes, sir, that's correct.

187
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,800
Madame president,

188
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,900
Tim wohe says it's urgent.

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,300
Put him through.

190
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,900
Have a seat.

191
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Yes?

192
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,800
Madame president, I'm sorry to interrupt.

193
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,000
There's a call for you from ike dubaku.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,100
Voice i.d. confirms that.
he says it's about your husband.

195
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,900
My husband?

196
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Yes, ma'am. I'll connect you.

197
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,900
This is president taylor.

198
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,200
I'll come straight to the point, madame president.

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
I have your husband.

200
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Let me demonstrate.

201
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,300
Say something.

202
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,800
Allison...

203
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Henry, are you all right?

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,300
I'm fine.

205
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,500
I'm sorry about this.

206
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,800
For god sake, don't let them use me

207
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
To influence you in any way.

208
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,900
My demands are as follows:

209
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,300
You will have your forces

210
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Withdrawn from around my country, Sangala,
Immediately and permanently.

211
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,100
Also, motobo must be delivered to my men

212
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,800
Who will be stationed at the east lot

213
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Of the stanswick power plant.

214
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,800
If he's not there by 4:00,

215
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,200
Or if anybody attempts to follow
or impede my men

216
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
When they leave the plant,

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,900
Your husband will die a slow and certain death.

218
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
You wouldn't dare!

219
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,100
Cut off his finger.

220
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,100
Stop it!

221
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Stop it!

222
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Meet my demands

223
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,100
Or I will send him back to you one piece at a time.

224
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,000
Do you understand, madame president?

225
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes,

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
I understand.

227
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,328
Any attempt To find your husband

228
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,500
Will be known to me very quickly,

229
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
And I will kill him immediately.

230
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,017
Madame president, I just heard back
From the team I sent to henry's last-known location.

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
They found samantha roth's

232
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,600
And secret service agent gedge's bodies.

233
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Oh, god!

234
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
Gedge had possession of a paralytic drug.

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,500
That and other evidence on scene suggests
he was complicit

236
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,245
In henry's abduction, which, of course, confirms

237
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,300
The corruption you just told us about.

238
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,100
Madame president, time is tight.

239
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,500
We need to decide how to respond.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,300
I don't think anyone would blame you

241
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,600
For holding back, at least temporarily,

242
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,700
The invasion of Sangala.

243
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,400
How many people died on those planes?

244
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,800
How many?!

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
About 300, ma'am.

246
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,400
All because I refused to change course in Sangala.

247
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,600
How can I ask the american people to make sacrifices

248
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,500
That I'm not willing to make myself?

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,700
I can't give in.

250
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't.

251
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,700
Madame president...

252
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,600
We can still try and find your husband

253
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Before the 4:00 deadline.

254
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,900
Dubaku has specifically forbidden that.

255
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,200
And according to you, I can't trust any of my

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
Law enforcement agencies.

257
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,700
You can trust me.

258
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,000
Right now everyone believes that agent walker is dead,

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
And I have no status at all.

260
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,100
Which means that dubaku's spies

261
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,900
Cannot track us because officially, we don't exist.

262
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,800
You resigned from government service,

263
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,300
And the senate regards you
as having been a renegade agent.

264
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,300
How am I supposed to know
where your loyalties really lie?

265
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,800
With all due respect, madame president,
ask around.

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,300
What could you even do on such short notice?

267
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,000
I couldn't make you any promises,

268
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,000
But we will do everything possible
to save your husband.

269
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
Right now, we need you to go along

270
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,100
With dubaku's demands.
help buy us some time.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Madame president, you don't have another choice.

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
All right.

273
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,400
All right.

274
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Find him, please?

275
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,900
Yes, ma'am.

276
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,300
We're gonna need a secure hard line.

277
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
You may use this room if you need to.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,400
I'll have you escorted back out through

279
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,900
The underground entrance when you're ready.

280
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
I'm gonna need a copy of the president

281
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
And the first gentleman's secret service details.

282
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,300
I'll have them brought to you.

283
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,400
Thank you.

284
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,900
Okay, we'll start off with agent gedge.

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
We need access to his phone records.

286
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,000
I want to know who he's been talking to
over the last few hours.

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Obviously, we can't use any of

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,800
The president's security people.

289
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Thank you.

290
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,200
Phone logs are highly classified,

291
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
Especially for agents assigned to the first family.

292
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
Can chloe o'brian get access?

293
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,700
It'll be faster if we can get someone

294
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,100
Who's already got clearance.

295
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,400
Larry moss.

296
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,000
He doesn't strike me

297
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
As someone who's willing to work outside the system.

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,900
That's true, but I think I can persuade him
to do what we need.

299
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,200
You really trust him?

300
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,700
Yes. we know each other pretty well.

301
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
Fine. try him. we don't have much time.

302
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,800
Agent moss.

303
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,100
Larry, it's renee. I'm alive,

304
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,500
But you can't let anyone know.
do you understand me?

305
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,600
Oh, my god.

306
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,700
Renee? what... where are you? are you all right?

307
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm-i'm fine. I'll explain later,

308
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,200
But right now we need your help.

309
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,700
Who's, who's "we"?

310
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
Myself and jack bauer.

311
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
What?!

312
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,300
He's on our side, larry, just like he said.

313
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,900
Everything that he did,
he did to preserve his cover.

314
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,300
Renee, this whole time I've been thinking
you were dead.

315
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,700
Why didn't you tell me?

316
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,000
The bureau is compromised.

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Larry, just like he said,
and on one there can know

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,500
About this operation.
it has to stay completely off book.

319
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,100
What operation?

320
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Jack and I are at the white house.

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,800
The first gentleman has been kidnapped by ike dubaku.

322
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,500
I don't, I don't know anything about that.

323
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,200
It's true. the president's asked
jack and me to find him.

324
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,400
Very few people know about this,

325
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,800
And that's the way that it has to stay.

326
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,700
If we don't find him by 4:00 p.m., he'll be killed.

327
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,400
Larry... if you've ever trusted me,

328
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,300
Trust me now, please, and help me.

329
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
What do you want me to do?

330
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,300
Looks like the first gentleman's secret service agent

331
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,700
Was involved in all of this-- brian gedge;
he's dead.

332
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,600
You need to check his phone logs

333
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,949
And get all the information you can
About who he's been in contact with recently.

334
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,700
I need to see you to make sure this is real,

335
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,000
That you're not under duress.

336
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,200
No, there's no time for that.

337
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,900
That's not negotiable.
you want my help, we meet.

338
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,300
The capitol reflecting pool,
as soon as you can get there.

339
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,500
Okay, fine.

340
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,300
HE'LL HELP US I THINK, BUT WE NEED TO GO.

341
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,500
President taylor emphasized

342
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,600
The terrorists are no longer a threat

343
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,300
And says the invasion will begin.

344
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,900
She also says

345
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,800
Former prime minister ule motobo
will be reinstated

346
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,100
To work towards building a new democratic government.

347
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,400
I don't get it.

348
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,000
What?

349
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,500
The president's talking as if

350
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
The cip device and motobo have been recovered,

351
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,300
But how could that have happened
without us knowing about it?

352
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, it just means whatever agency's responsible

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hasn't let us know.

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,800
What other agency?

355
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,900
We're being kept out of the loop,

356
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,000
And I don't like it.

357
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
So am I seeing you later?

358
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,900
I don't know. I've got some things to figure out.

359
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,100
What does that mean?

360
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,600
It means I have to get home at some point.

361
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,400
I haven't seen christina in a week.

362
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
All right.

363
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,100
Sean, are you all right?

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
I'm fine.

365
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,800
I'm sensing a little distance.

366
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
I just have to get back to work.

367
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,100
Excuse me.

368
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,800
Could you be a little less obvious, do you think?

369
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,900
What are you talking about?

370
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,200
Give me a break.

371
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,600
Just hold up a sign that says,

372
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
"hey, world, we're sleeping together."

373
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,700
Are you stupid?

374
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,200
I know it's stupid and wrong,

375
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,100
And I'm gonna end it.

376
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah, you'd better, fast, before larry notices.

377
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,500
Where is larry?

378
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I don't know.
that's not the point.

379
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
The point is, if he finds out about this,

380
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,900
he's gonna transfer your ass to juneau so fast,

381
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,200
Your head will spin.

382
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,800
Larry.

383
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,200
Oh, my god.

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,900
I thought I'd never see you again.

385
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,600
Were you able to access agent gedge's phone records?

386
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,600
Yeah.

387
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,200
Yeah,

388
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Over the last three hours, gedge spoke repeatedly

389
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,800
To another secret service agent
named edward vossler.

390
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
I checked out vossler's personnel records.

391
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,500
Before he was a secret service agent,
he was special forces,

392
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,000
And for two years, served in Sangala.

393
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,100
So we can assume vossler's working for dubaku.

394
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,000
Did you bring any of his files with you?

395
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah.

396
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,700
Does vossler have a family?

397
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,700
Why do you need to know that?

398
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,100
Does he have a family?

399
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
He's been married for five years to a paralegal.

400
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,500
They have an 11-month-old baby boy.

401
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,100
She left her job to stay home with the kid.

402
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,400
Okay, we're gonna need to split up.

403
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
I need you to help me track vossler.

404
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,100
I need you to go to his home
and hope his family is there.

405
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,700
Vossler was special forces.

406
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,500
There's no way we're gonna break him
in the time that we've got.

407
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
The only way to get him to cooperate
is to make him

408
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,700
Think we're gonna hurt his family,
his wife and his kid.

409
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,600
No, absolutely not.
renee?

410
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,300
That's stepping over the line, jack.

411
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,300
You stepped over the line

412
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
The second you interrogated tanner.

413
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,000
Tanner's a murderer.

414
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,100
As far as we know,
vossler's wife is completely innocent,

415
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,200
Let alone a small child.

416
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
When are you people gonna stop thinking

417
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
Everyone else is following your rules?!

418
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,700
They're not!

419
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,700
Dubaku is gonna kill henry taylor

420
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,800
Within the next 45 minutes unless we find him.

421
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,600
YOU'VE GOT ONE OF TWO CHOICES.

422
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,700
Now you can either phone the president
and explain to her

423
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,100
That your conscience won't allow you

424
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
To do what is necessary to save him,

425
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,900
Or you can simply do what is necessary.

426
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Pick one!

427
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,600
Renee?

428
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,800
Larry!

429
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Renee?

430
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm gonna need your vehicle.

431
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,600
Start tracking vossler through his cell phone.

432
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
Utilize his secret service deployment grid.

433
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
Look at yourself.

434
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,900
You've lost everyone and everything you ever had

435
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,000
By doing what you think is necessary.

436
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,400
I won't let you do it to her, bauer.

437
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Renee will not end up like you.

438
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
Are you gonna give me your keys or not?

439
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
Jack.

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,300
Jack!

441
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,800
The rules are what make us better.

442
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,200
Not today.

443
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,400
Even those who oppose the plan to invade Sangala

444
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Can't deny the atrocities committed by that regime.

445
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,800
I slowed down taylor's bleeding,

446
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,800
But I can't get it to stop completely.

447
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,200
Tourniquet is as tight as possible?

448
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,700
Yes.

449
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,100
Then cauterize the wound.

450
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,600
Mikali has a blowtorch.

451
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
You risk taylor going into shock.

452
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,500
Just put something in his mouth.

453
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,600
I don't want him biting his tongue off with the pain.

454
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,800
Hey, what are you doing at home, huh?

455
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,100
I thought you'd be at work.

456
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,400
I was. rosa called me at the diner.

457
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,200
She was having one of her episodes.

458
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,700
You know your sister.
she's just manipulating you.

459
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
You don't have to go to her every time she calls.

460
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm all she has, samuel.
be kind.

461
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
You know, you're kind enough for both of us.

462
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,500
I just wanted to make sure

463
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,800
That you were still coming to dinner tonight.

464
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,700
Um, look, I'm really sorry, but I can't.

465
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm looking at a stack of shipping manifests.

466
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,200
Oh, no! isn't there some way?

467
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,400
We could do it as late as you want.

468
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,500
I really wish I could.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,300
I'm sorry, marika.

470
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Uh, listen, baby,

471
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,100
I'll make it up to you, okay?

472
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,300
Okay. well, I'm gonna make extra

473
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,800
Just in case you change your mind.

474
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,300
You're too good to me.

475
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,500
You're right.

476
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,500
I have to get back to the diner, rosa.

477
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,800
Are you gonna be okay?

478
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
Who was that on the phone?

479
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It was him, wasn't it?

480
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,700
All right, stop.

481
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
I know you don't approve

482
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,500
Of samuel, but I love him.

483
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,900
Oh. you love him?

484
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,600
Why?

485
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,600
Because he spends money on you?

486
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Because he pays our rent?

487
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,039
You've only known him Four months.

488
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,500
What difference does that make?

489
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
You don't know anything about him.

490
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,100
What if he's not the importer he says he is?

491
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,900
Or that he's in this country illegally?

492
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,000
Not this again.

493
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,500
I'm just trying to protect you, marika.

494
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
I don't need your protection.

495
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,100
Yes, you do.

496
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,200
This man isn't...

497
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,500
Isn't what?

498
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,900
Nothing.

499
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Forget it.

500
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I'm sorry, I don't have time for this.

501
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,300
I'll be home after my shift.

502
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,200
We can appear to comply
with the first part of dubaku's demand

503
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,500
By pulling the fleet back.

504
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,400
Then we simply launch the invasion
from farther out at sea.

505
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,700
Now, the second part of his demand
is more complicated.

506
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,500
If we were really turning matobo over,

507
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,800
We'd be putting him in a car right about now.

508
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,000
That's out of the question. we need him safe.

509
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,200
Agreed.
but we can send a car with a look-alike.

510
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,900
If we handle it right,
dubaku won't be aware of the deception

511
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Until the last minute.

512
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,200
By then, hopefully, we'll have found henry.

513
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,000
Madame president,
do we have your authorization to proceed?

514
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,200
Yes.

515
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,900
This is bauer.

516
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,900
Okay, I've got vossler. he's on the beltway

517
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,000
Near bethesda, moving south,
about seven miles from you.

518
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,200
Copy that. I'm on my way. where's he headed?

519
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,100
According to the secret service log,

520
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,500
His shift starts at 4:00 p.m.

521
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,200
He's meeting a foreign dignitary's plane at andrews.

522
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,600
Jack, I don't have to tell you--

523
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,800
Once he's through that gate and onto that base,

524
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,100
You're not going to be able to touch him.

525
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,300
Okay, he's going to have to double back on the 337

526
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,600
If he wants to get through that main gate.

527
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I should be able to make up time
by taking connecticut.

528
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,100
Just keep sight of him.

529
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
Have you heard from renee?

530
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,800
Do we know if she's arrived at vossler's house yet?

531
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,300
No. but she knows how to get in touch with us

532
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,700
If she's in trouble.

533
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,800
Coming.

534
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,300
Can I help you?

535
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,600
Who are you?

536
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,300
Shut up. do what I tell you, and there's a chance

537
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
You'll live through this.

538
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,600
- Don't move!
- he's scared.

539
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Stay where you are
or I will shoot you where you stand.

540
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
You're going to kill me
for trying to comfort my baby?

541
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,900
Sit down.

542
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,400
What kind of a person are you?

543
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,600
Doing this to us.

544
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,400
You should ask your husband that.

545
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,900
What are you talking about?

546
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,200
Edward is a good man.

547
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,400
Maybe you don't know him quite as well
as you think you do.

548
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,400
- I know he would never point a gun near a child.
- shut up!

549
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,500
Put the cuff around your wrist.

550
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,200
Don't do this.

551
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,600
Now!

552
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,200
Okay, where is he now?

553
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,500
He just got off the beltway.

554
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,400
He's stopped in traffic.

555
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,700
Okay, I'm coming up on the intersection

556
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,200
Of allenford and auth.
I should be there in 30 seconds.

557
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,900
Just let me know if he moves.

558
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,000
He's moving.

559
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,800
Damn it!

560
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,900
What's the next street north?

561
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
Baxter drive.

562
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,900
But, jack, it's a one-way street.

563
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
Copy that.

564
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,300
He made the light at allenford.

565
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,800
I'm on baxter.

566
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,300
He's 15 seconds away, jack.

567
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,700
Ten seconds.

568
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
Five seconds.

569
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,400
I got him.

570
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,800
Let me see your hands!

571
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,900
Now!

572
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,700
Get out of the car. get out of the car!

573
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,400
Move. move!

574
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,400
GET IN HERE!

575
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,100
COME HERE!

576
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Where is he?

577
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,200
- Where is henry taylor?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

578
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,100
Where is he?

579
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,200
Fine,

580
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,700
We'll do this your way

581
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
Yes.

582
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,400
I've got vossler. you got his wife?

583
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,000
- And his child.
- you ready?

584
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Yes.

585
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,900
Put your phone on speaker.

586
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
Talk to your wife.

587
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,800
- You son of a bitch...
- talk to your wife!

588
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,600
Carol, ar-are you all right?

589
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,100
There's a woman with a gun.
she's threatening to kill me.

590
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,300
Why is conner crying?

591
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,500
Oh, my god, edward.

592
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
What's happening? who are these people?

593
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
You are running out of time.

594
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
I didn't want to have to do this.

595
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,000
No, you wouldn't...

596
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,800
- What's happening?
- I don't know. she's got conner.

597
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,600
Oh, my god, she's doing something to conner!

598
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,300
Let go of my baby!

599
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,400
He's just a baby! please!

600
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,900
- What the hell are you doing?
- you can stop this. just tell me where he is.

601
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,500
For god's sake, edward,
tell them what they want to know!

602
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,100
Damn it! all right, all right, I'll tell you!

603
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,500
Stand down. I'll get back to you.

604
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,300
Your baby's fine.

605
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
You're a monster!

606
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,500
Where is he?!

607
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,000
You tell me now, or the situation

608
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,500
For your family goes from bad to worse.

609
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,700
Where is he?

610
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,500
How do I know you're just
not going to kill them anyway?

611
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,700
You don't.

612
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Fine.

613
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,900
There's a greengrocer, 12451 arlington avenue.

614
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,300
They're holding him in the basement.

615
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,400
Access.

616
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,500
There's a staircase in the back,

617
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
But it's always locked.

618
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,000
- Is dubaku with him?
- he was.

619
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,100
How many guns are guarding him?

620
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,000
- At least four.
- get out of here!

621
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,300
Get away from the car!

622
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,800
Walk away... now!

623
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,000
Damn it.

624
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,700
Stop!

625
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,300
Get out of the car now!

626
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,500
Move! move!

627
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,500
The goal is to make it look like
we're going to hand matobo over

628
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,900
For as long as is reasonably possible.

629
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
When you get to the rendezvous point,

630
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,600
Keep your distance from dubaku's men.

631
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,400
Let them see you in the backseat,

632
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,900
But do not get out of the car.

633
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,700
Don't let them get any closer
than you feel comfortable with.

634
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,100
As soon as you start to feel
that the risk is unacceptable,

635
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,300
Get the hell out.

636
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,800
That's straight from the president.

637
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,600
- Clear?
- clear.

638
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Good luck.

639
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,500
Jack?

640
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,000
I got an address

641
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,300
For henry taylor.
12451 arlington avenue.

642
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,100
It's a storefront.
he's being held in the basement.

643
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,300
If you get there before I do,
I want you to stand down.

644
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,100
Dubaku's got at least four gunmen there.

645
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,900
- All right.
- meanwhile, I'm going to call bill,

646
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,700
Pull him up to speed.

647
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,200
I want you to do the same thing with larry.

648
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,400
- And what about vossler?
- he's dead.

649
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,500
He attacked me. I didn't have a choice.

650
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,700
Are you okay?

651
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,900
No, I don't think I am.

652
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,500
What do you mean? what's wrong?

653
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,600
Agent walker, are you still there?

654
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,700
I'm not...

655
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,400
Listen to me.

656
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,600
We could not have gotten this far
if it wasn't for you.

657
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,800
Okay?

658
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,600
No one would blame you
if this was just too much for you to handle.

659
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,000
Maybe you should get out.

660
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,700
Maybe I will.

661
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,100
Yeah.

662
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,800
Tomorrow.

663
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
Agent masden and I are on our way.

664
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,300
We'll be tracking you via satellite.

665
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,600
Check in with me
when you're approaching the power plant.

666
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
Yes, sir.

667
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,900
How much time do you think this will buy us?

668
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,600
Until dubaku realizes matobo's not in the limo.

669
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,900
Ten minutes, maybe 15.

670
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,900
That's 15 minutes more than we had.

671
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,100
Madame president,
I just got off the phone with jack bauer.

672
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,900
He and agent walker think
they have a location on your husband.

673
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,500
Where?

674
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,700
Arlington avenue.
they're on their way now.

675
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,100
How long will it take them?

676
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,800
Ten, 15 minutes.

677
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,900
Thank you.

678
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,600
This just came over from homeland.

679
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
Like you said--

680
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,200
We're being kept out of the loop.

681
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,400
Thanks.

682
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,100
Did you see this?

683
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,639
Homeland's preparing to lower the threat level

684
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,100
At the president's request.

685
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,300
Yeah, I saw the flash.

686
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,200
Don't you think that's odd,

687
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Considering we don't know anything
about the cip device being recovered?

688
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,400
Yeah. I'll talk to homeland.

689
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,600
All I'm saying is... I get the feeling

690
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,100
Like there's something going on
behind our back here.

691
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,000
Like I said, I'll talk to them.

692
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,900
- Excuse me.
- yeah, sure.

693
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,000
Where are you?

694
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,300
On my way to where we think
henry taylor's being held.

695
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,400
So you got vossler to talk.

696
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,000
It gave us our only chance
to rescue the president's husband.

697
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,600
What's the address?

698
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,200
I'll send a swat team to meet you.

699
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,300
You know you can't do that.

700
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,200
The bureau's compromised.

701
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,400
It will jeopardize any attempt that we make.

702
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,300
But there is something else I need you to do.

703
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,600
Okay, what's that?

704
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,300
Keep an incident quiet

705
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,500
Until what jack and I are doing goes down.

706
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,700
What incident?

707
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Vossler's dead.

708
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
Jack killed him at the hotel on 18th and riggin.

709
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,000
It was self-defense.

710
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,100
Is that what he told you?

711
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,300
- Larry...
- damn it, renee, what the hell are you doing with this guy?

712
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,000
We're supposed to bring suspects in,
not murder them.

713
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,300
Larry, please...

714
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,600
And until we know who dubaku's source is there,

715
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,300
You've got to handle this outside of the bureau, okay?

716
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,700
There's a guy at d.c. metro I know I can trust.

717
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,500
I'll have him deal with vossler.

718
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,700
Thank you, larry.

719
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,800
I understand. I will let him know.

720
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,100
According to our sources, a vehicle containing matobo

721
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,800
- Just left the white house.
- good.

722
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What is the state of the american invasion forces?

723
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,700
The fleet is withdrawing

724
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,600
From Sangalan territorial waters,

725
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,700
And has set steam for the 23rd meridian.

726
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,400
Excellent.

727
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,400
Hello.

728
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,400
It's rosa.

729
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Rosa, if you're looking for marika,
she's not with me.

730
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,300
I'm looking for you, samuel.

731
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,600
Or whatever your real name is.

732
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,200
What are you talking about?

733
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,600
My sister may be naive, but I'm not.

734
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,000
I checked with someone I know
at immigration services,

735
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,127
And no one named samuel aboa
emigrated from Sangala

736
00:36:46,127 --> 00:36:50,600
In the last year, or in the last 15 years.

737
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,300
Well, they've obviously made a mistake.

738
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,000
You're making a mistake.

739
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,300
Now I don't know who you really are,
and I don't care.

740
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,400
I just want you out of my sister's life.

741
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,000
Does marika know about this?

742
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
No, not yet.

743
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,700
And I'm willing to keep it that way.

744
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,600
So you've not reported me to anyone?

745
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,100
No. I don't want marika to know anything about this.

746
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,700
What do you want?

747
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,200
Break up with her,

748
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,300
And this stays between us.

749
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,100
You just end it tonight,

750
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,000
And we won't have a problem.

751
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,800
I have to take care of a little problem.

752
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
CALL ME WHEN WE HAVE MATOBO.

753
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,500
Yeah.

754
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,000
The vehicle that's supposed to be delivering matobo

755
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,600
Is arriving at the power plant.
if we delay any longer,

756
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,000
Dubaku is going to get suspicious.
what's your status?

757
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,700
- I'm almost there. how much time can you buy us?
- I don't know, jack.

758
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,400
Okay, agent walker and I will move in
as soon as I get there.

759
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
I'll keep you posted.

760
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,700
All right, good luck.

761
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,700
This is agent smith.

762
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,200
- We've got a visual on dubaku's men.
- understood.

763
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,600
We have it on satellite.

764
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,800
Bring him to us.

765
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,500
They've ordered us to get out of the car.

766
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,600
- Now one of them is making a call.
- hang tight, agent.

767
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,200
Their car arrived,

768
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,600
- But nothing is happening.
- what do you mean nothing is happening?

769
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,600
We ordered them to hand matobo over to us

770
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,200
But no one's getting out of the vehicle.

771
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,100
The americans have been playing us.

772
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,400
Destroy their vehicle.

773
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,900
Yes, sir.

774
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,000
- That's long enough.
get them the hell out of there.
- retreat.

775
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,400
- Get out now.
- roger that.

776
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,600
- You ready?
- yes.

777
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Let's go.

778
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,000
Get out from behind the counter.
now! move!

779
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,000
Okay, I want you to unlock that door.

780
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,700
And I want you to ask those men
what they want to eat.

781
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,900
You do one thing I don't like,

782
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,100
And I will blow your head off,
you understand me?

783
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,600
Open the door.

784
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,600
Want anything to eat?

785
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,600
- No. some cold beers.
- okay.

786
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,100
Yes.

787
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,300
Kill henry taylor.

788
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Then we have nothing to hold over their heads.

789
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,200
We don't have anything now.

790
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
The president was willing to let him die.

791
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,900
We are done here.

792
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,800
Kill taylor,

793
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,400
And have your men pack everything up.

794
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Understood.

795
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,900
Oh, my god.

796
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,400
Sir... sir...

797
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
We're going to get you help.

798
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,300
Just stay with me.

799
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,700
Get an ambulance!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
