1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,268
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

2
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:17,435
In the meantime, I'm going

3
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:19,337
to need a provisional
chief of staff.

4
00:00:19,405 --> 00:00:21,205
I would like that to be you.

5
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:23,140
<i>I have Larry Moss
calling for you.</i>

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,209
<i>Ma'am, we have evidence
Juma allowed Starkwood to use</i>

7
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,643
Sangala as a base to manufacture
biological weapons.

8
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,445
Are you saying these
weapons are on US soil?

9
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:31,579
We suspect they're at the
Starkwood headquarters

10
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,780
in Virginia.

11
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:34,681
And you're not suggesting
that Starkwood intends

12
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:36,649
to use those weapons
to attack this country?

13
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:37,817
Given their actions today,

14
00:00:37,885 --> 00:00:39,885
we need to move
on Starkwood immediately.

15
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,287
They're coming

16
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:43,554
and they'll be coming with
everything they've got

17
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:46,390
and the only thing
that's going to stop them

18
00:00:46,457 --> 00:00:48,525
is getting these weapons
ready to deploy.

19
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:51,127
Tell me what
the FBI knows.

20
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:52,328
I don't know anything,

21
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:54,495
Mr. Hodges.

22
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:56,398
<i>Get him out of here</i>

23
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:57,631
and do what you have to do.

24
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,301
I'm not spending
the rest of my life

25
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,803
in prison because Jonas
Hodges has lost his mind.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,570
You know where the weapons are?
Yes.

27
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:07,372
Where's Jack?

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,307
<i>He managed to secure
the weapons,</i>

29
00:01:09,374 --> 00:01:11,042
but Starkwood got him back.

30
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:12,675
Jack was exposed.

31
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:14,144
There has to be something that

32
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:16,178
you can do to help him.
There's no cure.

33
00:01:16,246 --> 00:01:17,446
We got a location
on the weapon.

34
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:21,115
nt to go.

35
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:23,584
I'm sorry.
I can't allow it.

36
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:24,785
I'm the only one who's
seen the canisters.

37
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,352
I know exactly what
we're looking for.

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,120
But you're sick.
We have no idea

39
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,588
when you're going to
start showing symptoms.

40
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,656
You're right.

41
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:37,627
Where are the damn weapons?!

42
00:01:39,263 --> 00:01:40,529
He played me.

43
00:01:40,597 --> 00:01:41,797
<i>Little old Seaton</i>

44
00:01:41,864 --> 00:01:43,031
bought us some time.

45
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:44,732
We're going to do
a point by point search

46
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
of this entire compound.

47
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,205
There are biological weapons
on this facility.

48
00:01:54,273 --> 00:01:55,273
We're not going
anywhere without them.

49
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:57,141
<i>You try to advance any farther,</i>

50
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:58,309
you will be fired upon.

51
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:13,720
I count three
platoons at least.

52
00:02:13,788 --> 00:02:15,188
Everything mil-spec.

53
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:17,055
Yeah. They were
waiting for us.

54
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:20,024
This was one big trap.

55
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,360
Renee, we would really use
those satellite overheads.

56
00:02:22,428 --> 00:02:23,627
Copy, Larry.

57
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:25,395
What have we got?
Nothing.

58
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:26,562
The subnet's been crashing.

59
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,063
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Here we go.

60
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,164
I've got sat five
retasking now...

61
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:31,533
Somebody talk to me.

62
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,801
What are you seeing?

63
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:34,468
Larry, you've got
hostiles on all sides.

64
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:36,269
Damn it. Find
me an opening.

65
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,537
I'm looking,

66
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:39,305
but there's no way through.
Okay, heads up.

67
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:40,905
<i>Is everybody seeing this?</i>

68
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,106
<i>Larry?</i>

69
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:44,308
Yeah.

70
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:45,576
Yeah. we're seeing it.

71
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,586
It's Hodges.

72
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:03,456
The men are
at the ready, sir.

73
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:04,857
I appreciate
your presence.

74
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,691
Where else would I be?

75
00:03:08,227 --> 00:03:09,326
Who's in charge here?

76
00:03:09,394 --> 00:03:11,194
I am.

77
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:12,563
Agent Moss.

78
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,598
You need to move your men
and allow us to proceed.

79
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,366
I want you
off our property

80
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,601
and I want you
to release my man.

81
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,569
You have no right
to take him hostage.

82
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,437
I have an order from the
President of the United States.

83
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,939
To search this building.

84
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:30,743
<i>For weapons that do not exist.</i>

85
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:33,043
Have you looked?

86
00:03:33,111 --> 00:03:35,044
Are there weapons
of mass destruction?

87
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:36,880
Are there weapons of any kind?

88
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,116
Is there anything
in here at all?!

89
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,088
Agent Moss,

90
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:51,223
who dreamed up this charade?

91
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,291
Give me a name.

92
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,593
Let's get to the bottom of this.

93
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,161
You want to talk
to me, Mr. Hodges?

94
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,296
Get these guns off my head.

95
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,231
You think you have
a gun at your head?

96
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,700
You know what I've got?

97
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:07,502
I've got the United States
government sending SWAT teams

98
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:09,704
and attack helicopters
in the middle of the night.

99
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:14,573
I've got a government that
I served faithfully for 30 years

100
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:17,042
dreaming up BS accusations

101
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,512
so politicians too cowardly
to show their faces

102
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,746
can dismantle my company.

103
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:24,180
That's what I've got.

104
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,318
You've got five minutes

105
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:33,320
to get these-these helicopters
flying out of here

106
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:35,488
with all of you on board.

107
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:36,890
You don't want
to do this.

108
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:39,591
Five minutes.

109
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,992
And I want my man back.

110
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,666
Renee, you get that?

111
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:51,767
Yeah, we did.

112
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:53,802
And what options do we have?
In five minutes?

113
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,637
I know there's no time
to bring in more TAC support,

114
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:56,937
so give me something else.

115
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,073
All right, Larry, give me
a second. Stand by.

116
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:03,142
That's it.

117
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,678
I want to show
you something.

118
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:08,178
Hodges just gave us five
minutes to clear the base.

119
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:09,447
We lost that situation.
We were outmaneuvered

120
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:11,448
but I think I found
us a new way in.

121
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:13,349
Look. These are
Senator Mayer's files.

122
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,417
This is Douglas Knowles.
He's the chairman of Starkwood.

123
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,152
He was actually helping

124
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,519
the senator with
the investigation.

125
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:19,887
He is the one who
brokered the deal

126
00:05:19,955 --> 00:05:21,255
to open the company's books.

127
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,856
What, another insider?
Didn't we just get burned?

128
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:24,090
Just listen.

129
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,191
Knowles was loyal to
Hodges for almost 20 years

130
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,794
and now he's secretly helping
the senator take down Starkwood?

131
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,928
He's scared of something.

132
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,863
This man wants to help us.

133
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,330
It's worth a shot.

134
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:35,198
Yeah. Make the call.

135
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,304
Knowles.

136
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:46,106
Mr. Knowles,
my name is Jack Bauer.

137
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:47,874
I got your number
from Senator Mayer.

138
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:49,375
Senator Mayer is dead.

139
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,343
Yes, sir, I know. I was
with him when he was killed

140
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,377
by one of your employees.

141
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:55,412
A man named John Quinn.

142
00:05:57,782 --> 00:06:00,484
You have no idea how much
I was hoping someone would call.

143
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,618
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't understand.

144
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:04,786
Things are very
out of control.

145
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,220
Are you aware
of what's happening

146
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,321
on your base?

147
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,356
I'm watching it
with my own eyes.

148
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:10,624
The FBI is pinned down.

149
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:12,324
They say they're looking
for bioweapons.

150
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:14,193
Sir, Jonas Hodges
is in possession

151
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,127
of a military-grade
bioweapon.

152
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,697
A prion variant developed
in Africa with General Juma.

153
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:20,798
Well, it's not
where they think it is.

154
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,165
They're all standing in
front of an empty hangar.

155
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,234
The FBI was deliberately led
to the wrong location

156
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,068
by a man named Seaton,
but I promise you, sir,

157
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,537
the weapon is
on your base.

158
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:31,238
I was contaminated when trying
to intercept the canisters.

159
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,306
They were ferried
back to Starkwood

160
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:33,840
approximately 90
minutes ago.

161
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:36,042
90 minutes ago
Jonas was handing down

162
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,710
his new strategy to the board.

163
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:41,312
Stonewall the government,
no cooperation whatsoever.

164
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,347
I can't believe
this is happening.

165
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:44,982
Sir, this is happening

166
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:46,850
and I promise you
the weapons are on your base.

167
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:48,985
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

168
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:51,253
I think I might.

169
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,121
Mr. Knowles, I want
to put you in touch

170
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:54,155
with one of my men
in the field.

171
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:56,023
Can I call you right back?
Yes.

172
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,425
Thank you. Go.

173
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:01,828
<i>Some of the men were unhappy
drawing down on federal agents.</i>

174
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,896
It's understandable.

175
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:06,931
I had hoped not
to include the rank and file.

176
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:09,066
You can count on them.

177
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:12,301
Let's show our guests the door.

178
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:15,838
Let's move!

179
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:18,640
Into position.

180
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,378
Jack, I'm on comm.

181
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:29,614
You're on with me
and Agent Walker.

182
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,848
Hodges' men have
repositioned themselves.

183
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,683
Okay, we're going
to have to move fast.

184
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,884
Larry, I want
you and your men

185
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,351
to pull out on
Hodges' timetable.

186
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,119
Tony, you're going to need
to find a way to stay behind.

187
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:39,254
We're going to get your vectors
over to a man that we contacted

188
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,422
inside Starkwood.

189
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:41,589
His name is Douglas Knowles.

190
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:43,123
He believes he knows
where the weapons are.

191
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:45,191
Isn't this how we got
into this mess?

192
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,260
Almeida and some supposedly
friendly contact?

193
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:48,361
Knowles is chairman

194
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:49,762
of the Starkwood board,
but he was cooperating

195
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,530
with Senator Mayer's
investigation of the company.

196
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:52,931
Larry, he is all that we've got.

197
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:57,267
All right, I got 400 eyeballs
trained on me right now.

198
00:07:57,334 --> 00:07:59,468
How the hell are we supposed
to get Almeida to stay behind?

199
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:01,270
Larry, I need you and your
men to create a diversion

200
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:02,304
to cover Tony's escape.

201
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:04,305
Look, we need to
make this work.

202
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,774
If you all get on those
helicopters together,

203
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,808
we are going to lose
this weapon for good.

204
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:14,279
<i>Larry, are you
on board with this?</i>

205
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:17,648
We got to go.

206
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,617
Larry, we need to know,
are you on board?

207
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:22,351
I'll do what I can.

208
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:25,754
Take his bag.

209
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:27,823
All right, let's go.

210
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,991
We're standing down.
You're coming with me.

211
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,425
Hey, wait a minute.

212
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:32,826
This wasn't part
of the deal.

213
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:34,494
What deal? As far as I could
tell, he couldn't care about you

214
00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:36,428
one way or the other.
Moss.

215
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:38,263
You take these handcuffs
off of me

216
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,530
or it's going
to get really ugly.

217
00:08:44,502 --> 00:08:45,703
Soldier!

218
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,140
Get the hell out
of here, Moss.

219
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,208
You don't want
to test us.

220
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,110
Let's go!

221
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,607
Don't move. No!

222
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:39,874
Doug Knowles.

223
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:42,877
Jack Bauer sent me.
Come on.

224
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,617
That street's
solid security cameras.

225
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,818
I'll take you to
a restricted area.

226
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,219
It's on the
east perimeter.

227
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,121
There's a good chance
the weapons are there.

228
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,156
The place is crawling.

229
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:01,657
I don't know how
we're going to make it.

230
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:03,324
I'll take care of that.

231
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,626
<i>Jack, I'm with Knowles.</i>

232
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:08,828
I'm going to need satellite
support on the east perimeter.

233
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,032
Jack, I need support.
Do you copy?

234
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,601
Copy, Tony.

235
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:21,071
I've got you just
off the landing pad.

236
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:22,705
No hostiles
in your immediate vicinity.

237
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:23,873
Proceed at your own discretion.

238
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,874
Copy that.

239
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,841
Which way?

240
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,710
Come on.

241
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:31,745
Jack.

242
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:34,513
You all right?

243
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:36,582
Yeah, I'm fine.

244
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:39,217
Tony and Knowles have connected.
We're good.

245
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:40,785
It's time to call
the White House with an update.

246
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,853
Okay, good.
I'll be right there.

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,300
Madam President,
excuse the interruption.

248
00:11:03,368 --> 00:11:04,735
Jack Bauer is on line seven.

249
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:10,805
Mr. Bauer, tell me you
have the bioweapon.

250
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:12,940
Madam President,
I'm afraid that's not the case.

251
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:14,508
Our search was stopped
by armed mercenaries

252
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:16,010
on Starkwood's base.

253
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:17,510
Agent Moss and his men
were forced to withdraw

254
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,945
from a firefight they most
certainly would have lost.

255
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,680
Are you saying Hodges
men were ready to fire

256
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,315
on federal agents?

257
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:24,849
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

258
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,884
My God!

259
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,217
Who does he think he is?!

260
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:30,620
Madam President,
despite the setback,

261
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,321
I am confident
the weapons are still there.

262
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:33,990
I reached out to
Starkwood's chairman.

263
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:36,424
He's willing to cooperate.
He's with Tony Alameida now.

264
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:38,525
They are moving towards
a secure area on the base

265
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:40,160
where we believe the
weapons are being held.

266
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,328
Very good.

267
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:42,495
Tim, what's our
troop status?

268
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:43,529
Mobilizing.

269
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:44,663
The Secretary
of Defense says

270
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:45,898
they're still several hours out.

271
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,565
At which point we have
a war on our hands

272
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,000
against 1,500
mercenaries

273
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:50,667
armed with bioweapons.

274
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:52,335
Madam President, I do believe
that a surgical air strike

275
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:53,803
will work as long
as we can pinpoint

276
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:56,038
the exact location
of the weapon.

277
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,106
And you can do that?

278
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,473
Yes, I believe we can.

279
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,441
Mr. Bauer,
you've seen the canisters

280
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:01,675
containing the bioweapons,
you know what

281
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:02,976
they look like,
is that correct?

282
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:04,144
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:06,545
Then we'll need you
to verify the canisters

284
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,680
once Almeida
has located them.

285
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:10,248
No more mistakes.

286
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:11,482
<i>We're gonna need
visual confirmation</i>

287
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,218
from you, Bauer-- eyes on.

288
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:16,220
Jack, we have got
to get this part right.

289
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:17,853
I understand.
Anything else?

290
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:24,092
Jack, I have been told
that you were exposed

291
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,793
to the pathogen.

292
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,395
How you doing?

293
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:29,829
Right now I'm fine,
Madam President.

294
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:31,298
Thank you for asking.

295
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,399
Thank you for your service.

296
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,266
I'm not giving up on you.

297
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:36,867
Keep me informed.

298
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:38,336
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:40,404
Let's go.

300
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:51,511
I don't have a lot of time.

301
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:52,646
What's going on?

302
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:53,813
That's what I've been
trying to ask you.

303
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I called three times.

304
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:56,549
It's kind of crazy
here right now.

305
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:58,016
Unless it's urgent,
I gotta call you back.

306
00:12:58,084 --> 00:12:59,884
I'm hearing rumors
that the Joint Chiefs

307
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:01,118
have been called in.

308
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:03,520
It's not a big deal.

309
00:13:03,588 --> 00:13:04,887
They're just doing
a final assessment

310
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,189
before lowering the alert level.

311
00:13:06,257 --> 00:13:07,556
Olivia, don't do this.

312
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:08,890
What?

313
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,225
I'm telling you the truth.

314
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:11,960
Really?

315
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:13,761
Because I've got a source
in the Port Authority

316
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,929
container yard who's
using terms like "weapons

317
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,864
of mass destruction,"
so naturally I'm wondering

318
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:20,632
if that's why the Joint Chiefs
are having a meeting.

319
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,101
Look, I can't
talk about it.

320
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,270
It's obviously a question
of national security.

321
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,404
But you have my word
I'll tell you soon as I can.

322
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,839
I want to know now.

323
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,342
I just gave you
a big story, Ken.

324
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:35,277
You'll have to wait.
I gotta go.

325
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:37,911
Don't hang up on me, Olivia.

326
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,080
That'd be a big mistake.

327
00:13:40,147 --> 00:13:42,782
What's that supposed to mean?

328
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,717
You want me to say it,
fine, I'll say it.

329
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,885
Think how your mother
would feel when she hears

330
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,420
that you forced out
her chief of staff

331
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:50,753
so you could take
over his position.

332
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:54,923
He was incompetent.

333
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,493
Yeah, well, it won't play
that way on the morning news.

334
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,527
So, talk to me.

335
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:01,462
Now.

336
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,064
I can't talk here.

337
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:07,833
I'm in the Roosevelt
Continental, room 1271.

338
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:10,102
You've got half an hour.

339
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:20,242
Agent Pierce,
please get a car ready.

340
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,977
I have to make a quick run.

341
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,416
All right, Jack, we're here.

342
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:31,917
Knowles says there's
been increased activity

343
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:33,351
in this area
for several days now.

344
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,986
I'm looking at about
a half a dozen buildings.

345
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,421
Could be any one of them.

346
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,521
Copy that, Tony.

347
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,123
Hold on, we're getting
infrared up now.

348
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,158
I'm counting seven buildings
in your immediate vicinity.

349
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:45,093
The building directly
southeast of your current

350
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:48,729
position is showing
no infrared signal.

351
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:50,797
I'm guessing they're using
a blackout shield.

352
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:52,098
All right,
we'll try there first.

353
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,000
You see any patrols
coming our way?

354
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:55,800
Negative, you're clear.

355
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:57,736
Okay, let's go.

356
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,015
Jack, Knowles'
key card isn't working.

357
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,083
We're gonna need
electronic support here.

358
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,784
There should be an
R-6 interface module

359
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,285
on the back of your comm device.

360
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,386
It's a card key.

361
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:23,088
Yeah, I know what
that is, thank you.

362
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,057
I'm plugging in now.

363
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,126
Okay, we're up.

364
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:32,561
Cormac Z series.

365
00:15:32,628 --> 00:15:34,395
We're looking
at a five digit key

366
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:37,131
protected by an AES
block cipher.

367
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,966
Running combinations.

368
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,468
Okay, Tony, you've got
a vehicle coming your way.

369
00:15:42,536 --> 00:15:44,703
It's east of you
about a hundred yards.

370
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:46,804
Take cover down there.

371
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,374
How much longer?

372
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:51,442
How much more time do you need?

373
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:54,043
I only have two
out of five digits.

374
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,278
We're pretty exposed here.

375
00:15:57,313 --> 00:15:58,980
Jack?

376
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,081
It's all right, I'm fine.

377
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:03,716
Come on.

378
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,127
<i>Two more numbers, Tony.</i>

379
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,830
What are we gonna do?

380
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,731
We still got two digits to go.

381
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,101
Move in for a closer look.

382
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:29,902
Sit tight.

383
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,270
Doug, where you-- Doug!

384
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:44,913
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

385
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:48,416
Hold your position.

386
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,484
May I see some ID?

387
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,752
Doug Knowles.

388
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,224
<i>One to go.</i>

389
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,627
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.

390
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:06,195
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base

391
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:08,029
cleared of all
nonessential personnel.

392
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:10,198
Nonessential personnel?

393
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,233
I'm chairman of the board.

394
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,767
I realize that,
but we're dealing

395
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,301
with a heightened
security situation here.

396
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,769
So, I need to know
what you were doing

397
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:17,970
in this area.

398
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,371
<i>Jonas called a late night</i>

399
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,072
board meeting,
that's what I'm doing here.

400
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,408
Sir, that meeting
ended nearly

401
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,644
<i>- two hours ago.
- We got it; we're in.</i>

402
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:30,212
I don't have to explain
myself to you, you know.

403
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,314
I'm sorry, sir,
but you do.

404
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:34,715
Sir, I don't believe
you're hearing me.

405
00:17:34,783 --> 00:17:37,584
No, I don't you're hearing me!

406
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:39,419
Look, I built this company!

407
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:41,354
And I don't need you
telling me

408
00:17:41,421 --> 00:17:43,488
where I can
and cannot walk!

409
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:45,157
Understood?!

410
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,923
<i>You're gonna have
to come with me, sir.</i>

411
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:48,626
Right this way.

412
00:17:52,996 --> 00:17:54,329
I'm in.

413
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:55,631
But they got Knowles.

414
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,065
Do you think he's
gonna say anything?

415
00:17:57,133 --> 00:17:58,232
I don't know.

416
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,867
But I better get in and out

417
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,734
as fast as possible
just in case he does.

418
00:18:01,802 --> 00:18:03,603
Okay, Tony, the president
needs a visual

419
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:05,037
on the weapons before
she'll launch an attack.

420
00:18:05,104 --> 00:18:06,238
She needs your eyes

421
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:08,006
on the canisters and a
confirmation by Jack.

422
00:18:08,074 --> 00:18:10,775
Copy that.

423
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:12,576
I'm moving.

424
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:13,644
Good.

425
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,011
Jack?

426
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,013
Stay here, I'll be right back.

427
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:24,084
Jack! Jack?!

428
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:25,952
We need a medic! Jack!

429
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,453
Jack?!

430
00:18:27,521 --> 00:18:29,355
Jack?

431
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:30,822
Get me the medic!

432
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,354
We just found
Mr. Knowles alone

433
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:48,323
just outside
the restricted zone.

434
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:50,158
Did he have an explanation?

435
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,259
Yes, sir,
he said he was walking.

436
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,595
Walking.

437
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:57,163
Should I take him to Stokes
for interrogation, sir?

438
00:18:57,231 --> 00:19:01,233
You're suggesting what, soldier,
that we strap him down,

439
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,267
extract a confession,
because he was walking?

440
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:05,437
He's the chairman of the board.

441
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:07,671
I was just requesting

442
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:09,005
instructions, sir.

443
00:19:09,073 --> 00:19:10,606
What you'd like done.

444
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:12,941
I'd like you to take him
to his office.

445
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:14,443
Make sure he's comfortable.

446
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,944
And stay with him
until I arrive.

447
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:18,412
Yes, sir.

448
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,846
Will that be all?

449
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:21,080
Call zone nine,

450
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:22,582
have them double down security.

451
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,484
Let's make sure that
Mr. Knowles was in fact alone.

452
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:26,552
Yes, sir.

453
00:19:39,227 --> 00:19:41,262
How much longer?

454
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,763
Half an hour.

455
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:45,197
Good.

456
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,967
I'll need to know
the minute it's done.

457
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,367
Yes, sir.

458
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,575
Aaron, I'd like you to wait
in the hall, if that's okay.

459
00:19:58,642 --> 00:20:02,177
Ms. Taylor, you tasked me
with handling your security.

460
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,345
I can't allow you
to enter a hotel room

461
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,412
I haven't vetted.

462
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:11,049
Aaron, I appreciate the concern.

463
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:14,151
But you can see
the door from here,

464
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,020
I have you on speed-dial,

465
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:19,055
and I can scream very loudly
when the occasion demands.

466
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:22,224
I just need two minutes
to wrangle a reporter.

467
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,526
Really, I'll be fine.

468
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:27,061
All right, I'll be here
if you need me.

469
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,343
Want a drink?
No.

470
00:20:49,745 --> 00:20:51,312
I assume you don't mind if I do.

471
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,614
It's been a day.

472
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:58,083
I gotta tell you.

473
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,685
I don't like being threatened.

474
00:20:59,753 --> 00:21:01,019
It was unfortunate.

475
00:21:01,086 --> 00:21:02,320
I apologize.

476
00:21:02,388 --> 00:21:04,555
We've known each other
a long time, Ken.

477
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:06,123
I thought we had
an understanding.

478
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,590
We do.

479
00:21:07,658 --> 00:21:10,059
And I want to keep it that way.

480
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:13,361
We both do.
Am I right?

481
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:18,999
Okay, so, I told you,
I have this source.

482
00:21:19,066 --> 00:21:21,501
Cop out at the Port
Authority container yard.

483
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,835
Okay.

484
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:25,369
He told me he saw these
professional assassin types

485
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:27,705
get into an intense firefight
out there a couple hours ago.

486
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:29,105
According to him,

487
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:31,775
someone hijacked a WMD
out to God knows where.

488
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:34,577
That's true.

489
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:36,044
Yeah.

490
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:37,612
Yeah, I want to know
all about it.

491
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,184
Look, if you think all you've
got to do is nod your head

492
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:47,519
confirming what I already know,
then we've got a problem.

493
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:49,888
It's national security, Ken.

494
00:21:49,956 --> 00:21:51,188
I can't tell you.

495
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,090
I'm saying you can.

496
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:56,259
If this story breaks,
it would create a panic.

497
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,527
People would be hurt.

498
00:21:58,595 --> 00:21:59,795
If you knew what it was,
you'd understand why

499
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:00,796
it's got to stay a secret.

500
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:03,464
Right, exactly.
I'd understand.

501
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,633
Have a little
faith, okay?

502
00:22:08,902 --> 00:22:12,604
All right. There is a bioweapon
in the container yard.

503
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,573
That's what
they were fighting over.

504
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,907
It was developed by Starkwood
in Africa.

505
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:19,042
Starkwood?
Right.

506
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,945
They moved it to their base
about 30 miles from here.

507
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:26,781
So it's there right now.

508
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:32,619
So this is what the Joint Chiefs
are discussing,

509
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:34,019
what to do about that.

510
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:37,421
Olivia...

511
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:47,529
The president ordered
an air strike

512
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:52,666
as soon as the exact location
of the canisters was known.

513
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,637
So you see why you can't run
with this?

514
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:01,506
Really, Ken,
you can't.

515
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:02,673
A lot of lives
are at stake.

516
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:05,175
The entire plan depends
on surprise.

517
00:23:05,243 --> 00:23:06,710
You get that, right?

518
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:15,149
Maybe you're right.

519
00:23:15,217 --> 00:23:17,317
Maybe I need to
kill this story.

520
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:20,653
Thank you.

521
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:25,490
What I mean is maybe somebody
could convince me.

522
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,827
What are you saying?

523
00:23:30,894 --> 00:23:33,129
You know what I'm saying.

524
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:34,162
You're very beautiful

525
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,296
when you get all
patriotic.

526
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:36,564
I ever tell
you that?

527
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,666
That's over. We agreed.

528
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:38,966
You agreed.

529
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:42,468
Really, I don't want to do this.

530
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:46,939
Ken...

531
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:49,741
Then say no.

532
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:09,822
Here, apply pressure.

533
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,823
You can give yourself
an injection

534
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:13,824
once every two hours.

535
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:14,959
More if needed.

536
00:24:15,027 --> 00:24:16,560
You think I'll need more?

537
00:24:16,628 --> 00:24:17,927
In all likelihood, yes.

538
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:21,229
The onset of symptoms so soon
after exposure suggests

539
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:23,265
the bio-agent is more virulent
than we thought.

540
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,168
All we're doing here
is just masking the symptoms.

541
00:24:27,235 --> 00:24:28,568
I understand.

542
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:30,503
There's something you may
want to consider, though.

543
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:32,404
What's that?

544
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,439
Bryden University
has been funding some studies

545
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,439
on prion diseases.

546
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:36,941
The work is purely
experimental

547
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,709
at this point,
but it does suggest treatment.

548
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,910
That's good news.

549
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,945
I don't want to get anyone's
hopes up here.

550
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,180
We're talking a slight chance.

551
00:24:44,247 --> 00:24:45,748
A possible treatment
using stem cells

552
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:47,049
from a genetically
compatible donor.

553
00:24:47,116 --> 00:24:48,750
An immediate family member

554
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:50,384
would make the best
donor candidate.

555
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:51,518
I saw your file.

556
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:53,486
It says you have
a daughter, right?

557
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:55,421
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

558
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,790
Jack, if there's
a chance.
Mr. Bauer...

559
00:24:57,857 --> 00:24:59,958
Doctor, thank you
for everything you've done.

560
00:25:00,026 --> 00:25:02,193
Excuse me.
I need to get back to work.

561
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:08,497
Jack...

562
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:10,365
This is none
of your business.

563
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:13,101
It's my business
when you're having
a seizure in the middle

564
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,768
of the FBI.
You heard the doctor.

565
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:16,136
The medication will
mask the symptoms.

566
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:17,637
Why won't you even
talk about this?

567
00:25:17,706 --> 00:25:19,672
Talk about what?
The experimental
procedure.

568
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,307
Because there's nothing
to talk about.

569
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:24,209
She's your daughter, and you're
not even gonna let her know?

570
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:25,176
That's right.

571
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:27,377
So you're just
not even gonna try?

572
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:29,012
Renee, I know you're trying
to help,

573
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,980
but you don't know
what you're talking about here.

574
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,649
My daughter and I,
we don't talk, okay?

575
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,184
So, please,
just let it go.

576
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,654
It should be her choice.

577
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:43,856
Well, it's not.

578
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:47,658
I'm the one who's dying.
It's my choice.

579
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:55,564
No sign of the target yet,
but Tony's working on it.

580
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:57,166
You look better.

581
00:25:57,234 --> 00:25:58,800
Thanks.

582
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:01,668
Tony, can you hear me?

583
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:03,070
Jack, you okay?

584
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:04,604
Yeah, I'm fine.

585
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,941
Okay, Tony, we're seeing new
activity outside the building.

586
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,507
Two vehicles,
eight hostiles.

587
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:11,143
Looks like
a security detail.

588
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:12,643
You think Knowles
gave him up?

589
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:14,678
Tony, they're moving straight
for your point of entry.

590
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,450
<i>Eight hostiles and closing.</i>

591
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:22,550
Yeah, I hear them.

592
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:23,651
You want to regroup?

593
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:26,586
No, I want
to get this over with.

594
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,563
Right there.

595
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:48,602
Two three, we're clear.

596
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:13,080
I haven't seen you here before.

597
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:16,149
They just sent
eight of us over here, sir.

598
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,815
Why, is something wrong?

599
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:21,318
No, sir.
Just, you know, precautions.

600
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:23,754
Right, right.
Can't be paranoid enough.

601
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,062
I'm in the main building.

602
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,595
Copy, we're with you.

603
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:39,965
Tony, it's Jack.
I've got you at 125 feet MSL,

604
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:41,967
approximately 40 feet
underground. Is that correct?

605
00:28:42,035 --> 00:28:43,968
That's right.
I'm four floors down.

606
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:47,671
We've got no information
on any kind of subterranean
floors for that building.

607
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:49,106
Believe me, they're here.

608
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:52,775
Epoxy-hardened walls,
poured concrete ceilings.

609
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,685
I have a visual on the weapon.

610
00:29:07,752 --> 00:29:10,388
Sending images
for verification now.

611
00:29:11,822 --> 00:29:13,690
Copy that.

612
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,333
Okay, those are
the canisters.

613
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:30,235
I'll notify Admiral Smith the
target is located and confirmed.

614
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:31,836
Tony, those are the canisters.

615
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,506
Jack, it looks like
they're transferring

616
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,841
the pathogens
from the canisters

617
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,209
into some sort of
delivery system.

618
00:29:40,276 --> 00:29:41,543
It's on the move.

619
00:29:41,611 --> 00:29:42,911
Copy that.
It doesn't matter.

620
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:44,278
Renee's phoning
in the coordinates.

621
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:46,046
Everything's gonna be dust
in the next ten minutes.

622
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,880
Get out of there now.
Copy that.

623
00:29:47,948 --> 00:29:49,616
Withdrawing.

624
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:02,658
Okay, men.

625
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:13,533
You want to explain this, Jonas?

626
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,668
I'm arrested by our
own security force.

627
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:17,669
Held captive

628
00:30:17,737 --> 00:30:19,303
in my own office
like a prisoner.

629
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:22,506
They won't allow me
a phone call, even to you,

630
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,941
to find out what
the hell is going on!

631
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:28,511
Well, that's a lot
of complaints, Doug.

632
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,077
You done?

633
00:30:30,146 --> 00:30:33,047
You were supposed
to be home hours ago.

634
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:35,215
Why'd they find you
snooping around?

635
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:37,883
I saw the FBI raid.

636
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:39,685
They say we have bioweapons.

637
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:44,755
Which they did not find.

638
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:46,490
That's not the point.

639
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,358
Is it true?

640
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:53,061
Remember when I first brought
you out here 20 years ago?

641
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:54,396
There was nothing here.

642
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,330
Nothing.

643
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,231
And out of the damn mud,

644
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,933
we built this place,

645
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:04,069
the largest private army in the
hemisphere, maybe the world,

646
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:07,805
and we pulled America's ass
out of the fire

647
00:31:07,873 --> 00:31:10,240
again and again and again.

648
00:31:10,308 --> 00:31:12,008
Answer the question!

649
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:15,645
I am.

650
00:31:17,012 --> 00:31:18,880
Every day, we've done things

651
00:31:18,947 --> 00:31:21,448
that the government itself
could not or would not do.

652
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:23,116
"Get this done,"

653
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:25,117
that's what they said,
"Here's your mission."

654
00:31:25,186 --> 00:31:26,719
Nobody asked how anything
was gonna be done.

655
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:29,321
Nobody wanted to know.

656
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,591
All anyone wanted was results,
and we delivered.

657
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,425
No one's questioning that.

658
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,294
No one's questioning that?

659
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:39,195
You're not insane, are you?

660
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:42,463
The senate, the committees,
the president.

661
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:45,365
Every chattering nonentity
in Washington

662
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:47,701
is out there with their standard
operating procedures

663
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:49,868
saying,
"How was this done?

664
00:31:49,936 --> 00:31:51,304
How was that done?"

665
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:55,273
Tearing at us, trying to bring
us down, every one of them.

666
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:59,542
I kept this country strong.
I kept it safe.

667
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,044
And I will not be persecuted
for that.

668
00:32:03,112 --> 00:32:07,348
Jonas, you cannot start
a war against the people

669
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:08,949
you're supposed to protect.

670
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:12,018
We were at war, Doug,

671
00:32:12,086 --> 00:32:14,587
the moment they decided
to dismantle us.

672
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:17,322
And as for particular
weapons,

673
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:19,957
as for your question,
let me rephrase it.

674
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,892
Are we prepared
to defend ourselves?

675
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,461
We are.

676
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:30,599
Jonas...

677
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,999
you can't take on
the federal government.

678
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:38,570
Yeah, well, you never were
one for thinking big.

679
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:41,473
20 years

680
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,574
I treated you like a son.

681
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:45,409
20 years.

682
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:49,545
A little loyalty...

683
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:52,681
wasn't that
the least I deserved?

684
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:43,717
Yes.

685
00:33:43,785 --> 00:33:47,353
Sir, we just got an alert from
one of our radar intercepts.

686
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:49,689
There's a squadron of F-18's

687
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:53,124
heading our way
out of Virginia Beach.

688
00:33:53,192 --> 00:33:54,325
Sir?

689
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:55,660
What's the ETA?

690
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:57,194
Less than ten minutes.

691
00:33:57,262 --> 00:33:59,529
What's our readiness?
How many?

692
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:02,898
We have three loaded.

693
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:04,865
Place the call
to the president.

694
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:08,168
I'll be there momentarily.

695
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,980
You probably think I'm the scum
of the earth right now.

696
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,251
All I care about is that you
don't run the Starkwood story.

697
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:33,485
You're a real sport.

698
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,755
Taking one for the team
like this.

699
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,393
Look at me.

700
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:49,698
You won't run it, right?

701
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:54,401
I'm sorry, Livy.

702
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,302
What?

703
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:01,273
Breaking something
this big

704
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,608
will put me over
the top in New York.

705
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:07,177
I'll make sure nobody knows
any of it came from you.

706
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:10,179
You lying son of a bitch.

707
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:12,513
Come on, please.

708
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:13,949
I'm did what I needed to do
to get ahead--

709
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:15,684
just like you.

710
00:35:15,751 --> 00:35:18,185
There's no comparison.

711
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:19,986
Running that story
will harm the country.

712
00:35:20,054 --> 00:35:22,989
I've been in Washington
a lot longer than you.

713
00:35:23,057 --> 00:35:25,691
You'll see, this is how
the way the game is played.

714
00:35:25,758 --> 00:35:28,926
Actually, Ken, this is how
the game is played.

715
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:32,996
What do you mean?

716
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:52,476
You run that story, or ever
try to blackmail me again,

717
00:35:52,543 --> 00:35:54,211
and I'll make sure
everyone knows

718
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,345
just how you get your leads.

719
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:57,580
I think your wife

720
00:35:57,648 --> 00:35:59,681
will be especially
interested.

721
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:02,017
From everything
you've told me,

722
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:03,884
that's gonna be
one nasty divorce.

723
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:06,252
You bitch.

724
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,055
Find a new beat, Ken.

725
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,189
I don't want to see you around
the White House again.

726
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:17,594
Sorry, I've got to take this.

727
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,202
Hi.

728
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,904
Where in the world are you?

729
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,739
I'm sorry. I had a
meeting on K Street.

730
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:34,507
I had to run interference
with a reporter.

731
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,241
Are the press on to this?

732
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:37,809
Not anymore.
I took care of it.

733
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:39,176
I need you here, Livy.

734
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:40,511
We've had confirmation
on the bioweapons,

735
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:42,712
and the air strike
is happening now.

736
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,114
I'll be there in five minutes.

737
00:36:55,823 --> 00:36:57,289
Where are we, Admiral?

738
00:36:57,357 --> 00:37:00,224
The F-18's have been loaded
with bunker-buster ordinance

739
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,361
and will be in range
in seven minutes.

740
00:37:03,428 --> 00:37:05,595
What's the risk
of the pathogen spreading

741
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,764
to the surrounding areas?

742
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:08,197
Minimal.

743
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:09,666
We're using white phosphorous
charges,

744
00:37:09,733 --> 00:37:10,932
which burn at 5,000 degrees.

745
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,301
More than enough
to incinerate the pathogen.

746
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:14,969
And that's been confirmed
by the CDC.

747
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:16,603
It has.

748
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,476
Weapons are ready?

749
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:26,778
Yes, sir.

750
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,914
The call to the president?

751
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,082
The call is in process.

752
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:37,118
It's an historic day,
gentlemen.

753
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:39,287
A great day for Starkwood.

754
00:37:44,091 --> 00:37:47,092
Too bad Mr. Knowles
can't be joining us.

755
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:01,335
<i>I have an ETAC
with eyes on. Airborne.</i>

756
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:02,804
<i>Roger,
I need 9,000 feet</i>

757
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:05,271
MSL and weapons control
status, over.

758
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,440
<i>Weapons control status:</i>

759
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:08,574
yellow tight.

760
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:10,076
<i>Fighters entering the IP.</i>

761
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:11,776
Engage airspace
coordination area.

762
00:38:11,844 --> 00:38:14,045
<i>Roger that.
Stand by.</i>

763
00:38:14,113 --> 00:38:16,346
Madam President, command
and control is reporting

764
00:38:16,414 --> 00:38:18,415
that a phased array radar system

765
00:38:18,482 --> 00:38:20,149
is active inside
the Starkwood compound.

766
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,617
Meaning what exactly?

767
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,319
They know we're coming.

768
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:28,522
Is there any evidence of an
antiaircraft artillery threat?

769
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,225
Intelligence is indicating no
such capability on the ground.

770
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:35,761
Madam President,
there's a phone call for you.

771
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:37,561
It's Jonas Hodges.

772
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,133
Put him on speaker.

773
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:45,667
Ma'am, he's requested

774
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:46,869
a private conversation.

775
00:38:46,937 --> 00:38:48,169
He says he's established
a proprietary line

776
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:50,471
in the Ops Room.

777
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,606
A proprietary line?

778
00:38:52,673 --> 00:38:54,174
How did he manage that?

779
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:56,308
I have no idea.

780
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:24,495
Hello.

781
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:27,231
Madam President,
let me begin by saying

782
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,699
that I am truly sorry
it's come to this.

783
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:34,069
at you turn your planes
around immediately.

784
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:38,072
You're in no position to
issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges.

785
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,875
Well, maybe I am.

786
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:43,943
You remember several years ago,
Madam President,

787
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:46,578
Starkwood was deployed
to Pakistan.

788
00:39:46,646 --> 00:39:48,646
Oh, I remember it
very well.

789
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:50,081
I fought that deployment.

790
00:39:50,149 --> 00:39:51,582
And you lost.

791
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,883
You'll also recall

792
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,851
that we requisitioned a missile
system at that time--

793
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:57,386
Python Fives.

794
00:39:57,453 --> 00:39:58,921
Well, three of those missiles

795
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:00,354
are now loaded
with the pathogen

796
00:40:00,422 --> 00:40:03,456
and aimed at cities
on our eastern seaboard.

797
00:40:07,327 --> 00:40:08,828
You're bluffing.

798
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:12,430
As a sign of good faith,

799
00:40:12,498 --> 00:40:16,733
I'm willing to show you that
I'm... that I'm not bluffing.

800
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:22,237
You see that?

801
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:24,538
Madam President?

802
00:40:24,606 --> 00:40:26,240
Hmm?

803
00:40:31,978 --> 00:40:33,779
You call this good faith?

804
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:37,048
You are waging war
on your own country, Jonas.

805
00:40:37,116 --> 00:40:39,616
Well, of course,
I wouldn't see it that way.

806
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:43,219
What do you want?

807
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:46,121
Well, we can have
that conversation

808
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:48,323
a little later on
at the White House.

809
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,826
You think we're going to just
sit down and discuss this?

810
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:54,194
Yes I do,
in the Oval Office,

811
00:40:54,261 --> 00:40:55,561
in confidence,

812
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:56,862
within the hour.

813
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,131
But in the meantime,
I think it is

814
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,299
to both of our advantage

815
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:03,499
that the American
people do not know

816
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,802
the exact circumstance
of this standoff.

817
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,503
So you will keep this
conversation to yourself,

818
00:41:08,571 --> 00:41:10,372
and turn the planes around.

819
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,241
And if you don't comply,
Madam President,

820
00:41:13,309 --> 00:41:17,577
I will have no choice
but to launch those missiles.

821
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:21,047
Mr. Hodges...

822
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:24,115
And remember, I can detect
any action you take

823
00:41:24,183 --> 00:41:25,582
against our facility.

824
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,952
You have 30 seconds.

825
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,553
Mr. Hodges...

826
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,387
Mr. Hodges!

827
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:02,642
Abort the air strike,
Admiral Smith.

828
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,844
Madam President...

829
00:42:04,912 --> 00:42:06,279
Just do as I say.

830
00:42:11,649 --> 00:42:12,850
Ma'am, with all respect...

831
00:42:12,918 --> 00:42:15,886
Damn it, Admiral, abort
the air strike immediately!

832
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:18,255
This is Admiral Smith.

833
00:42:18,322 --> 00:42:20,022
I have an abort order
from the president.

834
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,490
Take fighters off target.

835
00:42:21,557 --> 00:42:22,857
Repeat: take fighters

836
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:24,058
off target.

837
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:25,626
Stand by for
confirmation code.

838
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,567
We're standing down,
Madam President.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
