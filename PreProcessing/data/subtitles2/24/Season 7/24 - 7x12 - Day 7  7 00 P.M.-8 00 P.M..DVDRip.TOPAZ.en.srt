I asked you a question, Mr. Buchanan.

You think I made

This is Agent Walker.

509
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,733
I've been briefed
on the general situation.

510
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,496
What are the latest facts on the ground?

511
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,503
<i>There's nothing further
from GeneralJuma...</i>

512
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,801
<i>but an infrared scan of the building
shows he's holding the hostages...</i>

513
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,240
in a hallway outside the Roosevelt Room.

514
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:09,473
<i>- This is very possibly good news for the president.
- Explain.</i>

515
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,243
The area's not one of the more
defensible places in the building.

516
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:15,285
Tactically, it makes no sense forJuma
to have chosen it as a base.

517
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,811
<i>However, the area is adjacent
to the ground floor lockdown...</i>

518
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,085
which we know the president
was en route to.

519
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,424
So you think the president
made it into the lockdown?

520
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,486
That's our best explanation
for him being there.

521
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,589
<i>We're therefore asking you
to authorize the rescue operation...</i>

522
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,499
beforeJuma manages
to penetrate the lockdown.

523
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,768
<i>Do you have any other evidence...</i>

524
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:42,870
that supports your theory
that the president is in the lockdown?

525
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,006
<i>There's the fact that he couldn't
produce the president...</i>

526
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,142
when we asked him to prove
that he had her.

527
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,312
Couldn't or wouldn't?
You can't be certain which one it is, can you?

528
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,448
<i>Certainty is not possible in this case, sir.
We're giving you our best estimation...</i>

and we urge you to allow us to launch.

530
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,028
What if you're wrong?
What ifJuma does have the president?

531
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,999
He will kill her as soon as he realizes
what you're doing.

532
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,467
Inaction has its own risks too, sir.

533
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,697
<i>The more timeJuma has
to reinforce his position...</i>

534
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,468
the more difficult it'll be
to take the building and to save lives.

<i>I understand...</i>

the president's life.

<i>Prudence dictates that I hold off
on authorizing the rescue operation...</i>

<i>Mr. Vice President, terrorists

you are instructed to refrain

<i>You can't order an operation

There's a security kit behind that door

you're asking me to do?

604
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,690
Ju stand by and watch her butchered?

605
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,550
No, ma'am. But I am not the
president of the united states.

606
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,900
Well, i am the president.

607
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,690
And I am ordering you to open that door.

608
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,430
You're running out of time.

609
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,880
mom...

610
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,370
perhaps this will make your
mother decide more quickly.

611
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,970
mom, you shouldn't have...

612
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,340
I wouldn't let them hurt you, darling.

613
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,090
Damn it, bauer. What have you done?

614
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,510
all right, general, you've got me now.

615
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,940
There's no reason to hold anyone else.

616
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,430
Let them go.

617
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,910
You... don't give orders to me.

618
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,470
Get the camera ready for her statement.

619
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,120
What statement?

620
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,840
The last one you'll ever give.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
