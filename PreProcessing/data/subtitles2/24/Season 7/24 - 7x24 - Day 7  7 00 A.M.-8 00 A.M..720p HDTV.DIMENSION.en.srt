He's the one who ordered

a plan to bring them down.

Maybe-which means
he has absolutely no reason...

it always starts off with a small step.

as you can in the wrong direction...

you started in the fiirst place.

by much smarter men than me.

have to be more important
than the 15 people on the bus.

try to make choices that you can live with.

299
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:20,413

Oh, Livy.

Don't tell me you were the one
who leaked the information.

Hodges killed my brother...

317

and then you agreed
to put him into witness protection.

00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:35,510

getting away was too much for me.

480
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,652
Let the courts take it from here.

481
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:28,022
Stop this now, before it's too late.

482
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:33,224
Don't throw away your career.
This is absolutely insane.

483
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,868
Larry would not have wanted this.

484
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,807
Don't dishonor his death like this.

485
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,653
[Door Opens]

486
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,504
[Door Closes]

487
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,566
Daddy.

488
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:32,612
I'm too late.

489
00:41:33,232 --> 00:41:34,695
No, he's still
alive, Kim.

490
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:36,081
We induced a
coma to help

491
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,378
ease him through the
harsher symptoms.

492
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:42,161
My name is Gohar.

493
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:44,648
I'm a friend.

494
00:41:47,023 --> 00:41:47,542
A friend?

495
00:41:50,287 --> 00:41:51,542
We spent the last
few minutes talking

496
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:54,622
and I can tell you he's
accepted what is happening.

497
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:58,141
Maybe he has.

498
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:01,749
But I haven't.

499
00:42:03,317 --> 00:42:04,736
The stem cell treatment
that you told me about.

500
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:06,128
Can we still do it?

501
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,233
As I told you,
it's experimental

502
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:09,955
and the odds of
success are very low.

503
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:11,464
Just tell me
if it's too late to try.

504
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:13,600
No.

505
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:15,088
Then I want to do it.

506
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:18,101
- The risks--
- I understand the risks.

507
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:20,180
and I know my father didn't
want me to take that chance,

508
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:22,002
but it's my choice now

509
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,182
and I made up my mind.

510
00:42:33,075 --> 00:42:33,893
This is Sunny Macer.

511
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,044
I need immediate access
to a surgical suite.

512
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:37,720
Have Dr. Rosen
call me right away.

513
00:43:12,535 --> 00:43:13,295
I'm sorry, Daddy.

514
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,235
But I'm not ready
to let you go.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
