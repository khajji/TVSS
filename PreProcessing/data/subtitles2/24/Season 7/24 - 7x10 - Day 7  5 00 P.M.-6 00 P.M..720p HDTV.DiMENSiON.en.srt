1
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:15,973
(gasping)

2
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,308
Madam President,
we have your husband,

3
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,577
but he sustained
a gunshot wound to the chest.

4
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,212
<i>TAYLOR:
Is my husband going to be okay?</i>

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,115
We're not going to know anything
until the doctors see him.

6
00:00:24,183 --> 00:00:26,217
Since your husband was the only
leverage that Dubaku had left,

7
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:28,486
it's safe to say that he's
trying to leave the country now.

8
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:29,587
Whatever we're going
to do to find him,

9
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,721
we're going to have
to do it fast.

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:31,956
Whatever it takes,

11
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:34,125
I want that
son of a bitch found!

12
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:36,361
Have someone
find my daughter, Olivia,

13
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:37,928
and bring her to me.

14
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,497
What is it
that's so important

15
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,566
for my mother to steal
me away while I'm trying

16
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:43,334
to do business?
It's your father.

17
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:44,402
He's been shot.

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,404
My, God, I...

19
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:48,673
Do you think I'm a fool,
Mr. Burnett?

20
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:50,908
<i>If anything should happen to me</i>

21
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:52,510
on my way out
of the country,

22
00:00:52,578 --> 00:00:54,412
a data file with all the names
and bank transactions

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,415
of all those involved will be
sent to the Justice Department.

24
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,465
You told me that once
Dubaku served his purpose,

25
00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:01,721
you'd take him out.

26
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:03,020
Why are we still helping him?

27
00:01:03,088 --> 00:01:05,256
He's threatening to expose us
using a database he's kept

28
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:07,024
with names and accounts
of everyone involved.

29
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,626
Including mine?

30
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,860
We don't know
where the file is,

31
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:11,596
so you just better pray
that he gets away.

32
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:13,064
I'm begging you,
Marika...

33
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,599
FBI! Don't move!

34
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:15,766
Get on your knees!
Now!

35
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,001
Where is Dubaku?

36
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:18,336
Who?

37
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:20,238
<i>RENEE:
Don't play games with me!
Ike Dubaku!</i>

38
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:21,606
JACK:
You know this man?

39
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:23,408
She was going to meet him.

40
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:25,042
When the car arrives,
we would like you

41
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,977
to go with the driver,
so that we could follow you

42
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,413
back to Dubaku.

43
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,081
You want her to go to him
and face him?

44
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:32,550
It's the   only chance we have
of finding him before he

45
00:01:32,618 --> 00:01:34,118
disappears forever.
I'll do it.

46
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,187
You keep her safe,
you hear me?

47
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:37,422
We will.

48
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,424
You're less than a mile
behind the target car.

49
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,292
I got Metro PDs trying to build
a roadblock around us.

50
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,761
(siren wailing, tires screech)

51
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>RENEE:
We can't afford
to lose them, Jack!</i>

52
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,766
I gave this woman my word
we'd protect her.

53
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,935
(tires screeching)
Get out of the
car, right now!

54
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,103
(cops clamoring)

55
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,671
Federal agent!
On the ground!

56
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,406
She's a federal agent!
On the ground!

57
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:57,408
(panting)

58
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:59,210
BURNETT:
Your girlfriend's
been turned by the FBI.

59
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:00,411
If you let her come to you,

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,012
you're risking
your chances of escape.

61
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,215
I'll call my driver,
have him take care of her.

62
00:02:04,283 --> 00:02:06,884
No. I'll take care of her.

63
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:28,906
Sean,

64
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,808
I need to talk to you.
Is it important?

65
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:32,710
You tell me.
Did you issue

66
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,679
a federal warrant
on this vehicle?
What?

67
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:35,813
I found a digital footprint

68
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,248
on server four's backup
partition.

69
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:39,250
It originated from your station.
I'd like to know

70
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:41,319
what the hell is going on!
Keep your voice down.

71
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,187
You want to get us caught?

72
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:44,555
I sent out the warrant,

73
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,491
to sideline Bauer and Renee.

74
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:48,359
They were
closing in on Dubaku.

75
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:50,828
I thought you said
Dubaku's on his way
out of the country?

76
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:53,264
He is, but his girlfriend's
talking to FBI.

77
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:55,166
They used her
to track him.

78
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,401
Oh, my God.

79
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,169
Don't worry, I
took care of it.

80
00:02:58,236 --> 00:02:59,737
Bauer and Renee are
in police custody.

81
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,071
By the time
they're released,

82
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,273
Dubaku will be long gone.

83
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,408
Are you sure?

84
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,576
I'm positive.

85
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,278
Why didn't you just tell me
what was happening?

86
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,249
'Cause I knew
you'd react like this.

87
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,319
The last thing I need right now
is one of your meltdowns.

88
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:17,021
Now, listen,
I got you into this,

89
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:18,523
and I'm going to get
you out of it,

90
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,591
but not if you start panicking.

91
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,892
You've got
to keep it together.

92
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,227
I'm just really scared,
you know?

93
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,029
I know. I am, too.

94
00:03:25,096 --> 00:03:27,164
I'm just a little better
at hiding it than you are.

95
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:28,566
I've got everything covered.

96
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,401
I ran a bounce-tap
into the conference room

97
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,236
speakerphone that
they'll never find,

98
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:33,904
and I can hear
everything they're saying.

99
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,373
Now, sit at your station.

100
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,508
Try and act normal.

101
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:41,713
Let me worry about
Bauer and Renee.

102
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,781
Okay?

103
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,355
The man that we were tracking
is responsible

104
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:51,789
for today's terrorist attack.

105
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,725
If you don't let us go,
he's going to get away.

106
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:55,960
Look, my Captain's on the phone
with your superior.

107
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,127
You're making a mistake!

108
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,696
You've got to let us go!

109
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,435
That warrant had
to be sent out by one
of Dubaku's operatives.

110
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:07,171
I know.
Then Dubaku knows that
Marika is working with us.

111
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,439
He will kill her, Jack.

112
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:09,907
We should not have
used her like this.

113
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,442
We didn't have a choice.
She was our best asset.

114
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,811
She's not an asset, Jack.
She's a human being.

115
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:29,560
Colonel.

116
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:35,767
The FBI is still
looking for us, sir.

117
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,835
I'll do this quickly.
Wait there for me.

118
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,941
Samuel.

119
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,611
What? What is it?

120
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:47,712
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

121
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,746
Give me your cell phone.

122
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,214
My cell phone?

123
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,682
I know you've been
talking to the FBI.

124
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,619
You've been working
for them, Marika.

125
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:57,388
I don't know
what you're talking about.

126
00:04:58,557 --> 00:04:59,891
What are you doing?

127
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:01,959
What? What are
you doing?

128
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:05,496
(cell phone smashes)

129
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,469
No!

130
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,737
(grunts)

131
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:13,938
I trusted you!

132
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:15,406
How could you do this to me?!

133
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:18,843
The FBI told me
who you really are.

134
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,846
About the terrible
things you've done.

135
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,481
And you believed them?
They showed me proof!

136
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:26,684
They showed you lies
created by my enemies!

137
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:28,352
You don't know me.

138
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,120
And you don't
know my country.

139
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,356
I brought peace to Sangala.

140
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:35,693
(crying softly)

141
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:38,362
No. Shh, shh!

142
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,030
Don't be afraid, huh?

143
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:41,799
It's just...

144
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:43,434
when I heard what
you had done,

145
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:44,702
it was like you had

146
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,905
driven a dagger
through my heart.

147
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,209
I'm a forgiving man, Marika.

148
00:05:52,277 --> 00:05:54,278
I still want
you to come with me.

149
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:56,981
I want to give you
the life that I promised.

150
00:05:57,048 --> 00:06:00,451
I can't go with you.

151
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,220
I don't know who you are.

152
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,389
You do.

153
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:07,758
You do. If you look
past your fear,

154
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,094
you'll see that
I am still the man that you

155
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,829
fell in love with.

156
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,734
I won't leave
without you, Marika.

157
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:28,579
All right.

158
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,359
You won't be disappointed.

159
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:43,728
Come.

160
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:47,002
The FBI may be close.

161
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,336
Your story
was verified by FBI.

162
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:53,704
I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

163
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,339
Did FBI find
Marika Donoso?

164
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:57,474
I don't know.
You can ask them yourself.

165
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,243
Agent Moss wants
to talk to you.

166
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,945
Larry, where are they?
Where's Marika?

167
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:02,947
We lost her cell phone signal.
What do you mean?

168
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,248
What happened?
Don't know.

169
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:05,683
Just went dead
about three minutes ago.

170
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,784
Where?
CHLOE:
In an alley

171
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:08,152
on the Northeast corner
of N and 10th Street.

172
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,454
I'm looking through
traffic cams now.

173
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:12,489
All right, we're going
to comm. Standby.

174
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,694
They lost Marika's signal.

175
00:07:24,202 --> 00:07:25,736
That's it.
There. Jack?

176
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:27,972
We got a make on the car.
It's a dark gray

177
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,774
Jeep Grand Cherokee,
turned south on 11th Street

178
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,241
about two minutes ago.
Copy that.

179
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,343
Moving to intercept.
Did you see Marika?

180
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,680
Yes. She got in the car
with Dubaku.

181
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,082
Chloe, stay on those
traffic cams.
I'm on it.

182
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,086
We're ten minutes
from the airfield.

183
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:43,187
Is my plane ready?

184
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,022
Fueled and waiting.

185
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,824
Did you take care
of the problem?

186
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:48,092
She's had a change of heart.

187
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,359
She's coming with me.

188
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,064
Colonel, she was working
with the FBI.

189
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,531
You were almost arrested
because of her.

190
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,000
She's not your concern.

191
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:59,136
You just worry about
getting me out of the country.

192
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,340
Who was that?

193
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,377
It was a government official.

194
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,313
He's been
working for me.

195
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,381
A very corrupt man.

196
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,051
I look forward to no longer
dealing with people like him.

197
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:20,992
I want to spend time
with people I really care about.

198
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,970
CHLOE:
They're still on 11th.

199
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,404
They just crossed over
to New York Avenue.

200
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,507
Copy that.

201
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:37,875
Come on!

202
00:08:37,943 --> 00:08:39,810
Jack, they're
turning left.
Hold on.

203
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,883
(tires screeching)

204
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,601
Colonel!

205
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,470
FBI. Go! Go!

206
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:10,174
Hold on!

207
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:41,939
Ah!

208
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,977
Get on top of the car! See if
you can maintain a visual.

209
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,783
Ow!
Marika!

210
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,585
(grunting)
Marika!

211
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:01,992
Jack, they crashed!

212
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,461
Go!

213
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:09,233
Get back in your car!

214
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,535
JACK:
Larry, Dubaku's vehicle's
been involved in an accident.

215
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:12,970
We need an
ambulance, now!

216
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:14,238
Copy.

217
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,040
Back away!

218
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:23,480
Stay on your knees!

219
00:10:23,548 --> 00:10:25,082
Get on the ground, now!

220
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:27,918
Now!
(gunshots)

221
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,592
I got Dubaku.

222
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,296
(grunting)

223
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,178
Agent Walker,
the car is on fire.

224
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:55,279
Get out of there!

225
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:59,516
Get out of there!

226
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,591
I gave her my word, so back off

227
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:09,660
or help me.

228
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,206
RENEE:
It's her leg-- it's pinned.

229
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:26,346
Hold on.

230
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:28,615
(grunting)

231
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:31,251
Pull... pull!

232
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,326
Jack.

233
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,961
Go!

234
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,899
You all right?

235
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,241
RENEE:
Come on.

236
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:56,376
Larry, where is my ambulance?

237
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:57,611
Dubaku's badly injured.

238
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,312
He's unconscious.

239
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,313
I need that ambulance now.

240
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:02,382
They're on their way, Jack.

241
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:11,958
(breathing heavily)

242
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:36,335
ETHAN:
Admiral Smith estimates

243
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,937
we'll have the capitol of
Sangala secured within the hour.

244
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:40,572
He's surprised
how little resistance

245
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,974
our troops
have encountered.

246
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,410
And you'll be happy to know
we have liberated

247
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:47,879
the refugee camp
in Kasanga Province.

248
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:51,550
2,000 civilians are safe
from Juma's forces.

249
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,420
Madam President?

250
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:58,757
I'm sorry, Ethan.

251
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,692
Oh, my God, Kasanga Province.

252
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,161
That's... That's very good news.

253
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:06,565
Uh, maybe we should

254
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:08,834
finish this
another time.

255
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:10,935
Can I get you anything,

256
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:12,103
Madam President?

257
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:14,305
No, thank you.

258
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:16,641
Would you like to talk about it?

259
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:23,715
What happened to Henry
was my fault, Ethan.

260
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,387
He never believed
our son committed suicide.

261
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:30,889
He was right.

262
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:32,891
And I didn't listen to him.

263
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,359
And if I had, we wouldn't

264
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:35,560
be here
right now.

265
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,696
Henry wouldn't be
fighting for his life,

266
00:13:37,764 --> 00:13:40,799
and we might have exposed
this conspiracy.

267
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,202
Our government
wouldn't be paralyzed.

268
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,637
I didn't believe Henry, either.

269
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:46,805
No one did.

270
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:50,041
But I'm his wife.

271
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:52,911
He deserved my trust.

272
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:57,883
BUCHANAN:
Madam President?

273
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,083
I'm sorry to interrupt.

274
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,084
It's all
right, Bill.

275
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:01,119
Go ahead.

276
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,422
I just spoke
to Larry Moss at FBI.

277
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:04,790
We captured Dubaku.

278
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,792
He was seriously injured
in a car crash

279
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,760
during the
pursuit.
How bad?

280
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:09,928
Critical, nonresponsive.

281
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,663
Jack Bauer and Agent Walker
are with him.

282
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:13,264
They'll be there
to question him

283
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:14,966
should he regain
consciousness.

284
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:17,502
So, you're saying
that if Dubaku dies, our chances

285
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,003
of uncovering this
conspiracy die with him.

286
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:20,806
He could be the only one
who knows

287
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:22,240
the names of everyone
in the government

288
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:23,642
he's corrupted-- yes.

289
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:24,743
Madam President,

290
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:26,210
given this latest news,
I don't think

291
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:27,746
it's safe
for you to remain here.

292
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:29,448
I strongly urge you
to return

293
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:31,750
to the White House.
I'd prefer to stay
with my husband.

294
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:33,084
You're too exposed.

295
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:34,319
I can't effectively
protect you.

296
00:14:34,386 --> 00:14:36,287
Am I any safer
at the White House?

297
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:37,656
My administration

298
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,991
has been
corrupted, Bill,

299
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:42,594
and now you're telling me we're
about to lose our only lead.

300
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:44,429
Madam President,
I assure you I've taken

301
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:46,498
every precaution
to secure the White House.

302
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,900
It's the safest place
for you to be right now.

303
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:51,770
Henry will be in surgery
for several hours,

304
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:52,838
Madam President.

305
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:56,140
There's nothing more
we can do here.

306
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,442
You are needed

307
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,511
in the Oval Office.

308
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,953
All right.

309
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,988
I'll have the cars
brought around.

310
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:11,690
I'll also redirect
your daughter's escorts

311
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,425
to the
White House.
Thank you, Bill.

312
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:21,199
What are we going to do, Ethan?

313
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:23,702
How can we possibly
run this government

314
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,504
when we don't know
who we can trust?

315
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:27,038
We'll just have
to pray Jack Bauer

316
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,340
can get those names
from Dubaku.

317
00:15:35,765 --> 00:15:37,281
You got him stabilized?
Yes, sir.

318
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:38,483
We're transporting
him right now.
Bring him around.

319
00:15:38,551 --> 00:15:40,251
I need to talk to him.
Sir, he's in
no condition

320
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,220
to speak
right now.
This man has information vital

321
00:15:42,287 --> 00:15:43,688
to national security--
bring him around now.

322
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:44,823
Now!

323
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:47,392
One milligram epinephrine.

324
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,735
I know you can hear me.
You're in federal custody.

325
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,670
These paramedics are trying
to save your life.

326
00:15:58,738 --> 00:15:59,938
You want them to continue,
you're gonna

327
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,907
tell me what I want to know.
I want the names

328
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,675
of everyone in the United States
government that you've

329
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:04,676
been working with.

330
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:05,677
Come on.

331
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,278
You and I
both know the game.

332
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:08,413
It's over
for you now.

333
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,481
There's no sense in trying
to protect them.

334
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:14,352
You and I, we're both soldiers.

335
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,387
I know you don't care
about your own life,

336
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:18,222
but you got a family.

337
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,058
I know where your son is
in Sangala.

338
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,126
I know where he lives,
and I swear to you,

339
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:24,429
I will track him down,
and I will make him suffer,

340
00:16:24,496 --> 00:16:26,064
and I will make sure
that he knows

341
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:27,933
his father
was responsible.

342
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,536
All you got to do to make me
stop is give me the names.

343
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:33,404
Just give me
the names.

344
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:36,340
Don't hurt my family.

345
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:39,744
I have a list... list.

346
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:41,813
Where is the list?

347
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,247
His BP's spiking.
Give me the list.

348
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:44,382
Where is the list?!

349
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,617
He's going into
cardiac arrest.

350
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:47,251
Bring him back!
Get the paddles.

351
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:48,386
Start at 200 joules.

352
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:50,021
(machine whirring)
Clear.

353
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,389
No response--
there's a glitch.

354
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:52,757
Once more.
(whirring)

355
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,258
Clear.

356
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:55,259
There it is again.

357
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:56,895
Electronic
interference.

358
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:58,964
This could be it--
feels like

359
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:00,198
a metal plate
or something.

360
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:01,332
All right.

361
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,467
Amping up to 300.
(whirring)

362
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:03,468
Clear.
Where's the plate?

363
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:04,535
All right.

364
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:05,971
He's stabilized--
let's get him boarded.

365
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:08,206
Where's the plate?
It's below
his rib cage.

366
00:17:08,273 --> 00:17:09,474
Open him up.

367
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,742
Sir, we don't
have time.

368
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,612
I have to ask you
to step aside.
You open him up now.

369
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,980
Do it.

370
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:32,396
Sir, this man will die

371
00:17:32,464 --> 00:17:34,132
if we don't get him
to the hospital.

372
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,700
Get him out of here.

373
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,746
Patch me through to Agent Moss.

374
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:49,147
This is Moss.

375
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,314
Larry, it's Jack.

376
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:51,349
Go ahead, Jack.

377
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,617
I found some
kind of digital

378
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,185
storage device implanted
under Dubaku's skin.

379
00:17:54,253 --> 00:17:56,287
What is it?
In an effort to
protect his family,

380
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:57,488
he said he would
provide me

381
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,824
with a list of all
of his U.S. government contacts.

382
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,127
<i>He said it was on him;
he meant, in him.</i>

383
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:03,662
Larry, this is his
insurance policy.

384
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:06,230
I'm sure of it.
Jack, we need that data
as soon as possible.

385
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,432
Can you upload
the files to FBI?
I don't think so.

386
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,734
I've never seen
anything like it.

387
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:12,236
Hold on one second.

388
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:13,337
Officer.

389
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,739
Officer.

390
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:15,974
My name
is Jack Bauer.

391
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:17,375
I'm working
with the FBI.

392
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,144
I need you to get this device
to regional headquarters.

393
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:21,079
I want you to give it
to an Agent Larry Moss.

394
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:22,647
You put this in his
hands, his hands only.

395
00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:23,648
You understand?
Yes, sir.

396
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:24,783
Do it.

397
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,250
Larry, you got a chopper
coming your way.

398
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:27,686
You should have the drive
in five minutes.

399
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:28,853
We're gonna stay with Dubaku.

400
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,655
Get back to us as soon
as you got anything.

401
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:31,723
Copy that.

402
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:43,735
Sean.

403
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:44,803
What is it?

404
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,104
What's wrong?

405
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:47,972
Just listen to me,
and try not to overreact.

406
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,074
Okay, we have
a situation,

407
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,142
but I think I have
a way to handle it.

408
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,577
What situation?
You told me you had

409
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:53,644
everything
under control.

410
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,446
I do...

411
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:58,382
but they have Dubaku's database.
What?

412
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,718
Sean, our names
are on that list.

413
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:01,119
You told me that you
were taking care

414
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:02,353
of this,
and now you're telling me

415
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:03,788
that they
have our names?
No, they don't

416
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:05,223
have our names yet,
so here's the plan.

417
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,691
Sean, we have to get out
of here.

418
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,559
We have to get out
of here right now!

419
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:09,794
I'm not going
to jail, Sean!

420
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,429
Do you hear me?
Nobody's going
to jail.

421
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:12,864
I promise.
I'm sick
of your promises.

422
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:13,965
You promised me
that this

423
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,133
is all taken care of.

424
00:19:15,201 --> 00:19:16,601
You promised me
you're leaving your wife.

425
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:17,936
You make all these promises,

426
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:19,237
but you never
keep any of them!
Stop talking,

427
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:21,606
and just listen to me--
now, I told you I have a way

428
00:19:21,673 --> 00:19:23,875
out of this, but I need your
help, do you understand that?

429
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,177
Now, listen... okay?

430
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:30,181
As soon as O'Brian
downloads those files,

431
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:31,649
we're gonna crash
the entire system,

432
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:33,218
every single server
on this floor.

433
00:19:34,253 --> 00:19:35,754
That's crazy.

434
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:36,921
No, it's not crazy.

435
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:39,157
We're gonna go up
to the mainframe room...

436
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:40,792
initiate a system-wide reformat.

437
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,894
We'll wipe
everything clean,

438
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,130
and they won't be
able to stop it.

439
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:48,399
We're gonna have to bypass a lot
of safety protocols, okay?

440
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:49,968
But nobody's
better at dealing

441
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,570
with those servers than you are.

442
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:55,140
Isn't that true?

443
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,743
I need your help.

444
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:01,246
I can't do this
without you.

445
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:03,748
Hmm?

446
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,887
Erika?

447
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:11,022
Yeah.

448
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,925
Okay.

449
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,961
Um...

450
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,430
we're gonna have to...

451
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,599
tie the main servers together.

452
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,568
I need an
AVI motherboard,

453
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:26,037
but you're gonna have
to reconfigure it

454
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,105
for a macro uplink.

455
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:28,606
Okay, and we
have to hurry.

456
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,942
The drive is gonna
be here any minute.

457
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,278
Go up to the mainframe room
and get started.

458
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:34,412
I'm gonna prep the motherboard.

459
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,680
I'll meet you up there.

460
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:36,714
Okay.

461
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,649
Okay.

462
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:40,885
Hey.

463
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:43,087
We're gonna
be fine.

464
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:44,555
Huh?

465
00:20:44,623 --> 00:20:46,024
I love you.

466
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:50,328
I love you, too.

467
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:52,163
Okay, let's go.
Okay.

468
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,961
(indistinct chatter)

469
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,902
These are Marika Donoso's
personal effects.

470
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:23,137
Thank you.

471
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:24,305
Copy that.

472
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:25,574
Get back to me.

473
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:28,851
That was Larry.

474
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:29,611
They got the drive.

475
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,012
Chloe's gonna be
working on them.

476
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,014
They should have something
in the next few minutes.

477
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,248
That's all that matters,

478
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:35,917
right, Jack?

479
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:37,786
I don't like
what happened to Marika

480
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:38,954
any more
than you do.

481
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:40,221
We did what
was necessary.

482
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:41,656
You better figure out
a way to live with it.

483
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,191
How, Jack? Pretend
that it never happened?

484
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:44,759
Is it that easy for you?

485
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:48,229
I'll let you know when

486
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:50,431
Chloe's got
something.

487
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,609
Here it is.

488
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:06,380
(sighs):
This is a PX-1-7 drive.

489
00:22:06,448 --> 00:22:08,917
It's got an
auto-erase function.

490
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:11,352
We've only got one download.

491
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:19,260
(computer clinks and chirps)

492
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:34,709
Where have you been?

493
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:37,712
Just took a little
longer than I thought.

494
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:42,083
(computer beeps)

495
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,417
What are you doing?

496
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:45,153
Checking surveillance.
Got to keep an eye

497
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,821
on Larry and O'Brian.

498
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:48,389
Once we do this,
they're gonna

499
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:50,258
realize someone's up here
in a few seconds.

500
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:52,393
We'll have to
make a clean exit.

501
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,032
How much longer is this going
to take?

502
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,967
I just have
to bypass safety protocols.

503
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:00,168
(phone ringing)

504
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:01,369
Once they're down,

505
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:04,105
I'll start the reformat.

506
00:23:06,542 --> 00:23:07,575
Go ahead.

507
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:08,810
Dubaku hasn't arrived
at the airfield,

508
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:10,411
and he's not answering
his cell phone.

509
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:12,280
BURNETT:
What's going on?
FBI got him.

510
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:13,748
What?!

511
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:15,249
How long have you
known about this?

512
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:17,185
They're not going
to get anything out of him.

513
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:18,352
He's unconscious
in the hospital.

514
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,854
There was a crash
during a chase.

515
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:22,490
Listen, the FBI recovered
that database

516
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:24,192
you told me about,
the list of names.

517
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:25,593
I'm in the process
of deleting it.

518
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:27,228
I'm going to erase
every trace of it.

519
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:29,397
I don't have to tell
you what will happen
if they get that list.

520
00:23:29,464 --> 00:23:31,199
They won't. I'm gonna
take care of the database.

521
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:32,834
You need to take care
of Dubaku.

522
00:23:32,902 --> 00:23:35,436
Don't worry about him.
You just make sure...
ERIKA:
Damn it!

523
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:36,971
I got to go.

524
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,306
What's wrong?

525
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:40,141
It-It isn't working.
What do you mean,
it isn't working?

526
00:23:40,209 --> 00:23:41,642
All the inputs are active,

527
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,912
the servers are aligned,
but the reformat won't start.

528
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:45,313
It doesn't make any sense.

529
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,748
Okay, well, just-just
think it through, Erika.

530
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,616
Right? You
can do this.
Would you just shut up?

531
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:49,684
Okay?

532
00:23:49,752 --> 00:23:50,952
Okay.

533
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,121
Has to be server three.

534
00:23:53,189 --> 00:23:54,422
(beep)

535
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:55,523
All right,
server three was upgraded

536
00:23:55,591 --> 00:23:57,425
last week.

537
00:23:57,492 --> 00:23:59,627
Which means they restored

538
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,295
the partitions to the
system default settings.

539
00:24:01,363 --> 00:24:02,563
How could I be so stupid?

540
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:09,537
I just have
to configure the parameters.

541
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:12,406
Okay.

542
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:14,876
(trilling)

543
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:19,680
Okay? Is that it?

544
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,917
I think so.

545
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:26,187
Program's running.

546
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,491
(computer trilling)

547
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,860
What? What's happening?
What's going on?

548
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:33,628
The hard drive's
reformatting.
What?

549
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:35,797
The files are being erased.

550
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:36,731
We're losing everything.

551
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,566
Well, make it stop.

552
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:40,301
I don't have
the access.
Get the PX-1-7 out.

553
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:42,971
It's too late.
It's erased.

554
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,206
(indistinct, lively chatter)

555
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:47,175
CHLOE:
This is deliberate.
It's not a glitch.

556
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:48,709
Someone's trying
to crash the system.

557
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,078
Where's your mainframe room?

558
00:24:50,146 --> 00:24:51,512
Come on.

559
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:57,085
Here they come.

560
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:58,820
We got to get out of here.

561
00:24:58,888 --> 00:24:59,988
Almost there.
Erika...

562
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:01,856
It's done.
Are you sure?

563
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:04,993
Yeah. It'll take a few minutes
for the reformat to be complete,

564
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,861
but there's no stopping it.

565
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,029
Oh, baby.

566
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:09,264
Mm.

567
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:10,832
I knew you
could do it.

568
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,667
Yeah. We gonna be okay?

569
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,735
We're gonna be fine.

570
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:18,339
(gunshot)

571
00:25:18,407 --> 00:25:20,008
(Erika gasps)

572
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:22,543
(panting)

573
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,458
(groaning)

574
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,460
(gasping)

575
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:44,732
(sighs)

576
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:47,568
Sorry.

577
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:56,044
(gunshot, groaning)

578
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,112
(groans)

579
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,589
(groaning)

580
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:09,858
(door opening)

581
00:26:09,925 --> 00:26:11,192
Get on the floor!

582
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,894
It wasn't me!

583
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:14,595
Get on the floor!

584
00:26:14,663 --> 00:26:16,331
(groaning)

585
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:21,970
(Sean groaning)

586
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:25,340
Larry, it wasn't me.

587
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:27,842
Chloe!

588
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,911
SEAN:
Larry, I followed her up here.

589
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:32,013
She was trying
to crash the system.

590
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:33,447
She shot me!

591
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:35,783
I went for the weapon,
and it went off.

592
00:26:35,851 --> 00:26:37,451
Security, this is Agent Moss.

593
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,020
I need a team to lock down
the mainframe room.

594
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:41,155
And get a medic up here! Chloe,
can you recover the files?

595
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:42,523
I don't know yet.

596
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:43,892
What files?!
What the hell is happening?!

597
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,659
You tell me what the hell
is happening, Sean!

598
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:48,529
You were shutting me out, Larry,
so I looked around on my own.

599
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:50,932
I found out that Erika was
rerouting the sub-cam channel!

600
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,700
What the hell was she doing?

601
00:26:52,768 --> 00:26:55,436
She sent out a-a warrant
on a vehicle with two suspects.

602
00:26:55,504 --> 00:26:56,670
I knew something was wrong.

603
00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:58,172
That's not part of her job.

604
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,840
I asked her about it,
and she tried to deny it.

605
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,876
She was acting
very strangely.

606
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:02,977
Why didn't you say anything?

607
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:04,612
I don't know
what the hell it meant,

608
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,080
so I hacked into
her hard drive,

609
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:07,916
and I found schematics
for the main server.

610
00:27:07,983 --> 00:27:09,951
Bypass codes

611
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,219
for the safety protocols.

612
00:27:11,287 --> 00:27:14,488
I followed her up here
to see what she was up to.

613
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:16,291
The second I realized
she was trying to crash

614
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:18,426
the system, I-I confronted her.

615
00:27:18,493 --> 00:27:20,795
She shot me.

616
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,197
I went for the gun.

617
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:25,033
Larry, I didn't mean
to kill her.

618
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,137
Halt! Halt!

619
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:30,805
Larry, it's too late.
The system's fried.

620
00:27:30,872 --> 00:27:32,873
Dubaku's
files are gone.

621
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,575
Are you sure?
Can you recover anything?

622
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:36,877
The server's wiped clean.
She got everything.

623
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,838
Is this everything you got?

624
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,606
No, it's not.

625
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,174
I didn't have time
to print out every single

626
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,743
message that came
through Erika's workstation.

627
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,546
That's everything she was doing
for the past three days.

628
00:28:03,614 --> 00:28:05,748
Look, Larry,

629
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:06,916
I told you what happened.

630
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:08,485
I feel like
you owe me an explanation.

631
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:09,853
What the hell is going on here?

632
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,921
(sighs)

633
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,127
The government's been
compromised by Dubaku.

634
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:19,796
FBI, Secret Service.

635
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,297
God knows who else.

636
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:23,399
That's why I shut you out,
brought in Chloe O'Brian.

637
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,334
We were in the middle
of decrypting a file

638
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,303
that had the names of
everyone on Dubaku's payroll.

639
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:29,539
Erika erased it when
she wiped the server.

640
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,474
That was our only lead.

641
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,376
You should have told me
about this.

642
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:34,744
You should have trusted me.

643
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:37,614
Sean, I didn't know
who to trust.

644
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,417
You all right?
How's your arm?

645
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:42,819
It hurts like hell. It's fine.

646
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,121
Oh. When you're up for
it, I'm gonna need you

647
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:46,188
to write a statement.

648
00:28:46,256 --> 00:28:47,456
Okay.

649
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,625
And keep your mouth shut.

650
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:49,792
(phone ringing)

651
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,260
We don't know who else
in this building

652
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,196
might be working
for Dubaku. Yeah.

653
00:28:54,264 --> 00:28:55,464
Larry, don't ask me how,
but I did it.

654
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,266
You did what?

655
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,335
I recovered Dubaku's files.

656
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:01,070
What?

657
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,072
I was running a mirror file
on an outside server.

658
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,541
I always do that
when I'm dealing

659
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:06,175
with sensitive materials.

660
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,277
Erika's parameters
were too narrow to catch it.

661
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:10,279
How soon can you
have it decrypted?

662
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:12,381
It's decrypted. It's been
decrypting this entire time.

663
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:13,616
Dubaku kept

664
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,217
detailed evidence
on everyone.

665
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:17,987
Phone logs, financial records--
it's all here.

666
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:20,723
Listen, I'm gonna need you to
cross-check with FBI personnel.

667
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,559
Sean said Erika was
working by herself,

668
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,393
but I got to
be 100% sure.

669
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,662
Okay. Hold on.

670
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,730
Yeah.

671
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,167
Chloe recovered
the files.

672
00:29:31,234 --> 00:29:33,235
That's great.

673
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:37,273
I should get to that statement.

674
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,275
Yeah.

675
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,310
Sean?

676
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:43,046
When you're
done there,

677
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:44,380
I want you to go downstairs

678
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:45,815
and see Dr. Weber.

679
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:46,916
You shot a fellow agent.

680
00:29:46,984 --> 00:29:48,918
You're gonna want
to talk to somebody.

681
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:51,187
Yes, sir.

682
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:07,014
JANIS:
Hey, do you
have any idea

683
00:30:07,134 --> 00:30:08,125
what's going on
with the servers?

684
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:09,038
Not a clue.

685
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,206
The whole system's down.

686
00:30:10,273 --> 00:30:12,308
I tried to get
into the mainframe room,

687
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,143
and security has
got it locked off.

688
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:15,645
Ask Larry about it, Janis.

689
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,246
Where are you going?

690
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,148
I got to run an errand.

691
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,951
Now?

692
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,753
All right, all right.

693
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,821
Hold off.

694
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,990
(grunts)

695
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:03,092
You better start
talking to me right now!

696
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:08,197
I'd like to speak
with my attorney.

697
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:15,204
Put him in holding.

698
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,781
(breathing heavily)

699
00:31:24,848 --> 00:31:27,016
Get me Bill Buchanan
at the White House.

700
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:29,085
(indistinct chatter)

701
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:41,430
Where is my sister?

702
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:43,700
Where's Marika?

703
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,335
There was an accident.

704
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:48,137
What happened?

705
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,140
Marika didn't make it.

706
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:53,176
What-What do you mean?

707
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:55,344
There was a crash.

708
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:57,246
Uh, it happened
during the pursuit.

709
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:59,481
Marika was killed.

710
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:03,252
I don't understand.

711
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,321
You said that you'd protect her.

712
00:32:05,388 --> 00:32:06,823
You said she'd be okay.

713
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,058
We wouldn't have caught
Dubaku without Marika's help.

714
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:12,394
She was very,
very brave, Rosa.

715
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:15,431
What is this?

716
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,633
This is supposed
to make everything okay?

717
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:21,570
Marika was all I had!

718
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:25,041
I trusted you with her life,
and you let her die?!

719
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,043
I'm so sorry.
(gasps)

720
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,244
(crying):
Don't touch me!

721
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:30,713
(crying)

722
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,549
You killed my sister!

723
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:37,620
You didn't care how you did it
or who got hurt!

724
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:44,593
JACK:
Agent Walker?

725
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:51,467
Excuse me.

726
00:32:57,574 --> 00:32:59,842
I just got off the
phone with Larry.

727
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,377
Dubaku wasn't lying.

728
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:02,711
On the drive was a list

729
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,713
of everyone he was working
with in the government.

730
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,715
They're getting ready
to make arrests.

731
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,785
It's over.

732
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:13,956
It's not over for Rosa.

733
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:19,896
What happened to Marika
was a tragedy.

734
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:21,563
But I'm not going
to stand here

735
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,033
and tell you what
we did was wrong,
because we weren't.

736
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,701
She made a choice,
a brave one,

737
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:27,469
to get involved,
but she made it.

738
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:28,938
God, listen
to yourself, Jack.

739
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,773
You don't even
sound human.

740
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:32,208
Don't you feel
anything?

741
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,542
We had a job to do!

742
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,811
To protect the hundreds if not

743
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:35,878
thousands of
innocent lives

744
00:33:35,946 --> 00:33:37,113
that would not have
had a choice

745
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,216
if we let a terrorist
attack take place.

746
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,685
What we did wasn't wrong.

747
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:44,921
It was necessary.

748
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:48,124
I read your file.

749
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,226
When your wife was killed,
did you feel that

750
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,094
or did you just tell yourself
that that was necessary?

751
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:54,430
What do you want from me?

752
00:33:54,497 --> 00:33:55,631
What do you want from me?!

753
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:56,966
I just want to know
that you feel something!

754
00:33:57,034 --> 00:34:00,269
I want to know that you feel
the same kind of pain that I do!

755
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:02,071
Do you feel that?!

756
00:34:02,139 --> 00:34:03,639
Do you feel that?!

757
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,647
(crying)

758
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,716
It's all right.

759
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,687
You're going to be all right.

760
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,459
It's going to take a while.

761
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:25,494
But you will learn
to live with it.

762
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:28,064
What if I don't want to learn
to live with it?

763
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,100
Then quit.

764
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,437
And by the way,

765
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:37,073
that stunt you pulled
by the car...

766
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:41,543
...you ever pull your weapon
on my again,

767
00:34:41,611 --> 00:34:44,046
you better intend to use it.

768
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:45,381
I did.

769
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:12,424
(door opens)

770
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,760
Olivia.

771
00:35:15,828 --> 00:35:16,861
What's going on?

772
00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:18,730
How's Dad?

773
00:35:19,765 --> 00:35:22,200
He's still in surgery.

774
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:23,868
We're waiting for word.

775
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:26,404
Is he going to
be all right?

776
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:28,406
He was seriously injured.

777
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,342
The bullet

778
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:32,410
went through his lung.

779
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:36,080
Livy.

780
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:38,416
The doctors are doing

781
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,418
everything they can.

782
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,454
Who did this?

783
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:45,923
It's complicated.

784
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:49,427
I want to know
who shot my father!

785
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:53,198
Your father found out
about a conspiracy

786
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:54,999
inside the
government.

787
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:57,569
The people behind it
tried to kill him.

788
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:58,603
Who are these people?

789
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:00,938
We're trying to find
out right now.

790
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:02,974
That's all I
can tell you.

791
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:05,243
Okay, I want to go
to the hospital.

792
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,578
I want to be there

793
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:08,580
when he wakes up.
I can't let you do that.

794
00:36:08,648 --> 00:36:10,948
The people who shot your father
are still out there.

795
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:11,949
It's not safe.

796
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:13,585
I don't care, I want to see Dad!

797
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:15,220
This is not a debate.

798
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:17,088
I'm not going to risk anything
happening to you.

799
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:18,122
You're staying
in the White House,

800
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:20,124
and that's
the end of it.

801
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:22,827
AIDE (intercom beeps):
Madam President,
Bill Buchanan is here

802
00:36:22,895 --> 00:36:24,829
to see you.
I'll be right out.

803
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:31,203
There's a lot we need
to talk about, Olivia.

804
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:35,507
We've been ignoring things
for far too long.

805
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:39,744
It took Dad getting shot for you
to finally want to talk?

806
00:36:39,812 --> 00:36:41,879
Let's not go down this path.

807
00:36:42,915 --> 00:36:45,350
Not again.

808
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:47,419
Not today.

809
00:36:49,288 --> 00:36:51,223
We'll talk later.

810
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,292
One of the guards will take you
up to the residence.

811
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,304
All right, Bill.
What is it?

812
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:08,306
I have very good news.

813
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:09,441
Jack Bauer just

814
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:11,443
recovered a database
hidden on Dubaku.

815
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,810
It contains the names
of everyone

816
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:14,112
in the government who
was working with him.

817
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:15,094
How many?

818
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:16,307
Close to a hundred people,

819
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:17,621
across all agencies.

820
00:37:17,741 --> 00:37:19,958
Some at very
high levels.
My God.

821
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:22,954
Dubaku kept detailed
files on every person.

822
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,289
This is exactly

823
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:25,523
what we've been working toward,
Madam President.

824
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:26,558
We can finally put an end

825
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:28,660
to this conspiracy.

826
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:30,695
I assume you've already

827
00:37:30,763 --> 00:37:32,797
begun acting on this
information.
Yes.

828
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:35,467
As a matter of fact, Larry
Moss just identified
two more individuals

829
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:37,602
working within FBI who
were on the list.

830
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,605
He's confident the
Bureau is secure.

831
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:41,939
What's the next step?

832
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:44,776
I'm working with FBI to
coordinate an interagency sweep.

833
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:46,778
We should start making arrests
within the hour.

834
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:48,713
Bill, I don't
know what to say

835
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:50,047
to thank you.

836
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:51,883
What you have done
here today

837
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,551
puts all of us
in your debt.

838
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:54,919
I appreciate that,
Madam President,

839
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:57,922
but there are a lot
of people to thank,

840
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,724
including Jack Bauer.

841
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:04,696
He's scheduled
to resume his testimony

842
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:06,364
before the Senate Committee
tomorrow morning.

843
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:07,965
I'm aware of that.

844
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:09,233
Madam President,
forgive me

845
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:10,968
if I'm out of line,
but I feel

846
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:13,004
Senator Mayer is on
a personal crusade

847
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,411
against Jack.

848
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:16,874
He's already taken
his pound of flesh.

849
00:38:16,942 --> 00:38:18,710
He dismantled CTU,

850
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:19,877
attacked the reputations
of people

851
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:21,245
who've served this
country with honor.

852
00:38:21,314 --> 00:38:24,716
Now he wants to make
an example of Jack.

853
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:26,718
It isn't right,
Madam President,

854
00:38:26,786 --> 00:38:28,586
especially after today.

855
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,420
What are you asking me to do,
Bill?

856
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,124
I'm asking you to speak
to Senator Mayer.

857
00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:36,728
Jack Bauer helped save
this country.

858
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:39,798
He doesn't deserve to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

859
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:44,369
I appreciate your sentiments,
Bill,

860
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:46,304
but I'm going to have to think
about this.

861
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:48,573
That's all I'm  asking,
Madam President.

862
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,808
Thank you.

863
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:24,242
What the hell
are you doing here?

864
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,143
I need to talk
with you.
About what?

865
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:28,780
I told you I was going
to follow up on a lead.

866
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:30,982
No, you said you were going
to turn yourself in

867
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:33,017
as soon as this
was over.
And I will.

868
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,187
But this ain't over yet.

869
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:38,356
There's going to be
another attack.

870
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:39,591
Here in D.C.

871
00:39:39,658 --> 00:39:40,925
Dubaku is in custody.
He's already provided us

872
00:39:40,993 --> 00:39:42,660
with a list of everyone
in the government

873
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,662
that was working
with him.
It's not Dubaku.

874
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,432
It's his boss, Juma.

875
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,602
He knows he's about to lose
control of his country.

876
00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:52,937
So he's going to try and
rally his people behind him

877
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:54,972
by striking back
at the U.S.
How do you know this?

878
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,974
I tracked down
a source.

879
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,976
What source?

880
00:39:59,044 --> 00:40:01,979
He was one of the men I worked
with on Emerson's crew.

881
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:04,148
He had a direct line
of communication

882
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:07,151
with the Juma regime in Sangala.

883
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:10,154
It wasn't easy getting
the information out of him,

884
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:12,490
but I'm convinced
it's accurate.

885
00:40:12,558 --> 00:40:14,492
Then you should hand it
over to FBI.
No.

886
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,494
My source tells me

887
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:18,496
that the window opens
at 1900 hours.

888
00:40:18,564 --> 00:40:20,498
By the time the FBI

889
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:21,999
wades through their
procedures and red tape,

890
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,068
it's going to
be too late.

891
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:27,071
What's the target?

892
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:30,074
He doesn't know
the exact target,

893
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:33,044
but it's definitely going to be
of high value

894
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:35,112
and high impact.

895
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:38,550
He gave me the name
of somebody

896
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:40,552
who's been involved
in the planning.
Who?

897
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,353
Ryan Burnett.

898
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:46,691
Senator Mayer's Chief of Staff.

899
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:48,760
That's right.

900
00:40:48,828 --> 00:40:51,429
He's been involved from
the very beginning.

901
00:40:51,497 --> 00:40:52,764
What about Mayer?

902
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:53,965
No.

903
00:40:54,032 --> 00:40:55,232
He's not involved.

904
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,068
You're sure about that?

905
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:59,136
Yeah.

906
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,974
You better not be lying to me,
Tony.

907
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,044
This is real, Jack.

908
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,017
Burnett will be
on Dubaku's list.

909
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:15,353
As soon as he finds out
that Dubaku's in custody,

910
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,355
he'll start running.
You don't have a lot of time.

911
00:41:17,422 --> 00:41:19,357
I've already got
a tail on him.

912
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:21,359
(sighs)

913
00:41:21,426 --> 00:41:23,361
Listen, Jack,

914
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,363
if you're with me,

915
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,431
meet me at the corner of
First and Constitution.

916
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:39,644
I need your help.

917
00:41:50,956 --> 00:41:54,058
MOSS:
Thank you for your patience.

918
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:55,894
As I'm sure some of
you already know,

919
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:58,563
our government and its
ancillary agencies,

920
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:00,732
including this office,

921
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:02,600
have been infiltrated
by operatives

922
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:04,235
in league with
Ike Dubaku.

923
00:42:04,302 --> 00:42:06,237
(phone rings)

924
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:08,239
Yes, Senator?

925
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,241
MAYER:
Ryan, can you step in here?

926
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:12,309
Yes, sir.

927
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,648
(knocks on door)

928
00:42:19,117 --> 00:42:21,085
I'm going
to the White House.

929
00:42:21,153 --> 00:42:22,587
Sir?

930
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:25,590
President Taylor wants
to speak to me

931
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:27,058
regarding Jack Bauer.

932
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,192
Bauer?

933
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,226
What about him?

934
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:31,295
I don't know,

935
00:42:31,363 --> 00:42:32,764
but we'll find out
soon enough.

936
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,766
It's odd, though.

937
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,000
What is, sir?

938
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:37,835
Bauer was pulled away

939
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:39,070
from the Senate hearings
this morning

940
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:41,072
to help the FBI
with an investigation.

941
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:42,306
And now the president

942
00:42:42,374 --> 00:42:44,508
wants to talk to me
about him.

943
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:47,511
I don't like
the timing of this.

944
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,513
Grab your laptop, Ryan.

945
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:51,015
I want you there with me.

946
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,084
Yes, sir.

947
00:42:58,223 --> 00:43:01,225
(phone beeps)

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
