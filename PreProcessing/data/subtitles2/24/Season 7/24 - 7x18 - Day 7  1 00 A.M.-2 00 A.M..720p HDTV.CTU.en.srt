00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,770
********

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,370
Mr. Knowles,my name is jack bauer.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,860
Jonas hodges is in possession
of a military-grade bioweapon.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,710
I was contaminated when trying
to intercept the canisters.

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,700
I promise you,sir,the
weapon is on your base.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,430
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,730
Think I might.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,310
I have an order from the
president of the united states.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,660
To search this building.

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,370
Are there weapons of mass destruction?

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,960
Are there weapons of any kind?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,840
You've got five minutes to get these helicopters
flying out of here with all of you on board.

16
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,330
Larry,I want you and your men
to pull out on hodges' timetable.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,210
Tony,you're gonna need  to
find a way to stay behind.

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,370
We're gonna get your vectors  over to a
man  that we contacted  inside starkwood.

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,650
His name is douglas knowles. He
believes he knows where the weapons are.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,880
Stay here. I'll be right back.

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,260
Jack! We need a medic!

22
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,810
The bioagent is more
virulent than we thought.

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,080
All we're doing here is
just masking the symptoms.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,680
I understand.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,650
- There's something you may want to consider.
- What's that?

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,070
A possible treatment using stem cells
from a genetically compatible donor.

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,350
I saw your file,and it
says you have a daughter.

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,860
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

29
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,470
Jack.It should be her choice.

30
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,290
Well,it's not. I'm the one who's dying.

31
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm in. But they got knowles.

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,090
A little loyalty.

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,110
Wasn't that the least I deserved?

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,590
You can't take on the
federal government.

35
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,430
I have a visual on the weapon.

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,600
Okay,those are the canisters.

37
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,340
I'll notify admiral smith the
target is located and confirmed.

38
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,490
You remember starkwood
was deployed to pakistan,

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,660
that we requisitioned a
missile system at that time.

40
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,510
Well,three of those missiles
are now loaded with a pathogen

41
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,180
and aimed at cities on
our eastern seaboard.

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,520
You will keep this conversation to
yourself and turn the planes around.

43
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,200
And if you do not
comply,madam president,

44
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,510
I will have no choice but
to launch those missiles.

45
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,310
Abort the air strike,admiral smith.

46
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,250
- Ma'am,with all respect...
- damn it,admiral.

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,810
Abort the air strike immediately!

48
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,610
**********

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,950
Tony,it's jack. Do you copy?

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,420
Jack,what the hell is going on?

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,890
Where are those f-18s?

52
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,020
Tim woods just called
from the white house.

53
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,870
The president canceled the air strike.

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,360
What? Why?

55
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,830
She doesn't believe our intel is strong
enough to justify military action.

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,680
Is she out of her mind?

57
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,380
Jack,I saw those
canisters with my own eyes.

58
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,030
So did you. They're in that bunker.

59
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,950
She's not gonna get any
better intel than that.

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
I know. It doesn't make
any sense,but right now,

61
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,860
we've got a presidential order to
pull you out of the starkwood compound,

62
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,040
along with the perimeter teams.

63
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,360
Tony,larry's been told
the president's decision.

64
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,880
He's preparing to move his teams out,but
he's got to get you out of there first.

65
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,060
He'll be sending you coordinates for an
exfiltration point along the southwest perimeter.

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,050
- Tony?
- Hold on a second.

67
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,540
Tony,what's going on?

68
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,010
Jack,I might know why the president
called off that air strike.

69
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,450
What do you mean?

70
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,030
I think starkwood's got
surface-to-surface missiles.

71
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,780
That's how they're gonna
deploy the bioweapon.

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,740
How do you know this?

73
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,480
A fuel truck just pulled up next to the
bunker where they're storing the weapons.

74
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,140
They're pumping rp-7
into an underground depot.

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,590
What's rp-7?

76
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,040
It's a propellant only used in
surface-to-surface missiles. Tony,are you sure?

77
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,730
I'm looking right at it,jack.

78
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,380
Do you have any c-4 on you?

79
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,500
Yeah,I've got three charges
and a remote detonator.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,370
Do you think you can gain access
to the underground fuel depot?

81
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,390
Yeah,I think we've got a
play,but I've got to move soon...

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,360
before that fuel truck pulls away.

83
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,720
Okay,I want you to maintain your
position. I'm gonna call the president.

84
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,440
Come with me.

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,820
What is it,tim?

86
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,890
Madam president,the joint chiefs are
beginning to question your decision

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,500
to call off the air
strike against starkwood.

88
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,490
They think the intelligence we received
from tony almeida was sufficient

89
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,680
and that we may be missing an
opportunity to destroy the bioweapons.

90
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,710
I gave my orders,tim. No air strike.

91
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
No military action of any
kind against starkwood.

92
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,710
Now,I asked you to handle
the joint chiefs; handle them.

93
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,260
I'll do my best,ma'am,but if I may...

94
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,460
what is our next move?

95
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,840
Jonas hodges is coming
to the white house.

96
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,050
He wants to speak with me alone.

97
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,510
- For what possible reason?
- I don't know.

98
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,860
Madam president,shouldn't your
advisors be at that meeting?

99
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,340
Tim,stop asking me questions.

100
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,700
If you want to help,make sure as few people as
possible know that jonas hodges is coming here.

101
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,250
and bring him in through the
southeast service entrance.

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,370
Yes?

103
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,000
Madam president,jack bauer and
renee walker are calling from fbi.

104
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,430
You did speak to fbi?

105
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,520
Yes,ma'am,five minutes ago. I gave them
your reason for calling off the air strike,

106
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,090
but I must warn you,they
were skeptical as well.

107
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,690
Be ready for hodges.

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,470
Mr. Bauer,agent walker,this
is the president.

109
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,980
Madam president,we need to talk.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No,mr. Bauer,we don'T.
You need to listen.

111
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,290
I appreciate everything that you
have done in gathering this intel,

112
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,190
but I still need more before I can
authorize an air strike. I'm sorry.

113
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,080
Madam president,with all due respect,I
don't believe you're being truthful with us.

114
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,650
Excuse me?

115
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,860
I think you called off the
air strike because jonas hodges

116
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,630
is in possession of surface-to-surface
missiles armed with the bioweapon,

117
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,480
and he's threatening to use them in
case you try to take action against him.

118
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,920
Madam president,tony almeida witnessed
a truck pumping rp-7 rocket fuel

119
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,530
into an underground depot situated right next to
the bunker where the bioweapons are being stored.

120
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,810
The only purpose for rp-7 rocket
fuel is to launch missiles.

121
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,450
Madam president,please
just tell us the truth.

122
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,350
Jack,hodges has 13 python
missiles armed with the bioweapons.

123
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,640
Three are currently
aimed at american cities.

124
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,290
He demanded that i recall
the planes,or he would launch.

125
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,450
- What does hodges want?
- I don't know...

126
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,020
but he's requested a
face-to-face meeting.

127
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,650
He'll be at the white
house in a few minutes.

128
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,010
Madam president,the only reason he wants a
face-to-face meeting is to lay out his demands,

129
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,070
and whatever they are,you
cannot negotiate with him.

130
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,410
I'm not planning on
negotiating with him,jack.

131
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,110
Once he places his cards on the
table,I am sure that I can...

132
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,920
I can make him realize the
futility of what he is trying to do.

133
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,770
Jonas hodges is a traitor and a terrorist,and
after everything that's happened today,

134
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,760
are you really naive enough to believe that
you can simply talk to him and change his mind?

135
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,670
I'm not new at this,jack,and right
now,I don't have another option.

136
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,680
Madam president,you do. Tony
almeida is still inside starkwood.

137
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,860
I ordered him exfiltrated immediately.

138
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
What's he still doing there?

139
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,000
I asked him to stand by
until I could talk to you.

140
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,010
He believes he can gain
access to the fuel depot

141
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,210
and lay a series of explosive
charges and take the missiles out.

142
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,880
Now,I believe this can
work,but we need to act quickly.

143
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,350
What about the bioweapons?

144
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,040
Rp-7 rocket fuel
burns at 5,000 degrees.

145
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,130
There will be nothing left.

146
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,760
Once the weapons are destroyed,larry moss and his
teams can move in on starkwood and lock it down.

147
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,370
Hodges gave standing orders to his men to
launch the missiles at the first detection

148
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,970
of government inrference.

149
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,960
If almeida is detected,thousands
of americans will die,jack.

150
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,760
Madam president,I know
that there's a risk,

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,180
but I would not be asking you to do
this if I didn't think it would work.

152
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,840
Please,I am begging you. Trust me.

153
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,940
How long did the
doctors give you to live?

154
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,940
Uh,they're not sure,but the
pathogen has started to take effect.

155
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,520
Then there's not much i can
threaten you with,is there?

156
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,390
I expect you'll do
what you think is right.

157
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,190
what the hell does that mean?

158
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,820
She wants us to go in.

159
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,110
But she didn't authorize it.

160
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,150
She can'T. She needs this
to be a covert operation.

161
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,930
If something were to go wrong and
those missiles were to be launched,

162
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,870
the president needs to be able to swear
under oath that we were working on our own.

163
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,180
She wants us to go in. Notify
larry. We need to move fast.

164
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,900
I told you I'd get
you to the white house.

165
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,690
I just didn't think it would
be under these conditions.

166
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,450
It was brilliant,you know.

167
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,630
What was that,sir?

168
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,430
What you did to make almeida
think that you were betraying me.

169
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,910
- Quite brilliant.
- Thank you,sir.

170
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,530
You put yourself in harm's
way,greg,and I'll never forget that.

171
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,350
I can't believe... I'm feeling nervous.

172
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,150
You're gonna do fine,sir.

173
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,320
- Thank you,tim.
- You're welcome.

174
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,350
So,it sounds to me like the president
didn't actually authorize this.

175
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,150
Technically,no. It was more of an...

176
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,930
an indirect order,but believe
me,larry,she wants this to happen.

177
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,260
She's gonna meet with hodges,and
we're gonna blow those fuel tanks.

178
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,140
Larry,do you have a problem with this?

179
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,950
As a matter of fact,no. None whatsoever.

180
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,010
These starkwood bastards drew on my men.
I'm looking forward to getting back in there.

181
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,010
All right,have your teams hold
their position and be ready to move.

182
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,110
- Believe me,you'll know when it happens.
- All right.

183
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,400
- Tony,it's jack. Do you copy?
- Yeah,I'm here.

184
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,350
You were right about the missiles.
The president confirmed it.

185
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,710
We're gonna have to carry
this out as a covert operation.

186
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,240
Larry and his men are standing by to lock down
starkwood as soon as the missiles have been destroyed.

187
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,790
- Good.
- Tony...

188
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,990
I need to know that you can
do this without being detected.

189
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,300
Hodges's given his men standing orders to launch
those missiles if there's a breach of any kind.

190
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,300
Yeah. I can do it.

191
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,490
- Okay. Good luck.
- Yeah.

192
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,240
We're done here.

193
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,650
I'm going to go run a perimeter check.

194
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,090
You said you just finished one.

195
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,790
I know.

196
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,880
But I don't think we can
be too careful right now.

197
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,900
- Yeah.
- it's me.

198
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,220
Auxiliary tanks are fueled and ready.

199
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,830
Confirmed. I'll be
down in a few minutes.

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,930
Copy that.

201
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,320
Freeze! Let me see your hands.

202
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,140
Almeida.

203
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,320
Put your gun on the ground. Slowly.

204
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,360
Kick it.

205
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,820
drag him under the truck. Now! Let's go!

206
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,870
Hands up.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,400
What do you think you're doing?

208
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,060
You're going to take me
down to the fuel tanks.

209
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,890
Let's go.

210
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,960
Open it up.

211
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,890
Go ahead.

212
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,000
President will see you now.

213
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,980
Very good. Thank you.

214
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,400
Mr. Hodges.

215
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,360
Madam president.

216
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,580
This is greg seaton,my associate.

217
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,220
He's a remarkable man. Doesn't look
remarkle,but believe me,he's a genius.

218
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,060
Yes,I know mr. Seaton.

219
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,010
Thank you,gentlemen.

220
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,930
It never gets old,does it?

221
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,380
Stepping into the... the oval office.

222
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,600
Almost smells of history.

223
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,280
- Can we sit?
- Please.

224
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,940
You know,this is the first time I've
been in this room since you were elected?

225
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm aware of that,yes.

226
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,980
Under your predecessor,I used to
drop by every couple of months.

227
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,750
I'd brief president daniels on what
was really going on in the world.

228
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,660
And you've been excluded now.

229
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,270
- Is that what this is about?
- No,ma'am.

230
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,360
It's about allowing starkwood to fulfill
the purpose for which it was founded:

231
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,910
Protecting this country.

232
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,620
You have been attacking this country.

233
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,260
You and general juma have killed
hundreds of innocent people,

234
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,240
including my son.

235
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:50,120
Madam president,I'm
deeply sorry for your loss,

236
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,950
and my heart breaks for all
the lives that were taken today,

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,820
but I'm shocked that you would think
that I had anything to do with it.

238
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,650
We have evidence that you've
been working with juma.

239
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,510
Your intelligence
agencies have failed you.

240
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,610
If I had kno what juma was up to,I would
have done everything in my power to stop him.

241
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,470
So let's push aside all these baseless
accusations and maybe we can do some business here.

242
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,290
I'm listening.

243
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,200
Madam president,I know
you're a student of history,

244
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,330
and so you're well aware
that our nation's independence

245
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,480
was won with the aid of private armies,

246
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,610
and we can't survive without them.

247
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,380
Look how easy it was to get
bioweapons into this country.

248
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,790
Our defenses are fragile.
They're on the verge of collapse.

249
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,090
But it's not too late
to do something about it.

250
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,850
So what are you suggesting?

251
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,460
In short,I want a seat at the table.

252
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,140
Starkwood needs to be involved in the shaping
of military policy,domestic and global.

253
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,980
It sounds more like you want a
seat at the head of the table.

254
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,650
Madam president,I'm notere
to supplant your authority.

255
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,920
What I'm proposing is a partnership.

256
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,540
Think of starkwood as the fifth
branch of the military. Greg?

257
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,440
This contains the protocols that will
serve as the basis of our agreement.

258
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,280
I suggest that we review them together.

259
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,930
Jonas,I agreed to this meeting because
I wanted to hear what you had to say.

260
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,940
But what you're proposing is blackmail.

261
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,170
Well,that's putting it in
the worst possible light.

262
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,320
You are threatening to
kill thousands of people.

263
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,750
I'm not proud of this chapter.

264
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,740
I'm the first to admit it.

265
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,160
And it's time to turn the page. This
country has seen enough bloodshed today.

266
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,040
For the sake of the american
people,madam president,

267
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,100
I implore you to work with
me,and let's move past this.

268
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,300
Pick up the document,madam president.

269
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,740
Let's go. Come on. Get up
now,or I'll leave you down here.

270
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,880
And you don't want that
believe me. Get up! Let's go!

271
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,140
what is it?

272
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,570
Code 363. That's a government breach.

273
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,550
- We're supposed to launch.
- Are you sure it's not a false alarm?

274
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,440
No way to tell.

275
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,840
We've got standing orders,though.

276
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,130
Let's start the launch sequence.

277
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,780
too late.

278
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,480
Launch sequence complete.
Target is locked.

279
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,670
Enter the firing codes.

280
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,380
Sir,we need to confirm this.

281
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,770
That's not the correct protocol.

282
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,710
We're about to kill 10,000 people.
We should get someone on the phone.

283
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,430
Enter the codes. Now!

284
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,740
No,sir.

285
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,610
that's it. That's us. Let's
go. We're a go! We're a go!

286
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,410
- it's done.
- Tony?

287
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,510
Tony,do you copy?

288
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,820
An explosion of that magnitude
would have shorted out his com.

289
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,200
We're gonna have to wait for
larry and his men to move in.

290
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,090
It says here that you want active status
in the pentagon's strategic planning group.

291
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,040
That's correct.

292
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,270
That would give you access to
level 6 classified material.

293
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,760
Not even the vice president
has that clearance.

294
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,360
These points are nonnegotiable.

295
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,740
I'm not here to debate them.

296
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,740
Let's review the next section,which concerns
senate oversight of starkwood field operations.

297
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,360
I'm sorry to interrupt,madam
president,but I need to speak with you.

298
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,770
Can it wait?

299
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,740
No,ma'am,it can'T.

300
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,970
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Of course.

301
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,640
satcom has just detected a massive
explosion on the starkwood compound.

302
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,970
The bioweapons facility
has been destroyed.

303
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,500
- Are you sure?
- Yes,ma'am.

304
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,800
Judging by the size of the
explosion,nothing could have survived.

305
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,950
But I don't know how this
happened. This wasn't us.

306
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,300
- Call fbi and have them lock down starood.
- They're already moving in.

307
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,940
Good. And when this is over,I
want to speak to jack bauer.

308
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,380
- Yes,ma'am.
- You know...

309
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,110
I'm not sure I'm reaching her.

310
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,800
I think you handled it perfectly,sir.

311
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,480
We'll see.

312
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,590
What the hell is this?

313
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,480
Put this document into evidence,and
take these men into custody.

314
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:46,220
What are you thinking?
Have you lost your mind?

315
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,650
Jonas,we've taken out
your missiles. It's over.

316
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,570
That's impossible.

317
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,720
It's the truth.

318
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,540
And you're under arrest.

319
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,580
You are a terrorist and a murderer,

320
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,760
and I'm gonna do everything in my power to
make sure that you pay dearly for your crimes.

321
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,740
My only crime is that I'm
trying to protect my country!

322
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,130
You think this ends with me?

323
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,970
I'm just a small cog
in a very big machine.

324
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,910
Hold on.

325
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,440
You can't even begin to
imagine what you're up against.

326
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,590
What are you talking about?

327
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,360
You'll find out.

328
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,860
Get him out of here.

329
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,950
the advanced biohazard team is reporting no trace
of the bioweapon anywhere near the blast sight.

330
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,760
- It was incinerated in the explosion.
- Good.

331
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,500
- Any word on tony?
- Not yet. Larry's searching the compound now.

332
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,460
We should hear something soon.

333
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,370
Mr. Bauer,you have a phone
call; it's the president.

334
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,420
I'll take it in the conference
room. Thank you. I'll be right back.

335
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,630
Madam president.

336
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,300
Mr. Bauer,jonas hodges is under arrest.

337
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,930
That's good news. That's very good.

338
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,080
Jack,you and your team
provided me with an option.

339
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,190
And for that,I am deeply grateful.

340
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,070
And so are the american people.

341
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,150
Madam president,it was tony almeida who
risked his life to destroy those missiles.

342
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,070
And as you know,he's facing arrest
for things he did leading up to today,

343
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,900
and I was hoping that maybe you could...

344
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,650
yes,mr. Bauer?

345
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,830
Jack?

346
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,840
Um,I'm sorry,I...

347
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,970
completely forgot what I was saying.

348
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,770
You were talking about mr. Almeida.

349
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,820
And my answer is yes,I-I will
take his actions into account.

350
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,300
Thank you.

351
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,190
What's happening?

352
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,860
I-I-I'm not
exactly sure.

353
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,030
Jack,I am so sorry
you're going through this.

354
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,720
I wish that there were
something I could do.

355
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,970
M-madam president,I
appreciate this phone call.

356
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,020
But I'm sorry. I-I have to go.

357
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,290
- Of course.
- Thank you.

358
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,340
jonas hodges has been arrested.

359
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,230
Let me know as soon as you got tony.

360
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,630
I need to go see dr. Mace

361
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,530
Yes,madam president?

362
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,960
Call ben landry at cdc.

363
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,960
Tell him that I want real-time
updates on jack bauer's condition.

364
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,750
Yes,ma'am.

365
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,130
we've secured all entry points and command posts and
are sweeping the compound on a grid-by-grid basis.

366
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,400
- Are you meeting any resistance?
- No.

367
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,580
They're surrendering
peacefully and cooperating.

368
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:42,350
St of the men on this base,I don't think
they had any idea what was going on.

369
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,090
What about almeida?

370
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,030
- Uh,he's here. We found him.
- Is he okay?

371
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,090
Some cuts and bruises,but
otherwise,he's in pretty good shape.

372
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,520
Good. Good. Jack will
be glad to hear that.

373
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,290
Listen,renee...

374
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,450
we've known each other
a long time,you know.

375
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,590
Um,so much stuff has happened today.

376
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,860
Yeah. We have a lot
to talk about. I know.

377
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,890
Excuse me,agent walker.

378
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,640
- Your visitshe's in the waiting area.
- Okay,thank you.

379
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,980
Larry,I've got to go. Kim bauer's here.

380
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,630
- Jack's daughter? - Yes.
I-I asked her to come.

381
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,570
There's this experimental treatment for jack's
disease,but he needs compatible stem cells.

382
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,310
It's a long shot,but it's
the only hope he's got.

383
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,160
Okay. Let me know how it goes,all right?

384
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,370
- I will. I'm going off com.
- All right.

385
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,840
did they say something about kim bauer?

386
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:37,150
Yeah,she's at fbi helping with a treatment for
jack,some,uh,some kind of stem cell therapy.

387
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,870
So they think he's gonna be all right?

388
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,290
Didn't sound promising.

389
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,380
Listen,tony,this isn't
easy for me,but,uh...

390
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,020
I'm under orders to take
you into federal custody.

391
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,830
- Yeah,I know.
- You did a brave thing here.

392
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,620
Probably saved thousands of lives.

393
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,530
For the record,I don't think
this is how you should be repaid.

394
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,280
I appreciate that,but,uh...

395
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,760
I'm ready to pay for what I've done.

396
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,210
Get the cuffs off him,will you?

397
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,350
Chopper's on the way. I'll be
taking you back to fbi,all right?

398
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,680
Memory loss is consistent
with the disease,mr. Bauer.

399
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,810
I just wouldn't have expected
it to manifest this quickly.

400
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,830
It's not just memory loss.

401
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,840
It feels like...

402
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,670
I don't know exactly how to explain it.

403
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,360
I feel like,uh,like I'm
losing some part of myself.

404
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:44,570
The disease profile includes personality
changes,sometimes even hallucinations.

405
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,830
But this is a weaponized
pathogen we don't know much about.

406
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,150
Military's still combing through the
remains of the bioweapons lab in sangala,

407
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,050
so we expect to learn
something very soon.

408
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,340
You were able to give me something
that controlled the shaking.

409
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,430
Is there anything that you can give
me that would help me with this?

410
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,810
No. I'm sorry.

411
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,360
Okay. Thank you. Excuse me.

412
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,450
jack,is it all right?

413
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,830
Yeah,um,I'm gonna need to go on record
about everything that happened today.

414
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,870
And we need to do it soon.

415
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,840
I'm not sure how much longer I'm gonna
be le to provide you with the details.

416
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,150
Okay. First,there's something
that you need to know.

417
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,340
What?

418
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,200
It's about kim. She's here,jack.

419
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,440
I told her that you were sick and that she
might be able to help with the treatment.

420
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,590
You did...

421
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,260
you did what? Come here. Come here.

422
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,360
Who the hell do you think you are?

423
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,740
Who the hell do you think you are?

424
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,180
You think this is easy?

425
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,310
You think you understand what I'm
going through? Because you don'T.

426
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,240
I am dying.

427
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,630
And I was okay with
it. I could handle it.

428
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,310
And now you've put in
front of me the one thing,

429
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,870
the one thing that is
gonna make this unbearable.

430
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,860
- Jack,listen...
- no,you listen to me.

431
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,830
I specifically told you do
not drag my daughter into this.

432
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,100
No one dragged her into anything.

433
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,720
She's been trying to see you all day.

434
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,810
What?

435
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,790
She was at the senate
hearing this morning.

436
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,960
She flew out from L.A.To be there,but we
pulled you out before she could see you.

437
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,060
She's been leaving messages
at our office all day.

438
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,720
They just didn't get to me till now.

439
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,270
If you want,I can tell
her that you're not here.

440
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,980
I can tell her that you can't see her.

441
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,220
Can't do that.

442
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,270
- Where is she?
- Down the hall.

443
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,620
Show me.

444
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,650
daddy.

445
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,210
How are you feeling?

446
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,180
I'm-I'm okay.

447
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,370
You're not in any pain?

448
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,060
No.

449
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,550
Come sit down.

450
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,420
Did agent walker tell you
that I was trying to find you?

451
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,700
Yeah.

452
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,160
I've tried everything to track you down:
State department,private investigators.

453
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,770
Every time I got a phone number or
an address,you were already gone.

454
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,620
I'm sorry.

455
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,690
I thought I was doing the best
thing for you by staying away.

456
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,970
Daddy,I've missed you so much.

457
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,500
I've missed you,too.

458
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,820
You need to know how sorry I am for everything
that you've had to live through because of me.

459
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,570
No,don't do that.

460
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,530
Don't put that on yourself. I'm
the one that should apologize.

461
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,000
I pushed you away.

462
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,240
And instead of taking responsibility for all
the mistakes I've made in my life,I blamed you.

463
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,330
And it was stupid and immature.

464
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,790
And now,all the time that we've lost...

465
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,390
agent walker told me that there's
a chance-- a small chance--

466
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,220
that I could help you,and
you don't want me to.

467
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,610
The treatment is experimental.

468
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,170
and I don't think it's going to work.

469
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,860
And you don't want to because
you're afraid to ask me.

470
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,100
No.

471
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,080
There's a risk to you.

472
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,070
A small risk... worth taking.

473
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,720
Not to me.

474
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,550
Kim... I'm dying.

475
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,250
And whatever small chance there
is to stop that from happening--

476
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,860
it is not worth the pain for me to
let you sit there and watch me die.

477
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:14,280
Daddy,I don't want to lose you.

478
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,390
- Come here.
- I don'T.

479
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,540
sweetheart,it's going to be all right.

480
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,000
It's gonna be all right. I promise you.

481
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,130
what is it? what?

482
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,820
sweetheart,I'm sorry...

483
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,360
but you need to go.

484
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,060
Please,baby,please,I'm begging you.

485
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,870
- I love you so much.
- Honey,I love you,too.

486
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,450
Please,baby. thank you. Go.

487
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,600
perimeter 2 to dispatch:
Auxiliary gate 6 is clear.

488
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,360
Copy that,p-2. Hold your position.

489
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,730
Freeze! Show me your hands. Get 'em up!

490
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,640
P-2 to dispatch.

491
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,390
I have an agent down and a
suspect in custody. Code red.

492
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,580
Copy that,p-2.

493
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,310
All available agents
respond to auxiliary gate 6.

494
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,580
Drop the bag.

495
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,240
Hands on the hood.

496
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,930
P-2 to dispatch. Put me through
to agent moss. It's urgent.

497
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,160
agent moss.

498
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,710
Agent moss,this is davis
at auxiliary gate 6.

499
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,860
I have a starkwood op in custody.

500
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,400
He killed one of our agents.

501
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,310
He was carrying a canister of the bioweapon,trying
to smuggle it out using one of our vehicles.

502
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,410
What? Are you sure?

503
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,740
I'm looking at it right now.

504
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,340
Agent davis? Davis?

505
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,060
- walker.
- Renee,we got a breach in the cordon at gate 6.

506
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,610
One of the starkwood ops-- he's
got a canister of the bioweapon.

507
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,380
What?

508
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,770
It was id'd by agent davis,who
I believe has just been shot.

509
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,910
The suspect may be
fleeing in an fbi vehicle,

510
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,600
so I need you to close down all access roads,and
alert perimeter units  and metro police.

511
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,130
- Janis,get me dc metro.
- I'm gonna pursue it from the air.

512
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,970
Let's go! Let us up!

513
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,880
renee,alert homeland,let
them know what's going on.

514
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,750
Are we thinking this
is another attack,larry?

515
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,610
I don't know,but there's enough prion variant in
one of those canisters to take out a small city.

516
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,160
Agent miller,are there any major roadways in our
perimeter that starkwood eratives could have used?

517
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,480
Yes,sir. We're coming up on highway 42.

518
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,890
Should I turn us that way?

519
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,970
Yes,until we get a stronger
directive from agent walker.

520
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,810
Roger that.

521
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,350
Yes,sir. We'll keep homeland
apprised with real-time updates.

522
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,390
Did you access the gps locator system?

523
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,350
Yeah,I'm scanning transponders
for the stolen fbi vehicle.

524
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,160
How long will that take?

525
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,860
As long as it takes for
the satellite to reposition.

526
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,450
When you spoke to larry,you
mentioned an attack?

527
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,710
The starkwood operative we're trying to
find stole a canister of the bioweapon.

528
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,510
I thought tony almeida
destroyed all the weapons.

529
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,470
Apparently not.

530
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,780
how did this operative
get past our perimeter?

531
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,160
Shot and killed two of our agents.

532
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,860
This is it.

533
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,950
The suspect is getting off
highway 42 at smoketree avenue.

534
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,790
He's heading toward
the industrial corridor.

535
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,200
- Put me on the interagency channel.
- Go ahead.

536
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,080
All units,this is agent walker with fbi.

537
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,770
Suspect has exited
highway 42 at smoketree.

538
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,810
He's heading north into
the industrial corridor.

539
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,630
Units in the vicinity,please respond.

540
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,590
Renee,it's me. We're
over smoketree right now.

541
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,510
We're redirecting,and
we'll tighten our pursuit.

542
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,960
Got it. I'll reroute swat
team alpha to the scene.

543
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,090
Swat team alpha,we need to set up a
roadblock at the fairfax county line.

544
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,010
Dc metro's covering the district
line in case he tries to double back.

545
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,350
********

546
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,450
Sir. I have a visual.

547
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,920
Yeah. Got him.

548
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,460
Send us lower.

549
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,010
yeah,he's pulling off the
road. Get us down there now.

550
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,510
renee,it's larry. Suspect is on
foot. We can't wait for backup.

551
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,160
- We're moving in right now.
- All right. Swat team's a few minutes out.

552
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,000
- Careful,larry.
- Yeah.

553
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,050
Remember,suspect has a
canister,so pick your shots.

554
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,870
If possible,let's take him alive.

555
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,050
Yes,sir.

556
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,360
we got to get out of here.
Almeida,cover. Let's go.

557
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,890
Come on!

558
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,620
- relax.
- I'm okay.

559
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,750
Relax.

560
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,220
Tony.

561
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,870
tony! Tony!

562
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,500
what...

563
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm sorry,larry.

564
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,400
god...

565
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,390
let me see it.

566
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,310
How the hell do we get out of here?

567
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,550
I want you to take
this,find a place to hide.

568
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,310
- Wait for my call.
- What about you?

569
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,470
I'm gonna wait on the fbi,figure
out a way to get you out of here. Go!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
