1
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:17,500
CTU is being absorbed by the
Department of Homeland Security,

2
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:21,300
and Christopher Henderson
remains an open protocol.

3
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:22,734
<i>MILES:
Ms. Raines signed
a detailed statement</i>

4
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:25,367
<i>documenting
the numerous missteps</i>

5
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:26,634
made today by CTU,

6
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,534
and by you,
in particular.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,467
<i>CHLOE:
I don't understand,
why am I staying</i>

8
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:31,934
and everybody else
is being let go?

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,667
Because Ms. Raines requested
that you keep your position.

10
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,333
I had to keep Karen
from replacing you,

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,567
that's why
I signed the document,

12
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,300
I didn't have a choice.

13
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:41,634
Why were those men
trying to kill you?

14
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,101
David had a source
inside the White House.

15
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:45,667
Who's the source?

16
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,667
Mrs. Logan's assistant.

17
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:50,034
I have proof about who's behind

18
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,333
everything that's
happened today.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,500
<i>( whispering ):
Someone killed David...</i>

20
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,367
and they just
tried to kill me.

21
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:57,233
I have to go now...
Give me what I need!

22
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,267
They kidnapped
my little girl.

23
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,101
Evelyn.

24
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:05,901
I promise you we're going
to get your daughter back.

25
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:07,400
I already told them

26
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,767
I wouldn't give up
any information

27
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,034
<i>until I have my daughter.</i>

28
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:10,867
<i>JACK ( over radio ):
We need Henderson alive;</i>

29
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:11,934
do not shoot to kill.

30
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,333
Did you bring what we discussed?

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
I have the evidence with me.

32
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:18,367
I want my daughter.

33
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:22,233
She's moving.

34
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,667
Give me the evidence, Evelyn.

35
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:26,367
Now.

36
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:27,367
<i>( gunfire )</i>

37
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:28,567
<i>( screaming )</i>

38
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:29,667
Wayne, I didn't get him--

39
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:31,101
if you got a shot, take it!

40
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>( gunshots )</i>

41
00:01:32,867 --> 00:01:34,233
<i>( tires squealing )</i>

42
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,467
Chloe, it's Jack, Henderson
escaped in Evelyn's car!

43
00:01:36,534 --> 00:01:37,901
Do you have him on satellite?

44
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,467
We can't lose him!

45
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,101
Evelyn's been hit.

46
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,267
JACK:
It's not serious,

47
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,667
but it's gonna
have to be dressed.

48
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:44,901
Evelyn, you've got
your daughter back,

49
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:46,534
now tell me what
I need to know.

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,734
Who is behind this?
Is it the vice president?

51
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:51,500
The vice president
has nothing to do with this!

52
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:54,701
<i>LOGAN ( over phone ):
You promised me you would
control the situation.</i>

53
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:57,901
I didn't count on Jack Bauer
showing up, sir.

54
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,068
Bauer and Wayne Palmer
won't be around long enough

55
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:01,567
to tell anybody else
what they know.

56
00:02:01,634 --> 00:02:06,267
<i>HENDERSON ( over phone ):
I will not let you down.</i>

57
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,001
See that you don't.

58
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,732
<i>WAYNE:
The lanes are cut off.</i>

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,640
Okay, Evelyn, I need
you to stay focused.

60
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:32,706
The recording of the phone call
that you made

61
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,273
between President Logan
and Henderson

62
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,273
is in a safety
deposit box--
which bank?

63
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,574
Which bank?

64
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,607
City Trust and Savings
in Agoura Hills.

65
00:02:41,674 --> 00:02:42,640
Where's the key?

66
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:44,640
My jacket pocket.

67
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,906
Mom?

68
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:47,207
JACK:
It's all right,
sweetheart,

69
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:48,507
your mom's going to be fine.

70
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:50,706
She's going
to be fine, okay?

71
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,839
Jack, you heard
what they said.

72
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:55,273
We have to get off this road,

73
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,340
there are military patrols
everywhere.

74
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:58,973
There's a motel up there
on the right.

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,806
Turn in there.

76
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:02,574
I want to go home.

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,839
We're gonna get
you home, honey.

78
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:05,806
We're gonna get you home.

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,173
Wayne, can you get us a room.

80
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,706
I'll keep watch.

81
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:22,540
Make sure you keep
pressure on the wound,

82
00:03:22,607 --> 00:03:23,674
I'll be right back.

83
00:03:43,073 --> 00:03:44,006
<i>( phone speed dialing )</i>

84
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:45,574
<i>( ringing )</i>

85
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,073
<i>Hello?
JACK ( over phone ):
Audrey, it's Jack.</i>

86
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,706
Have you got Henderson
on satellite yet?

87
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,873
No, Chloe wasn't able
to reposition in time.

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,040
JACK:
Damn it!

89
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,473
Are you still
on a secure line?

90
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,574
Yes. Why,
what's going on?

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Evelyn didn't
implicate Gardner.

92
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,540
She implicated President Logan.

93
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:01,806
Oh, my God, Jack.

94
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,340
Logan? Are you sure?

95
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,674
She said he was responsible for
everything that happened today,

96
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:07,906
starting with providing the
terrorists with the nerve gas.

97
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,607
That's what David Palmer
found out.

98
00:04:09,674 --> 00:04:10,739
That's why
they killed him.

99
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:11,973
Are you saying that
President Logan

100
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,407
ordered Palmer's
assassination?

101
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,507
Henderson gave
the order.

102
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:15,773
But Evelyn says
she has evidence

103
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,407
that shows that President Logan
was complicit.

104
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:19,040
What kind of evidence?

105
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:20,973
She recorded a conversation
earlier this morning

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,440
between Henderson
and President Logan.

107
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,173
She put it in a safety
deposit box in a bank.

108
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
We're on our way
to get it now.

109
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:27,873
Jack, the city is
under martial law.

110
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,273
I know. I need you to upload

111
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,540
every military
checkpoint to my PDA

112
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,173
so we can navigate
our way around them.

113
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,640
All right,
I'll take care of that.

114
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,906
Audrey, as soon as I have
the recording,

115
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,607
we're going to have
to involve your father.

116
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,607
We need someone in the
government, someone credible,

117
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:41,307
to present the evidence.

118
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:43,040
All right.

119
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:45,106
He's on his way back
from a summit in Japan.

120
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:46,340
I'll call him
on the plane.

121
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:47,574
Okay. Make sure
you leave CTU

122
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,674
before you
do anything.

123
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,307
You don't think that
they can be trusted?

124
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,207
Right now,
we can't trust anyone.

125
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:54,240
Logan will have every federal
law enforcement agency,

126
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:55,240
the military,

127
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:56,373
all at his disposal.

128
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,407
And he will use them
to try and stop us.

129
00:04:58,473 --> 00:05:00,739
Don't fill your father in
on the particulars.

130
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:02,173
Just try and
set up the meeting.

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
I'll get back to you

132
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:04,973
as soon as
I have the recording.

133
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,706
All right, I'll upload
those checkpoints.
Yeah.

134
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,674
Wayne?

135
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:11,307
The bank manager
was listed.

136
00:05:11,373 --> 00:05:13,207
That's his address,
he's not far.

137
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:15,373
Good. Let's get them
in the room.

138
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,839
<i>( gently ):
Hey... we need
to get inside now.</i>

139
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,873
Come on, it's okay.

140
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,407
JACK:
Give me your arm.

141
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:30,706
<i>( straining )</i>

142
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,640
You can sit
right here, okay?

143
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:39,574
Okay. Lie down
here on the bed.

144
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,906
<i>( groaning and panting )</i>

145
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,173
JACK:
I'm sorry, but
it's not safe enough

146
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,640
to take you to
a hospital yet.

147
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,273
Let me see,
let me see.

148
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,173
<i>( moaning )</i>

149
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,473
Wayne?

150
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,839
Take Amy outside
for a second.

151
00:06:05,373 --> 00:06:06,373
<i>( groans )</i>

152
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,507
Okay, even though
the bullet went through,

153
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,507
I'm still going to have
to clean out this wound.

154
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:12,973
It's gonna hurt.

155
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,140
But I promise you
I'll get you to a hospital

156
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,140
as soon as I can.

157
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,207
In the meantime,

158
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,340
I'm going to have Wayne
look after you.

159
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,473
No. I'll be fine.

160
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,873
You need to get the evidence.

161
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,973
And you'll need help.

162
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,006
Are you sure?

163
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:26,440
Yeah.

164
00:06:27,574 --> 00:06:30,240
Okay.

165
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:30,706
Keep pressure on it.

166
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,939
Sweetheart, you can
see your mom now.

167
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,606
Give me the car keys.

168
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,239
Let's go.

169
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:51,606
I haven't been able to pick up
Bauer's trail yet.

170
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:53,072
<i>LOGAN ( on phone ):
So he got away.</i>

171
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,139
And there's nothing to stop
him and Wayne Palmer

172
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,872
from going to the media
with everything they know.

173
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,072
Jack knows there's no point
in going public

174
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,172
until he has proof.

175
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,905
He won't make any accusations

176
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,773
until he has
that evidence in his hand.

177
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,439
This evidence, this... this
recording that Evelyn made

178
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:08,439
of our conversation.

179
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:11,306
Are you any closer
to finding out

180
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:12,439
where she's hidden it?

181
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,606
No, sir, not yet.

182
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,806
But she was wounded,
and I will find her;

183
00:07:15,872 --> 00:07:18,172
we're monitoring hospitals,
emergency services.

184
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,072
This is containable,
I promise you.

185
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,072
Please spare me your
promises, Mr. Henderson.

186
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,972
It's all gone wrong.

187
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,439
None of this
should have happened.

188
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:28,139
All these killings...

189
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,872
This whole thing was planned
to make our country safer.

190
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,206
Stronger.

191
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:36,239
To protect our interests.

192
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:38,573
And it all spiraled
out of control

193
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,072
<i>when you decided
to kill David Palmer.</i>

194
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:43,339
Mr. President,
what's done is done.

195
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,972
And right now,
we have to focus
on stopping Bauer

196
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,573
before he finds
that recording.

197
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,306
No.

198
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:51,339
<i>You have to focus on it.</i>

199
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,673
Why haven't the analysts
finished the hourlies?

200
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,339
They're still getting
up to speed on CTU's protocols.

201
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:02,106
We knew this wasn't going
to be a seamless transition.

202
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:05,139
Sometimes I wonder if it
was even a necessary one.

203
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,206
Karen...

204
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,673
CTU's performance
today has been

205
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,306
considerably less
than stellar.

206
00:08:11,373 --> 00:08:12,773
Dozens of people
have been killed.

207
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,005
And they weren't
even able

208
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:15,506
to prevent an attack
on themselves.

209
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:17,872
Do you really believe,
under the circumstances,

210
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,406
that we could have
done any better?

211
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:22,306
CHLOE:
Ms. Hayes?

212
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,206
The president is on line one.

213
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:26,039
Put him through
to Bill Buchanan's office,

214
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,272
I'll be working out of there
from now on.

215
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,206
And have Medical notify me
as soon as Bierko

216
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:30,872
has regained consciousness.

217
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:31,972
Miles.

218
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,039
Yes, Mr. President?

219
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,673
Karen.

220
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,840
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

221
00:08:51,905 --> 00:08:53,005
Not at the moment, sir.

222
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,606
He was due back here
30 minutes ago

223
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:56,239
to lead the Bierko
interrogation.

224
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,573
He's gone off grid.

225
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,172
I'm not surprised.

226
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,539
Karen, I'm issuing
an executive order

227
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,306
for the immediate apprehension
and arrest of Jack Bauer.

228
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:07,139
I want you
to run point on this,

229
00:09:07,206 --> 00:09:09,639
and I want you to make this
CTU's top priority.

230
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:13,239
Yes, sir.

231
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:14,706
For purposes
of the warrant,

232
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:17,840
I'll need to know what
Bauer's being charged with.

233
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:20,439
His role in the assassination
of President David Palmer.

234
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:21,872
But I understood that
he'd been exonerated

235
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,039
of that charge, sir.

236
00:09:23,106 --> 00:09:25,706
You, yourself,
reinstated his credentials.

237
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,773
I know, but I didn't have
all the facts then.

238
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,373
Some new evidence
has come to light.

239
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:31,373
New evidence?

240
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,740
Yes.

241
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:35,072
I'm looking at it right now,

242
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,773
and I will forward it to you
at the appropriate time.

243
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,905
Yes, sir.

244
00:09:39,972 --> 00:09:42,272
Karen.

245
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,373
Obviously, this is
a very sensitive matter,

246
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,306
and for now I would
like you to treat

247
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,840
the origin of this warrant
as confidential.

248
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:50,773
Understood, sir.

249
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,373
Put out an alert
on Jack Bauer

250
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,473
to all federal law enforcement
agencies and NSA.

251
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:01,872
I'll also get military
the warrant--

252
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,773
they have more men
on the street than anyone.

253
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,972
I don't like this.

254
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,639
Pulling our resources off
finding Christopher Henderson

255
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:10,872
to go after Jack Bauer
without knowing the evidence?

256
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,905
It's a direct order
from the president.

257
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:18,706
You know, if we really
want to find Bauer,

258
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:20,972
we need to keep watch on anyone
he might contact for help.

259
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:25,606
Starting with Audrey Raines.

260
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,439
What's this?

261
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,272
Chloe, open it up
and make it look like

262
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,439
this is what
we're talking about.

263
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:39,139
Okay...

264
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,106
Can you get me
a secure channel,

265
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:43,272
so the calls
on my cell phone
can't be monitored?

266
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:44,972
Using a VPN pathway, sure.

267
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,606
Take somebody
about an hour to crack.

268
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:47,639
Why, what's going on?

269
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:49,005
I just spoke
with Jack.

270
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:51,840
Gardner isn't the one
who's behind this.

271
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:53,306
It's President Logan.

272
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:56,039
What?

273
00:10:56,106 --> 00:10:57,339
Jack is on his way
getting proof.

274
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,706
I'm leaving now to go help him.

275
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:00,272
Take a CTU walkie.

276
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:01,740
<i>( computer chimes )
Audrey.</i>

277
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,806
It's a warrant
for Jack's arrest.

278
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:06,806
It's starting.

279
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:07,939
What do we do?

280
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,506
Heading out?

281
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:11,439
Yes, I'm going
to try to grab

282
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:12,639
a couple hours
of sleep.

283
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,673
I came to talk

284
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,072
to both of you
about the warrant.

285
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,972
Well, let's start with
why the hell it was issued.

286
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,106
There's new evidence implicating
Jack in David Palmer's

287
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,272
assassination.
That's ridiculous.

288
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:23,373
I was there when
the assassin confessed.

289
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:24,939
All you have to do is
check the log.

290
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:26,740
I know about the logs, Chloe.

291
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:28,206
My orders are to bring Jack in.

292
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,039
New evidence?

293
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,740
Have you seen it?

294
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,905
It's forthcoming.

295
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:35,639
Who ordered this, Karen?

296
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,172
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

297
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,272
When was the last time
you spoke with Jack?

298
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:40,272
About an hour ago.

299
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:41,573
We haven't had contact since.

300
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,373
I hope I don't have
to remind either one of you

301
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:45,872
that you have
a legal obligation

302
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,139
to notify me
if Jack contacts you.

303
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:51,473
Look, I know this may seem odd
to the both of you--

304
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,439
frankly, it does to me--

305
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,539
but let's remember
it's in everyone's best interest

306
00:11:55,606 --> 00:11:57,106
to bring Jack in peacefully.

307
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,473
Have a good night.

308
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:02,039
Thank you.

309
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:11,506
<i>VALERIE ( over phone ):
Harris.</i>

310
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:12,506
Valerie?

311
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:13,539
Audrey's on her way.

312
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:14,840
What's your status?

313
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:15,773
We're placing
the transponder

314
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,039
on Audrey's car
right now.

315
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,339
<i>HAYES ( on phone ):
Good.</i>

316
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,840
There won't be many cars
on the road,

317
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,506
so use the tracker
and stay out of sight.

318
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:23,606
Will do.

319
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,606
We don't want anything
to stop Audrey

320
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,473
from leading us to Bauer.

321
00:12:40,972 --> 00:12:42,805
That's the house.

322
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:44,405
Okay.

323
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:45,872
What's the bank
manager's name?

324
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,138
Carl Mossman.

325
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,772
You got your gun?

326
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:57,538
Yeah, but we don't need them
for this, do we?

327
00:12:57,605 --> 00:12:59,271
He's not going to let
into his bank

328
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:00,538
in the middle of the night

329
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:01,972
unless he thinks
he has to.

330
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:03,371
Jack, why don't we just try

331
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:04,939
telling him the truth?

332
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,338
Would you believe it? The
only way we're going to have

333
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:08,805
his full compliance
is if he's scared.

334
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,538
If you're uncomfortable with
that, you should stay here.

<i>( grunts )</i>

336
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,438

They've got a magnetic alarm.

<i>MAN ( on TV ):
...that will take place
within the hour.</i>

340
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,872
At that time,
President Logan is scheduled

341
00:14:17,938 --> 00:14:19,938
to make a statement
to the American people

342
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:23,504
about the successful resolution
of today's terrorist threat.

343
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,005
Did you hear
something?

344
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:29,072
Like what?

345
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,638
I don't know.

346
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:35,438
Carl?

347
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:37,504
Hang on.

348
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:40,138
Carl?
I'll be right back.

349
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:49,404
Don't you move.

350
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:53,038
Rose, call
the police...!

Put the phone down.

354
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,339
Put the phone down now!

355
00:15:01,404 --> 00:15:03,371
Bring him in here!

356
00:15:03,438 --> 00:15:06,671
Just stay calm, and
everything will be fine.

357
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:10,339
Oh my God. Carl...

358
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:12,205
Take a seat on the bed.

359
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:14,905
Okay, look, our money
and jewelry's in floor safe

360
00:15:14,972 --> 00:15:16,838
in the closet.
We're not interested in that.

361
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,872
You're gonna get us
into your bank.

362
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:20,872
<i>( panting )</i>

363
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:22,638
I can't do that.

It's not that I won't. I can't.

365
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,972
The alarm system and the vault
only allow entry

366
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:30,905
during business hours.
Don't lie to me.

367
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,339
Every bank has
procedures

368
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:34,471
to allow access
during an emergency.

369
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:37,705
Hey! No, no!

370
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,605
I'll take you
to the bank.

00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:45,471
get up, get dressed.

374

I want four

376
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:01,872
Tie her up
to the chair.

377
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:04,404
Ankles and wrists. Make
sure she doesn't move.

378
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:16,005
Come on.
Yes, hi. This is Audrey Raines.

379
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:18,138
I need to speak
with Secretary Heller, please.

380
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:27,305
Mr. Secretary, there's
a call coming in for you

381
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:29,105
on an over-air
encrypted channel.

382
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,205
It's your daughter.

383
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,838
Audrey, is everything okay?

384
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,872
Hi. Uh, yes, I'm okay.

385
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,072
Dad, I need your help.

386
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:40,371
Is this a secure line?

387
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:41,738
Very secure.

388
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:43,838
Is this about the arrest order
for Jack?

389
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,571
I was just informed.

390
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,638
Dad, I can't go into details
right now, but Jack is innocent.

391
00:16:48,705 --> 00:16:49,705
He's being set up.

392
00:16:49,771 --> 00:16:51,339
Set up by whom?

393
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:55,471
What the hell
is going on, Audrey?

394
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:58,638
You call me this morning,
to tell me that Jack's alive.

395
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:00,638
Now I get word
he's a suspect again

396
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,172
in the Palmer
assassination.

397
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:04,504
Dad, I can't talk to you
about it right now.

398
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:06,205
I need to see you
in person.

399
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:09,205
Can you reroute your plane
to Los Angeles?

400
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:11,371
Dad, I would never ask you
to do this

401
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,038
if it wasn't
extremely important.

402
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,972
All right, yes.

403
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,504
Thank you.

404
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,371
The closest airport is Van Nuys.

405
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:28,005
We're about an hour out.

406
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:29,471
I'll call you on final approach.

407
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,305
Okay. Thank you.
I'll see you there.

408
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:32,438
I'll see you.

409
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:33,605
Bye.

410
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:38,438
Doug!

411
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:42,172
Yes, sir.

412
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:45,205
We have to make a stop in L.A.

413
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,305
And keep it off the manifest.

414
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:48,771
Yes, sir.

415
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,438
Pull over.

416
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:07,105
She stopped.

417
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,105
Corner of Alderton

418
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,638
and Davis.

419
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,695
It's a gas station.

420
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:14,829
CHLOE:

00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,562
Hold on.

423
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:21,162
Okay, switched over
to my own VPN. Now they can't

424
00:18:21,229 --> 00:18:22,461
monitor either end
of the conversation.

425
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:24,361
Do you have the walkie?
Yeah. Hang on.

426
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,562
All right, what
do I do with it?

427
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:29,595
Tune to proprietary
channel 17,

428
00:18:29,662 --> 00:18:31,461
turn the sensitivity
up all the way.

429
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,495
See if you pick up
a pilot signal.

430
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:35,361
Okay, hold on.

Wow. Do you hear that?

00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,029
That's what I figured--
they put a tracker on you.

434
00:18:45,395 --> 00:18:47,829
I found it. All right, Chloe,
I got it. Thank you.

435
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:50,095
Audrey, you need
to disable your phone

436
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,395
by taking the battery out
as soon as you can.

437
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:53,895
All right,
I have to wait

438
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:55,929
for a call from Jack
and then I will.
Okay.

439

Sir, it's almost time.

442
00:19:39,162 --> 00:19:41,829
Yes.

443

The press conference.

That's right.

445
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:46,995
Mr. President,

446
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,528
if I could
have a moment...

447
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:50,095
Uh, I should be done

448
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:51,328
with my statement
shortly, Hal.

449
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:52,795
This is potentially
time sensitive, sir.

450
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,595
I just got an alert
that a warrant

451
00:19:54,662 --> 00:19:56,296
has been issued for Jack Bauer.

452
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,461
Thank you, Aaron.

453
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:03,795
Yes, sir.

454
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,795
What about the warrant?

455
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:11,395
Well, it's an executive
branch warrant.

456
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,795
I didn't issue it, so it
must have come from you.

457
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:15,262
That's right, it came from me.

458
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:16,995
Well, as you've
put me in charge

459
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,229
of overseeing CTU and the
Homeland Security transfer,

460
00:20:19,296 --> 00:20:21,428
don't you think
you should have discussed it

461
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:23,795
with me first?

462
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:25,562
I appreciate everything
you've done today, Hal,

463
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:29,962
<i>but the last time I checked,
I was still Commander in Chief.</i>

464
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,029
Of course, Mr. President,
but Jack Bauer?

465
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:34,829
It doesn't
make any sense.

466
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:37,428
We should be treating
that man like a hero.

467
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:38,762
I've gone over the logs.

468
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:40,162
Walt Cummings has confessed

469
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,728
that he arranged Palmer's
assassination, framing Bauer.

470
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,328
Well, clearly,

471
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:46,829
Cummings was protecting Bauer.

472
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:49,461
Why?
I don't know why.

473
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:51,795
But the fact remains
I have received confirmation

474
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:53,628
from Intelligence sources

475
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:56,229
that Jack Bauer was,
without question, the shooter.

476
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,262
Which sources?
That's enough!

477
00:20:58,328 --> 00:21:00,995
I'm not going to stand here
and have my orders challenged.

478
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:04,495
You have concerns, Hal.

479
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:06,528
We'll sort this all out

480
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,262
once Bauer's in custody.

481
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:09,862
Does that suit you?

482
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,662
Yes, sir.

483
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,728
Good.

484
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:19,361

LOGAN:
My fellow Americans, it is with
great relief that I announce

512
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:34,662
that the terrorist threat
our nation faced today is over.

513
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:37,562
More than an hour ago, federal
counter-terrorist agents,

514
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:38,862
under my direction,

515
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:41,628
thwarted the latest attack
on innocent civilians,

516
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:45,929
the nature of which was kept
secret due to national security.

517
00:23:45,996 --> 00:23:49,929
This was done with the public's
best interest in mind.

518
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:51,695

He stopped the terrorists,
the treaty was signed.

522
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:02,929
He said he would
ride out this crisis,

523
00:24:02,996 --> 00:24:03,929
and everything
would be okay.

524

And it is.

Yes, ma'am.

Jack, why are we
stopping here?

531

There's too many military

00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:01,695
Jack, are you aware
President Logan's

541
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:03,762
issued a warrant for your arrest
for your role

542
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:04,795
in David Palmer's assassination?

543
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,396
No, but that makes sense.

544
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,429
The Vice President's not the one
who's behind this, is he?

545
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:11,695
No, it's Logan.

546
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,628
They're going to have
every agency

547
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:14,862
and the military
looking for you.

548
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,162
And Logan is the only one
who can call them off.

549
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:18,762
As soon as we have
the evidence in hand,

550
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:20,829
We're gonna pass it off
to Secretary of Defense Heller.

551
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,196
After that,
it's not gonna matter.

552
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:24,196
Is there anything I
can do for you, Jack?

553
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:26,129
Keep your eyes open
and watch your back.

WOMAN:
Ms. Hayes, Valerie Harris
is on line two for you.

563
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,729
She says it's urgent.

564
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:15,762
Valerie, what's happening?

565
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:18,595
We lost Audrey Raines.
What?

566
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,196
She found the tracker
and transferred it

567
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:22,196
to a DWP truck
at a gas station.

568
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:24,329
Damn it. How did
she find it?

569
00:26:24,396 --> 00:26:25,962
She's got
no field experience.
I don't know.

570
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:27,329
The only reason
we discovered it

571
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,463
is the DWP guy stopped to
check a faulty power line.

572
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:31,762
All right, hold your position

573
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:33,062
and wait for my instructions.

574
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:34,363
Will do.

575
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,162
MILES:
Papazian.

576
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,129
Audrey Raines
ditched her transponder.

577
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:42,795
I need you to redirect satellite
surveillance and track her.

578
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,962
I can redirect CalTrans
and maybe one SAT-LINK,

579
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:47,729
but the rest are dedicated
to finding Bauer.

580
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:50,296
Following Audrey should lead us
right to Bauer.

581
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,996
Just get it done and tell me

582
00:26:52,062 --> 00:26:53,396
when you've got something.
I'm on it.

583
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:08,296
Against the wall.

584
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:10,229
Watch him.

585
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,929
Just do what he says, Carl.

586
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:14,729
Do what he says and you'll
be home before you know it.
Right.

587
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:22,862
What's the emergency procedure

588
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:24,396
to enter the bank?
I have 30 seconds

589
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:25,895
to put my key in
the alarm panel,

590
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:27,129
then I enter my code.

591
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,762
You enter the wrong code
and alert the police,

592
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,096
all I have to do is make

593
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:31,296
one call, your wife is dead.

594
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:32,628
You understand me?
Yes.

595
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:33,762
Let's go.

596
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,130
Where's the vault?

597
00:28:04,197 --> 00:28:07,130
Take us around the back,
stay away from the windows.

598
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:20,796
How do I open it?

599
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:23,130
There's a 12-digit code, but
it's a timed unlock procedure,

600
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:24,563
which allows enough
time for the police

601
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:25,830
to arrive in the event

602
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:28,096
that someone should
trigger the silent alarm.

603
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,663
Write the code down for me.

604
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:41,163
Take him over to one of
the desks, keep an eye on him.

605
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,796
I know you.

606
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:52,896
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

607
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:54,796
You're David Palmer's brother.

608
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,996
I saw you on TV
this morning.

609
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,362
You were there when he was shot.

610
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:01,429
Now, what the hell
are you doing in my bank?

611
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,796
And who is he?

612
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,462
Listen, I know it's
absurd to ask you

613
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:07,263
to trust me under
these circumstances,

614
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,396
but believe me,
you don't want to know.

615
00:29:09,462 --> 00:29:10,729
Oh, come on.

616
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:13,063
You threaten me with a gun,
you kidnap me,

617
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,329
you're robbing my bank.

618
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:17,163
Now, I deserve to know
what the hell is going on here.

619
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:22,696
Fine.

620
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:24,429
Jack and I believe
there's evidence inside

621
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,729
of one of your safety deposit
boxes that's gonna prove

622
00:29:26,796 --> 00:29:28,696
who was behind the assassination
of my brother, okay?

623
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:32,329
JACK:
Wayne.

624
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,462
What's going on?

625
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,329
What do you want
me to say, Jack?

626
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:42,263
He recognized me.
It's all right.

627
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:43,529
Mr. Mossman,

628
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:45,362
how long is the delay
before the vault opens?

629
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:46,830
Five minutes.

630
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:49,197
Is that true what he said?
Is that why you two are here?

631
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:50,596
Yes.

632
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:54,230
Why didn't you just wait
till morning, get a subpoena?

633
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:56,696
The people that are behind this
will never let it go that far.

634
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,396
They've already tried to kill me

00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,830
You did?

647
00:30:44,897 --> 00:30:46,363
Well, that's good.

648
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,696
I'm glad.

649
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:50,530
I'll get back to you.

650
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:52,762
I thought
you went to bed.

651
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:54,461
No.

652
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:58,261
I, uh, watched you
with the press.

653
00:30:58,328 --> 00:31:01,595
Well, um, that was Morry,

654
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,395
and he thought
it went pretty well.

655
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,461
Good.

656
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:07,962
But that doesn't
begin to describe it.

657
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:10,295
Charles, you have had
to deal with

658
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:12,628
more crisis today
than any president

659
00:31:12,695 --> 00:31:15,295
in an entire term.

660
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:16,461
You...

661
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:19,395
were magnificent.

662
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:22,695
Magnificent.

663
00:31:22,762 --> 00:31:25,628
Well, I like the sound of that.

664
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:28,228
Especially coming from you.

665
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:33,061
I'm so proud of you.

666
00:31:33,128 --> 00:31:36,628
I hope I haven't embarrassed you
too much as your First Lady.

667
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:37,828
Stop. No.

668
00:31:37,895 --> 00:31:38,828
Don't be ridiculous.

669
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:39,862
I mean,

670
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:41,562
you walked up to the
edge a couple times,

671
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:42,628
but nobody noticed.

672
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:47,328
I'll try to find a compliment
in there somewhere.

673
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:50,161
I'm sorry, Marty.

674
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:51,361
I didn't...

675
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:03,194
Wow.

676
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:04,962
I was so selfish today.

677
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,962
No.

678
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,395
You had so much
on your plate,

679
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:09,295
you didn't need me
piling more on.

680
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,295
No, I...

681
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,595
Please don't
say anything.

682
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:14,795
Just accept my apology.

683
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:16,128
I do.

684
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:18,995
I do, I accept
your apology.

I have to take this privately.

00:32:30,895 --> 00:32:32,094
Who is it?
Now, what difference

688
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:33,428
does it make?
Please, Marty.

689
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,128
I thought the crisis was over.

Yes.

693
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:48,395
We know where Bauer is.

694
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:49,828
Evelyn gave him up.

695
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:52,194
Well, then take care of it.

696
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,495
My men are heading there now.

697
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:55,562
Good.

698
00:32:55,628 --> 00:32:58,228
Let me know when it's done.

I'm sorry, honey.

700
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:08,228
I guess I haven't gotten used
to the idea that...

701
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,461
that the crisis is over.

702
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:11,962
When what's done?

703
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:13,595
What?
You just said,

704
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:14,862
"Let me know when it's done."

705
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:16,895
Oh, that was Jamey.

706
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,128
I asked her to write me
a radio speech

707
00:33:19,194 --> 00:33:20,695
for tomorrow morning.

708
00:33:26,962 --> 00:33:28,728
We found Audrey Raines.

709
00:33:28,795 --> 00:33:29,929
Where?

710
00:33:29,995 --> 00:33:31,828
She's heading north
toward Mulholland.

711
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:33,428
Connect me with Harris.

712
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,628
<i>( phone rings )</i>

713
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:39,895
Harris.

714
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:41,929
Valerie,
we have a fix on Raines.

715
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:43,795
She's heading
toward the Sepulveda Pass,

716
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:45,061
coming up on Mulholland.

717
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:47,029
Copy that.

00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:03,495
Chloe?

721
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:04,895
Do you have a minute?

722
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:07,194
No.

723
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:09,061
What is it?

724
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:11,361
I was assigned to
log all satellite

725
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:12,762
and ground video activity,

726
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:14,528
but part of the vector
is locked out.

727
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,595
Locked out?
What do you mean?

728
00:34:16,662 --> 00:34:19,029
I mean, someone's
taken control of one

729
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:20,395
of the satellites
using a class one

730
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:21,962
priority override.

731
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:23,295
Do you know anything about it?

732
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,328
No.

733
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,862
I'll look into it.
Thanks.

<i>( sighs )</i>

737
00:35:07,029 --> 00:35:08,194
The perimeter is secure.

Do you have a visual?

739
00:35:09,762 --> 00:35:12,029
I did, briefly.
All right, listen.

740
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:14,828
You tell your men the instant,
and I mean the instant

741
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,962
that Bauer steps outside
that bank building

742
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:18,361
you take him down.

743
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:20,528
Then, kill the others
and secure the recording.

Twenty-three.

MOSSMAN:
Mr. Palmer,

748
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:33,728
I admired your brother
a great deal.

749
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:34,795
He was a great man.

750
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:35,862
Thank you.

751
00:35:40,194 --> 00:35:42,094
<i>HENDERSON ( on tape ):
It had to be done, sir.</i>

752
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,161
LOGAN:
I decide what needs to
be done, Mr. Henderson.

753
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:47,228
I never authorized you
to kill David Palmer.

754
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,461
Palmer was nosing around.

755
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:50,029
He'd have found out
about your involvement.

756
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:51,828
For God's sake, sir,
he called your wife.

757
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:54,795
I can handle my wife.

758
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,695
Right now, my concern
is keeping this operation

759
00:35:56,762 --> 00:35:58,562
from collapsing
like a house of cards.

760
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:00,328
You're protected, sir.
That's president Logan's voice.

761
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:01,395
Every thread ends
with Cummings.

762
00:36:01,461 --> 00:36:02,562
He thinks he's running this,

763
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,428
And you need
to keep playing it that way.

764
00:36:05,495 --> 00:36:07,662
I know my part,
Mr. Henderson.

765
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:09,395
You just do
as you're told.

766
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,395
Oh, my God.
We got what we need.

767
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,862
Mr. Mossman,

768
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:14,428
I'm sorry we put you
and your wife through this.

769
00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:16,194
It'll be safer for
you to stay here now.

770
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,495
Could you please
let us out?
Like to help if I can.

771
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:20,728
I've come this far.
We're gonna need
to borrow your car

772
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,128
a little longer.

773
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:23,228
MOSSMAN:
Sure, it's insured.

774
00:36:23,295 --> 00:36:24,595
Wait. There's someone inside.

775
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:27,261
Mr. Mossman, get
back in the vault now.

776
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:30,361
Is there any other way out
of here besides the front door?

777
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:31,862
No, front door only--
security reasons.

778
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:33,395
Damn it.

779
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:34,662
Both of you stay here.

780
00:36:34,728 --> 00:36:36,762
I'll be right back.

781
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,929
Henderson's men
are taking up positions.

782
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:13,962
There's no other way out-- we're
gonna have to turn ourselves in.

783
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:17,161
They didn't come here to arrest
us; they came here to kill us.

784
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:18,762
What are they
waiting for?

785
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:19,962
All the windows
are bulletproof.

786
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,128
They're waiting for us
to leave the building.

787
00:37:21,194 --> 00:37:23,061
So what are you gonna do?

788
00:37:23,128 --> 00:37:25,728
How do you trip
the silent alarm?

789
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:28,628
I have a key, but you trip
that alarm, LAPD

790
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:30,228
will be here
within a few minutes.

791
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:31,895
That's exactly what I want.

792
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:33,461
Henderson's men
outnumber us.

793
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:35,495
We leave this building now,
we lose.
Jack, if you call the cops,

794
00:37:35,562 --> 00:37:37,094
they're gonna get the recording
when we're taken into custody.

795
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:38,728
We won't be taken into custody.

796
00:37:38,795 --> 00:37:41,562
As soon as Henderson finds out
the LAPD have arrived,

797
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:43,261
he's gonna have his men
engage them.

798
00:37:43,328 --> 00:37:45,194
He doesn't want the police
to have the recording any more

799
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:47,962
than he wants us to have it.
So they start shooting
at each other.

800
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:50,428
How does that
help us?
We have to try
and use that as a diversion.

801
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:51,929
It's our only way out.

802
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:57,361
Trigger the alarm.

803
00:37:57,361 --> 00:38:02,361
Be right back.

804
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:30,218
Valerie.

805
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:32,251
The feed should be coming
through to your laptop now.

806
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:34,551
I've got her.

807
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:35,951
She's heading west on Chandler.

808
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:37,334
How close are you
to Audrey's car?

809
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,568
About two miles.

810
00:38:38,634 --> 00:38:39,834
Close the gap to one mile.

811
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,067
Affirmative.

812
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,434
Something's wrong.

813
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:55,901
The feed's breaking up.

814
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,634
We're experiencing
the same difficulty

815
00:38:58,701 --> 00:39:00,001
with our signal--
hold on.

816
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:03,367
What's going on?
I don't know.

817
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:06,401
The satellite's
positioned correctly.

818
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,467
I'm tracing
the corruption.

819
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:13,734
It's the server.

820
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:17,001
What is it?

821
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,234
O'Brian's gone.

822
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:47,734
* *

823
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:01,100
What were you doing?

824
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,467
What?

825
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,634
What were you doing?

826
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:06,367
Are you kidding?

827
00:40:06,434 --> 00:40:09,968
If you really want the details,
I'll write you a report.

828
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,100
Let's go, now.

829
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:34,801
MOSSMAN:
The police should be here
any minute.

830
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,067
Mr. Mossman, like I said before,

831
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,734
it might be safer
for you to stay

832
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:38,734
here in the bank.

833
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:40,134
No, these guys find me,

834
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,334
they assume I know
about the recording,

835
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,001
they'd probably
kill me, right?

836
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,734
I'll take my chances with you.

837
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:53,100
I want you to stay as close
to Mr. Palmer as you can.

838
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:54,768
I'll provide cover fire.

839
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,801
Once we leave the bank,
you break left.

840
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,001
Yes, sir.
Cooper, what's your status?

841
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,834
No change,
they still haven't come out.

842
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:04,501
Must have seen you, damn it.

843
00:41:04,568 --> 00:41:05,901
Tell your men to move in
immediately.

844
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:09,267
The cops are here.

845
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,634
We can't let them have Bauer;
take 'em down.

846
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:12,834
Yes, sir.

847
00:41:14,035 --> 00:41:16,434
This is LAPD!

848
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:17,801
Drop your weapons!

849
00:41:17,868 --> 00:41:18,968
Engage! Engage!

850
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:20,801
<i>( heavy gunfire )</i>

851
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,134
Let's go.

852
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,935
<i>( heavy gunfire continues )</i>

853
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:43,668
<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

854
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:46,534
<i>( rapid gunfire )</i>

855
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:51,401
Need to go
to the police car now-- move!

856
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,701
<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

857
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:00,067
JACK:
He's been hit!

858
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:06,834
<i>( tires screeching )
( bullets ricocheting )</i>

859
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:09,200
<i>( heavy gunfire continues )</i>

860
00:42:28,668 --> 00:42:30,467
How is he doing?

861
00:42:30,534 --> 00:42:32,267
He's dead.

862
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:35,267
Damn it.

863
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:37,001
<i>( phone rings )</i>

864
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,434
Jack, where are you?

865
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:39,668
I'm on my way to you.

866
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:40,901
Did your father agree to meet?

867
00:42:40,968 --> 00:42:42,467
Yes, he's landing
at Van Nuys Airport

868
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:43,568
in about 15 minutes.

869
00:42:43,634 --> 00:42:45,100
I'm there now.

870
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,200
Good, we got the evidence.

871
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:48,367
Have you listened to it?

872
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:50,734
Yeah, there's no doubt
it's Logan.

873
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,200
You understand what this means.

874
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:54,501
We're talking about taking down

875
00:42:54,568 --> 00:42:57,234
the President
of the United States.
