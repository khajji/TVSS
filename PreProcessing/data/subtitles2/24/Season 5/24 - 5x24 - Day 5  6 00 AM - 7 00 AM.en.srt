1
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,901
Coordinates for the targets--

2
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,101
 <i>upload them into the missiles.</i>

3
00:00:17,168 --> 00:00:18,201
Begin the
launch countdown.

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,634
How much time
do you need to cancel

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,168
the launch sequence?
I won't know for
certain till I see

6
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:22,600
how the targeting
software is configured.

7
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,467
We're going to keep Bierko
and his men out of here,

8
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:25,934
so you can finish this.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,934
CHLOE:
 <i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,034
It's done.

11
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,567
( <i>over radio</i> ):
The launch sequence is canceled.

12
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:40,767
You were never really
going to let me go, were you?

13
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:43,001
 JACK:
 <i>No.</i>

14
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:45,934
You were responsible
for the deaths

15
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,001
of David Palmer
and Tony Almeida

16
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:50,534
and Michelle Dessler.

17
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,467
I'm going after Logan.

18
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,600
What do you mean,
"going after Logan"?

19
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,534
 <i>I'll fill you in</i>
 <i>on the details later.</i>

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,934
Right now, I need you
to walk me through

21
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,834
modifying some field
communications equipment.

22
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:04,201
Who is this guy?
Morris O'Brian,
Chloe's ex-husband.

23
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:06,467
I need some com unit
modifications.

24
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:07,867
Can you do that
without talking?

25
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,667
I could, but it would be
a terrible waste of my charm.

26
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:12,567
Jack Bauer's on
his way here now.

27
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:15,201
 <i>He's going to confront</i>
 <i>your husband directly.</i>

28
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,700
But Charles is leaving
for the airfield immediately.

29
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:20,901
You have to find
a way to stall him.

30
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:23,433
There's a helicopter
waiting for me.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,333
Let it wait.
I can't.

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,367
Yes, you can.

33
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:29,600
You're the president.

34
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,067
Aaron said
the recording you had

35
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,201
implicating the president
was destroyed.

36
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:36,700
Yes.

37
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,367
NOVICK:
 <i>Without it, you can't</i>
 <i>mount a case.</i>

38
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,834
I'm working with someone
inside CTU.

39
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,333
They're setting up
a digital uplink.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,567
If I can get Logan
to acknowledge

41
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:43,801
everything that he's done today,

42
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:45,201
it's going to be
all the evidence we need.

43
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:47,268
 <i>I need to get on that chopper.</i>

44
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,834
PIERCE:
 <i>I don't see how that's</i>
 <i>gonna be possible.</i>

45
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,433
If Logan doesn't confess,

46
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,567
how far are you actually
willing to go?

47
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,834
As far as I have to.

48
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,467
Ah...

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,901
Here, let me get
this for you.

50
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,901
Watch your hair.

51
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:20,567
Thank you.

52
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,767
You're welcome.

53
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,001
I got a flight suit.

54
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,567
Go ahead.

55
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:37,867
Did you make it to the
Secret Service outbuilding?

56
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:38,934
Yeah.

57
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,433
I think Morris and I
may have a way

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,700
to pull the copilot
from the flight.

59
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,534
What about the
reassignment protocol?

60
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,801
Working on it.

61
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:47,067
Mike Novick will have
to verify the pilot codes.

62
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,534
It should take him
about one minute.

63
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,567
Chloe, hold on
a second.

64
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:51,001
I'm switching over
to com.
Okay.

65
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:54,467
Do you copy?

66
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:55,967
Yeah.

67
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:58,333
I'll get back to you as soon
as I'm on the chopper.

68
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Mike Novick's
going to call.

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,433
Morris.

70
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,234
Yes, sweetheart?

71
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,467
I need you to do
one more thing.

72
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,134
Some guy from Central
just called.

73
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:17,168
Says your packet's
messed up.

74
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,534
I got that
straightened out Monday.

75
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,667
I guess not.

76
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,134
He wants to
talk to you.
Now?

77
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,834
Right now. He had
me patch you through

78
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,734
to the Secret
Service outbuilding.

79
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,367
Mike.

80
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,934
I've delayed him
as long as I can.

81
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:47,168
He'll be there in a few minutes.

82
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:48,767
Have you heard anything
from Jack Bauer yet?

83
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,134
He should be in
the Secret Service

84
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,500
outbuilding. I'm sending him
the necessary documents now.

85
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,134
There's not much time.

86
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,400
I understand.

87
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:08,667
PIERCE:
Yeah, Mike.
The reassignment protocol

88
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,801
and authorization
should be coming through to you.

89
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,934
He'll need both.

90
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,268
How are we
doing for time?

91
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,333
Hurry.

92
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,634
Hello.

93
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,767
Hello.

94
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,268
John.

95
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,667
Aaron.

96
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,700
I thought you transferred out.

97
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:45,934
Not quite yet.

98
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,201
Some guy from
Central called,

99
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:48,834
said my packet's
all messed...

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,433
Don't worry
about him.

101
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,534
Carruth has been relieved.

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,500
I guess there was something
wrong with his packet.

103
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,767
Ron Franklin.

104
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,268
There's my protocol.

105
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,400
This is not bad,

106
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,534
but it needs to
be more positive,

107
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,734
like, uh...

108
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,967
Jack Bauer is
on the helicopter.

109
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,634
You have to find an excuse

110
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,734
not to get on board.

111
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:23,801
LOGAN:
Um... Carolyn, do you
have the itinerary?

112
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,067
MARTHA:
Charles?

113
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,300
Excuse me. Could
I talk to you

114
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,268
for a second?
Absolutely.

115
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,734
Will you excuse us
for a second?

116
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:35,168
I know it sounds silly,

117
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:36,433
but I didn't bring
my medication.

118
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,700
and I just, I just want
to have it with me.

119
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:39,934
Of course. Of course.
We'll send

120
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:41,400
somebody
back for it.
No, no, no. 

121
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,034
I don't want to delay you.

122
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,500
I'll be along later.
Besides, Charles,

123
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,901
I-I'm thinking that
when you land,

124
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:47,901
it would be better

125
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:48,901
if I wasn't with you.

126
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:49,834
Why?

127
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,467
This is <i>your</i> moment, Charles.

128
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:54,367
I-I think that...

129
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,967
when you step out
of that helicopter alone,

130
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:59,367
after saving the country,

131
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:03,634
that is an image that
history will never forget.

132
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:13,901
All right.

133
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,934
Thank you, Marti.

134
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:20,567
But don't be 

135
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:21,600
far behind me, now.

136
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:22,834
I won't.

137
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:37,300
Thank you.

138
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:15,433
Captain.

139
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:21,101
 I can fly this thing
if I have to,

140
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,700
 which leaves you
with one of two choices.

141
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,567
You either do what I say and you
live, or you don't

142
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:28,934
and you die for nothing.
You understand me?

143
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:32,600
I want you to wait until
I give you my command, then

144
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,834
follow these
instructions slowly.

145
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:36,567
You're going to disconnect
your helmet from

146
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:38,067
the communications system.
Then I want you

147
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:39,300
to rip out the mic cable,

148
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:41,767
take your helmet off
and stow it.

149
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:46,467
Do it now.

150
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,433
I'll know if you deviate
from your flight plan.

151
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,001
Mr. President!

152
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,300
I have a message for you
from the White House!

153
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,001
LOGAN:
What the hell are you doing?!

154
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,034
Put these on!

155
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:14,367
You.

156
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,534
This is Jack.
Do you copy?

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,634
I'm here, Jack.
Where are you?

158
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,534
We just left the ranch.
I have Logan with me.

159
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,367
Is Morris standing by
with the equipment?

160
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,300
He's on his way. I'll
let him know you're airborne.

161
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,834
Make sure the pilot
takes heading 2-8-6

162
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,268
for two miles,
then breaks south.

163
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,300
Captain!

164
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,168
I want you to follow
heading 2-8-6

165
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,134
for two miles,
then break south.

166
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:37,467
Once you break south, there
should be an industrial park.

167
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,967
There's an abandoned
printing press facility

168
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:40,001
that you can use.

169
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:41,067
I'll get back to you.

170
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:44,067
Copy that.

171
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:46,534
What are you
trying to do, Jack?

172
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
Whatever it is,
you know you won't

173
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:52,600
get away with it.

174
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,767
Are you going to kill me?

175
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,700
I suppose you want
some sort of revenge.

176
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:05,500
I understand that.

177
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,467
Bad things happened.

178
00:10:07,534 --> 00:10:09,268
I didn't want them to happen.

179
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,234
People who worked for me--
they-they went too far.

180
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,534
They did things
that they thought

181
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,001
I wanted them to do,
but they were wrong.

182
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,500
You have to understand.

183
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:20,901
I have always

184
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:24,201
acted in the country's
best interest.

185
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:26,367
But you're just trying
to get even.

186
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:28,767
Do you realize

187
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,333
what effect this will have
on the American people?

188
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,967
This day has been trying enough,

189
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,834
and now the President
is being attacked.

190
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,767
If you want
to do what's right,

191
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,067
you will turn this
thing around and go back.

192
00:10:46,268 --> 00:10:49,234
Damn it, Bauer, say something!

193
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:53,567
Hello.

194
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:54,567
Morris.

195
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:55,867
Yes, love.

196
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,734
The helicopter is landing
in an industrial park

197
00:10:57,801 --> 00:10:59,734
one mile due east
of where you are.

198
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,367
Head over there.

199
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:03,700
Okay, now, I give this guy
what we worked on,

200
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:04,967
and then I'm out, right?

201
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,067
Yes, but make sure
you have him call me

202
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,500
when you do
the hand-off.

203
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,801
All right.
Thanks.

204
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:19,867
Shut it down!

205
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:31,101
Your safety belt.

206
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:35,101
Move towards the door slowly.

207
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,134
Come on. Move!

208
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,567
Come on.

209
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,700
Move inside. Go.

210
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:21,567
Jack, maybe we can work
something out.

211
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:22,567
There's still time.

212
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:24,667
What do you want?

213
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:26,367
I can help you
get away from here

214
00:12:26,433 --> 00:12:28,134
with enough money
to start a new life,

215
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:30,433
maybe find that daughter
of yours.

216
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,400
Try to work something out.

217
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:36,134
Whatever you want,
it's yours.

218
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,400
You have my word.

219
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:39,067
Your word.

220
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,134
Jack, I'm the President
of the United States.

221
00:12:42,201 --> 00:12:45,268
I'm not, I'm not
carrying any weapons.

222
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:12,567
Don't you make a sound.

223
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:24,967
Hey.

224
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,134
Give me the case.

225
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,534
Jack Bauer.

226
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,567
I should have known that.

227
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,567
Modified equipment.

228
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:39,067
Yeah.

229
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:45,333
Oh, that's President Logan,
Jack.

230
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,367
Get out of here.

231
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,500
Yeah.
Chloe wants you to call her.

232
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,067
Go.

233
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:58,934
Yeah, Jack?

234
00:13:59,001 --> 00:13:59,934
I have him.

235
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,134
All right.

236
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:02,634
I've just checked
the response deployment.

237
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,101
You have less than ten minutes
until they're on you.

238
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:06,134
Fine.

239
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:07,801
Listen, Jack.

240
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,901
I don't mean to put
any added pressure on you,

241
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,767
but if you don't have
a confession by then,

242
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,268
we'll all be arrested
for treason.

243
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,723
Is this some kind
of broadcast?

244
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,224
What is this?

245
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,090
I would like to know.
Is this an assassination?

246
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:40,790
A confession.

247
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:43,391
Don't count on it.

248
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:47,257
I know you're good
at extracting information.

249
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:48,990
I know that you're good
at torture.

250
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:50,790
I saw what you did
with Walt Cummings.

251
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,924
I think you'll be
surprised to find out

252
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,224
that I'm a little tougher
than that.

253
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,257
Take a seat.

254
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,624
Chloe, it's Jack.
Can you hear me?

255
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,790
Yeah, Jack.

256
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:02,857
I want to make sure that
you have good reception.

257
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:05,057
Who you talking to?
Are those your
friends at CTU?

258
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:09,157
You know you're putting them
in danger, as well.

259
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,524
Coming through
fine, Jack.

260
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,690
Okay, good.

261
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:13,790
My people can't be
far behind, Jack.

262
00:15:15,823 --> 00:15:18,757
There's still time to get away.
Take it.

263
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:22,424
The plan involving the Sentox
nerve gas,

264
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:25,790
it was designed
to fool the terrorists
and the Russians.

265
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,291
Whether or not you formulated
the plan is irrelevant.

266
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:29,957
You authorized it.
You're delusional.

267
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:32,723
David Palmer uncovered
evidence of this plan.

268
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,924
When he started
asking questions,
he was assassinated.

269
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,090
Other people were killed
to cover that murder up.

270
00:15:38,157 --> 00:15:40,690
Men and women who served this
country with distinction;

271
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:42,291
people that I worked with;
friends of mine.

272
00:15:42,357 --> 00:15:43,624
No, you're wrong.

273
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,090
This is all a pack of lies.

274
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:46,757
The terrorists discovered
your deception.

275
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:50,890
And they deployed
Sentox nerve gas
on American soil.

276
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,291
Every American
who died today

277
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:54,124
as a result
of terrorist activity

278
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:58,990
is another murder that
you're accountable for.

279
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:01,690
And before you leave here,
you're going to admit it.

280
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,491
I suppose if you hurt me
enough, Jack,

281
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,357
I'll say whatever you want,

282
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,024
but that won't make it 
the truth.

283
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:14,324
And everybody who watches this
will know that perfectly well.

284
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,658
What are the names
of your co-conspirators?

285
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:18,757
There are no co-conspirators,
because there is no...

286
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:19,757
Walt Cummings,

287
00:16:19,823 --> 00:16:21,324
Christopher Henderson,

288
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:23,224
James Nathanson
have all admitted

289
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,057
to being part
of this conspiracy!

290
00:16:25,124 --> 00:16:26,457
Now they are dead!

291
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:28,257
Right before
Christopher Henderson died

292
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,723
he acknowledged that
there were others!

293
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,524
What are their names?!

294
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,690
A man will say anything
under torture.

295
00:16:33,757 --> 00:16:35,491
This won't mean a thing.

296
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:38,757
Mr. Logan, I'm not going
to torture you,

297
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:43,823
but you are going
to tell me what
I want to know.

298
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,558
Or so help me God,

299
00:16:45,624 --> 00:16:47,257
I will kill you.

300
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:11,024
A year and a half ago,

301
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,257
I was warned
that my life was in danger

302
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:17,357
by someone within
the government.

303
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,924
I was told the only 
way I could stay alive

304
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,558
was to create the illusion
that I was dead.

305
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,723
I was forced to deceive
people that I loved.

306
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,624
My only daughter
will never forgive me.

307
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:34,790
As I see the depth
of your corruption unfold,

308
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:39,823
I have no doubt
that you are that
source of danger.

309
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,558
David Palmer
was a great man.

310
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:44,191
And he was
a great president.

311
00:17:44,257 --> 00:17:47,391
He was also my friend.

312
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,857
He tried to warn me
about you

313
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:51,524
and now he is dead.

314
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:52,857
Other people tried
to help me

315
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,090
and they are dead, too.

316
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:58,924
So, Mr. Logan, I hope
you understand

317
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,224
I have absolutely
nothing to lose.

318
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,624
You are going
to be held accountable

319
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,723
for your part
of everything that
happened today.

320
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,957
You are not going to be able
to hide behind the presidency.

321
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:10,524
Right here, right now,

322
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,990
you are going
to face justice!

323
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:15,324
And make no mistake
about this, this
is personal.

324
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:16,823
And if you think
for a second

325
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,391
that I am scared
to put a bullet
in your brain,

326
00:18:19,457 --> 00:18:21,823
you don't know me.

327
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:27,757
I'm going to ask you
one last time,

328
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:32,291
who are your
co-conspirators?

329
00:18:32,357 --> 00:18:35,057
You have until
the count of three,

330
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,057
or I will kill you.

331
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:38,757
One...

332
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:41,057
You make me a martyr, I'll go
down in history with Lincoln

333
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:43,057
and Kennedy, but you'll go down
with John Wilkes Booth

334
00:18:43,124 --> 00:18:44,823
and Lee Harvey Oswald.
Is that what you want?

335
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,624
Two!

336
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,491
You're a man of honor.

337
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,357
How can you assassinate
a president of the
United States

338
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,024
in front
of the entire world?

339
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,491
If you love your country,
you won't pull the trigger.

340
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:57,357
Three!

341
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:22,224
You can't do it, can you?

342
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,857
No, Jack,
it's all right.

343
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:28,957
Jack, it's all right.
It's all right.

344
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:32,424
It's all right that you can't.

345
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,690
I'm the president.

346
00:19:42,757 --> 00:19:44,690
Jack, they're here.

347
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,690
AGENT:
Lay flat on your stomach!

348
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,391
Put your hands
out in front of you!

349
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:12,957
Extend your arms!

350
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:18,723
Mr. President,
are you all right?

351
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,257
I'm fine.

352
00:20:20,324 --> 00:20:21,957
I actually feel sorry
for that man.

353
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,723
He's delusional.

354
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,024
It would be better
if he were put

355
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,424
in some sort
of solitary confinement

356
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:28,591
for the time being.

357
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:16,933
Jack Bauer

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,434
wasn't able to get
the President to confess,

359
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,567
Mrs. Logan.

360
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:21,667
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:23,634
Why not?
What happened?

362
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,900
I'm not sure
of the details.

363
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:28,200
Bauer's in custody.

364
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,534
Gentlemen.

365
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,033
Thank you.

366
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:13,900
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

367
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,067
That will be all.
Thank you so much.

368
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,267
If I could just get you

369
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:20,200
to come this way. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

370
00:23:01,334 --> 00:23:03,900
David...

371
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:12,033
Marti, don't
do this to me now.
You killed him.

372
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,367
You killed him.

373
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,667
You're a murderer.
Stop.

374
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,634
You are!
You're a criminal!

375
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,634
My wife is not well.

376
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,801
Would you please
escort her?
Get off me!

377
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,567
Don't you touch me!

378
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:24,167
Don't you touch me!
Escort her into
the hangar, please.

379
00:23:24,234 --> 00:23:27,033
You don't know what he did!
He's not fit to be president!

380
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,768
It is a sacrilege for him to be
even speaking David's name!

381
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,834
Don't...!

382
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,067
No!

383
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:40,000
I want to make sure
that she's all right.

384
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:45,200
Has the hangar
been cleared?

385
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:46,601
Yes, sir.
All secure.

386
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,267
It's empty.
Good.

387
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:50,534
Let them know that
I'll be back in a moment.

388
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,167
Yes, Mr. President.

389
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:05,234
You're not wearing some kind
of listening device, are you?

390
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,801
What are you
talking about?

391
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:10,701
I have to watch you
now, Marti.

392
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,300
You said that
I was a good liar,

393
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,933
but I am nothing
compared to you.

394
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,768
Charles...! Stop it!

395
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:17,967
Stop it!

396
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,100
Charles...
Aah!
Yeah, Marti.

397
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,933
Tell me the truth.

398
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,334
You're hurting me.

399
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:36,267
You don't know
what pain is.

400
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:37,401
I'm on to you, Marti.

401
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,501
I should've seen it
from the first,

402
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,267
but I wanted to believe
that you still cared for me.

403
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:46,734
Making love to me was
just a ploy, wasn't it?

404
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,401
Took a lot of planning

405
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:52,300
to get Jack Bauer
on that helicopter.

406
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,033
You were part of
that plan, weren't you?

407
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,634
It was your job
to delay me, wasn't it?

408
00:24:57,701 --> 00:24:59,834
Wasn't it?!

409
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,467
Please...

410
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,501
Wasn't it?!

411
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,634
They used you

412
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,734
so Jack Bauer
could get to me.

413
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:07,768
Come on, Marti.
Come on, Marti.

414
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:09,267
Admit it,
you were part of it.

415
00:25:09,334 --> 00:25:11,667
Yes. Yes.

416
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,501
Why?

417
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,200
Why...?

418
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,667
Why did you help them?

419
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:23,100
Because you killed
David Palmer.

420
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:26,534
I told you I didn't realize
that was going to happen.

421
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:29,900
Your people killed him
to protect you.

422
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,601
You covered it up,
that's just as bad.

423
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,734
I covered it up
because I had to.

424
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:35,667
Oh, and then others
died to cover that up.

425
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,367
That's right, for
the good of the country.

426
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:40,033
You sold nerve gas
to terrorists.

427
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,134
You're insane.

428
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,801
You're insane!
I did it

429
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:47,234
for the good of the country
as I saw it at the time.

430
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:53,000
You're such a hypocrite.

431
00:25:54,834 --> 00:25:57,067
After your little
performance this morning,

432
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,868
you're in no position
to call me a hypocrite.

433
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,868
And I will tell you
something else--

434
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,267
if you blow up like this
one more time...

435
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:07,334
I will fill you
so full of drugs,

436
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,667
you won't even remember
your own name.

437
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:13,100
And then I will ship you
off to an asylum

438
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:16,000
and you can stay there
for the rest of your life.

439
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:19,734
Are we clear?

440
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,501
Are we clear?

441
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,224
My fellow Americans,

442
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,690
this has been a terrible day
in the history of this country--

443
00:27:36,757 --> 00:27:40,957
and yet at the same time,
a triumphant day,

444
00:27:41,024 --> 00:27:44,191
because in the end,
we won a significant victory

445
00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:48,557
over the forces of chaos
and terror.

446
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:50,724
We have preserved and protected
our way of life,

447
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:55,091
despite the loss
of innocent American lives.

448
00:27:55,158 --> 00:27:56,490
I'll start the transmission

449
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:58,624
in one minute.
Is the Attorney General there?

450
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,590
I'm here, Ms. O'Brian.
I certainly hope

451
00:28:00,657 --> 00:28:03,490
this recording is as important
as you claim it is.

452
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:08,690
Chloe, what's this about?

453
00:28:08,757 --> 00:28:10,624
I set up
a conference call with

454
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,224
the Attorney General.
He's on speakerphone now.

455
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,290
Are you serious?

456
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:14,490
I'm very serious.

457
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:16,423
Mr. Attorney General,
this is Karen Hayes,

458
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,757
Homeland Security.
Bill Buchanan, CTU.

459
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,924
Sir, I apologize. Ms. O'Brian
placed this call without

460
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,957
authorization from me.
I'm sorry I had to do that.

461
00:28:24,024 --> 00:28:25,457
We had to do things
under the radar

462
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:27,624
to protect you all in case
things went wrong.

463
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,224
In case what things
went wrong?

464
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,757
I think it would help
if I just played the recording.

465
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:33,191
HAYES:
What recording?

466
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:35,791
It's a conversation that took
place five minutes ago

467
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,024
between the President
and his wife.

468
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,290
How could you

469
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:41,057
possibly have a recording
of something like that?

470
00:28:41,124 --> 00:28:43,357
Sir, an agent named Jack Bauer
placed a listening device

471
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:45,791
on the President shortly
before this conversation.

472
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,457
Bauer? Isn't he the one
that's under arrest?

473
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:50,423
CHLOE:
I'm going to play
the recording now.

474
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,957
I don't want
to listen to it.

475
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,024
Ms. O'Brian, at the very least,
this constitutes

476
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:55,991
an egregious violation
of privacy,

477
00:28:56,057 --> 00:28:57,624
and we're talking about
the President.

478
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,158
MARTHA ( <i>sobbing</i> ):
...'cause you killed
David Palmer.

479
00:29:00,224 --> 00:29:05,124
LOGAN:
I told you, I didn't realize
that was going to happen.

480
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:07,690
Your people killed him
to protect you.

481
00:29:07,757 --> 00:29:09,557
You covered it up,
that's just as bad.

482
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,824
I covered it up
because I had to.

483
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:13,957
Oh, and then others
died to cover that up!

484
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:16,158
That's right, for
the good of the country.

485
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:17,757
You sold nerve gas
to terrorists.

486
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:20,657
You're insane.
You're insane!

487
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:24,258
A poet once said,
"No man is an island."

488
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:29,191
On a day like this, we can feel
the truth of those words.

489
00:29:29,258 --> 00:29:31,323
Any untimely death is a tragedy.

490
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,290
Yet some men embody such
greatness of character

491
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,757
that their death
serves as a unifying force

492
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:42,357
for those who remain behind.

493
00:29:42,423 --> 00:29:44,857
David Palmer was such a man.

494
00:29:44,924 --> 00:29:49,224
A great President,
a great American--

495
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:55,290
and on a more personal note--
a wonderful friend.

496
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:57,590
He'll be missed...
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

497
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:59,824
...more than words
can express...
Holtzman.

498
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:01,524
Yes, sir.

499
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,024
We take this moment to
remember with appreciation...

500
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:06,024
With all due respect,
Mr. Attorney General,

501
00:30:06,091 --> 00:30:09,357
are you sure this isn't
some kind of mistake?

502
00:30:10,724 --> 00:30:12,791
Yes, sir.

503
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:14,057
I understand, sir.

504
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:16,524
I'll do exactly as you say.

505
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,891
LOGAN:
...combination of wisdom,
strength and moral courage,

506
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:24,390
this country might have not
survived in its present form.

507
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,290
It's very appropriate that David
Palmer will be laid to rest

508
00:30:35,357 --> 00:30:36,590
in Arlington Cemetery,

509
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:41,224
for he was a soldier
in the truest sense.

510
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:46,323
He was a man whose courage rose
in direct proportion

511
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,724
to the threats
his country faced.

512
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:02,357
In closing, I would ask
that the country

513
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:04,824
observe a national day
of mourning

514
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:06,857
for one of
the greatest Americans

515
00:31:06,924 --> 00:31:10,191
this nation will ever see.

516
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:11,924
Thank you very much.

517
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:20,957
Federal marshall.
Would you please
come with us?

518
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:22,690
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

519
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:24,590
You came very close
to disrupting my speech.

520
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:26,390
BROWN:
On behalf of President Logan,

521
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:30,258
I wish to thank you all
very much for joining us.

522
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,258
I am sorry, but out of respect
for today's...

523
00:31:34,323 --> 00:31:36,390
Those are ridiculous
accusations.

524
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:40,124
Excuse me.
If I may, sir?

525
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:44,590
You've probably never seen
one of these, Mr. President.

526
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:48,724
It's a micro-transmitter.

527
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:18,124
Agent Clark, arrest these men

528
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,791
and get them the hell
out of here.

529
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,490
I'm sorry. 
Mr. President.

530
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:22,524
We have our orders.

531
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,323
You take...!

532
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,891
You take your orders
from me.

533
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:27,657
Not anymore.

534
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,724
After you, sir.

535
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,357
OFFICER:
Attention!

536
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:55,724
Aim, fire!

537
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,590
OFFICER:
Attention!

538
00:32:59,657 --> 00:33:00,824
Aim,

539
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:01,957
fire!

540
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:05,457
Attention!

541
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:06,357
Aim,

542
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:08,158
fire!

543
00:33:08,224 --> 00:33:12,024
Present arms.

544
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,724
Sir.

545
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:45,557
Give me a second.

546
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,724
Hey.

547
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,657
Hey.

548
00:34:09,657 --> 00:34:11,957
Thank God you're safe.

549
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,057
Everything's going
to be all right.

550
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:15,824
Jack, when I heard
you kidnapped the
President...

551
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:19,124
I was just trying
to get him to give me
a direct confession.

552
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,158
Jack...

553
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:27,423
How much longer
do you need to stay here?

554
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:32,757
Not much longer. They can
debrief me tomorrow.

555
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:34,191
You sure?

556
00:34:51,124 --> 00:34:53,323
I can't believe
you're really,

557
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,490
you're really here.

558
00:34:57,924 --> 00:35:00,357
Agent Bauer,

559
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:02,323
excuse me, but there's 
a call for you

560
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,323
from your daughter.

561
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,624
From my daughter?

562
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,091
Yes, sir. A Kim Bauer.
It's been put through

563
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:07,991
to a land line
just inside that door.

564
00:35:08,057 --> 00:35:09,524
Thank you.

565
00:35:13,624 --> 00:35:16,357
I'll be right back.
I promise.

566
00:35:16,423 --> 00:35:17,624
Take as long
as you need.

567
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,024
I'm not going anywhere.

568
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:22,357
I love you.

569
00:35:22,423 --> 00:35:24,490
I'll be right back.

570
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,657
Hey, Kim?

571
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:13,003
Any word on Logan?

572
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,637
No. My guess
is he'll try
to cut a deal.

573
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:18,237
He'll resign
without a fight

574
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,003
in exchange for clemency.

575
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,404
He doesn't deserve clemency.

576
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,838
No, but the country
doesn't deserve

577
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:24,938
a long impeachment
process, either,

578
00:36:25,003 --> 00:36:26,970
with everything
that's happened.

579
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:29,437
In any event, we can expect

580
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:33,103
Hal Gordon to be sworn in
as president soon.

581
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,037
Which means this
will probably be
the last time

582
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,037
I see this place.

583
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:37,771
I don't think so.

584
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:39,704
Not if I have anything
to do with it,

585
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:40,704
and I will.

586
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:44,637
You'll be back here
running CTU.

587
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:46,571
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

588
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:51,204
When I came in here
last night to save the day,

589
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,370
I was a little bit
condescending and tactless,

590
00:36:54,437 --> 00:36:57,204
to say the least.

591
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,838
I had no idea
what you were up against.

592
00:36:59,904 --> 00:37:00,904
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,137
No. No need to apologize.

594
00:37:03,204 --> 00:37:04,404
Mistakes were made.

595
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:07,537
You were right to come
in with a firm hand.

596
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:11,871
Well, I better go.

597
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,237
Karen.

598
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:18,204
I was thinking
of getting some breakfast

599
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,671
before going home.

600
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,437
I have to go over to Division
for one last briefing.

601
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:24,604
Bureaucracy.

602
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,137
Rain check?

603
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,504
Sure.

604
00:37:49,304 --> 00:37:51,704
Chloe,

605
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,704
really good work today.

606
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,437
You, too.

607
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,471
I found this
in Edgar's possessions.

608
00:38:01,537 --> 00:38:02,737
I thought you should
have it.

609
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:04,970
Thanks.

610
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:30,437
Hey.

611
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:33,970
What's all
this, then?

612
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,404
A friend of mine
who died today.

613
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:45,970
You, um, do you
want to talk about it?

614
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,137
Yeah? Come on.

615
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:05,304
Jack?

616
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,270
Oh, my God.

617
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,804
Agent Davis,
Jack Bauer's missing!

618
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,270
Attention, all units.

619
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:20,771
We have a missing agent:
Jack Bauer.

620
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:23,471
I repeat, we have
a missing agent: Jack Bauer.

621
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:25,037
...the lower level.

622
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:26,437
Put three men
on perimeter search.

623
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:28,270
Report back.

624
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:12,204
You surely must
be aware, Mr. Bauer,

625
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,437
that China has a long memory.

626
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:17,471
Only 18 months ago,

627
00:40:17,537 --> 00:40:19,471
you invaded
our territory

628
00:40:19,537 --> 00:40:22,237
and killed our consul.

629
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:35,404
Did you really think
that we would forget, hmm?

630
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:40,571
I know how this works.

631
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:46,170
I need to make one phone call.

632
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:51,437
Please...

633
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:56,471
just one phone call.

634
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:16,304
Kill me.

635
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:19,904
Just...

636
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,304
kill me.

637
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:25,237
Kill you?

638
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:29,070
You're far too valuable
to kill, Mr. Bauer.

639
