1
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,199
You're a traitor
to this country

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,100
and a disgrace
to your office.

3
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,900
Logan wants me dead
because

4
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:20,401
he thinks I know too much.

5
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,501
<i>Logan had more to protect,</i>
<i>and you know that.</i>

6
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:24,967
Aaron?

7
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,567
Ma'am, please stay
where you are.

8
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,668
( <i>gunshot</i> )

9
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:40,467
Bierko's escaped.

10
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:41,301
What?

11
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,301
How long ago?

12
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,234
<i>Davis, Karen Hayes here.</i>

13
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,367
What happened?

14
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:47,267
Our lead car got taken out
by an IED.

15
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:49,301
I overheard Bierko
talking to his men.

16
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:50,367
He said they're not finished.

17
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:51,501
I'm sure he said something

18
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,000
about a nerve gas canister.

19
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:54,267
Henderson set up Bierko

20
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:55,867
with the nerve gas
to begin with.

21
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,100
Trust me.
You're wasting your time.

22
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:58,134
He's not going
to help us.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,467
He will if we offer him a deal.

24
00:00:59,534 --> 00:01:02,701
<i>What do you want?</i>

25
00:01:02,768 --> 00:01:05,234
I'll disappear just like you did

26
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:07,701
so they wouldn't
turn you over to the Chinese.

27
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,367
Anything less than Bierko's head
on a plate,

28
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:12,967
this deal is off.

29
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:14,467
Bierko's going to release
the Sentox gas soon.

30
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:15,734
We need to know where.

31
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,301
CHLOE:
It's a Russian submarine, Jack.

32
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:19,833
What is the armament package
on a Russian Delta-4 class sub?

33
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,034
Best of my knowledge, 12
Scorpion land-attack missiles.

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,434
They're fast and accurate,
carry multiple warheads.

35
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,167
One of them can take out
several city blocks.

36
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:28,933
Lieutenant, we believe
the <i>Natalia</i>

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,567
has been targeted
for a terrorist attack.

38
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>We think the terrorists</i>

39
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,833
<i>are after your missiles</i>
<i>on the sub.</i>

40
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,434
<i>You need to secure your vessel</i>

41
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,334
<i>and lock down your</i>
<i>weapons system immediately.</i>

42
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:55,167
We have control
of the weapons system.

43
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:57,267
Vertical tubes are loaded
and ready.

44
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,800
I've flushed the Sentox.

45
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:33,234
The atmospheric readings
are all normal.

46
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,167
It's safe to breathe.

47
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,967
The coordinates
for the targets--

48
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:42,867
upload them
into the missiles.

49
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,534
Begin the launch
countdown.

50
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,501
Remove your masks.

51
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:57,301
We are close to finishing
what we started today.

52
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:00,800
I have identified
12 high-value targets:

53
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:04,100
financial centers,
transportation hubs,

54
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,434
high-population-density areas.

55
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,734
The Americans
will wake up this morning

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,067
to discover how steep a price
they've paid

57
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:14,933
for their alliance with Moscow.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,167
What we're about
to accomplish today

59
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:22,134
will be remembered
by our countrymen forever.

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,034
( <i>typing</i> )

61
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:37,100
Ms. Raines.

62
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:38,867
Admiral Kirkland.

63
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:41,034
I understand you're reporting
some type of emergency at

64
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,167
the Port of Los Angeles?

65
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:43,833
In anticipation
of today's treaty

66
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,234
with the Russians,
the Russian submarine <i>Natalia</i>

67
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,467
is docked here
for inspection by the U.S. Navy.

68
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:51,234
I'm familiar with the exercise.
I authorized it myself.

69
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:53,800
Terrorists have seized control
of that submarine.

70
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:57,534
What? We haven't received any
distress signals from the crew.

71
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:59,100
Because they're dead, sir,
all of them,

72
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:00,833
including the Russian crew.

73
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,701
We believe the terrorists
have flooded

74
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:04,701
the sub's ventilation system
with Sentox nerve gas.

75
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:06,634
My God.

76
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,200
Sir, I don't mean to preempt
your protocols, but how long

77
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,634
will it take you
to scramble a flight of F-18s?

78
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,401
You're asking me
to sink the submarine?

79
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,501
Sir, these terrorists
are in control of 12

80
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:17,734
multiple-warhead missiles,

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,867
which they will use
against civilian targets

82
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,701
unless we stop them first.

83
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:24,334
I'll need all of this confirmed.

84
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,833
We have a team on the ground
that can confirm,

85
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,334
but now I need
to know precisely:

86
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,534
How long will it take for you
to scramble these fighters?

87
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,034
I'm sending you the estimated

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,434
approach vectors
and ETA for my F-18s.

89
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,367
I can have my fighter jets there
within 22 to 25 minutes.

90
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:40,200
We have a problem, sir.

91
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,701
According to our simulation,
Bierko will have

92
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:44,833
his missiles in the air
in less than 20 minutes.

93
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,867
Scrambling the jets right now,
but it seems to me as if this is

94
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:50,100
going to be up to your team
on the ground.

95
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:06,301
We have visual contact
with the sub.

96
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,067
Hatches are still closed.

97
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:10,301
Ship's been locked down.

98
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,833
Confirming one hostile topside,
standing guard.

99
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,334
Jack, Chloe's simulation
has Bierko firing those missiles

100
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:16,867
in less than 20 minutes.

101
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,501
Sooner than that if he's already
started programming targets.

102
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,701
The Navy won't be able
to intercept in time.

103
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,200
Jack, it's Audrey.

104
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:25,367
I just got off the phone
with Admiral Kirkland.

105
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:28,100
He's scrambling F-18s,
but they won't be
able to get them

106
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:31,100
in the air in time in order
to destroy the sub.
How far out are reinforcements?

107
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,301
Too far.

108
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,668
Additional tac teams
won't arrive until

109
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,034
after the missiles
have launched.

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,301
That means we have
to take Bierko down ourselves.

111
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:39,067
That's not a real option, Jack.

112
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:41,334
There are only four
entry points on that submarine.

113
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:42,967
We have to assume that
Bierko's locked them down

114
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:44,634
and is defending them.

115
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:45,867
AUDREY:
Jack, Bill's right.

116
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:47,301
We don't have the manpower
or the resources

117
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:48,734
to get on that sub.

118
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,634
We might.
Somebody just launched

119
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,234
a signal tube
off the starboard side.

120
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:54,367
What's a signal tube?

121
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:55,401
It's a radio beacon
crewmen can send

122
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,234
to the surface in
case of emergencies.

123
00:05:58,301 --> 00:05:59,734
Chloe, if there
are friendlies inside,

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,267
they can help us
board the sub.

125
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:03,634
I want you to scan all
emergency frequencies.
On it.

126
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:05,334
Standing by.

127
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:06,668
Jack, just so
we're straight--

128
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,000
we stop Bierko,
my wife and I disappear

129
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:12,067
for good, with
your help, right?

130
00:06:12,134 --> 00:06:13,634
Yeah.
One other thing.

131
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,167
If I'm going on that sub
with you, I need a firearm.

132
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,768
I'll cover you.

133
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

134
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,100
I don't go anywhere undefended
against hostiles.

135
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,967
I still consider
you a hostile.

136
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:27,134
Jack, I don't get a gun,
I don't go in.

137
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,167
CHLOE:
Jack, you were right.
There's a survivor

138
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,167
on the submarine. He's sending
out a distress signal.

139
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:33,501
Can he receive
on this frequency?

140
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah.
Patch him through.

141
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,900
MAN:
I repeat. Petty Officer

142
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:46,334
Tim Rooney,
on <i>Natalia</i> K524.

143
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,800
Code seven. SOS.
We are under attack.

144
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,800
Petty Officer Rooney,
my name is Jack Bauer.

145
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,267
I'm with the Counterterrorist
Unit, Los Angeles.

146
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,134
What the hell is going on, sir?

147
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,267
Everyone's dead.

148
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,800
And there are people
in the Control Room

149
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,367
trying to operate
the missile launch system.

150
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:04,301
Who the hell are they?
They're Russian
separatists.

151
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,734
They're the terrorists
that were responsible

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,534
for the attacks that
took place earlier today.

153
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,000
Does the Navy know
about this?

154
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,467
Yeah. They're sending
in fighters,

155
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:11,900
but I don't think they're
going to get here in time.

156
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,734
So what are we supposed to do?

157
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,167
Did anyone else from your crew

158
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,534
survive the attack?

159
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:22,933
No. I don't think so.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,534
Where are you?

161
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:27,167
Lower Level,
Auxiliary Engineering.

162
00:07:27,234 --> 00:07:28,467
I was down here
doing an inventory

163
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:29,668
when the alarms
went off.

164
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,933
The atmospheric gauges
red-lined.

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,134
It's a sealed compartment,
so I shut it down.

166
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,768
The men that attacked the ship,

167
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,167
were they wearing gas masks?

168
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:39,534
They were, but they took
them off a few minutes ago.

169
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,167
Okay, good.
That means they

170
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,833
flushed the Sentox
out of the air system.

171
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,467
You should be able
to move around freely.

172
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:46,100
Hold on one second.

173
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,501
Chloe?
Yes, Jack?

174
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,701
I want you to get me
the nearest entry point

175
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,200
to Petty Officer Rooney's
current position.

176
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:54,200
The closest hatch
is the forward escape hatch.

177
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,567
Copy that.

178
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:58,200
Petty Officer Rooney,
do you have a firearm?

179
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:01,267
No. The armory's
on the other side of the ship.

180
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,933
You need to find something
that you can use as a weapon.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,134
I have a... I have
a utility tool.

182
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,933
It has a knife on it.

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,401
That'll work.
I want you to
make your way up

184
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,467
to the Upper Level.
Let me know when
you get there.

185
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:13,668
You still haven't told me
what it is you want me to do.

186
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:18,200
I need you to get
to the forward escape
hatch and let us in.

187
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:20,267
There's a man there guarding it.

188
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,134
Then you're going
to have to kill him.

189
00:08:25,034 --> 00:08:27,401
Petty Officer Rooney?

190
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,301
I'm an engineer.

191
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,601
I... I'm not trained for that.

192
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,401
The men that commandeered
the <i>Natalia</i>

193
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:34,933
plan to use
its missiles and launch them

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,501
on civilian targets
unless we stop them.

195
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,467
You need to make your way
up to the Upper Level.

196
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:42,501
You need to do it now.
We are running out of time.

197
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,933
I'll contact you
when I get there.

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,134
Copy that.

199
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:55,200
We need to get closer
to the sub. Are you ready?

200
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,334
Jack, I know you got
Malina's .45 in that bag.

201
00:08:57,401 --> 00:08:58,467
Now, give it to me.

202
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,833
Let's go.

203
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,334
We're generating a list

204
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:11,933
of potential targets, but
frankly, we have no idea

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,100
what Bierko
plans to hit.

206
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,567
Are we evacuating
these potential targets?

207
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,200
Don't have time. The missiles
will strike before we can

208
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:19,668
mobilize even small numbers
of people to the safe zones.

209
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,401
How could this happen, Mike?

210
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:22,668
How could these people
even access

211
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,434
a submarine
in the first place?

212
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,601
The sub was attacked
when it was being serviced

213
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:28,601
at a civilian port,

214
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,401
not on a Naval base
where security

215
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:32,967
would have been
more substantial.

216
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:35,668
There has to be a way
to destroy that sub

217
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,634
before Bierko can
launch those missiles.

218
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:40,034
F-18s are scrambling
as we speak.

219
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:45,467
According to the
latest estimates,

220
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:48,134
they're not going
to get there in time.

221
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:57,634
AARON:
Yes?

222
00:09:57,701 --> 00:10:00,267
I'm still waiting
to talk to Mike Novick.

223
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,567
He's in some kind
of crisis meeting.

224
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,167
There's no telling
how long he'll be.

225
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:06,334
Then I should try to get
off the ranch on my own.

226
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:09,067
No. Without Mike's help,
you'll be seen.

227
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:11,234
Charles can't find out
you're still alive.

228
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:13,534
I'll call you as soon
as I get ahold of Mike.

229
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:14,601
Okay.

230
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,200
Jack, the missiles
will launch

231
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,967
in less than ten minutes.

232
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:26,601
Copy that.

233
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:32,000
How much time do you need
to cancel the launch sequence?

234
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,634
I won't know for
certain until I see

235
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,434
how the targeting
software is configured.

236
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:39,200
Jack, the Petty Officer
is coming back on.

237
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,234
Patch him through.

238
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:41,334
Petty Officer Rooney,

239
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,900
you're on with Jack Bauer.

240
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:44,200
JACK:
What's your position, son?

241
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:47,034
I'm 30 feet forward
of the hatch.

242
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,634
Have you got a visual of the
hostile guarding the hatch?

243
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,067
Yeah. He's still there.

244
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:55,301
What do you want me to do?

245
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,401
You need to kill him

246
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,668
without alerting the others.

247
00:10:58,734 --> 00:11:00,668
Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

248
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm right-handed.

249
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:03,301
I want you to approach him
from behind.

250
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,833
When you're within 18 inches,

251
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,301
I want you to take
your left hand,

252
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,167
put it on his mouth,
pull his head back

253
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,601
into your chest
exposing his neck.

254
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:11,434
Then I want you to take
your right hand

255
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:12,434
and slit his throat.

256
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:15,534
I... I don't, uh...

257
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,767
I don't know if I can
do this.

258
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,934
You don't have a choice, son.

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,034
I want you to visualize
the hostile down on
the ground, dead.

260
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,967
You cannot afford
to think about this, son.

261
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,468
You need to do it.

262
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:31,034
Jack, there's less
than six minutes
until the missile launch.

263
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:34,334
Petty Officer Rooney?

264
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,901
Petty Officer Rooney?

265
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,167
Okay, I can do this.

266
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,767
I have to do this.

267
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,800
Cut him deep,
and cut him fast.

268
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,734
Agent McCullough, cover us.

269
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,234
We're moving in
on the tower.

270
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,268
Go.

271
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,233
Petty Officer Rooney,
what is your status?

272
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,134
My status is, uh...

273
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,300
He's dead.

274
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,034
Did anyone hear you?

275
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:37,300
No, no one's coming.

276
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,901
Good. Open the hatch.

277
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,634
You ready?
Yeah.

278
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,801
I'll take out the guard.
Let's go.

279
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:58,200
All right, he's down.
We're going in.

280
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:16,767
Oh, no.

281
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,267
The sub's missile hatches
just opened.

282
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,300
I see them.

283
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,667
What does that mean

284
00:13:20,734 --> 00:13:21,967
in terms of our time frame?

285
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,567
You have less than four minutes
until they launch.

286
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:33,434
Are you all right?
I'm okay.

287
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,934
Which way is
the control room?

288
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:35,901
It's down that hall.

289
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,168
You lead, we'll follow.
Okay.

290
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,467
All right, the control room's
right down that hall.

291
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,367
BAUER:
I'm going to need your help

292
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:58,934
drawing the rest of the
hostiles out of the con.

293
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:00,233
What do you want
me to do?

294
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,467
Is there another way for you

295
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:03,500
to get to the other side
of the control room?

296
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:05,001
Yeah, I can go down
one level

297
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:06,400
and then come up
behind them.

298
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,901
Okay, when you get there, I want
you to create a diversion,

299
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,068
something loud.

300
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:11,634
Just make sure you get
them out of there.

301
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,233
When you do, I want you
to find somewhere

302
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
to lay low and stay there.

303
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,901
I do not want you
to engage them.

304
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:16,901
Do you understand me?

305
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:17,934
Yeah, I can do that.

306
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,467
Go.

307
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,267
With the last
three missiles,

308
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,634
make sure you overlap
these populations centers

309
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,367
in San Francisco.

310
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,400
Locking up

311
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:51,101
GPS coordinates,
sir.

312
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,567
Keep working.

313
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,101
Did you hear that?
Yes, sir.

314
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,068
Down there.
Come with me,
both of you.

315
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:43,200
The control room's
right behind us.

316
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,434
I have a visual
on one hostile.

317
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,901
Agent McCullough, I'm going

Three minutes to launch.

00:16:46,134 --> 00:16:47,867
We're all clear.

323
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:08,233
Jack, I'm gonna have to manually
reverse all these codes.

324
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,333
Do you have enough time?
I'll do my best.
I don't want to be in here

any more than you
if those F-18s
take out this sub.

We're going to keep Bierko
and his men out of here

327
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:18,068
so you can finish this.
Let's go.

329
00:18:07,168 --> 00:18:09,034
Agent McCullough's down.

Bierko and one hostile
remaining.

331

Henderson, what
is your status?

332
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,767
Jack, I need more time.
You've got to hold them off.

333
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,101
60 seconds until they launch.

Hang on, Jack.

00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,200
CHLOE:
30 seconds to launch.

It's almost there, Jack.

00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Four more seconds.

Ten seconds.

HENDERSON:
The launch sequence is canceled.

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,901
I repeat,
the launch sequence is canceled.

346
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,867
Audrey, recall the F-18's.
I'm on it.

Bierko's dead.

00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:46,534
The submarine is secure.

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,634
HENDERSON:
Jack, are you okay?

350
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:49,267
Bill, I'm fine.

351
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:53,834
I'm getting a lot
of feedback.

352
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,134
Take me off the com.

353
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:18,168
Hold it, Jack.

354
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,068
Now lower your arms

356
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,767
and turn around.

Good for you, Jack.

You were responsible for

They were friends of mine.

That's the way it works.

367

My name is Jack Bauer,

00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:27,601
Okay. Lieutenant, I need
access to a vehicle.

Petty Officer,
get me a vehicle-- <i>now!</i>

00:22:29,667 --> 00:22:30,868
Thank you.

BUCHANAN:
Jack?
Yeah.

378
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:37,868
I've been told
the Navy's running

Yeah, they're here now.

00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,267
Bill, Christopher
Henderson is dead.

382
00:22:42,334 --> 00:22:43,968
What? What happened?

383
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:45,000
He fired on me.

384
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,701
I didn't have a choice.

385
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,634
Are you coming back to CTU?

386
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,100
Yeah, I'll be there soon.

387
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,367
All right, we'll see you then.

388
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,934
Chloe, the Navy needs our access
codes to our logs

389
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,567
so they can use them
for their report.

390
00:22:58,634 --> 00:22:59,567
Can you pick up?

391
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:00,667
Yeah.

392
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:02,100
What codes do they need?

393
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,467
They don't. Get somewhere
where you won't be overheard.

394
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:07,167
I'll have to get that
from my screen.

395
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:08,367
Let me get back

396
00:23:08,434 --> 00:23:09,400
to my station.

397
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:21,601
I'm here.

398
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,767
What's going on?

399
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,067
I'm not coming
back to CTU.

400
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,367
I'm going after Logan.

401
00:23:25,434 --> 00:23:26,868
What do you mean,
going after Logan?

402
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:28,501
I'll fill you in
on the details later.

403
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:30,567
Right now I need you
to walk me through modifying

404
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:32,434
some field
communications equipment.

405
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,901
That's not exactly
my area, Jack.

406
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:36,400
Then you'll need
to get some help.

407
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,167
Chloe,

408
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,200
are you with me on this?

409
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,300
Yeah. What do you need?

410
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,934
Hold on, I'll give you a list.

411
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:52,367
Okay.

412
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:53,767
Thank you.

413
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,868
We're certain the missiles
no longer pose a threat?

414
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:59,567
Yes, Mr. President.

415
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:01,501
We have complete control
over the boat.

416
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:05,067
Vladimir Bierko and all his
known associates are dead

or in custody.

418
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:12,067
So then it's all over, Mike.

419
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,133
It's over.

before I go back to Washington.

00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,601
About the successful
resolution of the crisis.

423
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:36,634
Yes.

424
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:38,968
And about David Palmer.

425
00:24:39,033 --> 00:24:40,367
Sir?

426
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,901
David's casket is being flown
to Arlington for burial,

427
00:24:42,968 --> 00:24:44,200
and I would like to say

428
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,534
a few words alongside it
at the airfield,

429
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,667
and then I'll fly
back to Washington.

430
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,567
I'll get to work
on it right away.

431
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,501
Good. Thank you, Mike.

432
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,434
For everything.

433
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:03,567
It's been a hell of a day.

00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,267
Yes, sir.

435
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:07,767
It has.

00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:20,968
Mike.

437
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:23,834
You need to come with me.

438
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,100
Come with you?

439
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:28,067
Please.

440
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:29,334
Oh, please.

Mrs. Logan,
have you been...?
No.

442
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,334
I've never been more sober.

443
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,334
Or more sane.

444
00:25:44,901 --> 00:25:46,667
What's this about?

445
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:47,901
My husband.

446
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,000
What about him?

447
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:50,534
Mike, I know
you've been troubled

by Charles's actions today.

449
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:55,934
You <i>know</i> that something

You just can't put
your finger on it.

Okay.

452
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,300
Tell me what this is about.

453
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,000
No, I'm going to show you.

454
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:08,133
It'll explain everything.
Please come.

455
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,634
The mission to retake the
submarine has been successful.

456
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:13,467
Hmm, so I understand.

457
00:26:13,534 --> 00:26:15,968
You'll also be interested
to know Christopher Henderson

was killed during the operation.

459

You're certain of this?

460
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:23,067
CTU has confirmed
the information.

461
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,267
That's excellent.

462
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,734
But let's not fool
ourselves into thinking

463
00:26:28,801 --> 00:26:30,200
that's the end
of all our problems.

464
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,834
There's still Bauer
to deal with.

465
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:34,300
Don't worry.

466
00:26:34,367 --> 00:26:36,667
Mr. Bauer will
be taken care of.

467
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:39,801
Good.

468
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,033
Mike. Over here.

469
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:47,868
Aaron...

What happened to you?

471
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:51,100
Agent Adams tried to kill me.

472
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,334
On the president's orders.

473
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,100
That doesn't
make any sense.

474
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,067
Where is Agent Adams?

475
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,400
Mike, we need your help.

476
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:14,801
God.

477
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,434
What the hell's going on here?

478
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:21,667
The president had something
to do with this?

479
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:22,667
Everything.

480
00:27:22,734 --> 00:27:24,267
He was involved
with <i>everything</i>

with the nerve gas,

the murder of David Palmer.

484
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,067
( <i>sighs</i> )

485
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:33,234
But Walt Cummings?

486
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,033
Walt was just their scapegoat.

487
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,400
He didn't commit suicide.

488
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,634
He was murdered by a man
who works for Charles.

489
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,400
Charles told me
to be quiet.

490
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:43,634
For the good of the country.

491
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:45,200
Keep my mouth shut.

492
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,334
I can't do that.

493
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,501
Not anymore.

494
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,667
Do you have proof?

495
00:27:52,734 --> 00:27:53,667
Jack Bauer was

496
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:55,100
in possession
of a recording

497
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:56,334
that implicated
the president.

498
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,634
That's why Logan
was willing

499
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:01,434
to go so far as to shoot
a plane full of people down--

500
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:03,701
because Jack was on it.

501
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:05,634
Well, where is
this recording?

502
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,067
It's been destroyed.

503
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:09,601
I didn't want

504
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:11,334
to believe it
either, Mike,

505
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,167
but it's the truth,
so help me God.

506
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:22,033
All right.

507
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,767
If this is true,
we need to find another way

508
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,934
to make a case
against the president.

509
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,067
You're right, but first

510
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:31,334
we have to get
Aaron off the ranch.

511
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
There can't be
a record of it.

512
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,000
All right. You're right.

513
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:41,200
We need to move fast.

514
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,000
I know the men at the
Western Gate well.

515
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,968
They won't stop and
inspect the vehicle

516
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,934
if I'm driving.
You'll hide in the back

517
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,934
out of sight.

518
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,901
Thank you, Mike.

519
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,400
Give me the keys.

520
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,200
Aaron.

521
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:03,033
I'll be fine.

522
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,167
I'll go somewhere where your
husband's people can't find me.

523
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:09,467
But will you let me know
that you're all right?

524
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:14,033
It's probably safer
if we don't have any contact.

525
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:22,033
Good-bye, Aaron.

526
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,601
Thank you.

527
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:14,501
Mike Novick.

528
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:15,833
Mike, it's Jack Bauer.

529
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,301
I know this is
an unusual request,

530
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:18,900
but I'm looking
for Aaron Pierce.

531
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:21,401
I've been trying
to reach him on his cell,
but he's not answering.

532
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,301
It's Jack Bauer.
He's trying
to find you.

533
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,768
Can you put him
on speaker?

534
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:28,000
Aaron's with me right
now, Jack. Hold on.

535
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:31,434
It's all right, Jack. You can
speak freely in front of Mike.

536
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:32,567
He knows what I know.

537
00:30:32,634 --> 00:30:33,768
Aaron, where are you?

538
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,234
A few miles from the ranch.

539
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,234
What happened?

540
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,134
The president tried
to have me killed,

541
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,867
but Mrs. Logan
saved my life.

542
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:43,034
She and I both decided
to bring Mike
into this.

543
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,234
And I'm still
trying to process everything they told me.

544
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,467
This is a real
mess, Jack.

545
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,301
Mike, I'm calling Aaron
because I need his help.

546
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:49,501
I need yours, too.

547
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:51,367
Help with what?

548
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,701
Bringing President Logan
to justice.

549
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,967
Well, Aaron said
the recording you had

550
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:58,833
implicating the president
was destroyed. Is that true?

551
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,967
Yes.

552
00:31:00,034 --> 00:31:01,701
Well, without it you
can't mount a case.

553
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:04,134
I can if I can get
a direct confession from Logan.

554
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,067
I'm working with someone
inside CTU.

555
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:07,601
They're setting up
a digital uplink.

556
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:09,501
If I can get Logan
to acknowledge everything

557
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,933
that he's done today,
it's going to be all the evidence
we need.

558
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,567
Jack, if you intend to
physically coerce the president
of the United States...

559
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:17,134
<i>Mike, we need to do this now.</i>

560
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
The longer we wait,
the more vulnerable we are.

561
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,467
President Logan tried to take me
out, just like he did Aaron.

562
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,900
I don't need to remind you
that he was responsible

563
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,134
for David Palmer's assassination

564
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,301
and a terrorist attack
on this country's soil.

565
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:29,134
He cannot be allowed
to remain in office,

566
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,367
not for one more day.

567
00:31:31,434 --> 00:31:33,234
How long will it
take you to get here?

568
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:34,434
20 minutes.

569
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:35,534
That's too late.

570
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,334
President Logan
will be gone.

571
00:31:37,401 --> 00:31:39,701
He's leaving for Washington
around that time.

572
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:41,167
Then you have to try
and delay him.

573
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,467
I'm not sure
I can do that.

574
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,234
Mike, just tell me you'll try.

575
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:48,434
All right.

576
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:50,933
But get here as fast as you can.

577
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Okay. Thank you.

578
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,267
Yes, sir. I'll get on a plane

579
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:58,668
as soon as I finish
our debrief with the Navy.

580
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,601
Homeland's ordered me to
Washington

581
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:12,134
as soon as I file
the Bierko case.

582
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:16,967
Apparently, the request
came from the White House.

583
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:19,367
Logan's looking
for an excuse to clean house.

584
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:21,434
I'm sure I'll be next.

585
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,768
HAYES:
Come in.

586
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,034
Yes, Chloe.

587
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,167
Do you have
something?

588
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,200
I need an authorization code.

589
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:31,200
For what?

590
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:32,301
I need access to

591
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,534
a high-clearance
workstation.

592
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:35,067
You already have access.

593
00:32:35,134 --> 00:32:36,534
It's for some new personnel.

594
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:38,301
What?

595
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:41,200
Morris?

596
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:42,800
You're bringing Morris back?

597
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:44,267
Yes.

598
00:32:44,334 --> 00:32:45,434
Why, Chloe?

599
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:46,933
Because I'm still trying
to salvage something

600
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,467
from the recording
that Miles erased.

601
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,734
If anyone can do it,
it's Morris.

602
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,567
I didn't think Morris

603
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:53,200
was even on the government
payroll anymore.

604
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:55,167
He's not.

605
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,501
What's he doing?

606
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:59,134
He's selling women's
shoes in Beverly Hills.

607
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,501
What?

608
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:01,800
Is this a joke?

609
00:33:01,867 --> 00:33:03,768
No. You know I wouldn't
have brought him in

610
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,134
if there was anyone
else I could call.

611
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,301
Please, Mr. Buchanan.

612
00:33:14,334 --> 00:33:15,867
Thank you.

613
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:19,100
Bill...

614
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:21,000
It's going to be
all right.
Who is this guy?

615
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:23,034
Morris O'Brian.

616
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,134
Chloe's ex-husband.

617
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,301
No, no, not like that.
May I?

618
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:30,601
See, the beauty of the beast is
if you leave these fields blank,

619
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:32,100
it'll prompt you
for a code.

620
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:33,467
Ba-bing. See that?

621
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:34,900
You just saved
60 seconds.

622
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,100
Ten of those a day,
that's an extra cigarette break

623
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:40,301
or whatever it is you do
to take the edge off.

624
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:41,401
Morris.

625
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,267
What are you doing?

626
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,501
Just making your people
more efficient.

627
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,634
I noticed you picked
the most attractive one.

628
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:51,900
Wrong. You're the most
attractive one.

629
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,301
Here's your clearance.

630
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:56,134
I'm surprised you got
Bill Buchanan to sign off on me.

631
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,800
You know, this is a really
good opportunity for you.

632
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:01,067
Why don't you surprise me
and not totally screw it up?

633
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:03,200
Okay.
I'm going to pretend

634
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:05,467
that this will require
all my focus and attention,

635
00:34:05,534 --> 00:34:08,401
even though we both know
I can do it in my sleep.

636
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:09,800
Sit down.

637
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,134
So where is this recording
you want me to resurrect?

638
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,301
Nothing. Forget it.
It's fried.

639
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,334
I'm missing something.

640
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,401
You said you wanted me to
salvage a digital recording.

641
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:18,900
That was an excuse.

642
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:21,067
I need some comm unit
modifications.

643
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:23,634
I need a certified digital
audio transfer rate of 6.8.

644
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:24,967
I can only get to 6.5.

645
00:34:25,034 --> 00:34:26,401
Can you do that
without talking?

646
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:29,200
I could, but it'd be
a terrible waste of my charm.

647
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,734
Okay. I'm not
listening anymore.

648
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,401
Call me when you're done.

649
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:35,634
Thanks.

650
00:34:39,601 --> 00:34:41,401
Behind me, you can see
preparations

651
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:44,167
as the casket bearing the body
of David Palmer

652
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:46,668
is due here shortly.
It will be met

653
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:48,768
<i>by President Logan
who is scheduled
( knock on door )</i>

654
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:51,967
to make a statement before
he flies back to Washington...

655
00:34:53,267 --> 00:34:54,567
Is Aaron safe?

656
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,634
Yes.

657
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,933
Thank God.

658
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,867
I can't believe Charles
is going to do this.

659
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:04,800
He has David's blood
on his hand,

660
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:06,334
he has the audacity
to eulogize him

661
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:08,134
in front of
the whole world.

662
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,634
Mrs. Logan...

663
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:11,034
I said earlier
there was no way

664
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,501
to make a case against
your husband.

665
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,234
I was wrong.

666
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:16,668
Jack Bauer,
the former CTU agent,

667
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:19,100
contacted Aaron and me.
He's on his way here now.

668
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,634
What for?

669
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,401
He's going to confront
your husband directly.

670
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,967
Confront him?

671
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:27,000
What's he going to do?

672
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,701
Jack Bauer will do
whatever it takes

673
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:31,800
to compel your husband
to confess the truth.

674
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:34,234
He's the only one I know
who can do this.

675
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:35,900
When will he be here?

676
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,267
15 minutes.

677
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:39,967
But Charles is leaving
for the airfield immediately.

678
00:35:40,034 --> 00:35:41,933
I know, I know, I tried
to delay him myself,

679
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,301
but he wouldn't
change his schedule.

680
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:44,601
That's why I'm coming to you.

681
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:47,501
I need you
to keep him here.

682
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:53,301
Martha...

683
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:57,467
if you want your husband
brought to justice,

684
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:59,734
this is our only chance.

685
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,034
You have to find
a way to stall him.

686
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:38,067
Aaron, it's good
to see you.

687
00:36:38,134 --> 00:36:39,367
Same here, Jack.

688
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,567
Was Mike able to delay
the President?
He's trying.

689
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,700
But he had to ask
Mrs. Logan for some help.

690
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:45,901
The First Lady knows
what we intend to do?

691
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:46,967
She does.

692
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:48,433
Aaron...

693
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,634
can she be trusted?

694
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,367
She is with us, Jack...

695
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:52,400
100%.

696
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:53,801
Can you still get access

697
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:55,867
to the Secret Service
deployment grid?
I already have.

698
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:57,967
The way security has been beefed
up around the main building,

699
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,433
there's no way you're
going to be able

700
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,467
to get Logan alone there.

701
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:02,067
Is Marine One taking him
to the airfield?

702
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:03,433
No, this was last minute.

703
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,201
They're transporting him
by reduced detachment.

704
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:06,400
They're using
a Navy helicopter.

705
00:37:06,467 --> 00:37:07,901
That's where this
has to happen.

706
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:09,433
I need to get on
that chopper.

707
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,767
I don't see how that's
going to be possible.

708
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:14,234
Aaron, you get me as close
to that helicopter as you can

709
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,567
and then we'll figure
it out from there.

710
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,667
All right.

711
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:19,168
Let's go.

712
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:24,333
Yes, I agree, Wayne Palmer
should be at the airfield.

713
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,134
But if you can't find him,
I'm not going to wait for him.

714
00:37:29,034 --> 00:37:31,634
Yes, I'm leaving now.

715
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,168
Have a copy of my speech
on the chopper,

716
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:40,534
and I'll work on it
on the flight over.

717
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:46,001
I'll be out of your way
in a second.

718
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,967
I saw on your schedule

719
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:50,268
that you're meeting
David Palmer's

720
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,801
casket at the airfield.

721
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:56,333
If you came here to judge me,
Martha,

722
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,268
I really don't have time...

723
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,367
No, no.

724
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,634
That's not it.

725
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,268
I've had time

726
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,034
to reflect and I...

727
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:08,333
I think I owe you an apology.

728
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,500
All right.

729
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:18,400
I said some horrible things
to you.

730
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:22,534
I've had horrible things
said to me before...

731
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
and by you.

732
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:29,567
But there was one thing you
said that I can't get over.

733
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:30,801
What?

734
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:33,168
That I broke your heart...

735
00:38:33,234 --> 00:38:35,400
and that you hated me.

736
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:40,201
Well, I wish I could
take those words back.

737
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:44,034
All I can ask now
is that you forgive me.

738
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:46,634
Please, Charles...

739
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:55,400
I don't know how
to respond, Marty.

740
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:57,567
I never expected you
to say anything like this.

741
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:03,201
I mean it, Charles, I...

742
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,734
I mean it,
I need you to forgive me.

743
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:10,300
You mean it now,
but you know how you are.

744
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:13,201
By tomorrow, I could be
the man you hate again.

745
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,467
I know.

746
00:39:19,634 --> 00:39:22,101
It'll take time for me
to prove myself to you,

747
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:25,567
but the truth is...

748
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:30,168
even though sometimes
I don't understand you,

749
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,067
I still need you.

750
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:37,234
And I still love you.

751
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,034
And that will never
change, Charles.

752
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:44,734
Not tomorrow, not ever.

753
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:52,734
I need you, too, Marty.

754
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,801
Fly with me
to Washington.

755
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,500
We can spend
some time together.

756
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:12,667
On a plane surrounded
by Secret Service?

757
00:40:12,734 --> 00:40:16,367
Why can't we just spend
a little more time here,

758
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:18,134
together, alone?

759
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:20,433
You know that's
not possible.
I have to go.

760
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,867
I had to go
five minutes ago.

761
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,168
Okay, Charles.

762
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:34,700
You go.

763
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:47,168
Come with me.

764
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,400
I have a better idea.

765
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:58,734
There's a helicopter
waiting for me.

766
00:40:58,801 --> 00:40:59,901
Let it wait.

767
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:01,634
I can't.

768
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,333
Yes, you can.

769
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,767
You're the President.

770
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:39,300
Tell the helicopter
to stand by.

771
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:40,867
Yes.

772
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,400
Until I'm ready.

773
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,101
And make sure
I'm not disturbed.

774
00:42:28,268 --> 00:42:30,234
It's clear.

775
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:36,767
<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

776
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:39,134
Yeah.

777
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:40,801
The President just notified
Secret Service

778
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:42,967
he's going
to be delayed.
How long?

779
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:44,300
He didn't say.

780
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,467
But Mrs. Logan knows we need
as much time as possible.

781
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:48,934
Jack...

782
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,834
if Logan doesn't confess,

783
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,934
how far are you actually
willing to go?

784
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:55,901
As far as I have to.
