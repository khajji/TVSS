1
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:14,681
You helped terrorists acquire

2
00:00:14,716 --> 00:00:16,078
weaponized nerve gas!

3
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:19,245
I told you we were going
to trigger the canisters

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,575
once the separatists reached
their base in Central Asia.

5
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:23,053
Damn it, Walt, you got into bed

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,929
with these people
and now they're threatening

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,817
to use the gas on American citizens!

8
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:28,419
What do we do about Walt?

9
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:29,475
We keep him out of sight

10
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,683
long enough for us
to construct a credible narrative.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,447
Are you talking about a cover-up?

12
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:38,509
Walt Cummings was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

13
00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,334
If we go public with Cummings,

14
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:43,802
the credibility of this office
will be destroyed.

15
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,021
Mr. President...

16
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:46,995
What is it, Mike?

17
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:49,074
- I think you should come here.
- What's going on?

18
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,300
Just come here, sir.

19
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,956
- Lynn?
- What is it?

20
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,866
I know you're busy,

21
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:56,440
but I need to see you, please.

22
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:05,012
I need you to do some work for us
and I'm going to need it done fast.

23
00:01:05,146 --> 00:01:06,250
Get the canisters!

24
00:01:06,576 --> 00:01:08,209
You have to cut precisely

25
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:09,728
ten centimeters

26
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:11,551
from the bottom of the casing.

27
00:01:11,874 --> 00:01:13,762
You and I need a place
where we can meet.

28
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:15,394
Call you back in five minutes.

29
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,758
Logan has asked Jack to be reinstated
on a provisional basis.

30
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,138
He's been given full autonomy
and access.

31
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,814
We got a possible intercept on Erwich.

32
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,294
A man named Jacob Rossler...

33
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,339
a software programmer

34
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:27,326
indicted for high-security code
infiltration.

35
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,482
Never convicted.

36
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:29,562
Copy that.

37
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,239
Federal agent!

38
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,505
Rossler is in custody!
I repeat, Rossler is in custody!

39
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:37,600
Answer.

40
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,197
Yes?

41
00:01:39,576 --> 00:01:41,353
We have the identification keys.

42
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:43,877
No!

43
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:46,498
Is he gonna make it?

44
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,158
No. He's dead.

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,338
Rossler's our only link
to those canisters.

46
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:54,202
Erwich's gonna call here any minute.

47
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,847
He's gonna expect to talk to him.

48
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:26,182
What's the situation?

49
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,966
Rossler's dead,
shot by his female companion.

50
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,887
What does that do to our plan?

51
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:32,523
We intended to use Rossler

52
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:34,451
to lead us to Erwich and the Sentox.

53
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:35,564
How?

54
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:37,132
Rossler was going to sell Erwich a chip

55
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,069
that would enable him
to activate the canisters

56
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,009
and release the Sentox.

57
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,371
And we put a tracker on the chip?

58
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,708
Yes, to follow Erwich back
to the canisters.

59
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:45,792
Obviously that plan has to change.

60
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,970
Has Erwich set a time and place
for the meeting yet?

61
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:48,688
No.

62
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:51,390
We've also picked-up increased chatter
related to the canisters.

63
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:52,413
Related how?

64
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:55,267
Erwich's been putting out feelers
to terrorist organizations

65
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:56,951
with sleeper cells established here.

66
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:58,941
He's asking for help
launching nerve gas

67
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:01,082
attacks on larger targets,
across the country.

68
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,952
There's a call coming in
on Rossler's phone.

69
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:05,104
We assume it's Erwich.
What do you want to do?

70
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:06,360
Put it on the speaker.

71
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:14,919
Jack, this has to be Erwich.
CTU is on the line.

72
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,376
You ready?

73
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,196
Yeah.

74
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,548
Five minutes.

75
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:26,089
Roof of the parking garage,
corner of White Oak and Mattison.

76
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,446
One of my men will meet you.

77
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:29,751
Look for a blue van.

78
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:33,452
What do you think?

79
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,710
I think we caught a break.
Give me the chip.

80
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,144
This is Jack Bauer.
Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.

81
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,117
Buchanan.

82
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:49,237
Bill, did you get that?

83
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,393
Yes. Erwich is sending someone else
to the meeting.

84
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:52,306
That's a problem.

85
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:53,405
No, I don't think so.

86
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,386
It means I can pass myself off
as Rossler.

87
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,869
We can keep the meeting.
We can control this thing.

88
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,702
Rossler and the man Erwich is sending
may know each other.

89
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,149
No, he said:
"look for a blue van."

90
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,273
He wouldn't have said that
if they knew each other.

91
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:05,599
It's a big risk, Jack.

92
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,196
Jack, they will probably kill you,

93
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:08,799
even if they do think
you're Rossler.

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,755
It ties up a loose end.

95
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,411
Well, right now,
we don't have a choice.

96
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,794
If we're lucky, this guy
will take the chip back to Erwich.

97
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,530
And that will lead us
to the nerve gas.

98
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,224
All right, Jack. Do it.

99
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:22,945
Thank you.

100
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:26,876
Chloe, Edgar, Jack is gonna need you

101
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,392
to tech support him
through the installation of that chip.

102
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:31,503
- We'll pull up the schematics.
- Already on it.

103
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:36,586
All  right, the chip
you'll be giving them is genuine,

104
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:38,629
but it's useless
without the correct unlock code.

105
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:40,361
The tracker's built
into the chip itself.

106
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,823
Okay. Thanks.

107
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:43,299
How  do you want to play this?

108
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,300
Passive, nonthreatening.

109
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:46,326
I want these people to think
I'm scared of them.

110
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:48,463
All right, get TAC teams ready.
We're on the move.

111
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:50,917
You'll need a new com unit
with fresh battery.

112
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,277
You'll be patched into CTU at all times.

113
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:55,147
With this, we'll be able to hear
everything

114
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,771
within a 20 foot radius of you.

115
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,675
I'll be watching your back.

116
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:00,212
Thanks.

117
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:03,946
Testing, 1, 2, 3. Testing, 1, 2, 3.

118
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,488
He'll be waiting for you there.

119
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:07,322
Let me know if there's a problem.

120
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:14,542
Do we have the new chip yet?

121
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:15,600
N o.

122
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:17,987
I sent Polakov and Komar
to meet Rossler.

123
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,868
They should have it in a few minutes.

124
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:20,726
Anything?

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,892
Remote will always be
the most effective way

126
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,292
of triggering the canisters.

127
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:27,439
I understand, but what if the new chip
doesn't work?

128
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,146
I need options in case Rossler fails us.

129
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,807
There may be a workaround,

130
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,299
but someone will have to be on site
with the canister.

131
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:38,663
Get it done.

132
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,685
Excuse me, Mr. President,
I thought you should know,

133
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,775
Walt's body has been moved
to the Secret Service

134
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,258
outbuilding for the time being.

135
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:53,921
You realize, sir,
we still need

136
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:56,106
to issue a public statement
about his death.

137
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,113
No statement
till his wife's been notified.

138
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,252
Of course.

139
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:03,475
Sir, if you don't mind me saying,

140
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,708
I think perhaps
we have an opportunity here.

141
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,975
This statement you
and Mrs. Logan plan to release...

142
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,849
disclosing the fact that Walt
was part of a conspiracy

143
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,072
to supply the terrorists with nerve gas,

144
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,997
and that he was involved

145
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:19,629
in David Palmer's assassination...

146
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,934
What's your point, Mike?

147
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,010
I'm sorry, sir.

148
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,632
I wonder if his death
might render all that moot.

149
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,121
Go on.

150
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,579
Very little will come
from dragging Walt's name

151
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:36,624
through the mud

152
00:06:36,926 --> 00:06:39,257
when he's not here
to answer for what he's done.

153
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:41,340
And it would be devastating
for this country,

154
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:42,901
particularly if, God forbid,

155
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:46,037
that nerve gas is used against us.

156
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,206
What are you suggesting?

157
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:52,509
We could attribute Walt's suicide
to a despondency

158
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:53,659
over the day's events.

159
00:06:54,464 --> 00:06:55,462
Overwork.

160
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:57,177
Personal issues.

161
00:06:57,436 --> 00:06:59,616
Let him go out with some dignity,
you mean,

162
00:06:59,906 --> 00:07:01,041
and not as a traitor.

163
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:02,560
Yes, sir.

164
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:09,082
My wife will have a considerable problem
with that.

165
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,534
Well... I respect

166
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:14,559
the First Lady's moral conviction,

167
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,654
but this is your decision,

168
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:19,862
not hers.

169
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:36,531
Is there anything else I can get you,
Mrs. Logan?

170
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,152
No, thank you, Evelyn. I'm fine.

171
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,068
Can I ask your advice on something?

172
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,249
Of course.

173
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,229
Some of the staff are asking questions.

174
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:50,264
About?

175
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,541
Walt Cummings' death.

176
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:54,300
Evelyn, I'm helping prepare a statement
right now

177
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,908
that the President's gonna give later.

178
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:57,201
It'll explain everything.

179
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,373
Is there something else, Evelyn?

180
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:03,537
Yes.

181
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:07,550
What?
What is it?

182
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:09,193
Why did he do it?

183
00:08:10,063 --> 00:08:11,507
Why did Walt kill himself?

184
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:15,309
I deserve to know.

185
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:17,498
A violent thing happened to someone

186
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,282
that I work with every day,

187
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,542
someone who had no visible signs
of depression.

188
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:23,318
What if it wasn't suicide?

189
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:25,206
What if we're in danger?

190
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:26,874
I don't know what to think.

191
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:27,960
It was suicide.

192
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,154
How can you be so sure?

193
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:35,040
Evelyn, listen to me.

194
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:40,482
What I'm going to say to you
has to stay in this room

195
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,590
until its made public,
do you understand?

196
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:43,975
You do understand?

197
00:08:44,313 --> 00:08:46,273
Even his family
doesn't know the truth yet.

198
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:47,341
Okay.

199
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:49,368
Walt Cummings was a traitor.

200
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:50,629
What?

201
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,167
I'm not going to go into any details,

202
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,122
but suffice it to say
that Walt was responsible

203
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:56,352
for some of the awful things
that have happened today.

204
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,744
I can't believe that.

205
00:08:57,965 --> 00:08:59,548
The President just found out.

206
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,155
I suppose that Walt
didn't want to face the humiliation

207
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,548
of a long public trial and...

208
00:09:04,865 --> 00:09:06,736
and he decided to kill himself.

209
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:10,435
Was he working with the terrorists?

210
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:14,137
Our enforcement agencies
are trying to figure that out.

211
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:28,051
Jack's arrived at the rendezvous point.

212
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:29,418
Maintain your distance.

213
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,156
All right, head's up.

214
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:42,175
We have a blue van
entering the parking garage,

215
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,983
license plate six-Quebec-four

216
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,239
n ine-nine-five-one.

217
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:47,941
Repeat, six-Quebec-four,
nine-nine-five-one.

218
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,269
Running the plates.

219
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,745
He's heading up the ramp towards you,
Jack.

220
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:00,791
Couldn't get a visual on who's inside.

221
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:06,654
I have a hit from DMV.

222
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,369
The plates don't match the vehicle.

223
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,425
They probably stole the van
and put clean plates on it.

224
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,013
Two men are getting out.

225
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:29,584
Show time.

226
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:35,056
Rossler?

227
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,730
I was told there'd only be one of you.

228
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:40,191
Is that a problem?

229
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,473
Yeah... I don't like surprises.

230
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,902
Relax... we've got your money.

231
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,626
Let me see it.

232
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,168
When I see the chip.

233
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:02,053
Erwich says you have to install it.

234
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:04,050
Where's the remote trigger?

235
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:05,508
Let's go.

236
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:19,391
Okay, Jack,

237
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,253
you need to remove the backing.

238
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:30,939
Inside, there are five jumpers.

239
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,306
Toggle the one in the middle
to the left.

240
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,055
Then pry out the old chip,
do it gently.

241
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:39,333
When it's out,
clear your throat or something.

242
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:50,192
Okay, insert the new chip in the slot,

243
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,834
press the reset button under it.

244
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,626
Screw the back on, and you're done.

245
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,065
The trigger's been reconfigured,

246
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,835
you can activate the canisters now.

247
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,457
You'd better hope it works.

248
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:25,927
You're coming with us,

249
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,082
just to make sure.

250
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:32,627
What are they doing?

251
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:39,744
We are on the move.

252
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,933
This isn't the deal I made with Erwich.

253
00:12:48,496 --> 00:12:50,058
I reconfigured the trigger...

254
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,601
you're supposed to just give me
the money!

255
00:12:54,642 --> 00:12:55,919
Standing by to move in.

256
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:57,650
Hold on, Curtis.

257
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,103
Erwich knows who Jack is,

258
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:00,923
he saw him at the airport.
They'll kill him.

259
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,060
By the time Jack gets close enough
to be recognized,

260
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:04,180
the TAC teams will move in.

261
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:06,188
No, we need to move in now,
take the 2 terrorists

262
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:07,820
and make them tell us where Erwich is.

263
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:08,830
We don't have time.

264
00:13:08,865 --> 00:13:11,118
Erwich will know something's wrong
and we'll lose him.

265
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,060
This is our only shot.

266
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:13,856
Bill?!

267
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,495
Are we letting them take Jack?

268
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,516
I'm awaiting orders.

269
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,737
Stand down, Curtis.

270
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:31,827
Take no action.

271
00:13:32,262 --> 00:13:34,547
Reassemble the TAC teams
and mount a follow operation.

272
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:36,073
All teams stand by.

273
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,044
Lynn's right.

274
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,551
Whatever happens,
Jack can handle it.

275
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:48,565
He has to.

276
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,045
Come in.

277
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:08,591
Excuse me, Mrs. Logan.

278
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:09,645
What is it?

279
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,181
Laura  Campbell gave me
the press release to give to you.

280
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,782
- I'm confused.
- About what?

281
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:14,828
It's not what you said.

282
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:17,027
They're calling Walt Cummings a hero,
not a traitor.

283
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,026
I don't believe this!

284
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:26,807
Well?
Is CTU any closer?

285
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,893
They're mounting
an undercover operation,

286
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,913
which they hope will lead them
to the canisters.

287
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,052
Hope is not good enough.

288
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,132
We want results.

289
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:35,456
You need to make that
abundantly clear to them, Mike!

290
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:36,630
I believe they're doing

291
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:38,415
everything that can be done, sir.

292
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,832
I just read the statement
you issued about Walt's death.

293
00:14:45,727 --> 00:14:47,729
"Stress due to overwork
robbed this country"

294
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,285
"of one of its most dedicated
public servants.

295
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:53,724
"His work with this administration
has..."

296
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,028
You're covering everything up.

297
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,238
I'll wait outside.

298
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:00,896
Don't go anywhere, Mike.

299
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,834
Your fingerprints are all over this.

300
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,766
Charles, we worked on this together.

301
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:07,300
I thought we'd both agreed

302
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:09,625
that you needed to go public
about Walt's involvement

303
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,674
with everything that is going on today.

304
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:13,236
I know. I know you're disappointed,

305
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:14,547
but I think it's obvious

306
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:16,909
that Walt taking his own life
changes things.

307
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,485
What's obvious is that
this is a pack of lies!

308
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,485
Mrs. Logan...

309
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,235
full disclosure would have been
necessary

310
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,918
to ensure Walt faced justice
for what he'd done.

311
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,466
With his death making that a non-issue,

312
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:32,207
it was decided this course
was best for his family.

313
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:33,831
Oh... don't.

314
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:35,868
You don't care
about his family.

315
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,527
You decided that this was best for you.

316
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,413
But, Charles, you are dead wrong...

317
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:41,958
Martha, that's enough!

318
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:43,402
I made my decision...

319
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,763
and I am the president.

320
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:49,231
Which means it's your job
to tell the truth...

321
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:52,472
even when it's ugly.

322
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:56,918
And if you don't, I will.

323
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,195
If you feel so strongly
about telling the truth,

324
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:02,368
you can start with Walt's wife
when she arrives.

325
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:04,361
Suzanne's coming here?

326
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:06,028
To collect her husband's body.

327
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,949
So you can be the one to tell her
that the real reason that Walt took

328
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:10,088
the coward's way out

329
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,951
was because he disgraced himself

330
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,543
and he betrayed his country.

331
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,264
All right.

332
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,382
It'll be very painful...

333
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,271
but it's the right thing to do.

334
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:34,172
We're one mile behind Jack, heading west

335
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,173
on Nordhoff, just passing Sepulveda.

336
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:37,578
Maintain your distance.

337
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,032
We've got them on satellite.
We're not going to lose them.

338
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,394
Where are we going?

339
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:43,050
What does it matter?

340
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:44,207
I have another appointment,

341
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,080
I just want to know
if I'm going to make it.

342
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:47,232
We're almost there.

343
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,474
How long it takes once we get there
is up to you.

344
00:16:50,363 --> 00:16:51,307
What do you mean?

345
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:52,382
I told you.

346
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:53,340
We need to make sure

347
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,634
the remote trigger works
on the canisters.

348
00:17:00,273 --> 00:17:03,138
Oh, my God, you've got
one of the canisters with you.

349
00:17:03,244 --> 00:17:04,805
Erwich wants a field test.

350
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:07,419
I'm not going to be within 50 miles
of that thing

351
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:09,142
when it goes off. We have masks.

352
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:13,667
What's the target?

353
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:20,940
Curtis, are you reading this?

354
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,722
Yeah. You want me to reposition
the TAC team for an intercept?

355
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,996
No! Not till we have a visual
on the canister.

356
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,857
If they stay on Nordhoff,

357
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,292
up ahead there's an industrial park

358
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:30,681
and two retail complexes.

359
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,232
They just turned north.

360
00:17:35,278 --> 00:17:36,252
That's not good.

361
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,974
What is it, Chloe,
what's the potential target?

362
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,696
The Sunrise Hills Mall.

363
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:02,736
Curtis, the intended target is
the Sunrise Hills Mall.

364
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:06,296
Repeat, the intended target
is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

365
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:08,542
Uploading schematics of the mall,

366
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:09,604
surrounding streets,

367
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:10,549
to TAC teams now.

368
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:13,286
All right, all teams stand by
for positioning.

369
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:14,301
We're setting up

370
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,809
at the second level
of the parking structure.

371
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:27,484
This is it.

372
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,942
Curtis?

373
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,382
Do you have Jack on visual?

374
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:44,063
Yeah. He and the two hostiles
are in the south parking lot.

375
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,495
Alpha Team, take the position

376
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:46,683
on the perimeter of the lot.

377
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:48,495
Bravo Team,
I want your plainclothes agents

378
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:50,162
in position at the mall doors.

379
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,809
How are you going to get
the canister inside?

380
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,087
Through the front door.

381
00:18:55,623 --> 00:18:56,610
Anyone asks,

382
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,921
we're working on the air-conditioning.

383
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,253
I didn't agree to this.
I'm not going in.

384
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:02,859
Yes,  you are.

385
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:04,438
Jack is trying to stall for time.

386
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,935
What are we waiting for?

387
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,823
There are hundreds of video cameras
in there.

388
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:09,763
This entire country will know
what we look like

389
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:10,870
in the next few hours.

390
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,373
We want your leaders to know
who did this to them.

391
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:14,370
This is your fight.

392
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:16,543
The deal I made with Erwich
was to sell him the chip,

393
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:18,281
not to get my face all over the news.

394
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,784
Erwich prefers to keep you alive,

395
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:21,128
but only if you cooperate.

396
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:23,135
Now, hand me the jackets.

397
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:27,691
Jack, we're moving the TAC teams in

398
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:30,623
to recover the canister
before you go inside the mall.

399
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:33,344
Fine, let's get this over with.

400
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:39,212
I'll let you know as soon as
we're in position.

401
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:42,525
Sending redeployment orders now.

402
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:43,629
Hold off on that.

403
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,045
What? Lynn?!

404
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:47,508
We have got to stop them
before they get inside.

405
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:48,621
If we move in now,

406
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,123
Erwich will know that we're onto him,

407
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:52,512
and we won't be led
to the other canisters.

408
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,179
Are you talking about
letting them go through with this?

409
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,339
Sacrificing the lives
of all those people?

410
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,061
We're talking about accepting the damage

411
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:02,450
that one canister can do,

412
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,169
versus what the other 19 can do.

413
00:20:04,216 --> 00:20:05,155
This is insane.

414
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:06,200
Bill?!

415
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:08,257
Bill's not in charge here, I am!

416
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:13,227
We need to call the President.

417
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:49,625
I just got into the mall's
internal video surveillance server.

418
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:51,351
We should be able to see Jack.

419
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,085
Jack, we're still waiting
for the President to call.

420
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,862
I'll let you know
as soon as we have him.

421
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:17,271
Can we go to the ice-cream shop
selling up those Sunday bars?

422
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:18,811
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

423
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,104
<i>I need flavors you like,
I'll bring out the sauces...</i>

424
00:21:21,132 --> 00:21:22,747
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

425
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,427
Get the security guard.
Knock on the glass.

426
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:51,837
- What are you guys doing here?
- Servicing the HVAC units.

427
00:21:52,297 --> 00:21:53,694
We didn't get a call about that.

428
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,730
I don't know what to tell you. We did.

429
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:56,876
You got paperwork?

430
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:58,095
Just a minute.

431
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:12,757
Will this work?

432
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:13,776
Yeah.

433
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:15,839
Do it.

434
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:17,944
Throw me the bag.

435
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:20,826
And your jacket.

436
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,986
Mr. Buchanan,
the president is on line one.

437
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:39,950
Put him through.

438
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,562
Jack, we have the President on the line.

439
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:43,840
I'm gonna patch you in.

440
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:44,899
Go head?

441
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:46,501
Mr. President, this is Lynn McGill.

442
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:48,057
You also have Bill Buchanan,

443
00:22:48,252 --> 00:22:51,317
Audrey Raines, Chloe O'Brian,
and Edgar Stiles in the room.

444
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:52,118
Go ahead.

445
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,644
Sir, we're calling you for a decision

446
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,461
on a critical operational matter.

447
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:56,429
What is it?

448
00:22:57,128 --> 00:23:00,183
Jack Bauer is currently undercover
with some of the terrorists.

449
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:02,441
They're expecting Jack
to help them release

450
00:23:02,442 --> 00:23:04,497
a single canister of Sentox nerve gas

451
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:06,561
in the Sunrise Hills Shopping Mall

452
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,958
where they are right now

453
00:23:08,028 --> 00:23:09,837
Well, then arrest them.
What's the problem?

454
00:23:09,884 --> 00:23:12,901
Sir, the problem is,
if we don't maintain Jack's cover,

455
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:14,916
there's no guarantee
that they'll lead us back

456
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:16,260
to the other 19 canisters.

457
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:21,396
Do you mean actually let them
release the Sentox?

458
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:23,009
Are you out of your mind?!

459
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:24,989
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan.

460
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:27,112
I had the same initial reaction.

461
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,207
Then I looked at our updated scenarios.

462
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,270
With the help of other terrorist
organizations,

463
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,710
the remaining 19 canisters

464
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,155
could be deployed at other,
more crowded public areas, such as

465
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:38,986
subway stations, hospitals
and sports arenas, sir.

466
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,832
The loss of life could exceed

467
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,610
hundreds of thousands of people.

468
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:46,384
My God.

469
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,015
Bring it over here.

470
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,114
What kind of casualties

471
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:09,576
are you predicting at the mall?

472
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:12,361
We don't have exact numbers,
but based on our video surveillance,

473
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,903
our best guess is between eight
and nine hundred.

474
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,328
Sir, many of them are children.

475
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,597
Can't you evacuate the mall?

476
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,863
Not without the terrorists knowing.

477
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:26,529
The public will not tolerate
the government's complicity in this.

478
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:28,564
They wouldn't know, sir.

479
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:30,821
This would be a covert decision.

480
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,340
We are monitoring the terrorists.
We know at 100% that

481
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,497
when they'll leave the mall,

482
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:39,209
they are going back
to the remaining canisters.

483
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:48,403
What's your recommendation?

484
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,792
Bill Buchanan and I agree

485
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:52,176
that the greatest good would be served
by allowing them

486
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:55,246
to release this single canister
of Sentox nerve gas.

487
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:57,468
And I believe, sir,
that we have no right

488
00:24:57,469 --> 00:24:59,565
to sanction the deaths
of innocent people.

489
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,966
We should take our chances,
interrogate these men,

490
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:04,467
and find the location
of the other canisters.

491
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:10,303
Are we ready?

492
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:11,244
Almost.

493
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,176
Mr. President,
we're running out of time.

494
00:25:17,177 --> 00:25:18,329
We need your decision, sir.

495
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:21,180
This is a field operation.

496
00:25:21,181 --> 00:25:22,014
It's up to you.

497
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:24,984
With all due respect, Mr. President,
it's not.

498
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,553
We don't have the legal authority

499
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:28,498
to make this decision, only you do.

500
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:34,894
You're putting me
in a terrible position.

501
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:35,982
Hold on.

502
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:39,367
Mike?

503
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,894
CTU has laid out the facts well.

504
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,909
But you have to make the call.

505
00:25:54,118 --> 00:25:54,918
All right.

506
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:58,618
The terrorists are forcing us
to make a tragic choice.

507
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:01,807
I'll go along with your assessment.

508
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:03,182
Let them release the Sentox.

509
00:26:03,183 --> 00:26:05,118
But you better find
those other canisters

510
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,285
or those people will have died in vain.

511
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:13,938
Pull our TAC teams out of the mall.

512
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,981
Jack, you heard
the president's decision.

513
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:18,626
Let's go.

514
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,585
Put your masks on.

515
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:25,610
Go and arm the valve.

516
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:30,776
What's the unlock code?

517
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:34,647
Jack, the unlock code
is alpha-kilo-charlie.

518
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:38,867
I repeat, alpha-kilo-charlie.

519
00:26:39,718 --> 00:26:41,700
Come on!
What's the unlock code?!

520
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,427
Alpha-kilo-charlie.

521
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,501
Echo-bravo-charlie.

522
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,696
Enter the correct code, Jack.
That's an order.

523
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:01,928
Jack, this is a direct order
from the president!

524
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:04,838
Now enter the correct code,
let them release the gas!

525
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,036
Now!

526
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:07,800
It's not arming the canister.

527
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,216
Why isn't it working?

528
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,066
Maybe the remote's been damaged.

529
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,767
Make it work or I'll kill you.

530
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,167
There's nothing I can do.

531
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,234
Make it work!

532
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,385
I told you there's
nothing I can do!

533
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,934
Jack, can you hear me?

534
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,082
Yes?

535
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,633
We can't arm the canisters!

536
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:38,008
What is the problem?

537
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:40,167
Rossler says he doesn't know.

538
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:42,004
- Do you believe him?
- I don't know.

539
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,267
Should I kill him?

540
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:48,496
Not until we are sure we have
another way to release the gas.

541
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:52,000
Andrei thinks
he's discovered an alternative.

542
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,267
I'll put him on.

543
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,113
Get him in the other room.

544
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,167
Polakov.

545
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:26,790
What's going on?

546
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:29,434
Andrei thinks he may have
another way to release the gas.

547
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,746
Now move the jumper over.

548
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:04,963
Expose the red and yellow wire.

549
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:07,500
Hang on, I'm gonna
put you on speakerphone.

550
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,467
Are you sure the valve
can't open without warning?

551
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,013
If you make a mistake, it could,

552
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,668
so pay attention.

553
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,556
Five more splices to go.

554
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,259
Which one now?

555
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:21,619
The orange wire next to...

556
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:23,427
Exactly as before.

557
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,233
The white wire and the blue wire,

558
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:28,793
connect them directly
to the socket

559
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,895
and to the release valve itself.

560
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,027
Get the masks.
We're almost ready.

561
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,352
Lynn, there is still time
to move in and stop them

562
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,831
before they murder
all those people.

563
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,752
Audrey, we have a directive
from the president.

564
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:53,596
The president's not looking
at these children

565
00:29:53,631 --> 00:29:55,086
whose death warrant he just signed.

566
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,040
Don't you realize how many
more people could die

567
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:59,212
if these men don't lead us
to the other 19 canisters?

568
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:00,919
They could.
That's theoretical right now.

569
00:30:00,943 --> 00:30:03,167
Those children will die within minutes!

570
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,694
Look at them. Look at the monitors!

571
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:06,349
- Audrey, that's enough.
- No, it's not.

572
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:07,971
Tell me,
if you were in Jack's shoes,

573
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,598
could you follow
through with that order,

574
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,676
stand by and watch as they murder
all those people?

575
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:13,651
This is war.
There are going to be casualties.

576
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:15,955
And if those are orders
of the president, yes!

577
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,305
I would have to.

578
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:20,569
I hope that's not true.

579
00:30:23,336 --> 00:30:24,828
For your sake.

580
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:27,223
Got two more wires to go.

581
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:36,634
All right, the wires are together.

582
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:38,195
Put your mask on.

583
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:40,661
Next pair you splice
will open the valve.

584
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:42,705
Go kill Rossler.

585
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,772
Polakov.
Polakov! Polakov!

586
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:44,983
Jack, can you hear me?

587
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:56,527
What's happening, Jack?

588
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:57,690
What's your status?

589
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,416
I've managed to stop
the flow of gas,

590
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,954
but some got into the air system.

591
00:32:01,012 --> 00:32:03,112
We need to evacuate the mall, now.

592
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:04,181
What about the terrorists?

593
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:05,402
One's dead, one escaped.

594
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:08,044
Have Curtis and his men
start looking for them.

595
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,394
Curtis, this is Buchanan.

596
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:11,449
Move in, now. About time. Move in!

597
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:13,534
Move in! All teams, move in!

598
00:32:16,498 --> 00:32:17,937
You! Against the wall!

599
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:19,052
I'm a federal agent.

600
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:21,648
Terrorists have released
a toxic substance into the air system.

601
00:32:21,684 --> 00:32:23,703
You need to evacuate people now.

602
00:32:23,868 --> 00:32:24,866
This is not a joke.

603
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:25,916
This is not a robbery

604
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:27,607
or a drill... do it now!

605
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,239
Uh, we have a red alert.

606
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,278
Begin evacuation procedures immediately!

607
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:33,176
Where is the power source
for the air system?

608
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:34,338
It's next to the food court.

609
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:35,830
The control room door's right there.

610
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,507
Get everybody out now!

611
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:40,266
Proceed to the nearest mall exit
in an orderly fashion.

612
00:32:40,313 --> 00:32:42,390
A mall evacuation is in progress.

613
00:32:42,871 --> 00:32:44,434
I repeat: the mall

614
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:45,867
is being evacuated.

615
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:48,234
Everyone inside the building
must proceed

616
00:32:48,276 --> 00:32:50,600
to the nearest exit as quickly
and as safely as possible.

617
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:52,146
Curtis, do you copy?

618
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,866
Yeah, Jack, we're
closing in on the mall.

619
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,338
I'm going to try and shut down
the air system in the mall.

620
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:58,414
I do not have a visual on the hostile.

621
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:00,821
Make sure your men take him alive.

622
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,136
Understood.

623
00:33:57,028 --> 00:33:58,156
Curtis, it's Jack.

624
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,412
The Sentox that escaped
has managed to stay

625
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:01,634
in the food court.

626
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,595
We've got at least 11 people down.

627
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:04,640
I need assistance.

628
00:34:04,699 --> 00:34:06,566
I need assistance now!

629
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:07,682
Got it.

630
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,690
Sweetheart, can you hear me?

631
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:11,534
I want you to hold the mask.

632
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:13,439
when I take it off, okay?

633
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:17,833
Here you go.

634
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,055
All right, everyone, masks on.

635
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:26,942
Inject anyone who's down.

636
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:28,762
Get them outside as soon as possible.

637
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,735
I need a shot of atropine
for a child under 12!

638
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,638
Curtis, give me that
jacket for her head.

639
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:41,163
I'm losing her!

640
00:34:49,982 --> 00:34:51,286
Come on.

641
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:54,208
She's responding.

642
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:55,546
Her pulse is stabilizing.

643
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,213
Jack, we've secured the exits.

644
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:59,472
We don't have a visual
on the other terrorist.

645
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,963
If he got out of the mall

646
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:03,750
before we locked down, he may be lost.

647
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:06,509
And our only remaining chance
of finding Erwich.

648
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:08,952
Monitor the tracking device
in the remote trigger.

649
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:11,434
The hostile that escaped
still had it on him.

650
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,738
Chloe?

651
00:35:13,642 --> 00:35:15,838
Jack's right: the signal's moving

652
00:35:15,873 --> 00:35:18,253
away from the mall.
Looks like he's on foot.

653
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:19,275
Michaels.

654
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,177
Jack and I are going
after the remote trigger.

655
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:23,564
You're in charge here.
Report directly to Bill Buchanan.

656
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,392
Walsh, gather your team. You're with us.

657
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,467
Don't be scared.

658
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:29,700
You're gonna be all right.

659
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:31,332
This man's going to take care of you.

660
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:46,651
Yes.

661
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:48,268
Rossler... or whoever he was...

662
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,671
killed Komar and tried to stop us.

663
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:52,442
What are you talking about? Why?

664
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:53,475
I don't know!

665
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:55,649
I managed to activate the valve
before I got away.

666
00:36:56,229 --> 00:36:58,343
At least some of the gas
was released in the mall.

667
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,523
You sure
you're not being followed?

668
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:03,671
Yes.

669
00:37:03,823 --> 00:37:05,383
What do you want me to do?

670
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,761
Come back.

671
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,235
I'll be there soon.

672
00:37:15,357 --> 00:37:16,790
He's turning left on Reese.

673
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:19,056
We're six blocks out.

674
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,413
Hold on, Mr. McGill.

675
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,350
I'll connect you to the President.

676
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,478
Yes.

677
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:30,073
Mr. President, I know this is
not what your order stipulated.

678
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:31,396
That's why I thought I had

679
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:32,864
to let you know what was happening.

680
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,557
What's happening is
I sent you over there

681
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,095
to make sure CTU was running smoothly

682
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:37,099
in a time of crisis,

683
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:38,931
and you seem to be incapable doing that.

684
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:40,831
Sir, Bauer refused the order.

685
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:42,043
There was nothing I could do.

686
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:43,341
No. I don't want excuses.

687
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:44,679
Just do your job.

688
00:37:44,738 --> 00:37:47,034
And if you can't do it,
I'll find somebody else who can.

689
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:49,313
The estimates from the mall
are much lower

690
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,133
than we originally anticipated.

691
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:55,152
It appears the fatalities will be
limited to between 10 and 20 people.

692
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:57,234
Thank God.

693
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,425
So, what are we telling the media?

694
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,507
Nothing yet.

695
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:04,574
CTU is maintaining a blackout
on the ground there

696
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:07,154
until we give them direction
on a cover story.

697
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,067
What about the other 19 canisters?

698
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:11,368
CTU has a terrorist

699
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,502
under surveillance as we speak.

700
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,531
They believe there's a good chance

701
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:17,867
he'll lead them to Erwich
and the rest of the canisters.

702
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:20,268
All right, good.

703
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:22,962
There's something else, sir.

704
00:38:23,444 --> 00:38:26,234
Suzanne Cummings has arrived
to claim Walt's body.

705
00:38:27,453 --> 00:38:29,734
Martha is on her way
to speak with her now.

706
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:33,969
Thank you, Mike.

707
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:04,054
Suzanne.

708
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:09,467
Hi, honey.

709
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:17,177
I can't believe he's gone.

710
00:39:18,137 --> 00:39:19,301
I'm sorry.

711
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:22,449
I'm so, so sorry.

712
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:25,486
I should have been with him today.

713
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:28,217
- Don't do this.
- I wanted to be.

714
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:30,481
Honey, don't, don't do that.
Don't blame yourself.

715
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:40,934
You know how much we love you, honey.

716
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:44,056
And no matter what you need,

717
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:45,771
we'll always be here for you.

718
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:49,433
I just don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

719
00:39:52,528 --> 00:39:53,855
You were with him today.

720
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,388
Why, Martha, why in the world

721
00:39:58,914 --> 00:40:00,867
would... Walt do this?

722
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:06,739
Suzanne...

723
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,264
Walt...

724
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:15,921
loved this country.

725
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:23,936
And he loved you.

726
00:40:32,654 --> 00:40:34,751
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:35,638 --> 00:40:37,810
I think I need a moment.

728
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,497
Of course. All right.

729
00:41:10,895 --> 00:41:13,689
He's slowing down. He's stopping.

730
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:15,634
Cross-referencing with the street grid.

731
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:19,645
He's in front of 1136 East Muldauer.

732
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,786
Bill, we're going to have
to hit him hard and fast,

733
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:24,627
to try and stop him from releasing
any more Sentox from the canisters.

734
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:25,672
Agreed.

735
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,274
Set up a perimeter

736
00:41:28,415 --> 00:41:29,858
and begin your approach.

737
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:31,400
All right, teams,
we're moving in.

738
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,204
Put your gas masks on.

739
00:42:07,819 --> 00:42:09,944
Team B, take the front entrance
off the street.

740
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:12,067
We're taking the side.
Go now. Go.

741
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:19,132
Yes.

742
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,188
You were followed.

743
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,374
I don't know how.

744
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:22,500
It doesn't matter.

745
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:24,282
You know what to do.

746
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:26,172
Yes.

747
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:30,567
No!

748
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:32,735
Hostile down! I repeat!

749
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:34,594
Hostile down!

750
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,499
Erwich's gone!

751
00:42:39,297 --> 00:42:40,799
Curtis, have your men call in now.

752
00:42:41,668 --> 00:42:42,972
Team A, Team B, report.

753
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:46,476
Come on, guys. What do you got?

754
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,226
There's nobody here.

755
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:49,483
Place is empty.

756
00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:51,609
Erwich is gone. The canisters are gone.

757
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:52,795
We've got nothing here!

758
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:54,433
Damn it!

759
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:02,863
