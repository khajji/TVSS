1
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,134
The terrorists
are controlling

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,101
the main terminal
at Ontario Airport.

3
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:18,567
Today, your president
and the president of Russia

4
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:22,500
have come together to sign
an anti-terrorism alliance.

5
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,367
I have hostages.

6
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:27,434
( on TV ):
Unless President Logan
and President Suvarov

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,500
make a joint statement
repudiating this accord,

8
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,300
I will order their execution.

9
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:33,901
I want this handled!

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,801
Do you understand?

11
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:36,967
I don't care how you do it.
I don't care what it takes.

12
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,901
Fix it!

13
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,367
David Palmer called me
last night.

14
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:44,233
He said it was a matter
of national security.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,901
Those were his exact words.

16
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,901
PALMER:
I need to talk to you.

17
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,667
It's hardly a matter
of national security.

18
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,467
That's not what he said.
Yes, it is.

19
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:53,233
No, that is a trick.

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,367
MARTHA:
I know that all phone
conversations are recorded.

21
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:57,434
Where do they store
those transcripts?

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,434
Archive room,
down the hall.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,867
This is Bill Buchanan.

24
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:04,101
I'm hoping we can
resolve this peacefully.

25
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:06,567
I don't think you understand
just how serious we are.

26
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,434
You make any efforts
to enter the tunnel,

27
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,634
you will spend the rest of
the day collecting body parts.

28
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,901
Jack, I'm going to need you

29
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:14,834
to quarterback this thing
from inside.

30
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:15,967
I'm staring straight down

31
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,400
on the main concourse.

32
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:19,168
We've got six hostiles
wearing explosive vests.

33
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,534
We have to assume their orders

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,300
are to detonate
if we try to make a move.

35
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,267
Hey, I got a woman--
Diane Huxley--

36
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,801
says she has info for CTU.

37
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,034
Diane, what's going on?
What's wrong?

38
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:28,934
Derek is inside the terminal.

39
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,734
You!

40
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:32,001
No...

41
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,434
JACK:
Curtis, they're moving

42
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,233
another one of the hostages.

43
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,134
Oh, my God, it's Derek.

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,634
You have a problem
at the terminal.

45
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,333
Jack Bauer is inside
providing recon

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,901
for CTU's rescue operation.

47
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,567
( loud static )

48
00:01:44,634 --> 00:01:46,400
Mr. Bauer,

49
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:49,467
Derek has five
seconds left to live.

50
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,634
Four, three...

51
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:53,001
Beresch!

52
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:13,134
We've been trying from here,

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
but we still
can't make contact with Jack.

54
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,567
Can you make a visual, Curtis?

55
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:18,500
Negative.

56
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:19,867
Maybe Jack went dark
intentionally.

57
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,200
Unlikely. He was
talking to us

58
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,600
when his transmission
cut off.

59
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,567
We have to assume
he's been captured or killed.

60
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:27,634
Which means we need to mount
this assault without his help.

61
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,068
Without Jack
directing our teams,

62
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,101
success probability
falls to less than 20%.

63
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,101
President Logan is going
to sign this treaty

64
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:34,500
in less than an hour.

65
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:36,300
If the terrorists
are still in control,

66
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:37,600
they'll kill
all the hostages.

67
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,500
What do you want
me to do, Bill?

68
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:43,300
Work up an assault plan
that doesn't include Jack.

69
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:44,667
All right, I'm going back
to the staging area.

70
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:46,400
We'll coordinate from there.

71
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,001
Back to your stations.

72
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,767
Prepare to reconfigure.

73
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,400
All teams,
stand down.

74
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,434
We're working up
a new mission profile.

75
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:15,600
Mr. Bauer,
what is CTU's assault plan?

76
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,434
The boy means something to you--
otherwise,

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,901
you wouldn't have given
yourself up so easily.

78
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,867
Tell me the plan.

79
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:31,600
They're going to storm

80
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,934
the north concourse doors
on my command.

81
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,267
I'm coordinating the operation
from in here.

82
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,600
Is there anyone else inside?

83
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,068
No.

84
00:03:41,134 --> 00:03:44,034
Get me the plans
to the terminal.

85
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:47,967
You've been a great help.

86
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:51,333
We'll keep the boy.

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Bring me
another hostage.

88
00:03:58,034 --> 00:04:00,001
Anything you do in here today

89
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:02,567
will not stop that treaty
from being signed.

90
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,367
The United States Government

91
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:06,434
does not negotiate with
terrorists-- you know that.

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,867
Your president is a weak man.

93
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:11,967
He'll back down
once more blood is spilled.

94
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,667
Not him.

95
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,434
Move! Move!
I'm not your enemy...

96
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,434
Please... Please,
you don't have to do this.

97
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Vlad.

98
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,767
I can help you buy
more time-- please!

99
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:38,168
No! You don't have
to do this now.

100
00:04:46,801 --> 00:04:49,068
CTU was supposed to have raided
the terminal by now.

101
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:51,001
Why haven't we
heard from them?

102
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,567
Bill Buchanan said
they had a setback.

103
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,068
What kind of setback?

104
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:55,734
They lost contact
with Jack Bauer.

105
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,233
( phone ringing )
Why? What happened to him?

106
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,001
They're not sure
what happened to him,

107
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,701
but they need to reconfigure
their assault plan. Yeah.

108
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:04,034
I'll tell the President.

109
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:09,333
Beresch is transmitting
from the terminal.

110
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
He's got
another hostage.

111
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:13,367
BERESCH:
We have waited patiently

112
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,634
for you to renounce
this unholy pact

113
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:20,001
with our oppressors,
but we have heard nothing.

114
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:24,667
This is the cost
of that silence.

115
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:26,134
( gunshot )

116
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,233
( hostages screaming )

117
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,534
BERESCH:
What happens next is
your choice, Mr. President.

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,101
If you choose to sign
this corrupt document,

119
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,667
understand that you will also be

120
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:43,300
staining it with the blood
of the remaining hostages.

121
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:50,634
If CTU can't pull
this off in time,

122
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:53,267
that's upwards
of 60 people, Mike.

123
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,901
You know I've never
done anything

124
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,567
in my presidency
that I didn't feel

125
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:58,901
was right for the country.

126
00:05:58,967 --> 00:05:59,934
Of course not, sir.

127
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,434
Nobody thinks otherwise.

128
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,667
I know I'm ambitious,

129
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:12,467
that I want this treaty to be
the hallmark of my presidency,

130
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:15,434
but I never thought I would
sacrifice innocent life.

131
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,701
Mr. President,

132
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,834
you are not responsible for
the actions of these murderers.

133
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,333
I could postpone this.
Sir?!

134
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,834
I give them what they want,
maybe nobody else has to die.

135
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:28,001
Do you think these
people would actually
release the hostages?

136
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:30,901
We both know that
would never happen.

137
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,867
You're doing the only thing
you can do.

138
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,101
TV REPORTER:
The terrorists, calling the
treaty an "unholy pact..."

139
00:06:45,168 --> 00:06:46,934
Mrs. Logan, if someone
altered the recording,

140
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,567
of your conversation
with David Palmer,

141
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,367
the President needs to know.

142
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:52,467
No. Not now. Not yet.

143
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,168
What are you waiting for?

144
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,634
Charles is much
too preoccupied.

145
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,967
Between the summit and
the hostage situation,

146
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,934
he's not in the frame of
mind to deal with this.

147
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:03,567
Besides, he thinks
I'm unstable.

148
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:05,967
Which means I have
to show it to him

149
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,200
in just the right way.

150
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,734
So, until the treaty is signed,

151
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,434
I'm not letting this
out of my sight.

152
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,168
( indistinct
radio transmissions )

153
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,534
What's happening?

154
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,034
I'm sorry, I don't
have time to explain.

155
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:26,400
You said you were going in
to get the hostages.

156
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:27,934
We lost contact with Jack.

157
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:29,267
What does that mean?

158
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,500
We're not sure
what happened.

159
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,233
But we need to change
our assault plan.

160
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,667
Is Jack okay?
We don't know.

161
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:35,034
What about Derek?
As soon as we get

162
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,333
more information,
I'll make sure you're told.

163
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,434
Please, I...

164
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,534
Ms. Huxley...
I need to go.

165
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,834
REPORTER:
The situation here continues
to grow more tragic.

166
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,300
We've just received
a video feed

167
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,068
confirming that another hostage
has been executed

168
00:07:54,134 --> 00:07:56,434
inside the main terminal
at Ontario Airport.

169
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,834
Jack...
Don't say anything.

170
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,434
We're going to get through this.

171
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,101
Just don't say anything
right now.

172
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:03,600
TV REPORTER:
...White House spokesperson
confirms

173
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,367
and reiterates
the President's intention

174
00:08:05,434 --> 00:08:09,168
to sign the historic pact
with his Russian counterpart

175
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:11,267
as scheduled.

176
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,101
You're going to call CTU

177
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:27,134
and tell them you've revised
your assault profile.

178
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,101
Tell them to come
to the emergency door

179
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:32,734
south of gate 12.

180
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:35,134
They won't just do that
because I ask them to.

181
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,701
They'll need an explanation.

182
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,101
That's your concern,
Mr. Bauer.

183
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:49,001
Overwrite volume four
with the approach vectors,

184
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:50,467
and re-key with
the airport grid.

185
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:52,267
Okay, hold on,
just for one second.

186
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,534
We don't have one second.
We're running out of time
to save the hostages.

187
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,934
Want some help, Spenser?

188
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,734
He doesn't need
any help.

189
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:59,634
Just keep managing the
two-ways or else we're
gonna have dropout.

190
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,667
Excuse me.

191
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:02,867
You're Ms. O'Brian, right?

192
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:03,967
Who are you?

193
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:06,500
Lynn McGill.
I'm from District.

194
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,200
I met you when you came out for
that memory management lecture.

195
00:09:08,267 --> 00:09:10,467
If you say so.
What do you need?

196
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:12,400
I need to talk to Bill Buchanan.
Is he around?

197
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:15,434
He's in the Situation Room.
He's kind of busy right now.

198
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,434
I see him. Thanks.

199
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,467
I look forward to
working with you today.

200
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:24,934
You don't know
who Lynn McGill is, do you?

201
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,634
No, and I don't care.
Get back to work.

202
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,333
BUCHANAN:
Once Curtis and his
teams go in there,

203
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,333
I want an update

204
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,467
on deployment of HRT.

205
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:45,400
Hi.

206
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,934
Mr. Buchanan, I assume
they told you I was coming.

207
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,901
Lynn, please... call me Bill.

208
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,233
If we were having a beer
or something,

209
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,634
but at work,
it's better if we maintain

210
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:54,734
a more formal mode of address.

211
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,934
Whatever makes you
feel comfortable.

212
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,701
Look, we're in the middle
of final prep here...

213
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,300
I know; I understand President
Logan wants us

214
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,867
to go into the terminal
as soon as possible.

215
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:04,168
Yes, before the
treaty is signed.

216
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,567
Is Curtis Manning ready
to send his teams in?

217
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:08,500
He is, but we're flying blind.

218
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,967
My briefing sheet says
that we have Jack Bauer

219
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,801
on the inside.
And we haven't heard

220
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,068
from him for close
to 20 minutes now.

221
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:15,333
Well, that's interesting.

222
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,500
Lynn, I read the bulletin
from Division,

223
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:20,701
but I still don't know
why you're here.

224
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,867
District was getting heat
from the White House.

225
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:23,867
Heat about what?

226
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,333
Jack Bauer.

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,500
They just want to know things
are running smoothly.

228
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:28,600
We're on track, Lynn.

229
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:29,734
Well, I'm sure you are...

230
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,034
but that's my assignment.

231
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,034
Is your tactical wired through
to all the servers?

232
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,500
Yes, it is-- you can go ahead
and plug into Station Four.

233
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,934
I'd prefer to work from
your office, Mr. Buchanan.

234
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,534
I hate to displace you,

235
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,567
but I think I should have
a central vantage point,

236
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:44,101
and I just want to make sure
that you're okay

237
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,168
working from another station.

238
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:48,400
Fine.

239
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,168
Good.

240
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,734
And, uh, it's not a big deal,

241
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:53,500
but just so that everyone's
clear on the chain of command,

242
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,168
I think you should address me
as Mr. McGill

243
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:57,134
in front of
the others.

244
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,767
You know, Lynn,
I'd rather not.

245
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:03,200
Just a suggestion.

246
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,734
Anyway, I need your office.
And that's not a suggestion.

247
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,701
( intercom beeps )
Fine.

248
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,300
( over intercom ):
Mr. Buchanan, it's Jack Bauer
on line one.

249
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,300
Is Curtis plugged into
this call?

250
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:16,367
CURTIS:
I'm on, Bill.

251
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:17,867
Go ahead, put Jack through.

252
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,400
( over intercom ):
You're both on with Jack Bauer.

253
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,734
Jack, what happened?

254
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:22,967
One of the hostiles
got too close,

255
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,801
I had to end
the transmission.

256
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,701
CURTIS:
All right, we'll restart
the countdown.

257
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:27,901
Negative, Curtis.

258
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,001
We need to scrap
the existing plan,

259
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,600
find a new breach point.

260
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,267
My men are already
in position.

261
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,001
They moved the hostages
within the kill zone.

262
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,600
They'll be taken out
with the crossfire.

263
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:40,300
There's an emergency door
just south of gate 12.

264
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,834
It's unguarded.

265
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,801
You should be able to punch
through with no opposition.

266
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:46,767
I see it, but I'm not
comfortable with
this entry point.

267
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:49,467
It's the only shot
we've got.

268
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,934
Are you there now?

269
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,300
Yes. It's clear.

270
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,101
I'm in a flank two position.

271
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:56,901
I repeat,
I am in flank two position.

272
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,867
Curtis, how long before
your teams can redeploy?

273
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,168
About 20 minutes.

274
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:02,634
The President's going
to sign that treaty

275
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,101
within 30 minutes.

276
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:05,767
I'll go as fast
as I can.

277
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,134
Jack, I'll call you when
my men are in position.
You can call us in.

278
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,168
Copy that.
I'll be standing by.

279
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,300
Ivan and Ishmael,

280
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:19,367
stay with the hostages.

281
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,134
The rest of you
come here.

282
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,434
Vlad, guard them.

283
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:46,734
Manning.

284
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:47,701
It's Buchanan.

285
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,834
How long until your people are

286
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,101
ready to move on the terrorists?

287
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:51,101
About 15 minutes.

288
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,467
Why so long?

289
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,367
When Jack called and
changed the breach point,

290
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,300
I had to modify everything,
including the explosives.

291
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,867
They have to be
repositioned
precisely.

292
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,333
Maybe it's a mistake
to write down

293
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,001
Jack's new information.
It might take too long.

294
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:03,500
Jack's aware of our deadline.
If he didn't think it was worth

295
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:05,267
the delay, he wouldn't
have made the call.

296
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,434
I trust him.

297
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,467
All right, Curtis, 15 minutes.

298
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:10,267
You have to make this happen.

299
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,767
I will.

300
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,300
Call when you're in position.

301
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:17,001
Mr. Buchanan? Mr. McGill needs
to see you in his office.

302
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:18,600
It'll have to wait.
Tell him I'm busy.

303
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:19,934
He said it had to be now.

304
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:22,534
Fine.

305
00:13:29,168 --> 00:13:31,634
No, I'm settled in fine.

306
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:33,500
If I need anything, I'll call.
Thanks, Donna.

307
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,134
What is it, Lynn?
I'm up to my ears

308
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,001
trying to coordinate this
hostage situation.

309
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,467
Sit down, Mr. Buchanan.

310
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,101
Would you stop
with the "Mr. Buchanan"?

311
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:42,034
We need to get this assault
in motion now.

312
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:43,834
Sit down, Bill.

313
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:52,634
I informed the White House
that the rescue operation
is back on track.

314
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:53,600
Thank you.

315
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,001
I must admit, though, I felt

316
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,068
a little inappropriate
talking about an operation

317
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,534
that I didn't personally review,

318
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,634
so before you send your
men into the terminal,

319
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,400
I'd like to see the Playbook.

320
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,600
Look, I can't have you

321
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,200
micro-managing
my work here, Lynn.

322
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,467
If you want to do my job,
just let me know.

323
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:08,467
I'll go home.

324
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:09,567
Please don't be defensive.

325
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,034
I'm not challenging you.

326
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,467
I'm just trying to do my job.

327
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:13,934
( sighs )

328
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,867
I'll have Chloe send it
to your laptop.

329
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,233
Anything else?

330
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,600
That's all for now.

331
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,434
Bill?

332
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,867
Fighting me isn't going
to increase our chances

333
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,267
of saving those people's lives.

334
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,634
Lynn wants to look
at the revised assault plan.

335
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,101
Send it to him.

336
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,600
Does that mean he's running
point, instead of you?

337
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,734
It just means he wants
to see the plan, Chloe.

338
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,068
Bill, Curtis
just confirmed

339
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,168
that his team will be ready
in ten minutes

340
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,367
based on Jack's new intel.

341
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,567
TV REPORTER:
As of this time, there is no
word as to whether

342
00:14:57,634 --> 00:14:59,567
or not the president is going to
call off the signing

343
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:02,600
of the historic treaty agreement
between the United States

344
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:05,600
and Russia scheduled
for just under an hour.

345
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,867
There been any response
from the White House

346
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,400
since we killed
the last hostage?

347
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:13,068
They released their statement
confirming the signing

348
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,267
of the treaty is going
ahead as planned.

349
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,467
They won't capitulate,
as long as they think

350
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,467
their rescue attempt
will succeed.

351
00:15:19,534 --> 00:15:21,300
Once we kill them, then

352
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:25,101
they'll realize their
options have run out.

353
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:36,500
The only chance these people
had of being rescued

354
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,901
is gone because of me.

355
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,734
People were going to die here
today, Derek.

356
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:44,034
That was their plan.
This is not your fault.

357
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,801
I'm the reason you went
along with them.

358
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,600
If I wasn't here...

359
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,400
Stop it.
( sniffling )

360
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:53,168
This is not over.

361
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,101
TV REPORTER:
While there has been
no official rebuke

362
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,068
of the terrorists' demands,
statements from the White House

363
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:05,134
appear to confirm the
president's position

364
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,634
is unchanged, and that the
treaty will be signed

365
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,701
within the hour, as scheduled.

366
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,967
That puts the lives
of the approximately 60 men,

367
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:14,834
women and children being held as
hostage in question.

368
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,001
Were the terrorists to carry out
their intentions...

369
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:18,467
Good news, sir.

370
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,767
CTU has reestablished contact
with Jack Bauer.

371
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,567
The rescue operation

372
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:25,300
is back on track.

373
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,300
But that's still
no guarantee.

374
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,834
Excuse me, sir?

375
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:31,534
The hostages may be killed
when we go in there.

376
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,434
Let's be honest.
That's more likely than not.

377
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,333
We don't know that, sir.

378
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,500
President Suvarov
is waiting for you outside.

379
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,934
You're walking
outside together

380
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,300
onto the stage.

381
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:45,701
We all agreed to the protocol.

382
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:46,901
It's time already?

383
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:49,734
Yes, sir.

384
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:58,300
Mr. President.
Shall we?

385
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,934
My people have just
informed me that the
assault has been delayed.

386
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,333
It's happening now.
It will happen

387
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,068
before the treaty is signed.
Don't worry.

388
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:08,967
Mr. President, like you,
I have staked

389
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:12,367
much of my political future
on the success of this treaty.

390
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,233
If this rescue
attempt fails

391
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,101
it will not only be
rendered meaningless,

392
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:21,367
it will become
a mockery.

393
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:23,567
And so will we.

394
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:42,168
I'm here to escort
Mrs. Logan.

395
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,667
The ceremony's beginning
any minute.

396
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,300
She'll be out in a moment.

397
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,434
Oh, may I...

398
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,467
have a word?

399
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:53,300
You're aware Mrs. Logan
was found in one of
the archive rooms?

400
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,867
Uh... I don't know
anything about that.

401
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:58,400
Aaron Pierce said
you lied to him.

402
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:01,567
You told him Mrs. Logan
was in her room, when
she was actually

403
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,233
going through classified
documents.

404
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,767
I don't think you understand
just how

405
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,901
grave this situation is.

406
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,434
What do you mean?

407
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,600
Mrs. Logan removed a document
from the archive

408
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,068
that contains highly-sensitive

409
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,767
intelligence protocols.

410
00:18:13,834 --> 00:18:15,901
That's not what
she said it was.

411
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,168
What exactly did she say
she took?

412
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:20,534
I think that you should
talk to her about this.

413
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,101
Evelyn, this is important.

414
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,500
What did she tell you?

415
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,267
She said it was a transcript
of a call she had

416
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,534
with David Palmer.

417
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,767
And I'm sure when she said that,
she believed it.

418
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:35,567
You're aware if this
document finds its way
into the wrong hands,

419
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:36,934
that you'll be held responsible.

420
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:38,267
I'm not the one who took it.

421
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,734
No, you aided
and abetted.

422
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,333
You'll not only lose your job,
you'll be prosecuted.

423
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,767
That's not fair.
Hmm...

424
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,634
I tried to talk
her out of this.

425
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:49,034
Look, all I'm asking is that you
tell me where did she put it.

426
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:53,168
She has it with her.
It's in her blouse.

427
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,267
She said she wouldn't let it out
of her sight until she talked

428
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,567
to the president about it.

429
00:18:56,634 --> 00:18:58,667
( door opens )

430
00:18:58,734 --> 00:19:00,233
Walt?

431
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,467
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm ready now.

432
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,767
( door shuts )

433
00:19:14,734 --> 00:19:17,434
Presidents Logan and Suvarov
will each make statements,

434
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,168
which will be followed
by the signing of the treaty.

435
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,134
There will be several photo
opportunities...

436
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,600
How much time will there
be between the moment

437
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,134
I step out on stage and
when I sign the document?

438
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,801
Not long.

439
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,701
Does CTU know that's
how long they have to
launch the rescue attempt?

440
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,101
Yes, sir. They're
completely synchronized

441
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:35,434
with what's
going on here.

442
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,333
( sighs )
I hope so.

443
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,500
The lives of those hostages
depend on it.

444
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,333
( spokesman speaking
indistinctly )

445
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,701
Today was supposed to be

446
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,667
the crowning achievement
of my presidency.

447
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,034
Instead, everybody's
waiting to hear

448
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:49,534
what's going to happen
at the airport.

449
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,300
( chuckles, sighs )

450
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:55,333
So, how are you feeling?

451
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,168
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

452
00:19:58,233 --> 00:20:00,567
How come you
just keep getting
better looking as you

453
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,200
get older, and I just
keep getting older?

454
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,867
What are you talking about?

455
00:20:03,934 --> 00:20:05,500
You're the most beautiful
first lady

456
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,967
Pennsylvania Avenue
has ever seen.

457
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,701
( spokesman speaking
indistinctly )

458
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:15,367
Ladies and gentlemen,

459
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:18,434
President Logan
and President Suvarov.

460
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,200
The treaty signing is a minute
and a half ahead of schedule.

461
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:33,534
Should you call Curtis
and let him know?

462
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,701
He might need to speed up
the assault prep.

463
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,101
No. Curtis is moving
as fast as he can.

464
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,934
A call from me isn't gonna make
him move any faster.

465
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:41,001
I just thought
he might like to...

466
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:42,434
I said no, Chloe.

467
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,400
The only way to make
sure the assault
happens in time

468
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,500
to save the hostages is to try
to slow down the signing.

469
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,233
What's wrong with Buchanan?

470
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,001
Nothing.
I think he just realizes

471
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:56,134
we're not gonna be able to save
the hostages.

472
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:13,034
Before we begin the treaty
signing, I would like to address

473
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:16,433
what's happening
just a few miles away from here.

474
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,001
As you know, terrorists have
already taken innocent life

475
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:24,167
in an attempt to stop
this historic treaty

476
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:26,067
from being signed.

477
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:29,134
President Suvarov
will not let this happen.

478
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:33,567
I will not let this happen!

479
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,400
BUCHANAN:
Yes, Mike?

480
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:38,400
Bill, I should have heard
from you by now.

481
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,767
Have your men gone in yet?
We're not quite ready.

482
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:42,334
You have to go in now.

483
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,234
The president's about to sign
that treaty.

484
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:46,467
I understand.
We're pushing as hard as we can.

485
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,800
In the meantime,
is there anything

486
00:21:47,867 --> 00:21:49,533
you can do on your end?
Like what?

487
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,734
Can you stall things?

488
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,301
Can you slow down
the ceremony?

489
00:21:52,368 --> 00:21:54,767
Bill, the entire world
is watching this

490
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,767
on live television.

491
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,134
The presidents of
the United States and Russia

492
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:00,800
are on stage now.

493
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:03,034
This process
has been set in motion.

494
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:04,767
No, I can't stall.

495
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,767
Okay, I'll call you back.

496
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,734
No. You stay on the phone
with me.

497
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,167
I need to know the moment
your people go in.

498
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:13,101
Yes, sir.

499
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,800
( people clapping )

500
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:16,800
This barbaric lawlessness
that's taking place

501
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:20,234
at Ontario Airport
only underscores the need...

502
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:23,901
the necessity for this accord

503
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,234
and for our continued vigilance
and commitment

504
00:22:27,301 --> 00:22:30,234
to fighting terrorism
around the world.

505
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:31,867
It looks like President Logan

506
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,667
is going through
with the signing.

507
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:36,734
He said he's not going
to give in to your demands.

508
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,700
Are you sure
this is going to work?

509
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,134
It will work.

510
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:42,800
And the reason the president
is so confident is that

511
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:45,268
he thinks his rescue attempt
will save the day.

512
00:22:45,334 --> 00:22:48,134
Are you sure you can
fend off that assault?
As soon as

513
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,034
the CTU agents
come through the entry point

514
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:52,400
that Jack Bauer fed to them
they'll all be killed.

515
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:56,067
One of the president's aides
will then walk up to the podium

516
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:59,167
and whisper into his ear
that there'll be no rescue,

517
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:02,334
that his signature on the treaty

518
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
will be the death warrant
of the hostages.

519
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,167
That will stop him,
I assure you.

520
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,834
Well, just in case you're wrong
and he signs the treaty,

521
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:13,667
you be ready
to carry out your threat.

522
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:16,101
Every one of my men
is committed to doing

523
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:18,500
what needs to be done today.

524
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:21,201
We've upgraded our estimate
of how many wounded there'll be.

525
00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:24,234
I need ten more ambulances
at the airport before we launch.

526
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:25,800
Right.

527
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,700
The rescue operation
you're about to execute

528
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,734
is radically changed
from your initial approach.

529
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,567
It was revised based on new
intelligence from Jack Bauer.

530
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:34,767
Which he phoned in
after going dark

531
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:35,901
for nearly 20 minutes;
I was there.

532
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:37,368
Right.
I need to call you back.

533
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:38,533
Well, I can't say that

534
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,001
his explanation
for being out of touch

535
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,201
is entirely satisfactory.

536
00:23:41,268 --> 00:23:43,234
Jack said he was trying
to avoid detection.

537
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,867
Wh-What are you suggesting?

538
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:47,767
There's too many unusual
circumstances at work here--
I want to try

539
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,600
to understand it better
before we send our people in.

540
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,368
I'll need the entire
transcripts of your

541
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,600
communications with Mr. Bauer
since he's been inside.

542
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:54,600
To what end?

543
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,834
Thoroughness.
I don't need

544
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,001
a sorting run on the calls,

545
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,101
just the raw transcripts'll
be fine.

546
00:23:58,167 --> 00:23:59,433
Fine, I'll send them to you.

547
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,467
Thank you.

548
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:03,667
Curtis is on line three.

549
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,301
Curtis, what's your situation?

550
00:24:07,368 --> 00:24:09,400
My men are in place, and we're
setting the entry charges.

551
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,067
Any complications?
No.

552
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,867
We're also jamming
the trigger frequency

553
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:14,934
so Beresch can't detonate
the vests remotely.

554
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:18,134
We should be able to make
our entry on target.
Good.

555
00:24:33,234 --> 00:24:35,268
( ringing )

556
00:24:35,334 --> 00:24:36,867
O'Brian.

557
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,500
Uh, Miss O'Brian,
I'm trying to understand

558
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,167
the transcript of
Jack's last call to CTU,
and there are...

559
00:24:42,234 --> 00:24:45,001
Mr. McGill, I'm really
busy trying to help keep
this revised assault

560
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,700
on schedule--
what do you need?
I understand,

561
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,201
and I don't want to
slow you down, but
I'd appreciate it

562
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:51,467
if you'd unlock
volume five-- there
are a few things

563
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,500
that I'd like to see.
I don't need to know
what you'd like to see.

564
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:55,800
Okay, it's unlocked.

565
00:24:55,867 --> 00:24:58,001
Good.

566
00:24:58,067 --> 00:25:02,268
This Lynn McGill person's
really slowing things down.

567
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,368
Yeah, that's his style.

568
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:05,067
I worked with him
once before.

569
00:25:05,134 --> 00:25:06,433
He usually loses about...

570
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,533
20% of his staff in the
first couple of days

571
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,034
after taking control
of a new office.

572
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:12,301
That many people quit?
No.

573
00:25:12,368 --> 00:25:14,067
Most of them are fired.

574
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:16,734
In the volatile climate

575
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,500
of the 21st century, the sharing
of deterrent technologies

576
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,867
by responsible powers

577
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:26,967
is the surest guarantee
of global peace.

578
00:25:27,034 --> 00:25:29,834
But let this accord be proof

579
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:32,533
that our two great nations

580
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,167
stand together
in their commitment

581
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:39,767
to fight the enemies
of peace and freedom.

582
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:47,734
( panting ):
Akhmed found Chevensky.

583
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,368
He's dead.

584
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:52,101
He killed himself--
we found him in
the baggage room.

585
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,533
What about the key card?

586
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,101
Chevensky had it hidden
right where he said he would.

587
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,734
BERESCH:
The rest of you
will work cleanup

588
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,001
on whoever makes it through
that line of fire.

589
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:05,767
Assume CTU is in body armor,

590
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:07,268
so go for the head shot.

591
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,967
You... and you,

592
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,700
guard the hostages.

593
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:15,634
Kill anyone

594
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,201
who tries to break away.

595
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:41,268
the black night is broken

596
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,234
by the dawning
of the light of global peace.

597
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,268
( phone ringing )

598
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,067
( ringing continues )

599
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,067
Curtis.

600
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,600
Jack, my men
are in place.
Okay.

601
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:04,567
Now, remember,
I am in a flank two position--

602
00:27:04,634 --> 00:27:07,467
make sure your men don't hit me
when they come in.

603
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:10,300
Roger that. Ready to start
the countdown on your word.

604
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,700
Jack?

605
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,134
( panting )

606
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,934
Move in at your discretion.

607
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:20,168
All teams,
we have a green light.

608
00:27:20,234 --> 00:27:23,001
Counting down from 60 seconds
on my mark.

609
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:24,234
Now.

610
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,001
Jack, we'll see
you inside.

611
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,600
Everyone, 60 seconds.

612
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:51,168
( rhythmic beeping )

613
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,034
( beeping continues )

614
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:03,001
Stop the assault!
Put Curtis on the phone.
What are you talking about?

615
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:05,834
They're walking into a trap.
Look at the transcript.

616
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:08,667
When Jack issued the
command directive, he
used the term "Flank two."

617
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:10,367
Yes, he was trying to
give us his position.

618
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:11,634
inside the terminal.
No, he wasn't.

619
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,567
"Flank two" is a duress code
used to indicate

620
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:15,034
the agent is communicating
under duress.

621
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:16,367
We ran Jack's calls through

622
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:17,867
a protocol filter--
if there'd been

623
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,467
a duress signal in there,
it would've found it.

624
00:28:19,534 --> 00:28:21,067
You filtered through
the current codes.

625
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:24,201
When Jack was active,
"Flank two" was
a duress code.

626
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,801
Chloe, confirm that.

627
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:31,600
Jack is trying to tell
us he's being used to
send misinformation.

628
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:35,067
If Curtis Manning's teams
go in now, they'll be ambushed.

629
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:37,268
He's right.

630
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:40,001
Curtis, abort the countdown.
Repeat, abort, abort.

631
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:41,767
Stand down.
All teams stand down.

632
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:43,333
We're aborting entry.
Repeat, we're aborting entry.

633
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,934
Confirm that
we're standing down.

634
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:48,767
What's wrong?
We detected a duress code
in Jack's call.

635
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,500
We have to assume that
terrorists are feeding him

636
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:52,067
the information
he gave us.

637
00:28:52,134 --> 00:28:54,600
Redeploy your men according
to the original assault plan

638
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,201
and do not contact Jack.

639
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,433
If Jack contacts you,
buy time.

640
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,734
Copy that. We're moving.

641
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:01,567
You're gonna outflank
the terrorists?

642
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:03,867
Yes.

643
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,901
That should work.

644
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:09,201
CURTIS:
All teams, reposition for entry

645
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:11,268
through the east and north
gates-- plan Bravo, repeat,

646
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,901
plan Bravo through
the east and north gates. Go!

647
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:15,034
Acknowledged.

648
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:16,834
Redeploy protocol one.

649
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,433
What's happening?
Ma'am, I need you

650
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,134
to step back
to the vehicle.

651
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:46,634
He said 60 seconds

652
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,834
three minutes ago.

653
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:50,300
What is CTU waiting for?!
I don't know.

654
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:53,300
You heard what I heard.

655
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,767
( rings )
It's Jack.

656
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,467
Jack.

657
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:00,834
What's happening?

658
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:03,001
There was a malfunction
on the entry charges.

659
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,134
What's the time frame?
Any minute.

660
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,767
They're resetting
the detonators.

661
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,134
Stand by.

662
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:09,467
Copy that.

663
00:30:11,834 --> 00:30:13,667
They're in position.

664
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,400
Stay ready!

665
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:42,201
( phone rings )

666
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:43,534
Yeah.

667
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,867
Is it done?

668
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,400
No. CTU hasn't attacked yet.

669
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,600
You said it would happen
before the signing.

670
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:53,934
And you told me the president
would never let it go this far.

671
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:02,034
He's signing it.

672
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:04,034
You have no choice.

673
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:05,500
Kill them all.

674
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,101
No!

675
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:55,400
( explosion )

676
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,567
You okay?
Yeah.

677
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,234
CURTIS:
Secure the terminal.

678
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,867
Besides the hostiles,

679
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,101
there appears to be
no further casualties.

680
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:15,234
Repeat: remaining hostages
are unharmed.

681
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,333
Good work, Curtis.

682
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,034
You get that, Mike?

683
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,801
Yeah...

684
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,234
( inaudible whispering )

685
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:37,333
Mr. President,

686
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,067
I have some good news.

687
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:42,234
I have just received word

688
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,367
that the crisis at
the Ontario Airport is over.

689
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:48,467
The rescue operation
that I authorized

690
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,767
was successful.

691
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,034
The terrorists have been
captured or killed.

692
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:55,268
And, best of all,
this has all been accomplished

693
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:59,101
with no further loss
of innocent life.

694
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,201
( applauding )

695
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,001
Excuse me, agent!

696
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:09,300
My name is Jack Bauer.

697
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,600
I know who you are, sir.

698
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,101
Can I use your pick?

699
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,801
This is Derek Huxley.

700
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:18,834
His mother is waiting for him
at the command post.

701
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:20,634
Can you please
take him there?

702
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,667
Of course.

703
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:22,801
What about you?

704
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,367
Come here.

705
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,700
I have to finish this.

706
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:40,168
Go take care of your mother.

707
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:41,567
Yeah.
Okay.

708
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:46,168
Go.

709
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:00,034
I'm missing one.

710
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,400
Everybody, I need
your attention.

711
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:08,201
We're looking for a man who
was being held here with you.

712
00:34:08,268 --> 00:34:10,067
He's a white male, mid-30s.

713
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:12,168
He was wearing
a bright yellow tie.

714
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:15,367
Did anyone see him leave?
Anyone?

715
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:21,901
Keep the hostages here
until I get back.

716
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:34,267
( sniffling )

717
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,468
Mom!

718
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:43,234
Derek!

719
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:47,834
( crying )

720
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,667
Oh, God...

721
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,067
They were going to kill me.

722
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,334
Jack saved my life.

723
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,167
He saves everyone's life.

724
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:06,567
Mrs. Huxley,
I need you and your son

725
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,034
to follow me.

726
00:35:08,101 --> 00:35:09,667
( sniffles )

727
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,134
Can I see Jack Bauer?

728
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:13,301
I'm sorry, I have instructions
to transport you

729
00:35:13,368 --> 00:35:14,600
to CTU.

730
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,201
This way, please.

731
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,167
( applause )

732
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,067
Thank you.

733
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,368
Charles?

734
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:36,734
Oh, watch your step.

735
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,434
I need to talk to you.

736
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,001
Sweetheart...

737
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,834
smile, it's over.

738
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,834
Charles, I just need a few
minutes alone with you.

739
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Yes... soon.

740
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:46,267
No!

741
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:48,034
Not soon, right now--
this is very important.

742
00:35:48,101 --> 00:35:51,667
Martha, when I am done
with this, I'll call for you.

743
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,001
I promise.

744
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,401
All right, this ends now.

745
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:57,334
I have played my role
without interfering.

746
00:35:57,401 --> 00:36:00,700
Now it is time for
you to attend to me.

747
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,101
And I will.

748
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:03,967
Charles, do not
patronize me!

749
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:05,101
Something is going on.

750
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,500
I am not crying
wolf again.

751
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:08,700
Martha...

752
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:15,334
please... do not ruin
this moment for me.

753
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,201
We'll talk later.

754
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,967
Martha.

755
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:28,234
Everything all right?

756
00:36:28,301 --> 00:36:30,234
No, it's not
all right.

757
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:32,500
I have to talk
to my husband.

758
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:35,834
The situation is more dangerous
than he realizes.

759
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,800
Whoa, and what
situation is that?

760
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:41,034
I'm sorry, Walt.

761
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:44,800
I can only talk
to Charles about this.

762
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:01,034
Curtis just confirmed

763
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:02,301
the area's been contained

764
00:37:02,368 --> 00:37:03,867
and their reporting
only minor injuries

765
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:05,600
among the hostages.
Good, thank you.

766
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,067
You should probably
route all field updates

767
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,301
through Mr. McGill,

768
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:11,101
for the time being.
Oh, okay.

769
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,301
Thanks.

770
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,800
Bill, if you have a moment.

771
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:16,434
Lynn, uh, before you
say anything,

772
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,633
I owe you an apology.

773
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,934
For what?

774
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,201
Well, if you hadn't recognized
the duress code

775
00:37:21,267 --> 00:37:23,001
that Jack transmitted, well...

776
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,734
Bill, you're the reason I
figured out what he was doing.

777
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,468
What do you mean?

778
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:29,800
Well, I admit,
I was suspicious of Mr. Bauer,

779
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:31,234
but you were so adamant

780
00:37:31,301 --> 00:37:32,734
about his integrity
that I just...

781
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,700
looked for a way to reconcile
the contradiction, so...

782
00:37:35,767 --> 00:37:38,067
thank you.

783
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:43,001
I assume Mr. Bauer's
been taken into custody?

784
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:45,468
Well, I plan to debrief him
here, but not as a suspect.

785
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,567
Well, he hasn't been
officially cleared
in the deaths

786
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,368
of David Palmer
or Michelle Dessler.

787
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,867
Well, based
on mitigating evidence

788
00:37:50,934 --> 00:37:53,368
in Chloe O'Brian's testimony,
we're confident that Jack

789
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:54,834
was framed for those murders.

790
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,001
I appreciate that,
but it still doesn't change

791
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,201
a very tangled situation.

792
00:37:58,267 --> 00:37:59,834
I mean, we have
surveillance footage

793
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,167
that places Jack Bauer

794
00:38:01,234 --> 00:38:03,434
at the site
of David Palmer's assassination.

795
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,134
Well, clearly, it was doctored.

796
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,800
Not according
to preliminary tests.

797
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,967
If we're gonna get
to the bottom of this,

798
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:11,201
Jack Bauer has a lot
to answer for.

799
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:14,067
Bring him in now.

800
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,667
The rest
of the terminal's clear.

801
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,067
MANNING:
Jack.

802
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:32,301
It's good to
see you again.

803
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:33,667
It's good to see you.

804
00:38:33,734 --> 00:38:35,934
We've got a problem--
one of the hostages is missing.

805
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,600
He was working
with the terrorists.

806
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,234
Give me a description;
I'll take care of it.

807
00:38:39,301 --> 00:38:40,500
I'll help you now--
let's go.

808
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:41,767
Jack, you need to
go back to CTU.

809
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:43,101
Buchanan just
gave orders

810
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:44,434
to take you into custody.

811
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,334
I watched Beresch
give this guy a key card.

812
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:47,900
Something else
is going down here.

813
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:49,567
We've got to find
this guy now.

814
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:50,900
And I'll get right on it,

815
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:55,101
but I need you to go
with these men, please.

816
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:00,567
He's a white male,
mid-30s, wearing a dark suit

817
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:01,767
and a yellow tie.

818
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:03,034
He's about five-eight.

819
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:04,633
We'll find him.

820
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,434
Okay. Thanks.

821
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:10,800
These are my weapons.

822
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,900
MANNING:
Altieri, Hutchinson,

823
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:15,633
we have a possible sleeper
among the hostages.

824
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,967
We're looking for
a Caucasian male,

825
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:19,368
five-eight, dark suit,
yellow tie.

826
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,234
Where have you been?

827
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,600
We had a problem
with Chevensky.

828
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,334
Where is he?
Dead.

829
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,101
You have the key?

830
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:08,368
* *

831
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,334
( device beeping )

832
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,001
Masks.

833
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:35,101
All right, now.

834
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,967
One, two, three.

835
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,700
Push it, push it.

836
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,734
( speaking foreign language )

837
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,267
Do you have the merchandise?

838
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:15,167
YELLOW TIE (over phone):
Yes, we're moving
the canisters out now.

839
00:41:15,234 --> 00:41:16,734
Good.

840
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,767
Transportation's been arranged.

841
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:20,401
Call me when you're out.

842
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,633
I will.

843
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:44,134
TV REPORTER:
This will be remembered
as a significant day

844
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,667
for President Logan,
perhaps a turning point

845
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:48,201
in what has been--
up until now--

846
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:50,334
a fairly unremarkable
presidency.

847
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:53,034
It is almost symbolic that it
should come on the heels

848
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:57,834
of the tragic assassination
of David Palmer.

849
00:41:59,134 --> 00:42:00,734
( door opens )

850
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,301
Evelyn, did you get a chance
to speak to my husband?

851
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:08,134
( muffled screaming )



9999
