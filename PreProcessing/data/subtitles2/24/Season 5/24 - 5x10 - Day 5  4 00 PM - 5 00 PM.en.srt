1
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,038
AUDREY:
I'm on the phone with a man
who claims to James Nathanson.

2
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:17,338
He was Walt Cummings' contact.

3
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:19,038
He says he has information
about the terrorists,

4
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:20,538
but he will only talk to you.

5
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:21,538
JACK:
What do you want with me?

6
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,937
CUMMINGS:
Protection.

7
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,738
The terrorists you're after
are trying to kill me.

8
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:26,038
What makes you think
I'm not gonna kill you myself?

9
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:27,438
Because you want to stop

10
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:30,271
the Sentox gas from being
released on American soil.

11
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:31,271
<i>So do I.</i>

12
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:33,171
Nathanson, stay down!

13
00:00:33,238 --> 00:00:35,438
Stay down!

14
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,238
What's on the chip?
Please, what's on the chip!

15
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:43,772
O'Brian.

16
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:45,471
I have a thumb drive that's
gonna help us find the Sentox.

17
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:48,271
CHLOE:
The decryption element
kicked out a company

18
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:49,871
called Omicron International.

19
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:51,605
Pull up their
senior executive roster,

20
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:53,405
See if a man named Christopher
Henderson's on the list.

21
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,738
Okay, here it is.

22
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,371
Senior Vice President
of Research and Development.

23
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:58,271
Send me the decrypted files
over to my PDA.

24
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:00,338
That's gonna be a little bit
hard to do right now, Jack.

25
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,238
The two of you are up
to something, and I'm
not gonna stand for it.

26
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:04,971
This is a deliberate attempt
to circumvent my authority.

27
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:07,104
Lynn, we're all
on the same side.
If you're father wasn't

28
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,837
the Secretary of
Defense, I'd have you
thrown out of here.

29
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:11,438
I don't have that problem
with you.

30
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,937
I spent a year securing a weapon

31
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:16,638
that would bring Moscow
to its knees.

32
00:01:16,705 --> 00:01:18,804
<i>And you waste it.</i>

33
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,672
We were betrayed, Bierko.

34
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:22,738
Someone must pay.
I agree.

35
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:28,104
This is President Logan.
What is it you want?

36
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,772
I want the route
of Suvarov's motorcade.

37
00:01:29,837 --> 00:01:32,837
If you refuse to cooperate,

38
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:35,071
I will have no choice
but to release

39
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,605
all the Sentox nerve gas.

40
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,371
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

41
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,937
Don't negotiate with them!

42
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:42,638
Isn't that the point of the
treaty you just signed?

43
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,904
Mr. President, I'm glad
that we have this opportunity

44
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,004
to thank you

45
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,505
and Mrs. Logan

46
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:48,638
for your hospitality.

47
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:50,171
The motorcade will take

48
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:52,104
service roads to the 118...

49
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,505
Mrs. Logan...
Aaron,

50
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,937
I've decided to drive to
the airport with the Suvarovs.

51
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,104
I'll ride up front.

52
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:58,672
No, that's not necessary.

53
00:01:58,738 --> 00:01:59,837
Yes, it is.

54
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:23,071
Yes?

55
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,638
Where is the motorcade now?
Just getting on the 118.

56
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:27,438
How long before they reach
the ambush point?

57
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:29,104
About 40 minutes.

58
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:31,738
Good. We'll be waiting.

59
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:36,038
Get everything ready.

60
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,138
Mr. President,
I asked Secret Service

61
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:49,038
to sent a threat assessment

62
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:51,038
for President
Suvarov's route.

63
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,605
The most vulnerable point

64
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,705
is here,
the downtown corridor.

65
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:57,904
This is the most likely
point of attack.

66
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,104
If an ambush were to occur.

67
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,738
It's going to happen, Mike.

68
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:05,305
We gave the terrorists
Suvarov's route.

69
00:03:08,138 --> 00:03:11,238
I need to come up
with a public response.

70
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:12,738
I need to convince
the world that

71
00:03:12,804 --> 00:03:14,672
Suvarov's death
only underscores the importance

72
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:17,204
of this antiterrorism treaty

73
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,071
that we just signed.

74
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:23,605
I'll, uh, begin working
on a statement, sir.

75
00:03:23,672 --> 00:03:26,271
Yes?

76
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:32,438
Thank you. I'll...
let the president know.

77
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:35,871
What? What is it, Mike?

78
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:38,405
What's going on?

79
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,305
Who was that?

80
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,804
Agent Pierce. Um,

81
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,638
I don't know how
to tell you this.
Just tell me.

82
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:51,804
Mrs. Logan is riding
with the Suvarovs.

83
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:56,904
What are you talking about?
Sir, she got into
that limousine.

84
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,804
Oh, my God.

85
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,772
Didn't-didn't the
Secret Service

86
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:02,438
try to stop her?!

87
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:04,171
There was no reason to stop her.

88
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,138
The motorcade is under
Secret Service escort.

89
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,871
As far as they're concerned,
she's not in any danger.

90
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:10,738
She wants me to call back

91
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,904
the motorcade-- she's trying
to save the Suvarovs.

92
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,438
Should I alert them?

93
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,071
Yes!

94
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:17,772
No, stop, wait.

95
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:25,004
If we warn them, the terrorists
are going to set off the gas.

96
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:29,672
Where are they now?

97
00:04:29,738 --> 00:04:32,438
They're still on the 118.

98
00:04:34,937 --> 00:04:37,004
Get my wife on the phone.

99
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,238
MRS. SUVAROV:
My aunt visited Los Angeles

100
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:54,505
in the 1950s.

101
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:57,004
She told me this area
was filled with orange groves,

102
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,538
but I haven't seen any.

103
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:03,004
I suppose it's all been
built over, no?

104
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,837
Martha?

105
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,505
Yes. I-I...
I was just trying to remember.

106
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:11,371
Um, I think your aunt's memory
is better than mine.

107
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,171
I visited here when
I was a child,

108
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:15,071
but I don't recall
the orange groves.

109
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:18,438
Yeah, this is Pierce.

110
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,837
Mrs. Logan,

111
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:26,405
it's the president
for you on line one.
Thank you, Aaron.

112
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:30,871
Hello, Charles.

113
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,204
Listen to me carefully.

114
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,405
I want you...

115
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,405
Yes, I think they had
a wonderful visit.

116
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:37,937
And they would very much like
for us to come to Moscow.

117
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,937
Wouldn't that be lovely?

118
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:44,104
I want you to tell the Suvarovs
that I need you back here.

119
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,004
I'm gonna have one of the
follow cars bring you back.

120
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:50,505
I don't think so, Charles.
Tell them now, while
I'm on the phone.

121
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,672
Martha,

122
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:56,538
I know that you want me to call
the motorcade back, but...

123
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:57,837
the terrorists were
very specific:

124
00:05:57,904 --> 00:06:00,571
if-if I don't allow them
to attack the motorcade,

125
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:01,871
they're gonna release

126
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:04,904
canisters of nerve gas
in multiple locations.

127
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:07,804
Well, I... guess we'll just have
to figure something out

128
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,871
before that happens.
We're trying! We're trying,

129
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,238
but we haven't found them yet.

130
00:06:14,305 --> 00:06:15,971
You need to get out of the car.

131
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:18,104
Okay, I should go now,
but you'll call me
Martha...

132
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,138
if there's any change of plans?
Damn it, Martha!

133
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:23,004
Okay, bye-bye.
I'll-I'll talk to you soon.

134
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:28,538
She won't get out
of the limousine.

135
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,371
My God.

136
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:33,071
We got to do something, Mike; we
got to get her out of the car.

137
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:35,238
I could have, uh, one
of the trail cars

138
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,937
stop them and force her out,
say that I need her back here.

139
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:42,138
You could, but... if Martha

140
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:44,238
is desperate to save
the Suvarovs,

141
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:47,271
she might feel that
the only remaining option

142
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:49,672
is to tell them the truth.

143
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:55,638
And Suvarov will know that
I gave him up for assassination.

144
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,271
Sir,

145
00:07:03,338 --> 00:07:06,672
do you want me to recall
the motorcade or not?

146
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:23,038
Edgar, meet me
in the server room

147
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,804
in a few minutes.

148
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:26,405
Am I in trouble?
No, but there's
something

149
00:07:26,471 --> 00:07:27,638
very important
that we need to discuss.

150
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:30,871
Okay.
And, Edgar,

151
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:32,638
don't tell anyone
where you're going.

152
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:35,405
This needs to stay
between us.
Sure.

153
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:44,471
What did Audrey Raines want?

154
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:47,171
She was just going over
some DOD protocols.

155
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:50,405
I thought you were supposed
to be monitoring chatter.

156
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,471
We are.
Why isn't it on
my screen, Carrie?

157
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,705
I didn't think
you wanted us to mirror

158
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,204
everything
to your system.

159
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:58,371
I thought you wanted
to save time.
I do want to save time.

160
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,371
It saves me time by not having
to clean up more mistakes.

161
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,405
Mirror everything until
we've secured this nerve gas.

162
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:03,538
Is that clear?

163
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:05,271
Yes, sir.

164
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:15,904
The thumb drive data
Jack sent us checks
out as authentic.

165
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:18,038
It's time-stamped
by DOD and CIA.

166
00:08:18,104 --> 00:08:21,104
So Omicron International
did make Sentox gas
for the military.

167
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,338
Yeah, and some terrorists
found out about it.

168
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:27,171
Or worse-- they were in contact
with Omicron.

169
00:08:27,238 --> 00:08:29,204
Who is this Henderson?

170
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,672
CHLOE:
Christopher Henderson,
Senior Vice President, R&D.

171
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:35,171
Jack said he knew him,
but he wouldn't talk about it.

172
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,705
Is he connected with the Sentox?

173
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:39,804
Doesn't say;
it just said he was a senior VP.
All right.

174
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:47,705
Yeah?

175
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:49,605
Jack, we've authenticated
the thumb drive data.

176
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:52,204
Omicron definitely made the
Sentox for the military.

177
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,705
Okay, I'm almost there--
look, I need you

178
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:55,238
to work something up
that gets me through

179
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:56,772
the front door
without them knowing I'm CTU.

180
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,605
Do you think it's necessary
to go in covertly?

181
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,171
Yeah. There's someone
I need to talk to.

182
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,772
I don't want him
to see me coming.

183
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:02,937
Christopher Henderson?

184
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:04,004
Yeah.

185
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:05,071
Who is he?

186
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:06,605
Someone I used to work for.

187
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:07,904
Where?

188
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:09,871
CTU. He was the man
who recruited me.

189
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:11,104
You've never mentioned him.

190
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:12,238
I know.

191
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:13,672
Things ended badly between us.

192
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:15,937
What happened?

193
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:18,705
I was part of an investigation
that uncovered evidence

194
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:20,505
that implicated him in the sale

195
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:23,937
of classified intelligence
to defense contractors.

196
00:09:24,004 --> 00:09:26,104
We never had enough evidence
to indict him,

197
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:28,772
but he lost his job,
his command.

198
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:30,904
Even as he was walking
out the door,

199
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,871
he maintained his innocence.

200
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,738
He never forgave me for being
part of the investigation.

201
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:37,438
Are you convinced he did it?

202
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,138
I was at the time.

203
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,904
Jack, Chloe can't find
a direct connection

204
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:43,338
between the Sentox
and Henderson.

205
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:44,638
Trust me,

206
00:09:44,705 --> 00:09:47,004
if Omicron was making Sentox,
legally or illegally,

207
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:48,904
Henderson knew about it.

208
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:50,004
Get back to me as soon

209
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:51,238
as you got my cover.
All right,

210
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,338
I'm on it.
What are you doing
here, Chloe?

211
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,705
Same thing you're doing here.

212
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:56,371
Edgar, thank you for coming.

213
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:58,937
Look, whatever this
is about, I don't
have a lot of time.

214
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:01,238
We don't have a single active
lead on this nerve gas.

215
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:02,638
That's not exactly true.

216
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:04,571
Jack is following a lead
out in the field.

217
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,438
How do <i>you</i> know?
I just spoke with him.

218
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,971
Everyone's looking for him.
Lynn issued an arrest warrant.

219
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,738
That's why we wanted
to talk to you, Edgar.

220
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,638
Lynn is losing it--
first he went after Jack,

221
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:15,505
and then he took Bill Buchanan
out of play.

222
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,305
Lynn is incapable of leading us
through this crisis.

223
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:20,837
So you're both working
behind his back?
We're afraid that if

224
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,904
we bring him into this,
he might derail the only
good lead that we have.

225
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,804
We have to help Jack
locate the nerve gas

226
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:28,538
before it's too late.
What do you want from me?

227
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:31,071
Cover for Chloe until
Jack reports back.

228
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:36,705
Please.

229
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,071
Okay.
Thank you.

230
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:46,405
Okay, fine. Yeah.

231
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,837
That was Secret Service.

232
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,605
As you can see,
the motorcade continues

233
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:51,772
to make its way to the airport
without incident.

234
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:53,371
There won't be
any warning, Mike.

235
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:55,038
When these people
attack,

236
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,937
they will be fast
and they will be merciless.

237
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,471
You can count on that.

238
00:10:58,538 --> 00:10:59,837
I have to talk to this man.

239
00:10:59,904 --> 00:11:02,271
M-Maybe I can convince him
to hold off.

240
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:03,471
Hold off?

241
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,904
Just until Martha
gets out of the car.

242
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,238
She wasn't supposed to be a part
of this in the first place.

243
00:11:06,305 --> 00:11:07,837
Sir, I don't think that would
change his plan.

244
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,571
He has to know that my wife's
in the car!

245
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,538
I can't lose her, Mike.

246
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:16,571
The only way
to keep Martha safe

247
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:18,104
is for me to call Secret Service

248
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:19,772
and tell them to turn

249
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:21,004
the motorcade around.

250
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,371
What about...
what about CTU?

251
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:23,904
Do they have any active leads

252
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:25,104
on the nerve gas?

253
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,371
As of five minutes ago,
they don't...

254
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:27,871
nothing that would help
our situation.

255
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,937
What am I missing, Mike?!

256
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,104
There's got to be some way out,

257
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,438
something
that I'm not seeing.

258
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,071
You're not missing anything.

259
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:36,971
Any action we take
to save Martha

260
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,705
would also save
the Suvarovs,

261
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:40,371
and if that happens,

262
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,638
the terrorists
will release the gas.

263
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:44,071
Unfortunately,

264
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,038
it's <i>that</i> simple.

265
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:53,471
Then there's nothing more
we can do, Mike.

266
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,271
Unless I warn them.

267
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,505
Martha's going to die
with the Suvarovs.

268
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:10,371
Aaron...
have there been any changes?

269
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,405
Excuse me?

270
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,438
Changes to what,
Mrs. Logan?

271
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:15,672
I-I was just wondering

272
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:17,171
if there had been any changes
to our route.

273
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,605
We haven't gotten

274
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,038
any revised
instructions, ma'am.

275
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:25,871
Thank you.

276
00:12:33,738 --> 00:12:35,571
You sure you're all right,
Martha?

277
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,004
Yes, yes.
I just wanted to make sure

278
00:12:38,071 --> 00:12:41,104
we don't run into
any heavy traffic.

279
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:00,171
Understood.

280
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,638
Those protocols should be
coming over shortly.

281
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:05,104
Who were you
on the phone with?

282
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,872
Homeland Security.

283
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:09,338
I gave you specific orders

284
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,037
to have everyone's systems
mirrored to mine.

285
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,371
I've been doing that.

286
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:13,304
But you're not finished,
yet somehow you have time

287
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,571
to chat with Homeland Security.

288
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:17,772
They needed us to give them
updated code sets.

289
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,638
It'll just take
another minute.
No, it won't.

290
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:20,872
Stiles, finish her task.

291
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:22,004
Carrie, you're done.

292
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,438
What do you... mean, done?

293
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:27,004
Fired. You don't
work here anymore.

294
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:28,605
STILES:
Mr. McGill,

295
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:29,937
it's not her fault.
She just...

296
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:31,872
Edgar, one more word out of you,
you walk out with her.

297
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,937
What's it gonna be?

298
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:39,805
Where's Agent O'Brian?

299
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,538
She had to step away
for a minute.
Where?

300
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:43,738
I don't know.

301
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,438
Jack, I'm still trying
to get your credentials
into Omicron's system.

302
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:05,138
You can't get into
the building without them.

303
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:06,705
What's the problem?

304
00:14:06,772 --> 00:14:08,004
Omicron's systems
don't refresh
often enough.

305
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:10,571
We need to push
this page in manually.

306
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:11,937
Okay, I'm in.

307
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:13,571
You're going in under the name
of John Barrie.

308
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:15,004
B-A-R-R-I-E.

309
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,471
You're with a company called

310
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:17,471
Eclipse LLC.

311
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:18,638
John Barrie, Eclipse LLC.

312
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:19,971
I got it.

313
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:21,004
Hold on a second;

314
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:22,204
she hasn't
planted it yet.

315
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:23,772
Chloe. What are you
doing in here?

316
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:25,338
I asked her to help me.

317
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,271
She doesn't work for you,
Ms. Raines; she works for me.

318
00:14:27,338 --> 00:14:28,538
But I don't,

319
00:14:28,605 --> 00:14:29,838
and DOD has assignment
priority

320
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,104
over CTU.

321
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,505
We're in the middle of a
real-time investigation,

322
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,071
and we're understaffed.

323
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:35,471
Chloe's a department head--
you can't just take her

324
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:37,471
away from me.
AUDREY:
I'm not taking her from you.

325
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:38,904
We needed a system patch
on a server,

326
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,204
and Chloe's the only one
who could fix it.

327
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:42,471
Well, then you come to me
and you ask me.

328
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:44,304
Everything in this office
runs through me!

329
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,705
Lynn, we are all trying
to do the same thing.

330
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:51,037
Can we please
just get past this?

331
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:53,071
Yeah, I'm past it.
I want Chloe back.

332
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:54,805
Okay, I'm finished here.

333
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:56,937
Sorry, Mr. McGill,
it won't happen again.

334
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:13,071
Good afternoon.

335
00:15:13,138 --> 00:15:14,471
John Barrie
with Eclipse.

336
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,904
I've got a 4:30
with R&D.

337
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,338
Thumb print, please.

338
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,505
Go on in.

339
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,204
Thank you.

340
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,338
MAN ( <i>over intercom</i> ):
Well, I'll tell you what you do.

341
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,238
You kick the McAvoy meeting
to next week on Thursday,

342
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:58,371
but you keep everything else.

343
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,004
What about your trip
to Washington?

344
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:01,705
That's right. Okay.

345
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:02,937
Well, I got to talk to Kagan
tomorrow morning.

346
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,405
I'll get back to you then.

347
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:05,805
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

348
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:07,471
I'm a little lost. I was looking
for the men's room.

349
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:08,872
Over there, second door.

350
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,304
Thank you.

351
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:22,904
Audrey Raines.

352
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:26,071
It's Jack. I need you
to lose the secretary.

353
00:16:26,138 --> 00:16:27,338
Her name is Joanna Tandy.

354
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:28,538
All right, I'll take care of it.

355
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:29,738
Thanks.

356
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:50,505
Christopher Henderson's office.

357
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:52,037
Ms. Tandy?
Yes?

358
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:53,805
Jane Espenson
from accounting.

359
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:55,338
We need you
to come down now

360
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,471
and double-check some
of these invoices.

361
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:58,071
What invoices?

362
00:16:58,138 --> 00:17:00,271
It's a little difficult
to explain over the phone.

363
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:02,772
Would you mind popping down
just for a minute?

364
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:03,805
Fine.

365
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,304
Thank you.

366
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,505
Mr. Henderson, there's a problem
down in accounting.

367
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:08,904
I'll be right back.

368
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:36,638
Jack? Jack?

369
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:52,038
Just for the record,
I never believed you were dead.

370
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,338
What are you doing here?

371
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,704
Earlier this morning,

372
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,404
terrorists gained control
of a large quantity

373
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,171
of Sentox VX
nerve gas.

374
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:03,537
Omicron
manufactured it.

375
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:04,838
When I pulled up
the executive list,

376
00:18:04,905 --> 00:18:06,005
your name was on it.

377
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:07,738
Sure my name's on it--
I work here.

378
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:08,871
Omicron had
the contract.

379
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,171
We manufacture
this stuff.

380
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:11,471
But every single gram of it

381
00:18:11,537 --> 00:18:12,537
went to the Department
of Defense.

382
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:13,738
It's all been accounted for.

383
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:15,471
Well, that can't be true,
now, can it?

384
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:17,272
We have confirmation
that terrorists

385
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:19,404
are in control
of 19 canisters of Sentox!

386
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,738
What are you accusing me
now of, Jack?

387
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:22,471
Being in bed with terrorists?

388
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:23,604
I'm following
the leads!

389
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,005
Well, the leads are wrong.

390
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:27,504
DOD destroyed
the entire stockpile.

391
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:30,372
Sentox was responsible
for the death of the people

392
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:32,704
in the Sunrise Hills Mall
less than two hours ago.

393
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:35,571
The news said it
was chlorine gas.

394
00:18:35,638 --> 00:18:36,571
That was a cover story
to stop

395
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:38,171
a widespread panic!

396
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:41,038
Come on, Christopher,
you know how this works!

397
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:50,105
The terrorists have threatened
to release the rest of the gas.

398
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:01,205
( <i>quietly</i> ):
Good God.

399
00:19:05,504 --> 00:19:07,638
Well, whoever's implicating me
in this

400
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,071
knows my history with CTU.

401
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:12,704
I mean, I'm
an easy target.

402
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:15,105
This is not
a coincidence.

403
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:18,738
Look, Jack, I know
there's dirt between us,

404
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,171
but I swear to you,

405
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:21,938
I got nothing
to do with this.

406
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:23,838
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
I can't afford to take

407
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:24,938
your word
on this.

408
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:25,771
Well, you're gonna have
to take my word.

409
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:27,537
11 people died in that mall!

410
00:19:27,604 --> 00:19:29,804
Hundreds of thousands of others
will if they release

411
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:30,905
the rest
of the Sentox.

412
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,437
You're not hearing me, Jack!

413
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,038
I had nothing to do with this!

414
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,171
Then prove it to me.

415
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:55,372
I need complete access
to Omicron's Sentox program.

416
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:57,038
I'm doing it now.

417
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:59,471
The entire operation
was run from a bunker
across the campus.

418
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,171
Let me see the bunker.

419
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:45,674
NSA chatter analysis
just came in.

420
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:46,975
I decoded some
words and phrases.

421
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,407
What were they saying?

422
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:50,875
It's too scrambled to make
any complete sentences,

423
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:52,975
but number strings
keep coming up.

424
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,108
5, 110, 10.

425
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:56,641
Freeways?

426
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,775
Those are the routes
President Suvarov's
taking to the airport.

427
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,441
The only other phrase
I could decode

428
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:03,242
refers to the downtown corridor.

429
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:04,841
How long ago did
this chatter start?

430
00:21:04,908 --> 00:21:07,608
About 30 minutes ago.

431
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:13,775
Come on.

432
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:16,474
Can we expand the search area?

433
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,674
I've got CTU air surveillance
on everything east of Glendale.

434
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:20,441
What about the north?
Edwards Air Force Base

435
00:21:20,508 --> 00:21:22,242
is giving us
support there.

436
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:23,407
We're still at a dead end

437
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:24,908
on finding new leads
with the nerve gas.

438
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:27,041
Excuse me, Mr. McGill, we think
there might be an attack

439
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:29,041
on President Suvarov's
motorcade.
What?

440
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:30,307
Edgar just monitored

441
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,075
some chatter from
NSA and ran a threat assessment.

442
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:34,374
What are you doing
analyzing chatter

443
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:36,108
that isn't related to finding
the nerve gas?

444
00:21:36,175 --> 00:21:38,075
It came through
on one of my filters.

445
00:21:38,142 --> 00:21:39,775
The point is, sir,
we found something.

446
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,274
Don't you want to alert
Secret Service

447
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,441
considering that Suvarov
is on his way to the airport?

448
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:45,041
Based on
an unsubstantiated theory

449
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,641
from a couple of analysts?

450
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:49,307
I think I've been embarrassed
enough for one day.

451
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,108
Can we at least devote
some limited resources

452
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,708
to try to confirm this threat?

453
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:53,708
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,975
Maybe I wasn't clear. No.

455
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,242
Now go downstairs

456
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:59,242
and focus on what
you're supposed
to be doing.

457
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,142
I don't think it would be
a bad idea

458
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,875
to pass along
the intel.

459
00:22:16,941 --> 00:22:19,441
Well, I do.

460
00:22:19,508 --> 00:22:22,041
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

461
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:29,841
Yes?

462
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:31,041
Our men are in place.

463
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:32,808
How far out are they?

464
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,075
The motorcade will be there
in less than 20 minutes.

465
00:22:36,142 --> 00:22:38,008
Are you sure no one is going
to interfere with us?

466
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:39,508
I don't think so.

467
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:42,341
Logan knows the consequences
if that happens.

468
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:43,841
But be alert.

469
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:46,674
Make sure they haven't
placed any of their
people near you.

470
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:51,208
If police show up,
we'll deal with them.
Good.

471
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:53,708
I'll call you when it's over.

472
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:55,741
Let's go, let's go.

473
00:22:58,608 --> 00:23:00,975
Keep them out.

474
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:04,775
If things don't go as planned,
I'll use them here.

475
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:14,242
I'm busy, Ms. Raines.

476
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:16,175
Lynn, I just looked
at this chatter report

477
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:17,574
and I definitely think
that we need

478
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:19,208
to let Secret Service know
of the threat.

479
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,574
I'm not going to repeat
my orders

480
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:21,908
to every person
in this office individually.

481
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:23,875
My people are not going
to chase that white elephant.

482
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:25,274
They're busy trying
to locate 19 canisters

483
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:26,574
of Sentox nerve gas.

484
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:28,975
Has it occurred to you
that if this threat is real,

485
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,608
then it's likely

486
00:23:30,674 --> 00:23:32,574
that the terrorists who have
the Sentox nerve gas

487
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:34,608
are the same ones
that are planning this attack?

488
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,274
This is an unverified threat!

489
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,741
If you want to hand
it off to NSA, be my guest.

490
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:41,674
NSA can't recall the motorcade
without going through

491
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:43,441
a time-consuming
approval process.

492
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:44,808
Good.

493
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,108
That process helps eliminate
false threats.

494
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,941
Look, we don't have that time.
According...

495
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:50,142
Ms. Raines, Ms. Raines,

496
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,441
this office has
made enough mistakes

497
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:54,274
for one day, and I intend
to stop the bleeding.

498
00:23:54,341 --> 00:23:55,641
Now let my people

499
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:56,908
focus on their work

500
00:23:56,975 --> 00:23:59,908
or I will have you
escorted out of here.

501
00:23:59,975 --> 00:24:01,341
Thank you.

502
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:53,808
I need to call this in
to Secret Service,

503
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,208
but they won't act on it

504
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,674
unless Lynn verifies it.

505
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:59,142
He's never going
to back you up on that.
Yes, he is.

506
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,142
I need you to hack
into Lynn's account for me.

507
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,474
I'll forge a message
to Secret Service

508
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,307
and make it look like
it came from him.

509
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:05,708
That's illegal.
Fine.

510
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:07,608
Edgar, I need you to put
a blanket on my sub-net

511
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,175
to make it look like
I'm doing something else.

512
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:11,307
We could all
end up in jail.

513
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:13,474
Think about it
for a second.

514
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,975
The Russian president,
his wife,

515
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,108
about 35 Secret Service,
all dead in a few minutes.

516
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:21,641
All right, but for the record,
this is not a good idea.

517
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:23,242
All right, I'll
compose a message.

518
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:26,008
As soon as you have the forged
verification file, call me.

519
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:45,875
Curtis.

520
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:48,242
Excuse me.
We need to talk.

521
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:50,242
What is it?

522
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:53,708
We've got a problem
with Lynn.

523
00:25:53,775 --> 00:25:54,808
Yeah, I know.

524
00:25:54,875 --> 00:25:55,908
He's not listening
to anybody.

525
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:57,608
Well, it's going to start
costing lives.

526
00:25:57,674 --> 00:25:59,208
Just give him some time.
He'll come around.

527
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:00,508
Curtis, we don't have time.

528
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:02,041
We've got to get Bill
back out here.

529
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:03,941
That's not going
to happen, Audrey.

530
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:05,508
We need to make it happen.

531
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:06,708
What are you suggesting?

532
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,008
Section 112.

533
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:12,108
On what grounds?

534
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:14,142
Lynn is mentally incapable
of running CTU.

535
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,741
I may not agree
with all his choices,

536
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:17,008
but going from there

537
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,407
to mentally unfit?

538
00:26:18,474 --> 00:26:19,708
That's a stretch.

539
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:20,741
No, it's not and you know it.

540
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:22,574
You've seen him.

541
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:24,374
With Bill in custody,
you are the ranking agent.

542
00:26:24,441 --> 00:26:25,407
You are the only one

543
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:26,541
that can invoke it.

544
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:29,474
I don't know, Audrey...
Yes, you do.

545
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,841
Curtis, CTU is barely
functional.

546
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:35,041
You are the one
that can turn it around.

547
00:26:35,108 --> 00:26:38,975
Even if I agreed, Section 112
requires documentation,

548
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,407
testimony, a lot
of groundwork.

549
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,908
The record of what is going on
right now

550
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:45,407
is documentation enough.

551
00:26:45,474 --> 00:26:47,708
Curtis...

552
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,108
please.

553
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,242
Think about it.

554
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:53,775
I will.

555
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:55,541
Good. Thank you.

556
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,108
Mr. President.

557
00:27:27,674 --> 00:27:30,908
Come in, Mike.

558
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:32,175
The motorcade

559
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:35,341
is only 15 minutes
away from the airport.

560
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:37,441
Yeah.

561
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:48,274
My father always told me that
life was about problem solving.

562
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:51,108
That every problem
had a solution.

563
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:52,641
You tell me where
the solution is

564
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:54,808
on this one.

565
00:28:04,374 --> 00:28:09,041
I don't have an answer,
Mr. President.

566
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:12,474
But if you want
the Suvarov motorcade

567
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,374
to turn back,

568
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,975
I need to do it now.

569
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:30,008
We know the terrorists are
willing to kill civilians.

570
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:34,242
And the low... the low end
of the casualty range

571
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:36,741
on this one is...

572
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:38,641
100,000 lives.

573
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,441
Yes, sir.

574
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:46,941
I decided before that I couldn't
risk all those lives

575
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:49,674
to save one man--
the Russian president.

576
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:54,608
I can't risk those lives now...

577
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:57,975
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
even to save my own wife.

578
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,941
Damn you, Martha,

579
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:03,541
for putting me in this position.

580
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,341
You brought it on yourself.

581
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:15,274
Mike...

582
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:26,708
Pray with me, Mike.

583
00:29:31,407 --> 00:29:36,075
Uh, Mr. President,
with all due respect,

584
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:40,108
this is a personal matter.

585
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:41,841
I don't...

586
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:43,574
Please, Mike.

587
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,741
How much longer
until we can send this out?

588
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:03,307
A couple of minutes.
I've almost hacked in.

589
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:05,108
We don't have
a couple of minutes.

590
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:06,608
EDGAR:
I'm almost there.

591
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:08,574
Oh, no.

592
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,841
Lynn cut us off.

593
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,008
What do I do?

594
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,975
I think it's too late
to do anything.

595
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:19,008
Mr. Stiles,

596
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:20,841
did you really think
I wouldn't notice

597
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:22,208
that you were trying
to access my com?

598
00:30:22,274 --> 00:30:24,307
Lynn, listen, we need to talk...
Shut up!

599
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:25,841
These people are working
against CTU protocols.

600
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,142
That means they're
working against me.

601
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,274
Lynn, what is this?

602
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,374
We were trying to warn
Secret Service

603
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,008
on an attack
on Suvarov's
motorcade.

604
00:30:31,075 --> 00:30:32,341
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles
and Ms. O'Brian--

605
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:33,641
put them in holding.

606
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,508
And then escort Audrey Raines
out of CTU.

607
00:30:35,574 --> 00:30:36,841
I can't do that.

608
00:30:36,908 --> 00:30:38,208
Yes, you can, Curtis.

609
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:39,908
It's a direct order.

610
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:40,975
Now do it.

611
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,474
You forced them
to work covertly.

612
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,708
They had no choice.

613
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:44,841
You're not behaving
rationally, Lynn.

614
00:30:44,908 --> 00:30:46,474
LYNN:
You and you,

615
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,474
take them all into custody
including Mr. Manning.

616
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,407
CURTIS:
If you try to carry out
that command,

617
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,741
I will draw my weapon.

618
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,541
If he draws his weapon,
shoot him.

619
00:30:53,608 --> 00:30:55,341
CURTIS:
This situation is already
getting out of control.

620
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,374
Don't make it worse.

621
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,975
McGILL:
Why are you hesitating?!

622
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,508
I gave you an order.
Now do it!

623
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:07,541
What would you like me to do,
Mr. Manning?

624
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:08,841
What?!

625
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,741
Lynn McGill, I'm relieving you
of your command

626
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:13,307
under the incapacity clause
of Section 112.

627
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:15,041
You'll do no such thing.

628
00:31:15,108 --> 00:31:16,208
Take him away.

629
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,407
You can't do that.

630
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,674
He can't do this.
Don't touch me.

631
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:26,908
This is an unjustified
usurpation of my authority.

632
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:27,941
Do you hear me?

633
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:30,242
We're in the middle
of a crisis.

634
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,441
There are going to be
repercussions.

635
00:31:32,508 --> 00:31:35,407
Everyone involved in this
is going to face prosecution.

636
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,341
This is Curtis Manning.

637
00:31:40,407 --> 00:31:42,641
Release Bill Buchanan
from holding

638
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,407
and inform Division that
he's been reinstated

639
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:46,075
as director of CTU

640
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,708
under Section 112 provisions.

641
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:51,208
Everyone, get back

642
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,641
to your stations.

643
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:10,228
Fill me in.
Chloe and Edgar
detected chatter

644
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:12,561
indicating a possible attack on
President Suvarov's motorcade

645
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:15,094
en route to the airport.
How'd they get
Suvarov's route?

646
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,628
We don't know, but
the most likely

647
00:32:16,695 --> 00:32:18,628
point of intercept
is the downtown corridor.

648
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:21,094
Has Secret Service
been notified?
Lynn refused to do so.

649
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:22,762
Notify Secret Service now.
I need your

650
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:24,994
level one access
code to override the
firewall Lynn put up.

651
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:26,361
Here.
I need Carrie back.

652
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:29,994
He fired her for no reason.
Have security reinstate her.

653
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:32,294
Edgar, pull up satellite and all
possible intercept points,

654
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:33,927
and call the president.

655
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,495
Yes, sir.
Where are we on

656
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:37,661
the location of the
nerve gas canisters?
No substantial progress.

657
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:40,862
What about the lead
Jack was following?
He traced the Sentox

658
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,828
back to Omicron International
where it was manufactured.

659
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:44,395
Is that where Jack is now?

660
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,495
Yes.
EDGAR:
Mr. Buchanan,

661
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:48,361
president's on the line.

662
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:50,094
Mr. President,
we have intelligence

663
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:53,027
that indicates
President Suvarov's motorcade

664
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:55,395
may be attacked
in the next few minutes.

665
00:33:00,428 --> 00:33:01,561
Is that so?

666
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:02,894
Yes, sir.

667
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:05,328
We are in the process
of notifying Secret Service.

668
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:09,027
What we <i>can</i> tell you is that
if the attack happens

669
00:33:09,094 --> 00:33:11,395
it will occur
in or around the downtown area.

670
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:15,128
The motorcade is approaching
that area now, sir.

671
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,862
Mr. President?

672
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:29,961
Bill. Mike Novick.

673
00:33:30,027 --> 00:33:33,828
The president is at a loss
for words.

674
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:37,795
His wife is
in the Suvarov's limousine.

675
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:45,795
Thank you.
You've done a good job.

676
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,495
What do we do?

677
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,561
There's nothing we <i>can</i> do, sir.

678
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:58,061
CTU is informing
the Secret Service.

679
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:02,228
They'll no doubt take
defensive measures,

680
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:03,461
which makes the attack

681
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:06,261
substantially less likely
to succeed.

682
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:21,328
AARON:
Yes, sir.

683
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,894
Protocol red.

684
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,561
Protocol red.
Hold on tight.

685
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,428
We're turning around--
we just received intelligence

686
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:29,695
about a threat
to the motorcade.

687
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,328
They're turning around!

688
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:39,395
We're under attack!

689
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:41,461
We need backup now!

690
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:58,595
It's a missile fire.
The motorcade's been hit.

691
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:01,061
A-Aaron?

692
00:35:01,128 --> 00:35:02,495
Aaron?

693
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,661
Oh, my God...

694
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,461
( <i>softly</i> ):
Aaron... Aaron...

695
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,161
It's okay.

696
00:35:56,228 --> 00:35:57,728
Are you okay?

697
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:14,862
Novick.

698
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:16,828
Yeah, Frank.

699
00:36:16,894 --> 00:36:19,661
How badly?

700
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:21,695
And what about
Mrs. Logan?

701
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,961
I will. Thank you.

702
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:30,228
Your wife survived
the attack.

703
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:34,061
CTU intervened in time.

704
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,628
Thank God.

705
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:42,894
What about the Suvarovs?

706
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:46,561
They were shaken up,
but, uh, they'll be okay.

707
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:53,027
He's going to think
I tipped off CTU.

708
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:55,528
It won't matter to him
that I tried to keep

709
00:36:55,595 --> 00:36:57,061
my end of the bargain.

710
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:01,027
I agree.

711
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:03,971
?????

712
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:22,208
All the work
on the Sentox project
was run out of here.

713
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,208
How restricted
was the access?

714
00:37:24,274 --> 00:37:26,741
Extremely. For security reasons,
each defense contract

715
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:29,775
was run out of its own
separate dedicated bunker,

716
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:31,908
each bunker's a completely
sealed environment.

717
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:35,374
Nothing gets in
and nothing gets out.

718
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:47,274
This is gonna
take some time.

719
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:48,875
I've got to merge some files,

720
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:50,441
find out who's working
on this project.

721
00:37:50,508 --> 00:37:52,541
You're Senior Vice President
and you don't know?

722
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:54,942
Give me a break, Jack--
there's 8,000 people

723
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:56,374
that work for this company.

724
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,641
I got to run a sort--
it's gonna take me a minute.

725
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:02,842
So who's the honcho
over at CTU now?

726
00:38:02,908 --> 00:38:06,007
Bill Buchanan.

727
00:38:06,074 --> 00:38:07,675
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Buchanan. What a stiff.

728
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:09,842
No wonder everything's
going to hell over there.

729
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:11,541
You guys keep getting rid

730
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:13,374
of everybody
who can do their job.

731
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,608
You made your own bed.

732
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,374
You accused
the wrong man, Jack.

733
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:19,141
I wasn't the lead investigator;
I showed them what I found.

734
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,974
I was framed.
By who?

735
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:24,641
Nina Myers, George Mason...
Who knows?

736
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:28,908
But I'll tell you, the one thing
that just hangs on me,

737
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,741
I'll tell you,
the one thing that just...

738
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,475
hurts me is that
you didn't believe me.

739
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:38,308
You made it impossible
to believe you.

740
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:40,408
How could I possibly defend you?

741
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:43,575
You wouldn't even
defend yourself.

742
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:47,007
No one gave me the chance.

743
00:38:54,274 --> 00:38:56,274
Okay, we got
something here.

744
00:38:56,341 --> 00:38:58,274
Lead scientist,
head of Project Sentox--

745
00:38:58,341 --> 00:39:00,308
Alan Burkett, PhD.

746
00:39:00,374 --> 00:39:02,174
I'm gonna need
to speak to him.

747
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:03,842
Well, you're gonna
have a problem.

748
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,241
Died in a helicopter crash
in Geneva two years ago.

749
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:10,074
Let's see what else we got.

750
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:11,541
This is bizarre.

751
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:13,308
Two other senior
scientists

752
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:15,775
on the Sentox project--
one drowned on a diving trip

753
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,808
in the Bahamas,
the other burned to death

754
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,675
in a car accident
two weeks later.

755
00:39:19,741 --> 00:39:21,308
What the hell is going on?

756
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:22,675
CTU's gonna have

757
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:24,074
to break it down.

758
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:26,608
How do I upload the files
and get them ready to transfer?

759
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:27,608
We need I.T.

760
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:28,641
They're next-door.

761
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,608
I'll get somebody to help us.

762
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:31,942
I'll CTU know that

763
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:34,141
we're sending the files over.

764
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:43,875
Hello?

765
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:45,875
Damn it.

766
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,608
Oh, my God.

767
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,842
How could I be so stupid?

768
00:40:27,641 --> 00:40:30,074
WOMAN ( <i>over phone</i> ):
Yes?
Yeah, it's me.

769
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:32,174
I listened to everything
Bauer had to say

770
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:34,274
about the thumb drive--
CTU does not have

771
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:36,107
enough information to hurt us.

772
00:40:36,174 --> 00:40:37,942
What about Bauer?

773
00:40:38,007 --> 00:40:42,007
Well, in about one minute,
he'll be dead.

774
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,775
Tell the media we don't know how

775
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:07,808
the terrorists found out
about the Suvarovs' route.

776
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,274
We're looking
into it now.

777
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:13,974
Mike, I've been thinking that...

778
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:17,641
diplomatically, we should
play up the fact that Martha

779
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,842
was in the vehicle.
Why is that, sir?

780
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:22,174
It will get rid of any suspicion
that we might have been...

781
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,775
( <i>phone rings</i> )
shortchanging
Suvarov's security.

782
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:29,241
There he is.

783
00:42:35,408 --> 00:42:37,007
Hello.

784
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:38,808
I thought we had
an understanding.

785
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,508
I had nothing
to do with this.

786
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:42,775
You have to believe me.
It was your job

787
00:42:42,842 --> 00:42:44,074
to make sure no
one interfered

788
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:45,575
with the attack
on the Suvarovs.

789
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:47,508
It happened outside
of my authority.

790
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:49,107
I told no one.

791
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:52,208
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

792
00:42:52,274 --> 00:42:54,041
then its new ally,
the United States,

793
00:42:54,107 --> 00:42:56,741
will pay with the lives
of its citizens.

794
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,741
Mr. President,
this is our final conversation.

795
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:01,541
Good-bye.
