1
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,867
( crying )

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:18,869
Your wife survived the attack.

3
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,504
Thank God.

4
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:22,207
LOGAN:
I should never have given in.

5
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,611
I should have ordered back
the motorcade.

6
00:00:23,677 --> 00:00:25,547
The terrorist attack failed.

7
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:26,950
We have to assume

8
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:28,687
they'll make good
on their threat to use

9
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:30,992
the Sentox nerve gas
on American soil.

10
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:32,527
Listen, I-I made
a mistake.

11
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:35,198
I didn't think that
I had any choice.

12
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,770
MARTHA:
You didn't stand up to them.

13
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,172
You saved my life.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,743
You're welcome.

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,178
Country's lucky

16
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:43,381
to have men like you.

17
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:45,351
I'm lucky.

18
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:48,858
Mrs. Logan?

19
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:50,828
Christopher Henderson
was responsible for setting up

20
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:52,231
the deal that allowed
the terrorists

21
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:53,968
to gain control of the Sentox.

22
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,604
He left me for dead.

23
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:57,240
BUCHANAN:
Right now,
Henderson is our primary link.

24
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,877
JACK:
You are going
to tell me now
how to find

25
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:00,112
the rest of the nerve gas.

26
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:01,381
Do it, Jack.
Get it done.

27
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:02,317
Shoot me.

28
00:01:02,383 --> 00:01:03,619
( gunshot )

29
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,423
( screaming )
Oh, you son of a bitch.

30
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,692
I shot her above the kneecap.

31
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,362
She can still walk.
Son of a bitch.

32
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:10,532
You make me shoot her again,
she'll be in a wheelchair

33
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,369
for the rest of her life.
Tell him what
he wants to know.

34
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:13,638
I can't.

35
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,107
I'm bringing
Christopher Henderson

36
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,912
into CTU.
I'm sorry...

37
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,615
I need an interrogation room
prepped.

38
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:20,249
I don't care
that you took my wallet.

39
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:21,820
I just need
to get my keycard back.

40
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:23,155
It's of no value to you.

41
00:01:23,223 --> 00:01:25,027
It just lets me in and out
of this building.

42
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,595
JENNY:
Okay, you told me
we were just going to take

43
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:28,599
his cash and a credit card.

44
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,135
That's how I'm getting us
all this money.

45
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:32,107
$20,000 line
of credit

46
00:01:32,173 --> 00:01:33,743
right here.

47
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,680
Who's going to pay you
that kind of money?

48
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:36,748
( gunshot )

49
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:39,020
( screams )

50
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,026
( gunshot )

51
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,193
I have the keycard.

52
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:44,162
BIERKO:
How long will it take for you

53
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,531
to reprogram it?

54
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,070
Five minutes, and then
we will be able to use it

55
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:49,807
to access CTU.

56
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:52,011
Good.

57
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:23,403
* *

58
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:46,479
* *

59
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,106
BIERKO:
Yes.

60
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,575
I'm reprogramming

61
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,246
the CTU keycard right now.

62
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:04,781
Will it work?

63
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,218
I need to change the ID,

64
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:08,721
but preserve McGill's
executive entry privileges.

65
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,192
It won't be a problem.

66
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,627
Good.

67
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,565
Our couriers are delivering
the canisters to the targets.

68
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,501
They'll be in place soon.

69
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,405
When are you
launching your attacks?

70
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:19,075
After you're done at CTU.

71
00:03:19,143 --> 00:03:21,046
I'm a few minutes out.

72
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:22,380
Call me when you're there.

73
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:24,484
Understood.

74
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:29,094
( beeps )

75
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:31,065
( keyboard clicking )

76
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,342
BUCHANAN:
We were able
to neutralize the attack

77
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:37,343
on the hospital, sir.

78
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,478
Good.

79
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,548
Do we have any idea

80
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,485
what the terrorists'
next target might be?

81
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:44,623
We're working with federal
and state authorities

82
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,526
to harden security
around the highest-value targets

83
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,062
in Los Angeles.

84
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,567
In other words, no.
We're completely in the dark.

85
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:51,937
We're just sitting around,

86
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:53,539
waiting for Bierko
to hit us again.

87
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:54,876
We do have one
promising lead, sir.

88
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,081
Jack Bauer was able to recapture
the man who escaped,

89
00:03:58,149 --> 00:04:00,252
Christopher Henderson.

90
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,223
Henderson was
a defense contractor

91
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,427
who brokered the sale
of the nerve gas to Bierko.

92
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,731
Is this the same
Christopher Henderson

93
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,937
who worked at CTU?

94
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:10,873
Yes, sir. He was head
of Field Ops,

95
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,210
until Jack brought him down
on corruption charges.

96
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:16,417
And this Henderson knows
how to find Bierko?

97
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,421
We believe so,
but he's not cooperating.

98
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,358
Jack's bringing him in
for further interrogation.

99
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,730
Keep me posted
on any progress.

100
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,600
Yes, sir.

101
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,105
Mr. Buchanan,
Tony Almeida's

102
00:04:28,173 --> 00:04:30,242
been asking to see you
down in the Clinic.

103
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,511
I don't have time right now.

104
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:33,449
Tell him I'll get to him
as soon as I can.

105
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:34,417
And, Ms. Raines.

106
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:38,392
Kim Bauer is here.

107
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,527
She's just
clearing Security.

108
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,076
Put her in the Field Ops Office,
please.

109
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,249
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:02,603
BUCHANAN:
What's Kim Bauer doing here?

111
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,808
Jack asked me to call her.

112
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:08,013
Does she know?

113
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:10,051
Not yet.

114
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:12,423
Who's with her?

115
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,792
I don't know,

116
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,462
but I'll find out
from Security.

117
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,865
Excuse me.

118
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:20,071
( touch tone beeping )

119
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:22,341
( phone ringing )

120
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,578
This is Bauer.

121
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:25,781
Hey, it's me.

122
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:27,485
Is Burke prepped

123
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:28,619
for the medical
interrogation?

124
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:29,620
Yes.

125
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,093
Jack, Kim just

126
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,563
arrived at CTU.

127
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:35,433
What did you say to her?

128
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,001
Nothing yet.

129
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,139
Good. I want her
to hear it from me.

130
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:42,178
Jack, it might be easier for her

131
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:44,450
if she knows that you're alive
before she sees you.

132
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:46,954
When I first saw you...

133
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:48,791
It's-it's just...

134
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,894
Yeah, I know.

135
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:54,100
I-I... I understand.

136
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,041
Look, when you talk to her,

137
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,812
just explain that the reason why

138
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,414
I couldn't tell her
I was still alive was 'cause

139
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:02,984
I was trying to protect her.

140
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,787
Of course, I will.

141
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,757
Audrey, thank you.

142
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:13,437
Kim's at CTU right now.

143
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,011
You know, after you died,

144
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:19,249
Chase left her,
and she hit bottom.

145
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:21,252
Did you know that?

146
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,358
It's only right now she's
putting her life back together.

147
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,197
Or maybe you did know that,

148
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,201
but you just couldn't
do anything about it, huh?

149
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:30,504
This doesn't concern you.

150
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,373
Oh, I think
it concerns me, Jack.

151
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,844
Miriam and I were there
for Kim when you weren't.

152
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:38,451
Whatever you think of me,
we love that girl.

153
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,006
Are you okay?

154
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:51,476
( sighs )

155
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,181
Both my parents died here.

156
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:57,754
I swore I'd never come back
to this place.

157
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:00,092
Well, we can leave
right now if you want.

158
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,465
Here, she's coming.

159
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:06,770
Kim.

160
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,441
Hi.

161
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:09,611
Hi.

162
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:10,747
This is Barry Landes.

163
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:12,583
Hi.
Audrey Raines.

164
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,051
So, what is it?

165
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,588
What did you have to tell me
that was so important?

166
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:18,994
I-I think it would be better
if we talked in private.

167
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:22,134
Whatever you have to say, you
can say it in front of Barry.

168
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,569
Kim, I really think
that that this...

169
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,407
No, no, it's-it's okay.

170
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,021
It's about your father.

171
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:36,695
What about my father?

172
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,534
He's alive.

173
00:07:43,908 --> 00:07:46,112
Kim, he wanted to tell
you, but he couldn't,

174
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,916
in order to
protect you.

175
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:50,387
Someone inside the
government wanted
your father dead,

176
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:53,694
so he staged
his own death and
went underground.

177
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,733
He knew that you
wouldn't be safe

178
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,439
if he told you
that he was alive.

179
00:08:00,507 --> 00:08:04,447
I didn't know either
until this morning.

180
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,327
I thought maybe if I told you
now before you saw him,

181
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:13,397
it might be a
little bit easier.

182
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,138
He's on his way
in now to CTU.

183
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,898
Hello, Mike.

184
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,836
Mr. Vice President.

185
00:08:33,904 --> 00:08:36,240
I thought you were
in Salt Lake City today.

186
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,379
Hal canceled his engagements
to be here, Mike.

187
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:42,485
I think you'll agree
we need all hands on deck

188
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:44,522
to deal with this
Sentox situation.

189
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,193
Of course, Mr. President.
Okay.

190
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,466
So, what's on
your mind, Hal?

191
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:51,502
Mr. President,
when these terrorists attack,

192
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,872
you're going to need

193
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,243
to maintain order.

194
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,612
And I submit to you,

195
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,282
the plan you're
implementing with CTU

196
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:00,252
is inadequate.

197
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,425
Sir, it was drawn up
after a careful study

198
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:05,763
for an attack
of just this magnitude.

199
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,402
CTU is already coordinating
with first responders.

200
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,142
Fine, and they should
still do so.

201
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,815
But what I'm proposing
is something far more sweeping.

202
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:17,619
And I believe

203
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:19,856
it's warranted by the facts.
Andrew?

204
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,331
begin with,

205
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,303
I'm revising all
of CTU's casualty estimates,

206
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:28,740
based on the assumption

207
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:30,208
that the terrorists will hit

208
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:32,145
all of these high-profile
targets: hospitals,

209
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:33,649
malls,

210
00:09:33,716 --> 00:09:35,452
sporting arenas,
transit hubs.

211
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,155
My low estimate is

212
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:38,791
400,000 casualties.

213
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:41,997
NOVICK:
Now, that's a considerable
upward revision.

214
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:43,634
I'd like to know
how you reached it.

215
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:45,805
Well, you're free to talk
to my working group.

216
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:47,107
You know, frankly,

217
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:48,677
I believe that
there are a lot of people

218
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,949
who don't take this threat
seriously enough.
I assure you

219
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:52,183
we're taking it very seriously.

220
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:53,520
We have no agenda

221
00:09:53,587 --> 00:09:54,722
but to do so.

222
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,025
Considering these
revised numbers,

223
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:57,226
what's your
recommendation?

224
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:59,363
Well, I believe
you should be thinking

225
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,069
of a preemptive declaration
of martial law

226
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,404
in the greater
Los Angeles area.

227
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:04,741
NOVICK:
Mr. President,

228
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,946
martial law is
appropriate only

229
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:10,018
as a last-ditch
measure,

230
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:11,721
not as a preemptive one.

231
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:13,458
Go on.

232
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:16,596
Every study we've done
has shown it would
incite more unrest,

233
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,801
not less.

234
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,804
And you couldn't do it without
approval from Congress.

235
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:24,044
Which is why
we won't call it martial law.

236
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:25,814
No one is going
to play semantics here

237
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:27,216
when we're putting troops
on the street

238
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:29,387
to try to keep people
from killing each other.

239
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:32,059
You're talking about a panic
that hasn't happened.

240
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:34,597
Right now, the public
isn't even aware of a threat.

241
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:38,071
You declare martial law,
you'll have to tell them.

242
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:40,942
How long would it take
to deploy the troops?

243
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,880
I've already been in touch
with the Pentagon.

244
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:46,352
National Guard and Army units
are on standby, pending

245
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,689
your decision.

246
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:50,027
Mr. President, I-I agree
there's a case

247
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:52,164
to be made, but for God's sake,
let's make it to Congress.

248
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,666
We can declare

249
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:55,235
an emergency session...
We don't have
time, Mike.

250
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:56,907
Hal is right.
This-This attack

251
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,643
could take place
any minute.

252
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,081
If CTU can't find this man
Bierko, we're going

253
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:02,984
to get hit.

254
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:06,690
It would be smart
to have control of the streets.

255
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:29,534
This is a mistake, Jack.

256
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,971
You don't want
to do this.

257
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:32,240
Get out.

258
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,642
I'll get immediate
immunity if I talk.

259
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:35,011
You know it,
and I know it.

260
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:37,784
And I'm not even going
to ask for it.

261
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,385
Damn it, Jack.
Will you listen to me?

262
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:40,588
I'm not trying
to protect myself.

263
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:42,158
I'm trying to protect
this country.

264
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:43,360
What do you mean?

265
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,231
You don't want to
know what I know.

266
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:47,501
You get me to talk,
I promise you

267
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:48,970
you'll just be opening
Pandora's box.

268
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:51,041
Tell me, and let me
judge that for myself.

269
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,216
That's what I thought.

270
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,694
BURKE:
I'll set him up in Holding.

271
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,598
Let me know when he's ready
for interrogation.
Yes, sir.

272
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,768
Jack.

273
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:21,465
Keycard, please.

274
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:39,706
Oh. All clear, sir.

275
00:13:02,534 --> 00:13:03,936
Yeah.

276
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,905
Okay, well, thanks.

277
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:07,708
That was Curtis;
he's on his way back

278
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:08,843
from the hospital.

279
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:12,549
Okay, good.

280
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,757
Audrey.

281
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:25,837
Did you speak to Kim?

282
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:27,973
Yes.
What was her reaction?

283
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,274
She's a little confused.

284
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,479
You should also know
that she's here with someone.

285
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,515
I think it might be
her boyfriend.

286
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:35,051
His name is Barry Landes.

287
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,220
Where is she?

288
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:39,023
She's in the Field Ops Office.

289
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:46,300
Okay, thanks.
Yeah.

290
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,415
Hey.

291
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:21,024
I don't know what to say.

292
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,260
I don't know what you expect me
to say.

293
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,298
You don't have to say anything.

294
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:29,102
Why didn't you just tell me
you were alive?

295
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,841
I couldn't.

296
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,243
If you knew
I was alive,

297
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,911
you would
have been at risk.

298
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:37,015
I had no choice.
You could have chosen

299
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:40,019
to trust her.

300
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,459
I'd like to speak with
my daughter alone, please.

301
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:46,129
I don't think
that's a good idea.

302
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,598
I don't care what you think.

303
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:48,499
I'm sure you don't.

304
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:50,302
All that matters is you,

305
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:51,805
and the judgments you make.

306
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:53,106
Even if it affects
those that love you.

307
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:54,575
Kim.

308
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,646
Barry, please,

309
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:59,083
let me speak
to my dad.

310
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:06,561
I'll be right outside.

311
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:14,173
Don't judge him.

312
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,980
He was there
when no one else was.

313
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,230
The most painful thing
that I've ever been through

314
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,633
was having to walk away

315
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:34,738
from you.

316
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:37,543
Even more painful
than losing your mother.

317
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,880
But it was the only
way to make sure

318
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:44,120
that you would be safe.

319
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:45,889
I buried you.

320
00:15:45,957 --> 00:15:51,265
I... I know.

321
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,269
( sighs )

322
00:15:53,336 --> 00:15:55,471
You know, there's something
wrong with people like you.

323
00:15:57,507 --> 00:16:00,011
You can't hold on
to anything.

324
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,313
Chase couldn't either.

325
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:02,614
He tried for a while,
and then he was gone,

326
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:04,418
just like you.

327
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,022
And now, you're back...

328
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:14,066
and I'm just supposed to...

329
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:16,170
I'm happy that you're alive.

330
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:19,576
I am.

331
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:22,613
But I can't give you
what you want right now.

332
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,959
Okay.

333
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:32,729
I understand that.

334
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:42,945
I need you to know
that I'm sorry, and I...

335
00:16:43,013 --> 00:16:44,548
Please, just go.

336
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:49,789
Excuse me.

337
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:51,959
Burke needs you
in Holding.

338
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:53,896
I'll be there in a minute.

339
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,867
I've got to go.

340
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:58,070
Barry's got a conference.

341
00:16:58,136 --> 00:16:59,905
We have a plane
to catch.

342
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:03,478
Please, Kimberly...
I want you to stay

343
00:17:03,546 --> 00:17:05,515
just a little longer.

344
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:08,685
There are some things
that I still need to tell you.

345
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:11,190
Please?

346
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:14,361
I'll talk to Barry.

347
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:18,202
Fine.

348
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,274
I'll be right back.

349
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:56,060
* *

350
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,447
( fan whirring )

351
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,016
BUCHANAN:
You call for me, Tony?

352
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,185
Yeah.

353
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,389
What's going on?

354
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,892
That's what I wanted to ask you.

355
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,296
What do you mean?

356
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,567
What do you think
I mean, Bill?

357
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:45,706
My wife was killed this morning,
right in front of my eyes.

358
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:47,774
And nobody here has told me
who did it, or why.

359
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:50,079
The investigation
is ongoing, Tony.

360
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:53,116
Come on, Bill.

361
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,354
I used to work here.

362
00:18:55,421 --> 00:18:58,158
I know that's what you say
to people when you don't want

363
00:18:58,225 --> 00:18:59,561
to tell them the truth.

364
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:02,398
The truth is you're
not an agent anymore.

365
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:06,405
And what you're asking
me is classified.

366
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:08,307
Tony, it doesn't
matter what I tell you,

367
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,409
there's nothing you can do.

368
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:10,911
I know there's nothing I can do!

369
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:12,981
Look at me, for God's sake!

370
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:17,656
I just want to know who did it.

371
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,327
I think for the sake
of all the years
I've given this place,

372
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,363
and all the sacrifices I've made
I think, I deserve to know.

373
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,534
Don't you?

374
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:32,111
All I can tell you is...

375
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:36,418
Michelle's murder
was part of a bigger plan...

376
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,755
to supply terrorists
with Sentox nerve gas.

377
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,729
Who's behind it?

378
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,537
Who's responsible, Bill?

379
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,074
The highest we've been able
to get up the chain of command

380
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,211
is someone you might know
from when you worked here.

381
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:55,715
Christopher Henderson.

382
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:59,253
What?

383
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:02,125
Why?

384
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:03,794
We're working
on it, Tony.

385
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:07,835
Don't let him
get away with this, Bill.

386
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,237
Don't you let him cut a deal.

387
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,508
I won't.

388
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:50,200
What do we know about the man
who's with Kim?

389
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:55,843
He's registered
with the state as a
clinical psychologist.

390
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:58,614
She was his patient?
I think so, yes.

391
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:05,124
He's ready.

392
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:11,434
Whatever he's not telling us
is important.

393
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:17,008
He knows what's coming.

394
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,814
And he's willing tolerate
an inhuman amount of pain.

395
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,751
Open the door.

396
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:27,024
( door opens )

397
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:49,426
Damn it, Christopher.

398
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:52,098
I don't think
you became a part of this

399
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:54,001
because of self-interest.

400
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,670
I honestly believe
that you think

401
00:21:55,738 --> 00:21:56,872
what you're doing right now

402
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,542
is the best thing
for this country,

403
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,811
but it is not your
choice to make.

404
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,481
That's good, Jack.

405
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:05,585
Disarm your subject's
resolve by showing empathy,

406
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:06,620
and respect for his agenda.

407
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:08,958
This is not a joke.

408
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:10,594
Thousands of lives are at stake.

409
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:14,967
people that we promised to
protect, to make feel safe.

410
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:17,972
There is enough time for you
to tell me what I need to know

411
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,073
to stop this insanity.

412
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,076
Please.

413
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:24,015
I'm sorry, Jack. I really am.

414
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:27,386
But I can't tell you
what you want to know.

415
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:36,109
Start it.

416
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,868
Mrs. Logan.

417
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:46,275
Mrs. Logan,
if I could have a minute.

418
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,479
If this is about Aaron,
it doesn't concern you.

419
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:49,746
No, Mrs. Logan, it doesn't.

420
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:51,182
And I'm not here to discuss it.

421
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:53,518
What is it?

422
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:55,787
The country's facing a crisis.

423
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:58,225
The President needs you.

424
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,593
( chuckles )

425
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:02,762
He, he needs me.

426
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:05,133
If you think the decision
to let the attack

427
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,472
on the motorcade proceed was
easy for him, you're wrong.

428
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,443
I was with him when he got
down on his knees and prayed.

429
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,214
He did?

430
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:17,648
He loves you.

431
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:19,418
He didn't want to lose you.

432
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:24,791
But with the lives of so
many people in jeopardy,

433
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:26,894
he felt he had no choice.

434
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:36,340
We've known each other
a long time, you and I.

435
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:37,841
Why don't you stop
talking about

436
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,343
what a positive
influence I am,

437
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,313
and tell me precisely
what it is

438
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,182
you're trying
to get me to do.

439
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:51,725
Vice President Gardner
is advising your husband

440
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:55,865
to declare martial law
in Los Angeles in preparation

441
00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:59,001
for the release
of the nerve gas.

442
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:01,639
He wants to do it
without congressional sanction

443
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:04,076
or a timetable
to lift it.

444
00:25:04,143 --> 00:25:05,444
He can't just rewrite the law.

445
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,279
Hal's got an agenda.

446
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:08,714
Well, he's wrong.

447
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,618
This will make things far worse.

448
00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:12,953
Mrs. Logan,
all I know is,

449
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,156
the President is listening
to Hal Gardner.

450
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:17,859
And it will only
help the country

451
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:20,463
to have him
listening to you as well.

452
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:13,030
EDGAR:
No, hold off on deploying
units seven through 12

453
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:14,799
until we finalize
our target scenario.

454
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:15,967
What is it?

455
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:17,704
I was running
a channel clearance,

456
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:19,673
and I noticed that one
of the environmental systems

457
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:21,206
put out a trouble flag.

458
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,209
It's probably a tech crew
changing out a circuit board.

459
00:26:23,277 --> 00:26:25,479
That's what I thought, but
I logged on to the manifest.

460
00:26:25,547 --> 00:26:26,548
There's nothing scheduled.

461
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:27,616
Carrie, I'm in the middle

462
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,017
of coordinating with
first reonders.

463
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:31,820
We're on high alert; I
don't have time for this.

464
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,490
You don't have to snap at me.

465
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:35,125
I just thought
someone should check it out.

466
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,194
Then check it out.

467
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:43,869
Carrie.

468
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:07,266
( drilling )

469
00:27:57,832 --> 00:27:59,500
Can you forgive me?

470
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:04,808
You acted like the President
of the United States.

471
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:08,144
Yes, I did.

472
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:10,079
But you wanted me to
be your husband first.

473
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,321
Can't pretend that I didn't.

474
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:22,061
But...

475
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:25,999
I still love you
as much as I always did.

476
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:30,506
Martha.

477
00:28:30,574 --> 00:28:33,310
Shh.

478
00:28:33,376 --> 00:28:36,413
There'll be plenty of time
for us later.

479
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,983
You have to get back to work.

480
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,018
The country needs you

481
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,088
more than I do.

482
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:51,398
Hello?

483
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:51,885
Anybody working on the system?

484
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,866
Chloe.

485
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,497
Hi, Kim.

486
00:30:04,564 --> 00:30:06,396
You're still here.

487
00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:07,829
Yeah.

488
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:09,626
Look, my father said that
he had to do something.

489
00:30:09,694 --> 00:30:11,659
You know how long
he's gonna be?

490
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,658
No, sorry.

491
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,622
Chloe...

492
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,089
I'm kind of busy right now.

493
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:21,584
You knew my father
was alive, didn't you?

494
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:24,816
For a year and a half
you've known.

495
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:27,448
Yeah.

496
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:30,180
He trusted you.

497
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,544
Only because he had to;
I helped stage his death.

498
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,776
You don't have to make excuses.

499
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:35,474
I'm not making excuses.

500
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,740
Four people knew he was alive,
two of them are dead:

501
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:39,771
President Palmer,
and Michelle Dessler;

502
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,470
and Tony Almeida's
in serious condition.

503
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:44,501
Michelle's dead?

504
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:48,564
The only reason
I'm alive is

505
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:50,097
because your dad found me
in time.

506
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:52,063
I know this is
really hard for you,

507
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,296
and it's none of my business,

508
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:56,260
but you should try
to cut him some slack.

509
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:03,388
( door opens )

510
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,318
What's going on, Bill?

511
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:12,480
Lynn...

512
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:18,443
What is it?

513
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:24,638
We just got a call from LAPD.

514
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:26,570
They found your sister's body

515
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:27,670
in her apartment.

516
00:31:27,737 --> 00:31:30,236
She'd been shot.

517
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:31,867
What?

518
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:33,033
I just talked to her.

519
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,999
I saw her today.

520
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,697
That's impossible. She can't...

521
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:38,995
I'm sorry.

522
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,992
The police ID'd her body.

523
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:46,057
My God.

524
00:31:56,017 --> 00:31:57,614
If you need a phone

525
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:03,211
to make some personal calls
or talk to the police...

526
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,910
Her boyfriend did this to her.

527
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:07,674
Tell me he's
in custody.

528
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:10,206
Is his name Dwayne Thompkins?

529
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:11,205
Yeah.

530
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:12,171
He didn't do it.

531
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:14,702
They found his body, too.

532
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:24,263
Lynn, the police are trying
to make sense of something.

533
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:29,125
Do you know if either
your sister or her boyfriend

534
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:31,724
were involved
in dealing drugs,

535
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,988
or had ties to....
organized crime?

536
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:38,784
Uh...

537
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:42,848
She was a...
pretty serious user.

538
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:49,576
But organized crime--
no way. Why?

539
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:54,406
The killings were clearly
the work of a professional.

540
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:58,603
Oh, my God.

541
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:03,267
I need to see
preliminary forensics.

542
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:05,665
Who's investigating?
I have to talk to them.

543
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:06,764
I can arrange a meeting...

544
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:07,930
No, I have to talk
to them now.

545
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:08,896
They have to search
the apartment.

546
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:10,195
See if my keycard is there.

547
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:11,328
What are you talking about?
What keycard?

548
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:12,759
My CTU keycard!

549
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:13,960
She has it, Bill!

550
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,092
What was she doing
with your keycard?

551
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,123
It was stolen from me,
all right?

552
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,355
Her boyfriend took it.

553
00:33:18,422 --> 00:33:19,354
Why didn't you
report this?

554
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:20,621
I'm reporting it now!

555
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,086
We don't have time
to argue about this.

556
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:23,751
Call and see if anybody
used it to breach security.

557
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:24,751
It was taken about...

558
00:33:24,818 --> 00:33:26,816
about four hours ago.

559
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:30,446
( phone rings )

560
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:32,378
O'Brian.

561
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,110
Chloe, I'm in Holding with Lynn.

562
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,609
I need you to check
the gate logs, now.

563
00:33:35,677 --> 00:33:38,407
What am I looking for?

564
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,372
Check and see if anyone
used Lynn's keycard

565
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,038
to enter CTU in
the last four hours.

566
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,071
Isn't Lynn standing
right next to you?

567
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:44,635
Chloe, do it!

568
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:47,334
Oh, my God.

569
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,300
It's showing
that his card was used

570
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:51,531
less than an hour ago
at the executive entrance.

571
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:52,530
He was already here...

572
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,461
Lockdown CTU now!

573
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:55,728
This is Chloe O'Brian.

574
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:57,294
Initiate a lockdown now.

575
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:01,591
Mr. Bauer, I'm sorry.

576
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:03,023
I don't know
what's going on.

577
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:04,621
He should be
talking by now.

578
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:09,517
Damn it, Christopher.

579
00:34:09,585 --> 00:34:10,851
It's enough.

580
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:11,983
I don't want to do this.

581
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,049
Just talk to me!

582
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,680
( faintly ):
I can't...

583
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:15,847
His vitals are crashing.

584
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:16,879
I need to stabilize him
in the Clinic

585
00:34:16,947 --> 00:34:17,779
before administering
another dose.

586
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:18,812
( alarm blaring )

587
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:21,243
( cell phone rings )

588
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,508
This is Bauer.

589
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:24,207
We've been compromised.

590
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,406
Someone used a stolen keycard

591
00:34:25,473 --> 00:34:26,672
to access CTU
less than an hour ago.

592
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,838
Did you get an ID?

593
00:34:27,906 --> 00:34:29,005
Not yet.

594
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:29,870
They didn't use
the card to exit.

595
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,069
They're still here.

596
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,235
We're in lockdown,
starting a search.

597
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm on my way.
Get him over to medical.

598
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:34,733
Stabilize him.

599
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:34,904
Don't let anyone near him.

600
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,633
Did you get him?

601
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:56,632
Still working on it.

602
00:34:56,698 --> 00:34:58,198
Exits are sealed.

603
00:34:58,266 --> 00:34:59,631
Security cleared Third East,
they're going room to room.

604
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,330
Give me a comm unit.

605
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:02,662
Audrey, is Kim
still up in Field Ops?

606
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:03,661
With Landes, yes.

607
00:35:03,729 --> 00:35:04,661
Get her down here.

608
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:05,660
I want a guard on her.

609
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,727
I'm on it.

610
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:07,525
EDGAR:
I think I got him in Third West.

611
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:08,459
He's in processing.

612
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:10,193
Could exit
south or north.

613
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,192
Jack, take north.

614
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:12,091
We'll give you updates.

615
00:35:12,158 --> 00:35:13,291
Mac's team
will head south.

616
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:14,556
Copy that.

617
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:16,555
Pull up north
and south angles.

618
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,254
There he is.

619
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,019
Edgar, run his face
through recognition software.

620
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:24,484
Where's Carrie?

621
00:35:24,552 --> 00:35:26,018
We need to check

622
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,583
for grid intrusions.

623
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,815
She's checking on a warning
signal in a B-socket.

624
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:30,815
Got it.

625
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,348
Checking the grid.

626
00:35:45,108 --> 00:35:46,373
( groans )

627
00:35:46,441 --> 00:35:49,073
You're gonna help me
get out of here.

628
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:52,503
He's in the north corridor.

629
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:53,570
Chloe, cover for me.

630
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:54,736
I want to see
what's keeping Carrie.

631
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:55,970
Go ahead.

632
00:35:56,036 --> 00:35:57,069
BUCHANAN:
All units,

633
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,235
he's moving west
in the north corridor.

634
00:35:58,302 --> 00:35:59,367
He's got one of our men.

635
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:17,259
Enter your passcode.

636
00:36:17,326 --> 00:36:18,657
But it's a lockdown!

637
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,890
Just do it.

638
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:29,919
( beeping )

639
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:31,618
( alarm blares )

640
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:42,279
He's in the north stairwell,
sub-level B.

641
00:36:43,445 --> 00:36:44,377
Jack, do you read?

642
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:45,678
I'm on my way.

643
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:13,064
Bill,

644
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:14,031
he's in the stairwell.

645
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:15,563
I don't think so, Jack.

646
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:17,495
Davis said he checked
sub-level B.

647
00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:18,895
Bill...

648
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:20,861
It was all clear.

649
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,724
No, he's doubled back.

650
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:28,089
He's using the stairs
to get the roof.

651
00:37:28,157 --> 00:37:29,156
All right, Jack.

652
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:31,621
I'm sending you
into the landings.

653
00:37:31,688 --> 00:37:33,587
Let me know
when you're ready to move.

654
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,153
Copy that.

655
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:42,216
( alarm continues )

656
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:53,377
Freeze!

657
00:37:54,477 --> 00:37:55,709
Let me see your hands!

658
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:58,575
Slowly.

659
00:37:58,642 --> 00:38:00,307
Drop the gun!

660
00:38:03,673 --> 00:38:04,438
Now!

661
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:17,266
Bill, it's Jack.

662
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:18,365
Hostile's down.
He's dead.

663
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:19,531
It was the only shot I had.

664
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,898
Do you have an ID, Jack?

665
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:23,762
We've got a bigger problem
than that.

666
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,196
He's got a device on him.
Looks like a relay switch.

667
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:27,527
Hold on.

668
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,493
He's got a PDA.

669
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,758
Oh, my God.

670
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:33,491
What is it, Jack?
It's a schematic

671
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,057
of CTU's ventilation system.

672
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:36,756
I think he tried to deploy nerve
gas throughout the building.

673
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:38,189
Order an evacuation.

674
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:39,621
Code six!

675
00:38:39,688 --> 00:38:40,621
Everybody out!

676
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:41,787
Go! Go!

677
00:38:41,854 --> 00:38:43,586
Jack, I have Kim with me.

678
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:45,619
Stay with her.
I'm on my way.

679
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:46,818
Make sure Burke
gets Henderson

680
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,084
out of here
as fast as he can.

681
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,084
All right, I'm on it.

682
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:50,415
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

683
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:51,414
O'Brian.

684
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:52,515
Chloe, what's going on?

685
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,114
Edgar, get out
of the building now!

686
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,345
Carrie?

687
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:03,342
( alarm continues )

688
00:39:28,563 --> 00:39:29,696
We have to get out
of the building now.

689
00:39:29,764 --> 00:39:30,696
What's going on?

690
00:39:30,763 --> 00:39:31,795
Just hurry!

691
00:39:32,862 --> 00:39:34,327
What's wrong
with those people?

692
00:39:34,394 --> 00:39:35,827
Oh, my God.

693
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:38,992
The nerve gas
is making its way in. Go.

694
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:40,058
The ducts run
from the outside in.

695
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:41,024
"Outside in"?!

696
00:39:41,091 --> 00:39:42,157
What does that mean?!

697
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:43,256
They start at the perimeter

698
00:39:43,323 --> 00:39:44,589
and reach
the building core last.

699
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:45,788
Auto-lock
the outer doors.

700
00:39:45,856 --> 00:39:46,955
Which rooms can we seal?

701
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,420
I'm working on it.

702
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:49,920
Burke, I need you to stand by.

703
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,519
We can't leave the building yet.

704
00:39:51,586 --> 00:39:52,852
I'll let you know
where you can move Henderson.

705
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:54,084
Chloe, what rooms
can we lock down?

706
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:55,151
Hold on!

707
00:39:57,449 --> 00:39:58,815
We can lock down
the Situation Room,

708
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:00,748
the upper offices
and Clinic Isolation.

709
00:40:00,814 --> 00:40:02,480
Go, people!

710
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:03,947
Kim, everybody, in the
Situation Room! Move now.

711
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:05,278
BUCHANAN:
I'll access Comm from my office!

712
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:06,377
Burke, you can move

713
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,511
Henderson
to the Clinic Isolation.

714
00:40:07,578 --> 00:40:09,211
Seal it off for bio.

715
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,009
I repeat:
Seal it off for bio.

716
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,042
Get in the Situation Room now.

717
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,508
Move!

718
00:40:13,575 --> 00:40:15,307
Chloe, seal it.

719
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:16,740
Seal all the rooms.

720
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:30,100
Open the door!

721
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,532
You have to let me in!
Open the door!

722
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,531
Oh, my God.
Let her in!

723
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:33,531
We can't break the seal.

724
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,731
You have to try

725
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,430
and find another exit
out of the building.

726
00:40:36,497 --> 00:40:37,463
Hurry! Go!

727
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:39,862
Chloe, are the rest
of the rooms sealed?

728
00:40:39,929 --> 00:40:41,494
Yes, it's done.

729
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:10,579
( gagging and choking )

730
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:14,478
Everybody, stay calm.

731
00:41:14,545 --> 00:41:16,843
There's nothing
we can do for her now.

732
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:22,374
Oh, no.

733
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:30,171
Oh, my God.

734
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,299
Chloe.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
