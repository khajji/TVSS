1
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,860
Jack Bauer is currently
undercover

2
00:00:13,927 --> 00:00:15,361
with some of the terrorists.

3
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:17,227
They're expecting Jack
to help them release

4
00:00:17,294 --> 00:00:18,960
a single canister

5
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:21,460
of Sentox nerve gas in the
Sunrise Hills Shopping Mall.

6
00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:25,027
Do you mean to actually
let them release the Sentox?

7
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:26,361
Are you out
of your mind?

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,261
We have the terrorists
under surveillance.

9
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,627
Even if they kill Bauer,

10
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:32,261
we will be able to track them

11
00:00:32,327 --> 00:00:34,127
back to the remaining
canisters.

12
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:35,793
I'll go along
with your assessment.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,860
Let them release the Sentox,

14
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,593
but you'd better find
those other canisters

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,827
or those people will have died
in vain.

16
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:43,827
There is still time
to move in and stop them

17
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,261
before they murder
all those people.

18
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,994
Audrey, we have
a directive from the President.

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,460
Do you realize how many more
people could die if these men

20
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:51,294
don't lead us
to the other 19 canisters?

21
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:55,393
with that order, stand by
and watch as they murder
all those people?

22
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:58,060
If those are the orders
of the president?

23
00:00:58,127 --> 00:00:59,827
Yes, I would have to!

24
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:00,894
The trigger's been
reconfigured.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,094
You can activate

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,194
the canisters now.

27
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:05,294
Better hope it works.

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:06,526
What's the unlock code?

29
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:09,627
Jack, the unlock code
is alpha-kilo-charlie.

30
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:11,894
Ecko-bravo-charlie.

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,660
Jack, this is a direct order
from the president.

32
00:01:14,727 --> 00:01:17,526
Now enter the correct code
and let them release the gas.

33
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:18,560
Now!

34
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:19,793
Make it work!

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,426
I told you there's nothing
I can do!

36
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,793
They have another way
to release the gas.

37
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,227
( hissing )

38
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:33,426
I managed to stop
the flow of gas,

39
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,860
but some got into
the air system.

40
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,560
We need to evacuate
the mall now.

41
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:37,727
What about the terrorists?

42
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:39,493
One's dead, one escaped.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,261
Monitor the tracking device
in the remote trigger.

44
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:44,027
The hostile that escaped
still had it on him.

45
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:46,593
I managed to activate the valve
before I got away.

46
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,760
At least some of the gas
was released into the mall.

47
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:50,560
What do you want me to do?

48
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:51,960
Come back here.

49
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:55,160
You were followed.

50
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:57,127
You know what to do.

51
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,027
( gunshot )
No!

52
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:02,027
Hostile down!

53
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:03,960
Erwich is gone,
the canisters are gone.

54
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:05,393
We've got nothing here.

55
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,994
Damn it!

56
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:17,393
REPORTER:
Despite an attempt by extremists
to derail the process,

57
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,227
the treaty was signed earlier
today by President Logan

58
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:22,593
and Russian President
Yuri Suvarov.

59
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,460
Officials from each country
are hailing the agreement

60
00:02:25,526 --> 00:02:28,526
as a major milestone
in U.S.-Russian relations.

61
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:30,426
The White House Press Secretary

62
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:34,060
has called this a critical
achievement in diplomacy

63
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,526
and will set the course
for President...

64
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:38,094
Sentox gas
is genuine.

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,793
The test was successful.

66
00:02:42,327 --> 00:02:44,526
I spent a year securing a weapon

67
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:47,760
that would bring Moscow
to its knees.

68
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:50,227
And you waste it killing
a handful

69
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,560
of American civilians.

70
00:02:56,227 --> 00:02:58,194
We were betrayed, Bierko.

71
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,493
Someone must pay.

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,793
I agree.

73
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:07,793
You were the one
who trusted the Americans.

74
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,660
Nathanson lied to us.

75
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:12,526
He plotted to turn
the gas against us.

76
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,927
Your trust nearly cost us
everything.

77
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:21,294
Since I anticipated this,

78
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:23,560
I have secured additional men
and resources

79
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:26,160
at great personal expense.

80
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,361
Have you found a way
to reconfigure the canisters

81
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:29,994
with dispersal
mechanisms?

82
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,194
Yes.

83
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,593
Do it.

84
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,327
Nathanson will
be eliminated.

85
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:35,426
Then we will

86
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:37,560
return to our original task--

87
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:40,194
striking at the heart of Russia.

88
00:03:41,526 --> 00:03:43,560
Where's Nathanson?

89
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,727
I don't know
where he went.

90
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,827
I swear, I don't.

91
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,493
( exhales )

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,361
( gunshot )

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,727
( dialing phone )

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,793
( phone ringing )

95
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,060
Yeah.

96
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,927
I took out Nathanson's men.

97
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,660
But there is no
sign of Nathanson.

98
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:11,560
Find him.

99
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,227
( dialing phone )

100
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:26,827
( phone ringing )

101
00:04:26,894 --> 00:04:28,327
Alpha-seven.

102
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,593
This is Nathanson.

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,027
Someone just
took out my men.

104
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:32,094
Who?

105
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,094
I think Bierko's
hitting us back.

106
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,526
Destroy all your databases.

107
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:36,760
( gunshot )

108
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:43,994
I know you're there, Jenny.

109
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,327
Pick up the phone.

110
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:48,294
Damn it, Jenny, I need
the keycard from my wallet!

111
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:51,627
Look, I'll leave the police
out of this.

112
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:54,526
You and your loser
boyfriend can keep
the money you stole,

113
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,027
max out my credit
cards, I don't care.

114
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,361
Just give me
back my keycard.

115
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:00,560
It's important.

116
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,127
We can't sell the keycard.

117
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,060
Why can't we just
give it to him?

118
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:11,660
I'm calling my brother.

119
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,261
No, you're not.

120
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:14,894
What is going on, Dwayne?

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm handling this.

122
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:28,027
( phone rings )

123
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:32,994
Jenny?

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,960
SECRETARY:
Please hold for the President.

125
00:05:35,027 --> 00:05:38,094
LOGAN:
Have your people recovered
the nerve gas?

126
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,127
McGill?

127
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,793
Yes, sir.
I'm here. I'm sorry.

128
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,027
( clears throat )

129
00:05:42,094 --> 00:05:43,327
Do you have
any leads?

130
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:45,960
Have you intercepted
the terrorists?

131
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,361
( sighs ):
No, sir.

132
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:49,493
The man we followed
from the mall took his own life

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,426
before he could
be apprehended.

134
00:05:51,493 --> 00:05:52,894
Damn it, McGill,
I put this on you.

135
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,627
If you'd let the
terrorists release
the Sentox gas

136
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:56,827
in the mall as I
agreed to let you do,

137
00:05:56,894 --> 00:06:00,027
we wouldn't be where
we are right now,
which is nowhere.

138
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,261
Mr. President...
Stop!

139
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:05,526
LOGAN:
Stop making excuses.

140
00:06:05,593 --> 00:06:07,793
Take responsibility
and do your job.

141
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,627
( phone beeps off )

142
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,793
Although we were able
to limit the casualties,

143
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,793
the attack at the mall indicates

144
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,361
that these terrorists intend
to make good on their threat

145
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,894
to release the nerve gas
on U.S. soil.

146
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,894
Unless we catch a break,

147
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,727
we can expect to suffer
multiple attacks,

148
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:32,327
resulting in mass casualties.

149
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,361
I assumed you'd want me
to start without you.

150
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,027
Just tell me where we are.

151
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:43,060
LAPD is setting up a perimeter

152
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:44,660
around the terrorists'
last known location.

153
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:47,027
We've activated all
search protocols,

154
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:48,860
including satellite
and Caltrans surveillance.

155
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,793
But we don't have
any real leads, do we?

156
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,227
( scoffs ):
If Jack Bauer
would have followed

157
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:57,261
orders and maintained
his cover, we could have
intercepted these people.

158
00:06:57,327 --> 00:06:59,060
We don't know that
for sure, Lynn.

159
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,261
What we do know is,
Jack's field decision

160
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:02,760
saved over 800 innocent people.

161
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:05,327
It may well cost us 100
times that many people.

162
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,660
In the meantime,
we've contained both

163
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,060
the physical threat and
the media's awareness,

164
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,693
which would have triggered
massive civil unrest.

165
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,227
Well, you tell yourself that
if you want to,

166
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,593
Ms. Raines, but the
fact remains that
these terrorists

167
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,593
are at large with 19 canisters
of Sentox nerve gas,

168
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,727
and we don't know

169
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:18,194
where or when
they're gonna hit us next.

170
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:20,027
We're all aware of
the threat, Lynn.

171
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,227
Then why does she keep
defending Bauer?

172
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,927
I want Bauer placed in custody.

173
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:26,927
I want him
brought in here.

174
00:07:26,994 --> 00:07:28,426
I want him held responsible

175
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:30,227
for what's happened.

176
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:32,060
Jack can be disciplined later.

177
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,727
Taking him out of the field
right now is a mistake.

178
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,094
Don't tell me how
to do my job.

179
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,027
He was authorized
by the President, Lynn.

180
00:07:37,094 --> 00:07:38,393
But he works for me,
and so do you.

181
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,393
I want him here now.

182
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,426
The rest of you,

183
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,760
maintain your search protocols.

184
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:45,227
Send your progress reports
to my screen in ten minutes.

185
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,827
It's all right.

186
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,627
We're all under a lot
of pressure.

187
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:53,526
Let's get back to it.

188
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,393
( phone ringing )

189
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,727
Manning.

190
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,693
This is Buchanan. We have orders
to bring Jack in.

191
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,027
We weren't able to find anything

192
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,227
that confirmed
this guy's identity.

193
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:08,693
I want you to take his picture,
lift his prints,

194
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,094
get him over to CTU
as soon as possible.

195
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,327
We've got nothing on this guy.

196
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:13,261
We're gonna have to run him
through NCIC

197
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,526
and Interpol databases.

198
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:16,560
I just got off the
phone with Bill.

199
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:18,560
Lynn McGill wants me to
bring you back to CTU.

200
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,194
He's on some
kind of warpath.

201
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:21,493
Why? Because I didn't think

202
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,460
letting terrorists release
Sentox nerve gas

203
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:25,860
in a crowded mall
was an acceptable loss?

204
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:27,194
And because we lost
our only real lead,

205
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:29,194
and Lynn's looking
for someone to blame.

206
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,294
I was appointed by the President
of the United States.

207
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:32,793
It was a field call.
I know.

208
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,094
And between you and me,

209
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,194
I think you made the right
call back at the mall.

210
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:39,960
I'm calling the President.

211
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:42,526
Look, Jack, the
trail's gone cold.

212
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:43,760
There's no point
in fighting it.

213
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,793
Let's just go back to
CTU and square it.

214
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,927
Fine.

215
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:51,593
Look, I'm sorry,

216
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,060
but I also have
to take your gun.

217
00:08:56,793 --> 00:09:00,060
Jack, don't make this
any more difficult
than it already is.

218
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,827
Fine.

219
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:10,593
We can't afford to
decommission Jack,
especially now.

220
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,860
I agree.

221
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,194
What can we
do about it?

222
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,361
Nothing...
while Lynn's in charge.

223
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:18,660
He may be in charge, Bill,
but he is not in control.

224
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,627
Ms. Raines, you have
a call on line one.

225
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,027
Thank you.

226
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,894
I'll be filtering intel
at Station Three.

227
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:28,460
Audrey Raines.

228
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,160
NATHANSON:
Ms. Raines, if you try
to trace this call

229
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:33,393
or put anyone else on the line,
I will hang up.

230
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,693
Who is this?

231
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,261
My name is James Nathanson.

232
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,261
I'm sure Walt Cummings has
already told you all about me.

233
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:43,160
You're the one who
sold the nerve gas
to the terrorists.

234
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:45,361
That's close enough
to the truth.

235
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:46,927
What do you want?

236
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:49,094
Transfer me to Jack Bauer
on a clean line.

237
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,560
Why Jack?

238
00:09:50,627 --> 00:09:52,393
That's not your concern.

239
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,760
You're getting to
Jack through me.

240
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,693
That makes it
my concern.

241
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,261
I'm going through you

242
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:01,361
because I know you have a
special relationship with Bauer.

243
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,526
I know all about you,
Ms. Raines.

244
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,693
Which is why I'm counting on you
to recognize

245
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,793
an opportunity
when it presents itself.

246
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,593
What opportunity?

247
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,927
I can help you find
this nerve gas.

248
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:14,827
How do I know you're
telling the truth?

249
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,127
You don't.

250
00:10:16,194 --> 00:10:17,693
Now put me through to Bauer.

251
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,960
( phone ringing )

252
00:10:29,027 --> 00:10:30,294
This is Bauer.

253
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,960
Jack, I know you're with Curtis,
so I'm assuming

254
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:33,593
that you can't speak freely.

255
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,361
It's Audrey.

256
00:10:36,426 --> 00:10:37,593
It's personal.

257
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,927
Go ahead.

258
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:40,426
Thanks.

259
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,660
I'm on the phone with
a man who claims to
be James Nathanson.

260
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,294
He was Walt
Cummings' contact.

261
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:48,261
He says he has information
about the terrorists,

262
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:49,460
but he will
only talk to you.

263
00:10:49,526 --> 00:10:50,627
Why me?

264
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:51,960
NATHANSON:
You can hang up now, Ms. Raines.

265
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,160
My phone has a node monitor.

266
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:56,426
I'll know if anyone else comes
on this line.

267
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:58,827
Jack?
That's all right, Audrey.
Hang up the phone.

268
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:00,393
All right.

269
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,127
What do you want with me?
Protection.

270
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,627
The terrorists you're after are
trying to kill me.

271
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:06,994
If the terrorists figured out
that you were the one who rigged

272
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,860
the canisters of Sentox
to blow up in their faces,

273
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,060
what do you need me for?

274
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,426
Just turn yourself in
to the authorities.

275
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,094
They'll protect you.
Walt Cummings isn't

276
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,627
the only one
behind this operation

277
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,127
who works inside the government.

278
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:17,327
I need your help.

279
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,127
You conspired to have me
take the fall

280
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:21,060
for President Palmer's
assassination.

281
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:22,327
What makes you think I'm not

282
00:11:22,393 --> 00:11:23,593
going to kill you myself?

283
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,727
Because you want
to stop the Sentox gas

284
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:27,294
from being released
on American soil.

285
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:28,294
So do I.

286
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:31,060
Where are you?

287
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:33,094
There's a phone booth
on the south side of Moorpark,

288
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,426
just east of Densmore.

289
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,194
Be there in ten minutes,
or I'll be gone.

290
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,460
Moorpark and Densmore.
Got it.

291
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:40,493
Jack?

292
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,760
Audrey, I'll explain everything

293
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,127
as soon as I get back to CTU.

294
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,593
Thanks.

295
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,361
It's going
to be strange for her.

296
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,760
Audrey. Just yesterday,
she thought you were dead.

297
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,327
Yeah.

298
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,294
I know it's none of my business,

299
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:16,327
but she's a good person, Jack.

300
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,760
I hope you two
get half a chance.

301
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:21,426
Thanks.

302
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,294
( grunting ):
Jack!

303
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,627
Don't fight, Curtis.

304
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:37,227
Don't fight it.

305
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,430
Lynn McGill.

306
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,670
It's Curtis. Jack escaped.

307
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,720
What?

308
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
He got a call from someone.The next thing I know,

309
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,760
he blindsided me,took my car.

310
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,180
Who called him?

311
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,490
He said it was Audrey, but he may have been lying.

312
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,670
Lynn?

313
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,430
We can try to track him using your vehicle's onboard transceiver.

314
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,600
I just tried bringing it up on my PDA.

315
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,910
He's either disabled or shut down the transceiver.

316
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,990
Curtis,how could you let this happen?

317
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,120
I'll get dispatch on it.

318
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,760
One of my team's en route to pick me up.

319
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,230
We'll find him.

320
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,520
You don't even know where to look.

321
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,580
Get back to CTU. We'll deploy from here.

322
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,120
Damn it.

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,250
Chloe,run a triangulation on Jack Bauer's cell phone.

324
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,350
- Find out where he is.- Yes,sir.

325
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,230
Have you talked to Jack since he's been in custody?

326
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,570
No.

327
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,120
Well,he's not in custody anymore.

328
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,320
He assaulted Curtis and stole his car.

329
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,770
Why would he do that?

330
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,570
Maybe you can tell me.

331
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,060
I don't know where Jack is, if that's what you're asking me.

332
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,900
You have no idea what he's doing?

333
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,430
No,but I'm sure there's an explanation.

334
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,110
Mr. McGill,we're not getting a signal from Jack's cell.

335
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,120
The sim card must be out of his phone.

336
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,790
Well,if you think of anything you'll let me know,right?

337
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,010
Of course.

338
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,660
Thanks.

339
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,990
O'Brian.

340
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,230
Chloe,what I'm about to tell you needs to stay between us.

341
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,560
It involves Jack.

342
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,350
What is going on? It just came on my screen that Jack's gone missing.

343
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,240
He's following a lead on the Sentox gas.

344
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,310
He needed to go alone.

345
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,940
I just transferred a call from my station to him.

346
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
I need you to delete the record.

347
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,570
If Lynn finds out we're working behind his back...

348
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,580
Chloe,I know. Believe me,I know.

349
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,930
But this is the only way.

350
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,710
There isn't a lot of time.

351
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,410
When did you make the call?

352
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,390
Communications archive.

353
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,550
This is Lynn McGill.

354
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,080
Bring up the phone logs at the station Audrey Raines is using

355
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,330
Yes,sir.

356
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,350
I found the transfer.I can't dump just the one call.

357
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,770
They're all cross-indexed.

358
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,940
Can't you unlink it?

359
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,330
No. It would take like two hours.

360
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,050
Okay,Mr. McGill,

361
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,100
the call logs should be on your screen.

362
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,140
Scroll through to station five.

363
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,930
That's the one we dedicated to the DOD.

364
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,020
The only way to get rid of the entry

365
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,620
is to dump the entire log... all the calls you've made and received today.

366
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,230
Do it.

367
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,210
It's done.

368
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,790
Thank you,Chloe.

369
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,870
...a day that will long be remembered as a step forward for both the United States and Russia.

370
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,820
President Logan and President Suvarov

371
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,640
are expected shortly to deliver their closing remarks.

372
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,840
Following this, the Russian head of...

373
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,800
What is it now,Mike?

374
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,820
I'm sorry,sir,but there's a call you need to take.It just came in on this.

375
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,970
And what is that?

376
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,690
Walt Cummings' phone,sir.

377
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,640
It's been in Secret Service custody.

378
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,230
They just brought it to me.

379
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,340
The caller's claiming he has the Sentox gas.

380
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,300
Is someone tracing the call?

381
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,310
They can't.

382
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,740
It's being sent through multiple relays.

383
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,070
I'm not talking to a terrorist.

384
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,050
You talk to them. You find out what he wants.

385
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,780
Mr. President,he's demanding to speak with you.

386
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:23,890
All right.

387
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,210
But put him on speaker.

388
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,650
This is President Logan.

389
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,810
Is this Erwich?

390
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,930
Ivan Erwich is no longer with us,Mr. President.

391
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,940
His attack on your shopping mall was unsanctioned and unwarranted.

392
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,210
It didn't serve our interests.

393
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,170
What is it you want?

394
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:54,920
What I want is to release the Sentox nerve gas on Moscow.

395
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,870
Since that is now impossible,

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,140
I'm forced to strike at Russia on foreign soil...

397
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,780
with your help.

398
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,310
My help?

399
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,060
I want the route of Suvarov's motorcade.

400
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,170
His entire route to the airport,

401
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,970
along with a full profile of his security detail.

402
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,120
I...I don't personally have that information.

403
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,500
Then get it.

404
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,410
Make no mistake,Mr. President,

405
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,690
it's our Russian oppressors

406
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,550
I mean to hurt,not your people.

407
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,880
However,if you refuse to cooperate,

408
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,090
I will have no choice but to release all of the Sentox gas in areas

409
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,240
far more populated than your shopping mall.

410
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,710
You just said that killing Americans didn't serve your interests.This...

411
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,920
this would be senseless murder.

412
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,400
Yes,it would.

413
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,970
So give me Suvarov's route.

414
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,060
I'll need some time.

415
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,750
You have 15 minutes.

416
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,260
I'm... I'm not sure...

417
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,660
He wants to assassinate Suvarov.

418
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,420
We can't let that happen.

419
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,790
If the Russian president is killed on U.S. soil,

420
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,630
it wouldn't just nullify the treaty...

421
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,170
it would destroy our relationship with Moscow.

422
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,320
Get me Suvarov's route from Secret Service.

423
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,200
Mr. President...

424
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,340
No,I haven't made any decision yet,Mike,

425
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,860
but whatever I decide,I'd better have the route in hand

426
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,220
when he calls back,don't you think?

427
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,610
Yes,sir.

428
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,060
Somebody's screwing with me,Bill.

429
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,850
I won't tolerate it.

430
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,520
Screwing with you how?

431
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,870
Audrey Raines' phone log has been erased.

432
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
What?

433
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,270
Take a look.

434
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,770
Probably a system glitch.

435
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,850
It wasn't a glitch. She did it on purpose.

436
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,220
Audrey? You think Audrey did this?

437
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,080
I know she did. That's ridiculous.

438
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,330
She's one of the most by-the-book people I know.

439
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,720
when you're trying to hide something.

440
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,440
Did you know that she was on the phone with Jack right beforehe attacked Curtis?

441
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,120
No,I didn't know that. What... what does that prove?

442
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,590
There's something going on with these two.

443
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,670
What's their history?

444
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,080
You know their history,Lynn.They worked together at DOD.

445
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,120
There's more than that,right?

446
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,140
It got personal later on,Lynn.- NPersonal?

447
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,480
And you didn't think it was important to tell me that?

448
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,500
No,I didn't.

449
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,810
What difference does that make?

450
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,740
When did she find out Jack was still alive?

451
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,500
This morning,with the rest of us.

452
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,590
You sure about that?

453
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,360
I was there,Lynn. I saw her reaction.

454
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,880
Could have been an act.

455
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,240
You're starting to sound paranoid.

456
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,510
I don't care how I sound.

457
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,440
From this point on, I want all our people on a tight leash.

458
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,990
If someone has a hidden agenda, I want to know about it.

459
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,810
CTU's become way too porous, and that's your fault,Bill.

460
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,140
I don't need to hear this from you.

461
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,760
You don't want to hear this from me?

462
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,620
Then tell me why Audrey erased her phone logs.

463
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,620
I'm here. Where are you?

464
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,400
In a minute. First,I want to make sure that you weren't followed.

465
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,340
Otherwise,there's no deal.

466
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,030
Take the alley between the two buildings across the street from you.

467
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,640
I left the gate open.

468
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,880
Listen to me.

469
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,700
I don't know what you think I can do for you,

470
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,370
but you committed treason.

471
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,400
I don't see it that way.

472
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,130
I love this country.

473
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,940
You're never going to be able to justify killing David Palmer.

474
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,580
That was an unfortunate necessity.

475
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,840
We admired Palmer,but we had other priorities.

476
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,100
This country needs a reason to secure its oil interests in Asia

477
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,610
a reason that Russia and the rest of the world can get behind.

478
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,460
I've heard your reasoning from Walt Cummings.

479
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,770
It's still treason.

480
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,210
No. It's realpolitik.

481
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,040
Do you see the open door ahead?

482
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,130
Yeah.

483
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,620
Enter it,make two right turns,

484
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,960
and walk back the direction you came from.

485
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,740
Hold on.

486
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,750
You have hostiles coming in after you. They are not CTU.

487
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,030
Do you have a weapon?

488
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,520
Yes.Where are you?

489
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,380
Second floor.

490
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,440
Try and make your way to the roof.I'll meet you there.

491
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,020
Stay on the line. All right.

492
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,510
All right. I understand.

493
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,610
Audrey.

494
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,350
DOD wants a fuller explanation about what happened at the mall.

495
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,720
I told them we're still trying to find a thread on the nerve gas.

496
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,880
I just spent the last five minutes getting grilled by Lynn.

497
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,430
About what?

498
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,350
You and Jack.

499
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,230
Your relationship.

500
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,710
What'd you tell him?

501
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,350
The truth.

502
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,100
That you and he were once romantically involved and now I'm not sure.

503
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,810
I don't see how that's any of his business.

504
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,980
He thinks it is.

505
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,200
He thinks you had something to do with Jack breaking from custody.

506
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,160
Did you?

507
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,720
Not exactly.

508
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,990
What the hell does that mean?

509
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,150
A man claiming to be James Nathanson called here about 20 minutes ago.

510
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,370
He said that he had information on terrorists.

511
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,990
That he would only give it to Jack.

512
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,840
Why didn't you tell me about this?

513
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,370
I was afraid of losing this lead. I didn't know what to do,Bill.

514
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,630
So Jack's meeting this man Nathanson alone,without backup.

515
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,790
- Where is he? - I don't know.

516
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,560
Nathanson dropped me from the call.

517
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,560
Who else knows about this? Just Chloe.

518
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,710
- She helped me cover the call from Lynn. - Audrey.

519
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,810
If you could just,uh,sign right here.

520
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,250
District elevated the threat level.

521
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm briefing first responders on the high probability of multiple attacks,

522
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,580
so I need to review DOD protocols.

523
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,000
All right,I'll send them to your screen.

524
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,200
We can do it here.

525
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,600
Unless you have a problem working with me on this.

526
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,820
No. No,no,it's fine.

527
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,690
Excuse me.

528
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:25,960
Bauer?

529
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,150
Yeah,where are you?

530
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,670
I'm in the freight elevator.

531
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,950
You need to get out of there now. You're cornered.

532
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,710
Bauer,where are you?

533
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,700
I'm almost there. Just keep moving.

534
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,240
Nathanson,stay down!

535
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,070
Stay down!

536
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,210
Nathanson!

537
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,890
Look at me. Look at me.

538
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,120
How do I find the canisters of Sentox?

539
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,560
How do I find the canisters?

540
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,210
In my pocket.

541
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,320
What's on the chip?

542
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,230
Please.What's on the chip?!

543
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,010
Nathanson's dead,but there was someone else there.

544
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,130
Who?

545
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,180
I don't know yet.

546
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,860
But he took out three of my men and disabled the helicopter.

547
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,150
Nathanson may have given him information that compromises us.

548
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,080
Keep looking until you find him.

549
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,390
Some critics have already said that by signing this treaty,

550
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,360
we as the United States are taking on our ally's enemies

551
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,450
as well as having to deal with our own.

552
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,120
Diagram Seven lays out the hierarchy for first responders.

553
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,230
Civil Defense protocols for each agency are pretty well defined.

554
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,820
Shouldn't you get that?

555
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,920
Audrey Raines.

556
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,560
It's me.Nathanson's just been killed, but he gave me intel.

557
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,400
I need you to uplink the data.

558
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,080
Sorry,Steve,you have the wrong extension.

559
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,740
I'll transfer you to I.T.

560
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,800
Overlapping responsibilities default to federal,then to state.

561
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,750
O'Brian.

562
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,760
Chloe,it's Jack. Audrey just rolled my call over to you.

563
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,350
What the hell's going on over there?

564
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,950
It's Lynn. He's been shadowing her.

565
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,740
He thinks that she's been talking to you behind his back,

566
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,530
which I guess she has.

567
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,460
Chloe,listen to me.

568
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,100
I have a thumb drive that's gonna help us find the Sentox.

569
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,000
I need you to data mine the files.

570
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,630
Upload the drive to my socket.

571
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,800
Access code 5J55J.

572
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,060
Hold on.

573
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,890
You should be getting it now.

574
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,680
Chloe,I need you to keep this under the radar.

575
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,360
You mean keep it from Lynn.

576
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,510
At least until we know what we've got.

577
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,780
My number come up on your screen?

578
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,560
Yeah.

579
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,120
Okay,I had to switch out phones. If you need to get ahold of me,

580
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,580
call me back on that number.

581
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,860
Okay,I will.

582
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,330
Suvarov's motorcade, with his security detail.

583
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,520
Sir...

584
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,760
If President Suvarov is killed,

585
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,940
and the Russians find out we supplied his killers with this information,

586
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,310
it would be considered an act of war.

587
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,760
The Russian motorcade has a significant security force.

588
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,640
I see no reason to believe that the terrorists would even be successful.

589
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,440
Maybe we should have an analysis done,

590
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,220
determine,uh,uh, the vulnerable points along the route.

591
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,280
Sir,we can't do that without giving away the fact

592
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,520
that we had advance knowledge of an attack.

593
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,640
What attack?

594
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,230
It's-It's nothing that you need to be concerned about.

595
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,790
Charles,you invited me into this circle.

596
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,220
What attack?

597
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,550
The terrorists want the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

598
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,000
They've threatened to deploy more Sentox gas if I don't give it to them.

599
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,880
You're not...

600
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,740
seriously considering it,are you?

601
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,820
Martha... Charles believes

602
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,350
an assault on the Suvarovs has a good chance...

603
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:20,410
Mike,will you please let the president speak for himself?

604
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,370
May we have a moment?

605
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,460
Charles. Martha,please.

606
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,480
If I don't give them the information they want,

607
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,690
tens of thousands of Americans will die on our own soil...

608
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,120
maybe hundreds of thousands... and I will be responsible.

609
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,090
All right,all right,all right, Charles,Charles,

610
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,410
there has got to be another way.

611
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,820
You change their itinerary, delay Suvarov from leaving.

612
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,110
It's all over the news that the Russians are leaving after we make the joint statement.

613
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,930
If there's any deviation from that,the terrorists will know that I've alerted them.

614
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,120
Charles,what are, what are you telling me?

615
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,220
What are you saying?

616
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,840
That we are going to stand in front of the entire world

617
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,850
with the Suvarovs,you're going to look him in the eye,

618
00:32:15,210 --> 02:44:27,300
shake his hand,knowing you're sending them to their deaths?

619
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,650
If we were in Russia and Suvarov got this ultimatum,do you think that he would spare us?

620
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,810
I am not talking about Russia.

621
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,440
I am not talking about Suvarov.

622
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,930
I am talking about you.

623
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,190
You are the president of the United States of America.

624
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,190
My God! Charles!

625
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,570
You're talking about murder!

626
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,030
Martha,my back is up against the wall.

627
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,480
You... Give me another solution.

628
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,330
You stand up to them.

629
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,030
Refuse to negotiate with them.

630
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,310
Isn't that the policy of this country?

631
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,880
Isn't that the point of the treaty you've just signed?

632
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,840
It's not that simple,Martha.

633
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,300
It never is.

634
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,570
Oh,damn it.

635
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,100
Buchanan.

636
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,310
This is Chloe.

637
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,550
What is it,Chloe?

638
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,280
Jack just sent me the data he got off Nathanson.

639
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,740
My decryption filters weren't working

640
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,220
and I just realized why.

641
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,080
The drive's DOD formatted.

642
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,760
DOD?

643
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,260
Yeah. I don't know how Nathanson got his hands on a highly classified government t-drive.

644
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,040
Audrey's the only one with clearance.

645
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,300
Lynn's got her tied up.

646
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,740
Exactly.

647
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,450
How much time do you need?

648
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,620
To decrypt all the vectors?

649
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Two,three minutes.

650
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,820
Hang on.

651
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,770
Lynn,do you have a minute?

652
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,900
What is it?

653
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,990
You were inquiring about a security breach with the phone logs.

654
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,640
LYNN: That's right.

655
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,420
...The archive room? Are you sure?

656
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,370
BUCHANAN: We can key in the user I.D.

657
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,660
from your office and find who we're looking for.

658
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,930
We just have to use your key card.

659
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,190
LYNN: Why are you so interested in this?

660
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,600
I'm serious about all breaches of security.

661
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,460
What was that?

662
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:18,670
What?

663
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,220
That last window you closed... what was it?

664
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,280
It was just the DOD protocols.

665
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,960
What is going on here?

666
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,750
Lynn,will you please just calm down?

667
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,050
LYNN: Don't tell me to calm down!

668
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,330
The two of you are up to something

669
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,640
and I'm not gonna stand for it.

670
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,500
I think you're protecting Audrey and she's protecting Bauer.

671
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,700
Look,I can explain,Lynn.

672
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,640
So can I.

673
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,650
This was a deliberate attempt to circumvent my authority.

674
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,110
Lynn,we are all on the same side.

675
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,530
If your father wasn't the secretary of defense,

676
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,860
I'd have you thrown out of here.

677
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,300
I don't have that problem with you.

678
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,450
Can I have Security to Station Five,please,right away.

679
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,010
What are you doing,Lynn?

680
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,650
Place Mr. Buchanan in custody and take him to holding.

681
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,420
You are making a mistake - NAudrey.

682
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,620
I want everyone's attention.

683
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,940
I'm putting a section two-three redundancy into effect as of this moment.

684
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,940
All of your stations will be mirrored and monitored through my office.

685
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,690
Now get back to work.

686
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,060
We need Bill to get through this crisis.

687
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,810
You are jeopardizing our chances of finding that nerve gas.

688
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,050
I will make sure that DOD and the Secretary of Defense are aware of that.

689
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,520
Don't threaten me,Ms. Raines.

690
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,020
I promise you,you do not want to threaten me.

691
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,950
What do you got?

692
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,530
The decryption element kicked out a company called Terra-Dyne.

693
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,800
Over the past three years, they've acquired more than 100 pounds of raw strontium isotope,

694
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,040
used to create Sentox nerve gas.

695
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,320
Where do I find Terra-Dyne?

696
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,240
La Ca~ada.

697
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:02,620
It's a subsidiary of a larger corporation called Omicron International.

698
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,300
Hold on,did you say Omicron?

699
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,470
Yeah. Are you sure?

700
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:06,310
What's wrong?

701
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,390
Pull up their senior executive roster.

702
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,440
See if a man named Christopher Henderson's on the list.

703
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,280
Why?

704
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:12,370
Just do it,please.

705
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,110
Okay,here it is.

706
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,270
Christopher Henderson, Senior Vice President of Research and Development.

707
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,340
Do you know him?

708
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,950
Yeah,I did once.

709
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,940
Listen,send me the decrypted files over to my PDA.

710
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,510
It's gonna be a little bit hard to do right now,Jack.

711
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,630
Lynn is watching everyone like a hawk.

712
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,280
Well,can Buchanan help you?- He could if he weren't in holding.

713
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,410
What are you talking about?

714
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,660
Lynn detained him for insubordination.

715
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,790
How could he do that?

716
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,080
Because he's losing it.

717
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,850
I think the President's putting too much pressure on him to get those canisters.

718
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,330
He can't handle it.

719
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,490
Chloe,I still need the decrypted files.

720
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,140
You're gonna have to find a way to get them to me.

721
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,630
I'll try.

722
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,450
They haven't called yet?

723
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,620
Not yet,sir.

724
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,460
President Suvarov's waiting.

725
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,180
We'll be out in a minute.

726
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,060
Martha...

727
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,130
please?

728
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,460
This is a difficult decision for me...

729
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,610
both politically and personally.

730
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,490
And maybe I won't have to make it.

731
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:27,840
Maybe CTU will find the canisters before the Suvarovs have to leave.

732
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,030
That's what I'm praying for.

733
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,840
But whatever happens, I need you to understand.

734
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,300
I do.

735
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,890
I understand,Charles,I do.

736
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,780
Mr. President.

737
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,100
SUVAROV: It has been a challenging day

738
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,230
so I especially appreciate how professional you have all been.

739
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,220
Your president is fortunate to have such talented people working for him.

740
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,990
Thank you.

741
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,370
Yuri.

742
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,890
Anya.

743
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,290
Mr. President,I'm glad we have this opportunity

744
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,410
to thank you and Mrs. Logan personally for your hospitality.

745
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,850
( cell phone rings ) LOGAN: Mr. President it's been our pleasure.

746
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,130
SUVAROV: Anya and I hope that you will visit us soon... Yeah

747
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,630
Hold on.

748
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,890
We would love that.

749
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,140
Wouldn't we,Martha?

750
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,460
Yes.

751
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,980
It would be lovely.

752
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,540
Martha... thank you again for being so kind.

753
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,120
SUVAROV: I read the text of your statement.

754
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,320
It was excellent.

755
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,700
And congratulations again on your brilliant handling of the crisis at the airport.

756
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:49,510
Thank you,Yuri.

757
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,460
And-And thank you for your steadfast support.

758
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,120
Have there been further developments?

759
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,410
No,no,not at all.

760
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,910
There's always pressure,huh?

761
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,200
But everything's under control. - yes

762
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,000
Ladies,the photographers are waiting.

763
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,490
Thank you,Mr. President.

764
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,990
The motorcade will take service roads to the 118,

765
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,940
then to the 5 Freeway...

766
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,160
Charles...

767
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,440
Martha,please,just... just smile and wave.

768
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,150
The motorcade will take Suvarov through this downtown corridor.

769
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,200
That will give us our best shot at destroying all the vehicles.

770
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,470
Tell our people this is where I want them to strike.

771
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,310
All right,that's it,folks. We need to move.

772
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,360
Charles,you can't let them get in that car.

773
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,900
It's not too late.

774
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,280
Mr. President,Lynn McGill is calling from CTU.

775
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,080
What about?

776
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,340
He didn't say. He just asked to speak with you directly.

777
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,190
Excuse me.

778
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,110
Mr. President,I'm afraid I have to say my good-byes here.

779
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,570
Affairs of state,you know, the pressure's continuous.

780
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,620
Yes,I understand,of course.

781
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,440
Thank you,President Logan, for everything.

782
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,210
Thank you.

783
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,930
Anya.

784
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,660
Charles.

785
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:13,960
Mrs. Logan.

786
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,180
Aaron,I've decided to drive to the airport with the Suvarovs.

787
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,180
You could have a car follow us.

788
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,870
We're not detailed for that.

789
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,580
I'll ride up front.

790
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,460
No,Aaron,no,that's not necessary.

791
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,180
Yes,it is.

792
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,890
Would you...

793
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,840
tell my husband where I am?

794
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,030
I hope you don't mind if I accompany you.

795
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,480
You sure your husband won't mind?

796
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,940
No,of course not.

797
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,780
This way,we'll have more time to talk.

798
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,080
Ma'am,the President is being briefed by CTU right now.

799
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,550
But I left word for you.

800
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:09,810
Thank you.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
