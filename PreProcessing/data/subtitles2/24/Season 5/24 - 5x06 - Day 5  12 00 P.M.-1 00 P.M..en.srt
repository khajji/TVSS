1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,099
Any problems getting
the canisters out?

2
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,799
No. They were hidden exactly
where you said they'd be.

3
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:20,300
Russians will finally
understand the consequences

4
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:23,099
of occupying our homeland when
we turn Moscow into a graveyard.

5
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:25,266
Erwich has just cleared
airport security.

6
00:00:25,332 --> 00:00:27,099
Then the authorities don't know
anything's been stolen.

7
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,499
Not yet.
Then the only thing we have
left to take care of is Bauer.

8
00:00:30,566 --> 00:00:31,833
You paged me?

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,266
I need you to do something.

10
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,300
We have our hands full
searching for the nerve gas.

11
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:36,933
Bauer is a priority.

12
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:38,833
I just signed a treaty.

13
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:39,866
Now all of a sudden

14
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,166
I find out
that the terrorists

15
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,666
are still out there...
with nerve gas.

16
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:45,999
MARTHA:
You people have to listen to me.

17
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,399
I had a document.

18
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,933
<i>It was hidden in my blouse.</i>

19
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:51,966
<i>It's gone.
Someone stole it from me.</i>

20
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,766
This is what she was like
before you sent her to Vermont.

21
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:56,532
Are you suggesting
that I readmit her?

22
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,033
For her sake, if nothing else.

23
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:01,833
Aaron, my wife is gone.

24
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,166
We have
a priority alert.

25
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,099
You've been burrowing
into classified

26
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,866
CTU protocols
without authorization.

27
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,866
<i>SPENSER:
I don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

28
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,599
Stop. I know you logged on

29
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:14,166
<i>to the security subsystem
where you had no right to be.</i>

30
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,833
<i>AUDREY:
Someone knew
that Jack was alive.</i>

31
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,465
<i>It's critical
to our investigation</i>

32
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:19,166
<i>that we find out who that was.</i>

33
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:23,599
<i>( grunting )</i>

34
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,532
Did you let that man into CTU?

35
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,365
This man
is a professional assassin.

36
00:01:27,432 --> 00:01:29,365
He just killed Dr. Paulson,
he tried to kill me.

37
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:31,833
Who told you to let
that man into CTU?

38
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,300
The White House.

39
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:35,499
Mr. Cummings.

40
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:43,833
JACK:
I don't understand
the problem.

41
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,632
David Palmer was murdered
because he was about

42
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:47,365
to expose Walt Cummings'
connection to the terrorists.

43
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:49,732
When Cummings failed to frame
me for Palmer's murder,

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,200
he tried to kill me.

45
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:53,166
All that may be true, Jack,
but we don't have proof.

46
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:54,532
We can prove that Cummings

47
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,233
used Spenser to get
Jack's assassin into CTU.

48
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,532
All we have
is Spenser's word.

49
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,033
That's not enough
to build a case.

50
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,899
You don't
have time to build a case.

51
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,099
You want the nerve gas,

52
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,399
Cummings
is your connection.

53
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,465
Cummings is the President's
Chief Advisor.

54
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:07,166
How exactly do you
suggest we get to him?

55
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,532
I can secretly meet
with Mike Novick,

56
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,732
enlist his help.
How do we know

57
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,266
Novick's not in this
with Cummings?

58
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:14,233
Because I know him.
He'll listen to me.

59
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,033
And the President
will listen to him.

60
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,133
With Novick's help,
we can isolate Cummings.

61
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,666
Jack, as much
as I appreciate

62
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:20,999
you wanting
to be involved,

63
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,266
you don't work here
anymore.

64
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:24,399
That's exactly the reason
why I should do this.

65
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:26,799
If it backfires, there'll
be no fallout on you.

66
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,200
I think it's worth a try.

67
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,899
I agree.

68
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:34,133
It's your call.

69
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,300
<i>( sighs )</i>

70
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,200
All right, Jack.

71
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,799
But just so we're clear,

72
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:49,732
this is about
finding the nerve gas,

73
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,632
not getting revenge
for David Palmer.

74
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,799
Understood.

75
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:55,632
Work out your protocols
with Ms. Raines.

76
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:56,866
We'll keep
looking through

77
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,632
Cummings' background
for anything

78
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,133
that supports our case.

79
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,566
We're gonna need to set up

80
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:03,632
a secure channel for you

81
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,666
to contact us on.
We'll drop you

82
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:07,465
as close to Logan's
retreat as possible.

83
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:11,966
Can you bring up
the satellite photo
of the compound?

84
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,766
Jack, I'm sorry if
I'm being a little distant.

85
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,332
I just...

86
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,033
It's taking me a little while
to get used to you being alive.

87
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:25,999
I understand.

88
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,300
I'll call Novick.

89
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,200
Jack.

90
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:40,266
When Cummings finds out
that you're still alive,

91
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,799
he's gonna come after you again.

92
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,066
Yeah.

93
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:56,233
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

94
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,399
Yes?

95
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:58,599
NATHANSON:
Is Bauer dead?

96
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,966
I haven't received
confirmation yet.

97
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:03,133
Your man should have
taken care of this by now.

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,432
Perhaps he had to alter
his strike window.

99
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:08,033
Has the nerve gas
reached the port?

100
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,200
Not yet.

101
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:11,532
But they should
be arriving any minute.

102
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,200
Good. I have to go.

103
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,365
I'm late for a briefing.

104
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,566
You have all the shipping
documents in order?

105
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,999
The canisters
will arrive at port

106
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,566
in your country in eight days.

107
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:31,699
Ground transportation to your
base camp will take another day.

108
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:34,632
Will you need my help
getting them to your target?

109
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,300
No. I've arranged
transport to Moscow.

110

<i>( indistinct talking )</i>

111
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,033
Have they found my wife yet?

112
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:55,432
No, sir,
but Secret Service is confident

113
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,933
she's still
on the grounds.

114
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:59,033
If they're so damn confident,
why can't anyone find her?

115
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,399
What the hell
are they doing?

116
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:02,599
I'm sure it's just a matter
of time, Mr. President.

117
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,599
Sorry I'm late.

118
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,099
I was just
setting up the video.

119
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,432
This was made
by terrorists,

120
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:12,499
to document the effects
of exposure to nerve gas.

121
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:15,332
It was recovered
from a training camp
two years ago.

122
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,799
Disorientation occurs

123
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,999
moments
after exposure.

124
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:23,966
Now the video jumps forward,

125
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,099
no more than a couple
of minutes, we estimate.

126
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,933
Within that time,

127
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,166
there's permanent damage

128
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:31,266
to the central
nervous system.

129
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,566
Violent seizures
take over.

130
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,632
Bronchial membranes
blister and peel away.

131
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,266
Death occurs within...

132
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:39,532
Stop.

133
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,399
Now, according
to DOD,

134
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:46,899
the Sentox-Six nerve gas
stolen from the airport

135
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,599
is far more lethal than the gas

136
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,833
we just saw used.

137
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,166
<i>( beeping )</i>

138

If released in a town
or city, for example,

139
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:56,699
the cloud will remain lethal
for much longer.

140
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:59,166
Are we any closer

141
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,365
to finding the canisters?

142
00:06:00,432 --> 00:06:02,866
There haven't been any reports

of progress, sir.

144
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,632
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

145
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,233
I need to return a call
to the State Department.

Do you have
those updates, Walt?

147
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,866
Yes, here's one from CTU.

148
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:24,666
Also one from Homeland Security.

Yeah...
What's going on?

I have a lead on
the stolen nerve gas.

Isn't CTU
coordinating
the search?

159

This is something I need
to bring directly to you.

160

I don't understand.

00:06:58,732 --> 00:07:01,399
No one can know about this,
not even the President.

164
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:05,332
I'm not comfortable with
all this secrecy, Jack.

165
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,033
You need to give me some idea
what this is about.

166
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,933
It concerns Walt Cummings.

167
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:14,966
There's an area

168
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:17,632
a few hundred yards outside
the southwest gate.

169
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,133
It's at the far side
of the property

170
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,566
from the main house.

171
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,066
Thanks, Mike.
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

172
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,332
Jack...

173
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,532
Hey.

174
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,599
They said we can leave soon.

175
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:34,432
I know, I heard.

176
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:35,732
What about you?

177
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:37,266
Are you coming home
with us?

178
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,066
No, I need to stay here.

179
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,133
CTU still
needs my help.

180
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,599
Derek, I'd like to speak

181
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,099
with your mom for a moment,
is that all right?

182
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,233
Yeah, of course.

183
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,365
Take him downstairs.

184
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:49,933
She'll be there soon.

185
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,933
You're not coming back

186
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,899
to us at all, are you?

187
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:02,499
No.

188
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:09,166
I never thought I was going
to be back here at CTU.

189
00:08:09,233 --> 00:08:10,966
I would never have
gotten you involved

190
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,999
in all of this,
I promise you.

191
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:19,599
It's the woman who interviewed
me, isn't it? Audrey Raines.

192
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,432
You were involved with her.

193
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,532
I could tell by the way
you looked at each other.

194
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:32,465
I was with her before
I had to disappear.

195
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:35,432
Are you still
in love with her?

196
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,332
Yes.

197
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,532
Does she still love you?

198
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:47,866
I don't know.

199
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,099
Mr. Bauer.

200
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,200
Your transportation's
standing by.

201
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,066
I'll be right there.

202
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:59,399
I'm sorry, I have to go.

203
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,799
Thank you.

204
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:16,933
Yeah.

Bauer killed hours ago.

I'm not going

You heard the call, didn't you?

Bauer's coming here to expose

my role in all this.

220
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,499
You're assuming
he knows the extent of it.

221
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,933
Well, it's obvious
he knows enough.

Now, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

223

At this point, there's only
one thing you can do.

Mrs. Logan,

You've got to
listen to me.

They're just trying
to help you.

No. No.

They're trying to make it

00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:03,701
I had a breakdown,
so they can

235
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:05,135
cart me off to some

Audrey, did you check
with the airports?

249
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,267
Yes. They've all been alerted
on the missing canisters.

250
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,068
And CHP?
Same thing.

251
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:07,768
Trucks are being checked
at all major interstates.

252
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:10,068
Make sure there's no mention
of the Sentox nerve gas.

253
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:11,300
The White House is clear
about that.

There's no mention
of chemical weapons.

257
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,768
Good. The last thing we need
is for the public to find out

to be concerned.

00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:17,768
Is she all right?

326
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:18,734
She's fine, sir.

327
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,135
She was hiding
in the stables.

328
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:21,400
<i>( heavy sigh )</i>

329
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,135
Stables? What the hell

330
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:25,968
did she think
she was doing?

331
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,267
Mr. President...

332
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:32,534
I feel awkward
mentioning this, but...

333
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:34,400
Mrs. Logan said
some things...

334
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,300
About David Palmer.

335
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:36,534
Yes, sir.

336
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:39,601
I've heard her conspiracy
theories, Aaron.

337
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,101
I've heard them all.

338
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:50,367
But thank you
for your concern, Aaron.

339
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:59,334
They found my wife.

340
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,235
Good.

341
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:10,968
Mr. President...
we need to talk.

342
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:14,168
What is it, Walt?

343
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:17,135
I was hoping
to spare you from this,

344
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:19,701
but I'm afraid Jack Bauer
is forcing my hand.

345
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:23,868
He's on his way here to
meet with Mike Novick.

346
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:25,168
Bauer? Why?

347
00:18:25,235 --> 00:18:27,168
He's going to accuse me
of helping

348
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,834
the terrorists
acquire the nerve gas.

349
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,667
That's ridiculous.

350
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:34,334
No, sir.

351
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,300
It's the truth.

352
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,034
What did you say?

353
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:41,068
Through a proxy, I leaked

354
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,267
information to
the terrorists

355
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:43,934
about where the nerve
gas was hidden.

356
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,034
You have to understand, sir,
this gas was never going

357
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:47,534
to pose a threat
to American lives.

358
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:49,068
Never pose a threat?!

359
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:51,334
People died in the airport!

360
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,267
Hostages were killed!

361
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:54,901
We had hoped to limit
the collateral damage.

362
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,501
"Collateral damage"?!
What are you thinking?

363
00:18:57,567 --> 00:19:00,501
This is an unspeakable crime.

364
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:09,701
Walt... you have to answer
for this.

365
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:12,534
Mr. President...
it's in your best
interest to hear me out

366
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,868
before you make
that phone call.

367
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,135
<i>( slams receiver )</i>

368
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:19,434
What do you mean
"my best interest"?

369
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:21,801
Sentox gas is being smuggled
out of the country

370
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,300
by separatists who think
they are going to use it

371
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,834
against the Russians.

372
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:28,001
However, that nerve gas will
never reach Russian soil.

373
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:31,834
And you know this how?

374
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:34,634
We control the remote detonators
on those gas canisters.

375
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,634
As soon as they reach
the terrorists' base,

376
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,734
we'll trigger the
canisters by satellite

377
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:39,934
and release the gas.

378
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,667
So everything
that happened today

379
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:43,235
was just to kill
a some terrorists?

380
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,201
No, the goal is to
produce a smoking gun,

381
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,235
proof of the existence

382
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,400
of weapons of mass destruction
in Central Asia.

383
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:53,934
This is unbelievable.

384
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,501
It's necessary.

385
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,034
It will finally
give us a pretext

386
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:59,001
to increase our military
presence in the region,

387
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:03,101
guaranteeing the flow of oil
for the next generation.

388
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,235
How dare you.

389
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,801
How dare you act
without my consent.

390
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,201
How dare you put
this administration--

391
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,634
this entire country in jeopardy.

392
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,768
You're a traitor.

393
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:17,334
No, no, Mr. President,
I am a patriot!

394
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,467
Doing what needs
to be done

395
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:22,501
for the continued safety
and well-being of this nation!

396
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:26,434
My God...

397
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:28,434
you gave the order to have
David Palmer killed.

398
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:33,567
That was an unfortunate
but necessary intervention.

399
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:37,201
He found out too much
and we had...
Walt!

400
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:39,634
You're rationalizing murder,
the murder of a president.

401
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:42,501
You're going to contact
these people

402
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,567
and recover the nerve gas
before it leaves the country.

403
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,667
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Why not?

404
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,634
I don't know where
the nerve gas is.

405
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:51,001
And the man I have
working inside

406
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:53,400
has gone dark--
he's unreachable.

407
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:58,235
Now, you'll let things
play out as they are.

408
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,768
Otherwise, your administration
will be implicated

409
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:03,400
and your presidency
will be destroyed.

410
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:53,968
Jack.

411
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:57,301
Thanks for seeing me
like this, Mike.

412
00:21:57,368 --> 00:22:00,068
What is it?

413
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:02,201
Did you tell anyone
we were meeting?

414
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:03,634
Of course not.

415
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:13,301
Son of a bitch!
Who did you tell?

416
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:16,101
Who did you tell?!
I didn't tell
anybody, Jack!

417
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,834
<i>MAN ( over loudspeaker ):
Jack Bauer,
stay right where you are.</i>

418
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:23,867
Put down your weapons
and put your hands up.

419
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,467
What's the meaning
of this?!

420
00:22:26,534 --> 00:22:28,500
Tell your men
to stand down!

421
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:29,867
I'm sorry, sir,
we can't do that.

422
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,934
He's here at my request!
We have orders

423
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:34,234
to use force
if necessary.

424
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,101
Orders? From who?

425
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:38,201
The President of
the United States.

426
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,867
Get on your knees.

427
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:00,767
Thanks.

428
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:06,201
Novick and Bauer have
been taken into custody.

429
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:11,001
So we're just gonna
lock Mike Novick up?
For the time being.

430
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:13,168
Well, what good will it do?
Eventually, he's gonna get out,

431
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:14,500
and he's gonna talk
to the press.

432
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:15,834
What can he say?
He doesn't know anything.

433
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:18,968
I thought you told me
he talked to Jack Bauer.

434
00:23:19,034 --> 00:23:21,467
We stopped Bauer before he
could give Mike any details.

435
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,435
What's he gonna think?

436
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,934
We're detaining him.

437
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:28,401
Bauer was about to divulge
national security secrets

438
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,301
that Mike's not
authorized to hear.

439
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,567
That's why Mike's
being detained.

440
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:34,068
And what about Bauer?

441
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:36,634
He must have talked
to other people at CTU

442
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,734
and told them
what he knows.

443
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,401
As soon as this

444
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:42,435
nerve gas leaves
U.S. soil,

445
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,368
it's gonna be very difficult
to prove

446
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:46,201
that either of us
is connected

447
00:23:46,268 --> 00:23:47,701
to this in any way.

448
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:51,834
And you're sure that
these-these-these
detonators will work,

449
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:55,234
that the Sentox gas
will be released
before it can be used

450
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,901
against the Russians?
Yes.

451
00:23:58,335 --> 00:24:01,234
Right now all you need to do
is authorize me

452
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:02,634
to terminate
CTU's involvement

453
00:24:02,701 --> 00:24:04,134
in this matter.

454
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:06,634
We'll tell them we've got the
situation under control,

455
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:08,301
and that we'll
deal with Bauer.

456
00:24:08,368 --> 00:24:10,801
Who, after all, is not
officially affiliated

457
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,168
with them any longer.

458
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:18,767
All right.

459
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,634
Good.

460
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,968
<i>( phone rings )</i>

461
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,168
Yes?

462
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,467
Mr. President, I have

463
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,534
Mrs. Logan for you.

464
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:35,767
Not now.

465
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,667
Yes, sir.

466
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:11,234
Dunley.

467
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,968
What is Jack Bauer doing here,

468
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:17,767
why is he under arrest,
and why wasn't I told?

469
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:20,467
Orders of
the president.
Directly?

470
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:25,034
No. It came through
Walt Cummings' office.

471
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:27,467
Okay. Thank you.

472
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:34,667
We're no longer running point
on the search for the canisters.

473
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,867
We've been ordered off
by Division.

474
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,101
Why?

475
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:39,467
The White House
wants to use

476
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:40,934
their own people
to coordinate from now on.

477
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,567
That doesn't make sense--
we'll waste hours

478
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:43,968
getting another agency
up to speed.

479
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,335
Yeah, I know.
I tried calling the president.

480
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:46,634
He's not taking my calls.
What about Mike Novick?

481
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:47,901
Jack should be with him by now.

482
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,201
Novick's people say
he's unreachable,

483
00:25:49,268 --> 00:25:50,401
and Jack's cell goes
right to voice-mail.

484
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,867
Something's wrong.

485
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,767
Yeah, I know, but I don't know
what we can do about it.

486
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,801
I do.
What?

487
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,801
We can disregard
the order.

488
00:25:57,867 --> 00:26:00,034
We're not disregarding
a presidential order.

489
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,301
If we don't, we will not
find this nerve gas.

490
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,767
Sending Jack Bauer
to have a conversation

491
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:05,234
with Mike Novick as a
private citizen is one thing,

492
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:08,034
but I'm not about to start
considering disobeying

493
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,335
a direct order from
the White House.

494
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,500
That's because you don't
have the experience

495
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,667
to know any better.

496

<i>( soft chuckle )</i>

497
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:16,667
Mr. Buchanan,

498
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:19,567
will you step outside
for a moment?

499
00:26:24,435 --> 00:26:26,068
I can't have you talking
to me like that in front
of these people.

500
00:26:26,134 --> 00:26:28,368
You're right. I'm sorry.
Are we clear about
who's in charge here?

501
00:26:28,435 --> 00:26:29,767
Yeah, but my advice stands.

502
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:31,801
If this order jeopardizes
our chances of finding

503
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,368
that nerve gas,
it's your responsibility

504
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:35,600
to ignore it-- at
least until we can

505
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,634
make our case
to the White House.

506
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,034
You also need to learn

507
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:41,301
to make decisions
faster.
Bill...

508
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:43,500
One more thing that
comes with experience.

509
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,567
Lynn,

510
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:47,467
if we don't do
everything in our power

511
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:49,634
to stop these terrorists,
we're not doing our job.

512
00:26:51,134 --> 00:26:54,301
<i>( panting )</i>

513
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:56,201
Okay, disregard the order.

514

Thank you.

515
00:26:59,801 --> 00:27:04,268
EVELYN:
Is there anything else
you'd like me to pack for you?

516
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:07,834
Maybe a few of your...
nicer dresses?

517
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,500
I'm being confined to a
psychiatric ward, Evelyn.

518
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:14,335
I don't think there are gonna
be any black-tie events.

519
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,767
Sorry.

520
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:22,068
How'd this happen?

521
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,567
What's that, Mrs. Logan?

522
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,968
Charles and me.

523
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:34,634
I was his confidante.

524
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:38,368
All those years in
Congress, my... opinion

525
00:27:38,435 --> 00:27:43,101
was the one that
mattered most to him.

526
00:27:43,168 --> 00:27:45,435
And now I'm...

527
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:50,534
...less than an
afterthought.

528
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,667
I'm sure the president
would be here if he could.

529
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:59,867
He's the President
of the United States, Evelyn.

530
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,134
He can do whatever he wants.

531
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:05,401
If he wanted to be here,
he would be.

534
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:24,901
Mr. Bauer, you're being moved

535
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:27,701
per the president's
orders.
Where?

536
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:29,335
To a class three
detention facility.

537
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:31,301
On what charges?
I was invited here

538
00:28:31,368 --> 00:28:32,767
by Mike Novick.

539
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,901
Those are my orders, sir.

540
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,101
You're Pierce, right?

541
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:42,168
Aaron Pierce. You served
under David Palmer.
Yes, I did.

542
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:45,234
I need to speak with you
just for a moment, please.
That's not possible.

543
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:47,001
It concerns David
Palmer's killer.

544
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,701
All right.

545
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,467
David Palmer was assassinated
because he was on the verge

546
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:57,068
of discovering that the
terrorists that attacked us
today were being helped

547
00:28:57,134 --> 00:28:59,401
by someone within
Logan's administration.
Who?

548
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:00,734
Walt Cummings.

549
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,034
Why would Mr. Cummings
be involved

550
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:05,767
with terrorists?
I couldn't tell you.

551
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:08,168
But I can tell you
that the terrorists
are now in possession

552
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:10,401
of a weaponized nerve gas,
and Walt Cummings may be

553
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:12,600
the last chance we have
to stop them in time.

554
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,734
Walt Cummings ordered the
assassination of David Palmer.

555
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:21,001
I know that's hard to believe,
but I can prove it, it's true.

556
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:23,968
Actually, it's not
that hard to believe.

557
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:26,268
The First Lady also thinks

558
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:28,467
someone in the administration
was involved.

559
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,600
Your primary responsibility
as lead agent

560
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,301
is to protect the President

561
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:33,901
of the United States.

562
00:29:33,968 --> 00:29:37,301
Someone in his administration
is undermining his authority.

563
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:39,600
That is equivalent
to a coup d'\tat.

564
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:43,268
Agent Pierce, please...

565
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:45,268
please, I need your help.

566
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:01,921
Bauer's escaped.

567
00:30:01,987 --> 00:30:04,588
When? I didn't get
a code alert.

568
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:05,820
My comm's down.

569
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,921
Call it in, have agents
cover the west gate--

570
00:30:07,987 --> 00:30:09,954
that's where he was headed.
What about you?

571
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:11,555
I'll take your post.

572
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:12,754
Go.

573
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,954
Yes, sir.

574
00:30:19,454 --> 00:30:21,887
That was NSA--
CTU hasn't transferred

575
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:25,087
the search operation
to their jurisdiction yet.

576
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:26,321
What's the problem?
I don't know.

577
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:28,254
But you need to
call Lynn McGill,

578
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:29,687
make sure we're in charge
of this.

579
00:30:29,754 --> 00:30:32,154
I've been avoiding his calls
because he's just gonna ask me

580
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,555
why I'm pulling CTU off
the search operation,

581
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:35,354
and I don't know
what to tell him!

582
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:36,521
You don't have
to tell him anything.

583
00:30:36,588 --> 00:30:38,021
You're the president.

584
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,720
Agent Pierce,

585
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:41,687
we're in the middle
of a meeting, if you don't mind.

586
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,787
Mr. President,

587
00:30:44,854 --> 00:30:46,854
my name is Jack Bauer,
and I'm sorry to have

588
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,488
to confront you like this,
but your chief of staff

589
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,154
is withholding information

590
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:52,854
that is vital
to this nation's security.

591
00:30:55,388 --> 00:30:57,054
<i>( blow lands )
Stop this!</i>

592
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:00,921
I'm the President
of the United States--

593
00:31:00,987 --> 00:31:02,121
get your hands
off this man!

594
00:31:02,188 --> 00:31:03,954
Agent Pierce, do something!

595
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:05,621
I am, Mr. President.

596
00:31:05,687 --> 00:31:07,221
I'm upholding my
oath to protect you.

597
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:09,021
That won't have
any effect, sir.

598
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:10,787
I've overridden
the distress line.

599
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:14,521
Mr. Cummings is guilty of
conspiring with terrorists.

600
00:31:14,588 --> 00:31:16,521
He facilitated the theft
of a military-grade nerve gas,

601
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:20,154
and today is responsible for the
death of at least three people,

602
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:21,521
including David Palmer.

603
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,687
I know about that, but
there's an explanation.

604
00:31:23,754 --> 00:31:25,954
What do you mean,
you know about that?

605
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:28,388
Mr. Bauer, please, I just
found out a couple minutes ago.

606
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,621
It's very complicated.

607
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,421
I don't know
what this man has told you,

608
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:33,221
but we need to find
that nerve gas now,

609
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:35,254
and I mean immediately,
before it is too late.

610
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:36,854
It's already too late.

611
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:38,254
What do you mean?

612
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:40,854
Apparently, it's on its way
out of the country.

613
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,421
Where is it?!

614
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,787
He told me he doesn't know!

615
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:47,154
He's lying to you, sir!

616
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,521
The man I have
inside has gone dark,

617
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:52,887
I don't know.

618
00:31:56,388 --> 00:31:58,354
I'm done talking with you,
you understand me?

619
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:00,087
Now you read my file.

620
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,288
First thing I'm going to do,
I'm going to take out

621
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:02,354
your right eye,
then I'm going to move over,

622
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,321
and I'm going to take our
your left.

623
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,621
And then I'm going to cut you.

624
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,421
I'm going to keep cutting you
until I get

625
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:07,621
the information that I need,
you understand me?

626
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,087
So for the last time,
where is the nerve gas?

642
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,288
MAN:
Mr. Buchanan, I've got
Jack Bauer on line three.

643
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,054
Jack, what's going on?
We've been trying to reach you.

644
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,887
Bill, hold on. I'm going
to put you on speakerphone.

645
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:08,121
Bill, I'm standing here
with the president.

646
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:10,154
The nerve gas is
at Long Beach Harbor

647
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,388
in a container full
of medical supplies

648
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:13,454
on a freighter bound
for Central Asia.

649
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:15,621
It's set to depart
at 2:30 p.m.

650
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,354
How solid
is the intel, Jack?

651
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:18,754
It came directly
from Cummings.

652
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,921
Mr. President, we've
been trying to reach you

653
00:33:20,987 --> 00:33:23,454
about an order we received
changing our jurisdiction.

654
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:24,687
Disregard the order.

655
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,820
Then you want CTU to maintain

656
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:28,288
operational control
of the retrieval?

657
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:29,954
Yes. Absolutely.

658
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:31,754
I'm alerting CBP.

659
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,787
Get hazmat teams in there
and set up a perimeter.

660
00:33:33,854 --> 00:33:36,555
Have medical teams standing by
in case the gas is released.

661
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:37,521
Got it.

662
00:33:37,588 --> 00:33:38,621
Good work, Jack.

663
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,621
Are you heading back
to CTU?

664
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:43,954
I don't know yet.

665
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:45,021
Jack, we'll let you know
when we have more information

666
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,655
on the container.

667
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,754
Copy that.

668
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:55,388
Mr. President, Agent Pierce
and I are prepared

669
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:59,054
to hand ourselves over
to the authorities now.

670
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:04,021
Aaron.

671
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:07,121
Yes, Mr. President?

672
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:11,221
Take back your shield and get
Walt Cummings out of my sight.

673
00:34:11,288 --> 00:34:13,921
Yes, sir.

674
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:36,354
He told me it was too late,
and I believed him.

675
00:34:38,588 --> 00:34:43,254
You need to understand,
I trusted Walt Cummings...

676
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:44,854
but he lied to me.

677
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:47,887
I was coerced.

678
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,655
There is, uh, one more thing
that we need to discuss.

679
00:34:57,787 --> 00:34:59,154
What is that, sir?

680
00:34:59,221 --> 00:35:00,754
You.

681
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,754
The fact that you're alive

682
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,687
presents problems
for both of us.

683
00:35:05,954 --> 00:35:09,820
<i>( softly ):
Yes, Mr. President.</i>

684
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,388
I accomplished what
I set out to do,

685
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:17,621
which was to identify and
locate David Palmer's killer.

686
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:22,188
I would like to stay on until
the nerve gas is retrieved.

687
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:27,021
After that, I give you my word
I will simply disappear again.

688
00:35:29,787 --> 00:35:32,188
All right.

689
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:35,521
I think that would be best
for the good of the country.

690
00:35:35,588 --> 00:35:38,087
Yes, sir.

691
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:44,555
Thank you, Mr. Bauer.

692
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:46,054
Thank you, Mr. President.

693
00:36:26,487 --> 00:36:28,088
I'll see you soon.

694
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,554
<i>( knocks on hood )</i>

695
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:43,888
Wait. Hold up, Kevin.

696
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:45,854
What's happening?

697
00:36:47,155 --> 00:36:48,454
Martha.
Charles...

698
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:51,055
Come on. Get out
of the car.

699
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,021
Be careful.

700
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,554
What?

701
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:57,521
You were right.

702
00:36:57,587 --> 00:36:58,654
There was a conspiracy.

703
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:00,688
David was trying
to warn you and warn me.

704
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,354
I should have listened
to you.

705
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,554
<i>( stammering ):
I-I...</i>

706
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,254
Y-you... you believe me now?

707
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,654
It was Walt Cummings.

708
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:10,688
He lied to me.

709
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:11,888
He convinced me that

710
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:13,621
you were out of control.

711
00:37:13,688 --> 00:37:14,688
Walt?!

712
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,220
Sending you back
to the... the clinic

713
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:18,754
in Vermont
was his idea.

714
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:22,821
And you went along with it.

715
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:26,587
I'm sorry, Martha.

716
00:37:26,654 --> 00:37:30,921
Sending me away
without a word...

717
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:35,454
like I was... some nuisance
to be gotten rid of.

718
00:37:39,587 --> 00:37:41,354
Excuse me,
Mr. President,

719
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:43,287
but you wanted to know
when a link with CTU

720
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:44,254
was established.

721
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,254
Yes, um...
thank you, Wendy.

722
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,155
See that
the First Lady's bags

723
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,155
get back to
her room.

724
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,721
Of course.

725
00:37:55,788 --> 00:37:58,155
I've got to go.

726
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,454
Chloe, do we have confirmation
on the intel Jack gave us?

727
00:38:18,521 --> 00:38:20,055
There's only one ship scheduled

728
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:22,121
to leave the port
of Long Beach at 2:30.

729
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:24,220
It's a freighter
heading for Central Asia,

730
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:25,821
leaving from Pier F.

731
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:27,187
We don't have CTU teams
in the vicinity,

732
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:29,155
but we've got a Customs
and Border Protection

733
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,754
task force on site
under our directive.

734
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:33,055
All right, make sure
that CBP understands

735
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:34,387
the nerve gas is
housed in 20 canisters

736
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:35,788
of gray metal
that are unmarked.

737
00:38:35,854 --> 00:38:37,320
They're going
out in a shipment
of medical supplies.

738
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:38,654
Yeah, yeah,
they know all that already.

739
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:39,921
But there's going to be

740
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:41,454
about a thousand cargo
containers on that ship,

741
00:38:41,521 --> 00:38:43,021
and we don't know
which one the
nerve gas is in.

742
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,487
It's container 539146,
box seven.

743
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:47,487
I was able to hack into
the ship's manifest.

744
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:49,754
It's the only container
stocking medical supplies.

745
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:51,387
That's great.

746
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,688
Make sure all the strike
force units have that.

747
00:38:52,754 --> 00:38:54,554
Right.
Lynn, the White House
is requesting

748
00:38:54,621 --> 00:38:56,088
a live feed from the assault.

749
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:57,521
We'll have Chloe
patch them in once
the TAC teams

750
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:58,754
reach the staging area.

751
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,821
All right, got it. Yeah.

752
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:05,921
That's him.

753
00:39:05,988 --> 00:39:07,754
<i>BUCHANAN ( over speakerphone ):
His name is Ivan Erwich.</i>

754
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:09,088
He's a chemical engineer

755
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:11,220
trained at the University
of St. Petersburg.

756
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:13,921
Joined his country's separatist
movement six years ago.

757
00:39:13,988 --> 00:39:15,121
Do we have
any clearer images,

758
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,421
any file photos?

759
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,121
No, which is why
we need you to I.D. him

760
00:39:19,187 --> 00:39:20,921
when the strike force
has a visual.

761
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:22,621
Okay, just make sure
that CPB knows

762
00:39:22,688 --> 00:39:24,287
that we need
to take Erwich alive.

763
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:25,954
They know. Stand by.

764
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,155
What's the situation?

765
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,688
The strike team
is in place, Mr. President.

766
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:32,721
We're just waiting
for the video feed to come up.

767
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,688
Feed's up.

768
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:42,521
<i>FINN ( over monitor ):

No hostiles present.

770
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:45,721
You have the green light,

00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,155
If a bullet breaches
one of those canisters,

774
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,287
we'll have
a massive casualty situation.

790
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,821
What do we got?
What do we got?!

791
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:05,187
Nothing?!

792
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,187
There are

793

no gas canisters here, CTU.

794
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:10,121
Repeat, the nerve gas
is not here.

795
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:12,821
Get Walt Cummings in here now!

796
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,254
Yes, sir.

The nerve gas
isn't there.

799
00:41:20,454 --> 00:41:22,320
It has to be.

800
00:41:22,387 --> 00:41:24,421
Where are the canisters?!

801
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:25,621
I don't know.

802
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:27,721
I-I've told
you everything.

803
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:30,354
They have
to be there.

804
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:33,854
Oh, God...

805
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,187
What is it?

806
00:41:35,254 --> 00:41:38,155
That's Schaeffer,
the man we had inside.

807
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,587
They must've found out
we reprogrammed

808
00:41:40,654 --> 00:41:42,521
the detonators.

809
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,454
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

810
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,754
It's his cell
phone, sir.

811
00:42:08,888 --> 00:42:10,854
Who's calling you?

812
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:12,155
That's Schaeffer's number.

813
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,320
JACK:
Bill?

814
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:14,821
Yeah, Jack?
I want you
to monitor

815
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:16,155
and record this call.

816
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,320
We're on it.

817
00:42:17,387 --> 00:42:19,454
Answer it now.

818
00:42:21,654 --> 00:42:22,587
Yes?

819
00:42:22,654 --> 00:42:23,721
ERWICH:
We know you've altered

820
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:24,854
the arming codes,
Mr. Cummings.

821
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,721
CUMMINGS:
Who is this?

822
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:30,454
I think you know my name...
as I now know yours.

823
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:31,888
Your man Schaeffer confessed

824
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:33,454
everything.

825
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:36,788
Is President Logan with you?

826
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,155
The President
had nothing

827
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,220
to do with this...

828
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:41,821
nor did anyone else
in the government.

829
00:42:41,888 --> 00:42:42,954
I was acting alone.

830
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,155
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

831
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,621
It's the truth.

832
00:42:46,688 --> 00:42:47,788
Erwich, listen.

833
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:49,921
We can negotiate something.

834
00:42:49,988 --> 00:42:51,587
I don't negotiate
with my enemies.

835
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,454
I eliminate them.

836
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:55,454
Your country is about to pay

837
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:58,454
a very steep price.
