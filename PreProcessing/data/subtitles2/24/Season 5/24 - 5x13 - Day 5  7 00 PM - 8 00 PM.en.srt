1
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:14,034
I'm reprogramming

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,934
a CTU key car right now.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,533
Good.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,301
Our couriers are delivering
the canisters to the targets.

5
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,200
They'll be in place soon.

6
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:23,301
When are you launching
your attacks?

7
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,566
After you're done at CTU.

8
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:28,967
GARDNER:
When these terrorists attack,

9
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,267
you're going to need
to maintain order.

10
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:32,800
I believe we should be thinking

11
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,334
of a preemptive declaration
of martial law.

12
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,900
in the Greater
Los Angeles area.

13
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,167
If CTU

14
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:39,733
can't find
this man, Bierko,

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,967
we're gonna get hit!

16
00:00:41,034 --> 00:00:42,401
Why didn't you
just tell me

17
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:43,533
you were alive?

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,867
JACK:
If you knew I was alive,

19
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,200
you would have been at risk,

20
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:48,301
and I had no choice.

21
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,800
I'm happy
that you're alive-- I am,

22
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,700
but I can't give you
what you want right now.

23
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,700
Michelle's murder
was part of a bigger plan.

24
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,667
to supply terrorists
with Sentox nerve gas.

25
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:00,900
Who's behind it?

26
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,900
BUCHANAN:
Christopher Anderson.

27
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,900
Whatever he's not telling us
is important.

28
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,367
And he's willing to tolerate
an inhuman amount of pain.

29
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,767
Thousands of lives
are at stake.

30
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:12,234
There is enough time for you
to tell me what I need to know

31
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:13,833
to stop this insanity, please!

32
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
I'm sorry, guy,

33
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,401
but I can't tell you
what you want to know.

34
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:19,833
( phone ringing )

35
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,700
This is Bauer.
BUCHANAN:
We've been compromised!

36
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:24,433
Someone used a stolen key card
to access CTU

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,167
less than an hour ago.

38
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:27,533
JACK:
Freeze!

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,301
Drop the gun!

40
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,067
Bill, it's Jack.

41
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,234
I think he tried to deploy nerve
gas throughout the building.

42
00:01:35,301 --> 00:01:36,833
BUCHANAN:
Code six, everybody out!

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,833
Go, go!

44
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,767
Seal all the rooms.

45
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:47,433
Oh, no.

46
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,767
Chloe.

47
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,433
MAN ( over P.A. ):
All CTU personnel.

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,034
This facility
has been contaminated

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,566
with Sentox VX1 nerve gas.

50
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:26,234
Repeat: this facility
has been contaminated.

51
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,934
There are two safe zones
on the main floor--

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,700
the Situation Room and Medical.

53
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,633
On the second floor,

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,401
the safe zones
are Mr. Buchanan's office

55
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:39,134
and Holding Room Four.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
These areas will remain sealed,
pending the arrival

57
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,433
of the Chemical Response Team.

58
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,900
If you are in any of these
sealed areas, do not attempt

59
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,700
to leave until the CRT
clears the environment.

60
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,401
I'm on my way, but it could take
20 to 30 minutes

61
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,301
to gather all the CRT
personnel you'll need.

62
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:58,934
I understand, Curtis,
but we need CRT

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,466
here now!

64
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:01,900
This is a high priority.

65
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,700
Get here as fast as you can.

66
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,367
All right, copy-- I'll call you
in a few minutes with updates,

67
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:10,566
( phone ringing )

68
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:11,767
This is Bauer.

69
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,134
Jack, it's Bill.

70
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,301
I just talked to Curtis.

71
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,733
He's with the Chemical
Response Team.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,667
They won't be able to get here
for at least 30 minutes.

73
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,967
Why not?

74
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,800
Most of their units
were sent to Tyler Memorial.

75
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,367
The rest are en route
to high probability targets.

76
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:25,767
Okay, we're going
to keep working here.

77
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,200
Our networks
are still up, right?

78
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:29,200
Yeah, the phones are working,
the computers are up.

79
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:31,167
I can coordinate with Division
from here.

80
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:32,867
What do you need where you are?

81
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:35,500
I need to know if Henderson
is still alive.
Where is he?

82
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:36,667
Agent Burke was transferring him

83
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,267
over to the Isolation Clinic
in Medical.

84
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:40,900
I don't know if they made it
before the barriers went down.

85
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,466
You can tell if you pull up
a building grid.

86
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:45,000
What about CTU's
chemical response plan?

87
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,967
Chloe, my name
is Dr. Landes.

88
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,034
Now, he was a friend of yours--
what was his name?

89
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,168
Edgar.
Edgar.

90
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,967
LANDES:
I'd like you to turn away
from Edgar

91
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:06,701
and focus on me, please.

92
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:10,467
Chloe,
you're in shock,

93
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,168
and I'd like to help you
through it.

94
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,367
The only thing
I'm going to ask you to do

95
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:17,101
is sit in this chair
and collect your breath.

96
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:18,500
Let's do that now.

97
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:32,134
Just collect your breath,
just for a second.

98
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,801
He was such a good guy.

99
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,901
I just treated him
like crap all day.

100
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,333
This is my fault.

101
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,867
Sir?

102
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:50,500
Someone stole my key card

103
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,400
and used it to get
into the building.

104
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:56,267
It was missing,
and I didn't say anything.

105
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,001
Why not?

106
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,434
I thought they just stole
my wallet for the money.

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,934
How could you not report it?

108
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:06,233
I was embarrassed.

109
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,767
I didn't want anyone to know
I got beat up.

110
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:13,534
So we're all going to die,
because you were embarrassed?

111
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,400
( man groans )

112
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:22,767
Mr. Almeida, what are you doing?

113
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,034
I want to know
what's going on.

114
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:25,200
No, I can't allow that.

115
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,767
I'm not sitting
in this damn bed

116
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,168
while CTU is under attack--
got it?

117
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,134
Fine.

118
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,967
How long are we supposed to
be sectioned off like this?

119
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,200
I haven't received
any news.

120
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:37,567
Oh, my God.

121
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,400
Jack, we've got
the building grid.

122
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,400
( dialing )

123
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:47,701
( ringing )
Buchanan.

124
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:49,434
Bill, it's Jack--
the grid's up.

125
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,834
All right, check the isolation
zones that have logged in.

126
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:54,634
You'll have survivors.

127
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:56,233
Two zones have logged on
in Medical.

128
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,734
Try them.

129
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,901
I'm going to keep
this line open.

130
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,200
Okay, hold on.

131
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,801
( phone ringing )

132
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,034
Clinic.
Dr. Besson, it's Jack Bauer.

133
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:06,400
Jack, what's going on?

134
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,001
One of the terrorists
infiltrated CTU

135
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,734
and deployed a canister
of Sentox nerve gas

136
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,168
through the ventilation system.

137
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,767
That's why we needed to seal off
as many rooms as possible.

138
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:17,500
I need to know if Agent Burke
got to Medical with Henderson.

139
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes, he did.

140
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:20,001
Henderson's here right now?

141
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,834
Tony, is that you?

142
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:24,168
Jack, how much longer
are we going to be locked down?

143
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,001
Right now, we're in standby--
we're trying to figure out

144
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,134
how to clean out the air supply.

145
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,333
Dr. Besson?

146
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,333
Dr. Besson?

147
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,434
Tony!

148
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,767
Get me a security feed
over at Medical.

149
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,667
Jack, I don't think this
program is set up for that.

150
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:41,967
Try a redirect.
All right.

151
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:43,634
Dr. Besson!

152
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,200
( phone beeps off )

153
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:03,367
BURKE:
What are you doing?
Move aside.

154
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:04,901
( system beeps )

155
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,134
My God, he's got a gun.

156
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,168
Patch me through
to their intercom.
Do it.

157
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,667
We'll be able to hear them,
but they can't hear us yet.

158
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,034
BURKE:
You can't kill him.

159
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:16,967
He's got information
we need.
He killed my wife!

160
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:19,267
Tony, please, don't kill him.
Move aside, Rick!

161
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,134
I don't want to shoot you,
but I will.

162
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,867
Move it!

163
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:27,467
Henderson!

164
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:29,467
You remember me?

165
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:32,001
My name is Tony Almeida.

166
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,001
You killed my wife,
Michelle Dessler, this morning.

167
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,101
He's going to kill him-- hurry!

168
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,534
Hurry!

169
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,367
She was my life,

170
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,500
and you took her.

171
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,867
And now,
I'm going to take yours.

172
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:45,934
I got it.

173
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,267
Tony, it's Jack.

174
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,600
I've got you
on the security feed.

175
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,734
Stay out of this, Jack!

176
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,267
Tony, please, just listen to me.

177
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,801
You can't do this.

178
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:58,934
I know how you
feel right now.

179
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:02,901
I lost Terry
the exact same way,

180
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,767
to one of our own.

181
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:08,101
I know what it feels
to be betrayed like this.

182
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:10,233
But, Tony, Henderson
has information

183
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,200
that can save thousands
and thousands of lives.

184
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:16,600
And I know that doesn't make you
feel better right now,

185
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,934
but I know you, Tony.

186
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:21,934
I know you don't want to make
this situation

187
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,200
any worse than it is.

188
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:28,634
Please?

189
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:34,400
Please, just let us finish
our interrogation.

190
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,834
Hurry up.

191
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:47,068
Agent Burke, please continue.

192
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:48,934
We have to get him talking.

193
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,300
He's our only lead to Bierko

194
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:54,734
and the rest
of the Sentox canisters.

195
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,467
Tell me where to find Bierko.

196
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,934
( grunts )

197
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:06,101
Where?

198
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:10,300
Nowhere.

199
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:13,600
BURKE:
What is your computer password?

200
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,500
No.

201
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,567
I know no password.

202
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,667
JACK:
Agent Burke,

203
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:22,600
can we increase
the dose?

204
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:24,701
Not without killing him.

205
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:26,434
Okay, take a short break
and then start again.

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,600
Get back to me as soon

207
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,734
as you've got anything.

208
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,168
Yes, sir.

209
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,867
GARDNER:
How could CTU have been hit?

210
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,267
We're not sure,
Mr. Vice President.

211
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,500
Are you telling me

212
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,367
they didn't have
any safeguards in place?

213
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:44,333
They had partial containment,
but our early reports indicate

214
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,967
that 40% of their personnel
have been taken out.

215
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,034
You mean
they've been killed?

216
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,168
We're afraid so, sir.

217
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,767
CTU is protecting
this city.

218
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,701
Are you saying
they're no longer
capable of doing that?

219
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:59,467
I'm saying they've been
seriously compromised, yes.

220
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,967
So what are we going
to do, Ms. Hayes?

221
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:01,934
We've got terrorists

222
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,300
with nerve gas canisters
out there.

223
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,068
Who is going
to stop them?

224
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:07,901
Mr. President, I suggest
an emergency restructuring.

225
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,400
Meaning what?

226
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:10,767
Meaning that the Chemical
Response Team

227
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:11,801
will go in

228
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:12,967
neutralize the nerve gas
at CTU

229
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:15,001
and I will take a team
in there and personally

230
00:11:15,068 --> 00:11:16,068
manage the operation.

231
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:18,934
How soon can you do that?

232
00:11:19,001 --> 00:11:20,168
Within the hour.

233
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,901
Fine. Do it.

234
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,168
Yes, sir.

235
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,567
All right, they're still
somewhat operational.

236
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:25,967
It's not a complete
disaster.

237
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:27,801
Mr. President, it is.

238
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,001
I can see no other option
right now

239
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,801
but to impose martial law
on the city of Los Angeles.

240
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:35,701
Hal, my advisors believe if the
military takes over the streets

241
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:38,200
and starts detaining people,
it could create mayhem.

242
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:39,701
Sir, it's only a matter of time

243
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,667
before more canisters
are released

244
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,667
in public places

245
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:43,901
and then you will have
mayhem.

246
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,034
Except without the soldiers

247
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:46,200
you'll need to contain it.

248
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:47,667
So what do I tell
the public?

249
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,701
That we've got nerve gas
canisters all over the city,

250
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,267
but we don't know
where they are?!

251
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,267
No, no, you don't have
to get into that.

252
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,434
Tie it to that earlier
incident at the airport.

253
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,233
I'm going to get resistance
from all sides.

254
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
That's true, sir.

255
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,734
We may have to swallow

256
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:03,667
some saltwater,
but wouldn't it be worth it,

257
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:06,367
if we can keep
the people off the streets,

258
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,967
safe from
another public attack?

259
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:10,901
I don't know, Hal.

260
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,400
Sir, consider this--

261
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,600
if we clear the streets
of everybody

262
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,567
except the military,
these terrorists won't be able

263
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,500
to move as freely
as they are right now.

264
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,001
We have to do
whatever we can

265
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:24,567
to stop the people behind this.

266
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:34,233
CTU is no longer
an obstacle.

267
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,767
At least for
the time being.

268
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:37,434
Good.
Have our men move

269
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,168
from their current positions
and go to the new target.

270
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,801
How much of the nerve gas
will they release there?

271
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:45,534
All of it.

272
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,534
Excuse me.

273
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,534
Chloe, are you ready
to go back to work?

274
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,967
What do you need?

275
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:12,068
I need you.

276
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:13,200
We can't break Henderson.

277
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,333
I need you to keep trying
to decrypt the files

278
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,434
that we took
from his computer.

279
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,434
I already tried that.

280
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,467
It didn't work.

281
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:19,834
Maybe somebody else
could do it.

282
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:23,367
Chloe, you're the only person
in the room qualified.

283
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,600
Chloe, please.

284
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,134
Don't shut down on me now.

285
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,867
I'm upset about everything
that's happening too,

286
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,567
but you know how
things work around here.

287
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:31,168
We do not quit
until it's over.

288
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:34,567
You're not helping her.
You're just making things worse.

289
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,934
I am sure that you
are qualified

290
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,701
to help someone through
this kind of distress

291
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,034
over an extended
period of time,

292
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:46,567
but you see, we do not have

293
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:48,367
an extended
period of time.

294
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:50,467
So if you don't mind
stepping aside

295
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,134
so I can do my job,
I would appreciate it.

296
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Believe it or not, Jack,

297
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:54,767
you don't have to be
qualified to help people.

298
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,200
You just have to be there
for them.

299
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:58,267
Like you were there
for my daughter.

300
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,934
What does that mean?

301
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,701
You're 20 years older
than she is.

302
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,701
I know exactly

303
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,134
what you're doing.

304
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,467
I've done nothing but try
and help her deal with her loss.

305
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:12,534
How dare you accuse me
of taking advantage of her.

306
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
You did...

307
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,400
Dad, stop!

308
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:16,801
You can be angry
at me all you want,

309
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,434
but before I met Barry,
I didn't want to live.

310
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,600
Do you understand that?

311
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:25,467
Fine, I'll get back to work
if everyone could just relax.

312
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,867
Jack, we have a problem.

313
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:33,467
What?

314
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,801
( beeping )

315
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:37,434
Chloe, I just saw

316
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,967
the alarm.
What's going on?

317
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:41,934
The seal pressure indicators
in the contaminated zones

318
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:44,034
are showing traces
of sublimated polymer

319
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,300
near the partition seal.

320
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,534
What does that mean?

321
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,467
It means that the nerve gas
must be mixed

322
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:49,634
with a corrosive agent--

323
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:50,667
an acid.

324
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:51,934
The acid's breaking down
the seal

325
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:54,434
between the rooms.

326
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,600
How long till
the seal fails completely?

327
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,101
CHLOE:
It's hard to say for sure.

328
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,333
Can you give me an estimate?

329
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,168
It's deteriorating quickly.

330
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,934
I'd say 15 minutes,
20 at the most.

331
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,434
And then what?

332
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,267
As soon as the gas
permeates the seal,

333
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,834
it enters the room.
Then it's over.

334
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:11,967
Get me schematics
on all the isolated zones.

335
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:13,333
( typing rapidly )

336
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,701
Mr. Vice President,
with all due respect,

337
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,367
I'm not trying
to usurp your position.

338
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,701
I'm simply trying to serve
the president

339
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,367
the best way I can.

340
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:34,300
( sighing ):
Yes, sir.

341
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,233
What was that about?

342
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,634
I was trying
to convince Gardner

343
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:44,168
to let me help him draft
the president's statement.

344
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:47,901
Charles is letting Hal
write his statement?!

345
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,333
He's insisted.

346
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,667
And the president
gave him the go-ahead.

347
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,667
But that means Gardner
is effectively

348
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,667
making policy.

349
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:56,667
We've got
to stop him.

350
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:57,767
I'm trying.

351
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,434
But you know what kind
of pressure

352
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,034
the president's
under today.

353
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:02,867
He wants all the counsel
he can get.

354
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:05,434
And Hal's only too eager
to help out.

355
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,634
Of course he's too eager.

356
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,434
He's got his eye
on the Oval Office.

357
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,734
Anything he can do
to speed up Charles' downfall

358
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:12,400
puts him one step
closer to the presidency.

359
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:16,534
Martha, you have to intervene.

360
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,233
Hal feeds
the president ideas.

361
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,634
We saw it
at the WTO,

362
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:21,867
we saw it in Chicago.

363
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:24,801
When they work,
Hal takes the credit for them.

364
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,068
When they don't,

365
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,267
the president
takes the hits.

366
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,967
Have you reminded
Charles of that?

367
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:31,300
I can't.

368
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,233
Hal's the vice president.

369
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm just the chief of staff.

370
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:40,367
You have influence
that supercedes

371
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:42,034
any constitutional rank.

372
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,634
And now's the time
to use it.

373
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:52,967
I want to see the statement
as soon as it's issued.

374
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,567
You will.

375
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:04,500
I just checked the readings
from all uncontaminated zones.

376
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,134
The testing you've been doing

377
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,367
in your respective areas
is consistent.

378
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:11,068
The Sentox nerve gas
that was released

379
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,068
into the air duct system
contains a corrosive agent

380
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:15,233
that is eating away
at the barrier seals

381
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,634
protecting the safe zones.

382
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,467
I'm not going
to pull any punches.

383
00:17:18,534 --> 00:17:20,168
CRT will not be here
to help us.

384
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,734
At this point, our only hope
is to help ourselves.

385
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:25,767
We need to find a way
to either neutralize

386
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:28,767
or flush the Sentox
out of the contaminated areas

387
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,267
before the barrier seals fail

388
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,934
and the gas enters
the safe zones.

389
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:36,034
I want all personnel
working on this problem.

390
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,333
We don't have much time.

391
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,168
Do what you can.

392
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,867
We'll hope for the best.

393
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:45,367
Maybe we can do something
from in here.

394
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:47,001
Access the ventilation
system?

395
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:48,500
Even if I could,
it doesn't mean

396
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,434
we could do anything to stop
the seals from breaking down.

397
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Just try.

398
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,534
Maybe it's not
as bad as we think.

399
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,434
Maybe the numbers are off.

400
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,034
They're not.

401
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:05,168
Even if the seals leak,
CRT could get here in time.

402
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:07,734
The only reason
she's here

403
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,534
is because I asked
her to stay.

404
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,967
If something happens to her,
it's going to be because of me.

405
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:16,300
Because of what I did.

406
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,001
There was no way that
you could know

407
00:18:18,068 --> 00:18:19,333
that CTU was vulnerable.

408
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
CHLOE:
Jack.

409
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,101
You've got something?

410
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,333
I think if I can slow
the seals from breaking down

411
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,634
I can flush
the contaminated areas

412
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,534
using the air conditioning.
Do it.

413
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,233
Something's wrong.

414
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,534
The control isn't responding.

415
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,300
Why not?
It's being blocked
by some program

416
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,034
that I can't
get to remotely.

417
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:38,867
It's probably on a computer
near Holding Four.

418
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,834
Can you get me in there?

419
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:42,233
This is a false wall.

420
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,101
The air in there
is not contaminated.

421
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:45,734
Can he get to
the computer
through there?

422
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,767
Yes, but once he makes
it through the safe zone,

423
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,500
he'll be in
a contaminated area.

424
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:50,734
What are you talking about?

425
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,168
He can't go through
a contaminated area.

426
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,600
I can hold my breath.

427
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,834
The Sentox won't be
absorbed by my skin

428
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,200
over that short
a period of time.

429
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,034
As long as I don't inhale it,
I'll be fine.

430
00:18:58,101 --> 00:18:59,701
Jack, you can't
hold your breath that long.

431
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,767
I only have to hold my breath
long enough

432
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,967
to get to the computer,
disconnect the program

433
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:05,134
and get back
to the ventilated room.

434
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,434
Once I'm back
in the safe room,

435
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,233
how long will it take you
to clear out the Sentox?

436
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,834
About 20 seconds

437
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,267
based on
the cubic footage.

438
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,567
AUDREY:
Jack, even if you
get to the computer,

439
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,434
what if we can't
ventilate that room?

440
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,400
Chloe thinks we can.

441
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:18,934
Right now, this is
our only option.

442
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:21,068
CRT is not going
to get here in time.

443
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:22,367
The seals are now
80% gone.

444
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:24,068
What's the bottom line?

445
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:26,134
We have less
than 20 minutes.

446
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,767
AUDREY:
All right, Jack,
Chloe and I

447
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,901
are on channel one.

448
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,267
If you need to communicate
with anyone else

449
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,300
we'll patch you through.

450
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:32,667
As soon as I go through,

451
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,200
you have to replace this
behind me.

452
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:36,267
Jack, it's time.
Go now.

453
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,801
Now.

454
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,034
Chloe, it's Jack.
I just completed the airlock.

455
00:20:52,101 --> 00:20:53,567
I'm getting ready to move

456
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:54,634
into the ventilation room.

457
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,634
I'll tap my com unit
three times

458
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:57,934
when I'm back
in the safe room.

459
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:00,168
All right. Jack,
I don't have to remind you

460
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,534
if that airlock leaks,

461
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,534
we'll all be dead
within the next three minutes.

462
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,267
It's not going
to leak, Chloe.

463
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,867
Okay...

464
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,367
I'm going in.

465
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,400
Okay.

466
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,300
( inhales deeply )

467
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:58,068
* *

468
00:22:13,101 --> 00:22:15,267
( computer blipping )

469
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,667
Seal corrosion is now
at 86 percent.

470
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,801
Is there anything

471
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:21,500
we can do from here?
No, we just have to wait.

472
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,934
There's nothing we can do to get
your dad out any faster.

473
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:25,967
Don't talk down to me, Chloe.

474
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:28,500
Listen, we're in a crisis
situation here, okay?

475
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:29,867
Tempers are bound to flare.

476
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,400
Let's just everybody breathe.

477
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,600
What's with you
and the breathing?

478
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,367
Is that your solution
to everything?

479
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:45,734
It's Jack,
he's back in the room.

480
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,600
It's too soon, he couldn't
have found the program

481
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,701
and disabled it yet.

482
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,534
He's got 15 more seconds
before the room clears.

483
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:56,734
What's it mean that
he finished so quickly?

484
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,034
I don't know.

485
00:22:58,101 --> 00:22:59,400
Well, it could be
a good thing, right?

486
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,034
It could be a good thing
or it could be a bad thing.

487
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:02,801
That's what
"I don't know" means.

488
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,734
( computer blips )
All right, Jack,

489
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:08,467
the room is clear, you can
breathe. Are you okay?

490
00:23:08,534 --> 00:23:10,667
( gasps )

491
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,400
I couldn't get to it.

492
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:14,734
Chloe, you're right.
I saw it.

493
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:15,901
There's a computer

494
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,967
program running on
the AC control unit,

495
00:23:18,034 --> 00:23:20,300
but there's a security grate
in the wall behind the vent.

496
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,034
I don't see it on my system.

497
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,200
Trust me, it's there.

498
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,267
I just found it.

499
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,767
It was a security upgrade

500
00:23:29,834 --> 00:23:31,233
in the last two years.

501
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,567
Somebody didn't file it
properly,

502
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:34,068
that's why
I didn't see it.

503
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:35,200
Are there any other vents

504
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:37,101
that could help us
get into that wall?

505
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:38,467
No, they've all been upgraded.

506
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:40,200
Well, it's a room,
there's got to be a door.

507
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:41,267
Where does it lead?

508
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,500
To a corridor
above Holding Four.

509
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,101
None of us can get there
from where we're at.

510
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:45,634
Who's in holding room four?

511
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:46,801
Lynn McGill.

512
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:48,467
Are there any other vented rooms

513
00:23:48,534 --> 00:23:49,567
we can get him to?

514
00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:51,734
No, Jack, there's nothing.

515
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:58,333
Patch me through to him.

516
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:01,534
( phone rings )

517
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,934
( phone beeps on )
McGill here.

518
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:05,434
Lynn, it's Jack.

519
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,767
We found a computer interrupt
in the AC control unit.

520
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:09,233
Now if we can shut that down
in the next

521
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,434
few minutes, we can stop the gas
from permeating the safe zones.

522
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,200
Well, that's good news.

523
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,034
The problem is
you're the only person

524
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:17,434
close enough to get to it.

525
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,634
Chloe?

526
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:19,767
CHLOE:
It's directly above

527
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,034
the holding room
where you are now.

528
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:23,567
Take the stairs, go to the left
around the corner.

529
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:24,767
It's the room on your left.

530
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,134
Okay...

531
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,767
How are we going
to do this, Jack?

532
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,934
Lynn, the truth is

533
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,134
if I can get there,
I would do this myself,

534
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,634
but I'm not close enough.

535
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:34,400
No one who's
still alive in CTU is.

536
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,634
You're the only person
who can do this.

537
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:38,867
And I'm going to have to ask you
to do it without any protection.

538
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:39,967
I see.

539
00:24:40,034 --> 00:24:41,734
No, you don't.

540
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:43,834
As soon as you open the door
to the hallway,

541
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,834
your room
will become contaminated.

542
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,634
You can hold your breath long
enough to fix the problem,

543
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,500
but we have nowhere else
to send you.

544
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,534
We can't airlock you.

545
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,034
There are two of us
in here, Jack.

546
00:24:54,101 --> 00:24:57,168
Sir, this is Harry Swinton.

547
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:58,967
So you're saying
that if he does this,

548
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:01,001
then we're both going to die?

549
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:03,300
I'm so sorry.

550
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,168
We don't have a choice, Harry.

551
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:09,467
How do we know that you're not
just making this story up

552
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:11,667
so you don't have to make
the sacrifice yourself?

553
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:12,901
You don't.

554
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,867
All I can ask you to do
is believe me.

555
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:16,200
I'm telling you the truth.

556
00:25:16,267 --> 00:25:17,801
Well, that's easy for you
to say, sir.

557
00:25:17,867 --> 00:25:19,300
You're not the one
who's about to die.

558
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:22,267
It's not easy for me to say.

559
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,267
Hold on.

560
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,767
( keypad beeps )

561
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,634
We have to do this, Harry.

562
00:25:29,701 --> 00:25:30,934
We're going to die anyway.

563
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,233
If we don't,
so will everyone in CTU.

564
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,767
We have to do this.

565
00:25:45,034 --> 00:25:46,534
( phone beeps on )
Okay, Jack, go ahead.

566
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,801
Once you enter
the ventilation room,

567
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,734
the computer will be
on your right.

568
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,901
CHLOE:
There's a program running
on the computer.

569
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,001
You need to quit out of it,
I'll take it from there.

570
00:25:55,068 --> 00:25:57,534
JACK:
Lynn, we don't have
a lot of time.

571
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,300
I'll do it.

572
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,051
Chloe...

573
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:31,383
I'm sorry about
how I acted earlier...

574
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,348
and about your friend
that died.

575
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,148
Okay.

576
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:36,380
Thanks.

577
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:39,412
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

578
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,243
Did you have contact with
my dad while he was gone?

579
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,408
I sent him information
about once a month.

580
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:47,875
What kind of information?

581
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,573
A lot of different things.

582
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,040
About me?

583
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:54,369
Actually, almost all
of it was about you.

584
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:56,203
Your breakup with Chase,
your depression...

585
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:57,735
Wha...?
How did you get...?

586
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:00,600
I'm really good at
getting information.

587
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:03,465
I don't judge it,
I just pass it on.

588
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,164
I'm sorry about
you and Chase.

589
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:07,230
It must've been
really painful.

590
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,694
Yeah, it was.

591
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,194
So you talked to him, too?

592
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:13,359
Chase? No.

593
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:15,025
You know where he is?

594
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,890
No, but I could
find out, if you want.

595
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:19,289
No, no, it's all right.

596
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:22,554
Barry thinks
I should let that go.

597
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:24,453
He's probably right.
Yeah, well, shrinks

598
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,653
are always giving advice

599
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:28,451
that they probably
don't follow themselves.

600
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:31,481
How are you doing?

601
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,915
Well, this morning I woke up
with a guy in my bed

602
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:35,346
that I'll probably
never see again.

603
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:37,445
And I just watched
one of my best friends die

604
00:27:37,513 --> 00:27:38,678
right in front of me, so...

605
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:40,911
I guess not that great.

606
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:42,942
Yeah.

607
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:51,037
( panting )

608
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,235
( knocking )

609
00:27:57,335 --> 00:27:58,967
Replace the panel.

610
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,298
Pull up the security feed for
the observation room.

611
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:03,396
( typing )

612
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:07,762
You be a good girl
for Mommy, okay?

613
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:09,293
She tells you
you have to go to bed,

614
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,658
you have to go to bed.

615
00:28:11,727 --> 00:28:13,258
When you coming home?

616
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,091
I don't know, honey.

617
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,156
If I fall asleep,
will you wake me up?

618
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:21,186
Of course I will.

619
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:22,586
Yeah?
Yeah.

620
00:28:24,687 --> 00:28:26,351
I'm going in now, Harry.

621
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:30,348
I love you.

622
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,816
Love you, too, Dad.

623
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,779
( keypad beeps )

624
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:38,777
Chloe, we're ready.

625
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:39,977
I'm going in.

626
00:28:40,044 --> 00:28:41,841
Okay, good luck.

627
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,675
And thanks for doing this.

628
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:47,372
Yeah.

629
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,229
( inhales deeply )

630
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,514
( computer blips )

631
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:33,812
( computer blips )

632
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,042
He did it.

633
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,574
Is the AC responding?

634
00:29:41,642 --> 00:29:43,206
Yes. I'm starting the fans now.

635
00:29:43,273 --> 00:29:45,238
How long before the
Sentox is neutralized?

636
00:29:45,306 --> 00:29:47,105
At least 15 minutes,
but the concentration

637
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,170
should go down enough to stop
eating away at the seals

638
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:51,302
immediately.
Polymer count is down

639
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,201
It looks like the seals
will hold

640
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,366
until all zones are clear.

641
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,362
JACK:
Lynn, Harry, I don't know
if you can still hear me,

642
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:04,661
but I want you to know
what you did was successful.

643
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:08,359
The seals are holding.

644
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:10,058
I will personally notify your
families

645
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,056
and tell them
of the sacrifice you made.

646
00:30:13,124 --> 00:30:16,989
I'm so sorry.

647
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:19,252
I don't know what else to say.

648
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,484
Thank you.

649
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:25,717
( gasps deeply )

650
00:30:29,082 --> 00:30:31,745
( gasping )

651
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,045
I'm okay...

652
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:37,710
I'm okay.

653
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:39,507
( heaving breaths )

654
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:40,840
( gasping )

655
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:43,038
( gags )

656
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:48,703
Oh, my God.

657
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:54,732
( gasps deeply )

658
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:05,892
( grunts )

659
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:08,224
( gags, coughs )

660
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,916
( grunting )

661
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:34,343
Pull up the security feed
to Medical.

662
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,165
Can you hear me?

663
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:53,566
What's your name?

664
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:55,664
No...

665
00:31:55,731 --> 00:31:57,529
No name.

666
00:31:57,598 --> 00:32:00,261
You're wasting your time.

667
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:01,861
Agent Burke, this is Jack Bauer.

668
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:03,191
What have you got
from Henderson?

669
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,425
Nothing. He's still not talking.

670
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,224
Okay, keep working on him.

671
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:11,187
As soon as the barriers go up,
I'll get back to you.

672
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:12,587
Chloe,

673
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:14,152
I don't think we're going
to break Henderson now.

674
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:15,453
All the information
that we're going to get

675
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,518
is from his computer.

676
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,784
I need you to keep
working on those files.

677
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,349
Most of my team is gone.
How am I going to do that?

678
00:32:19,418 --> 00:32:21,715
Only work on his files.

679
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:24,179
Kim,

680
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:25,548
as soon
as the barriers go up,

681
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:26,747
I want you go over
to Medical

682
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,312
and let them
check you out.

683
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,912
No, Dad, when the barriers
go up, I'm leaving.

684
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:31,644
Kim, please,
just do this for me.

685
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:33,075
We still need
to talk.

686
00:32:33,143 --> 00:32:35,275
There's nothing
to talk about.

687
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:39,572
Don't be in such a hurry
to cut me off.

688
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,237
You cut me off.

689
00:32:41,305 --> 00:32:42,737
Listen to me,
I'm not angry.

690
00:32:42,804 --> 00:32:44,402
I love you.

691
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,869
But there's nothing
left to say

692
00:32:45,936 --> 00:32:47,834
except I don't want
to be around you.

693
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:53,097
Every time I am,
something horrible happens.

694
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:57,227
People die, and I know
that's not your fault,

695
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:59,760
but I can't be
a part of it.

696
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:02,391
I don't want you
to be a part of that.

697
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,525
All I want is for
one day you and I

698
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:07,055
just to be able
to spend time together.

699
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,353
Kim, I had to
give you up once,

700
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,285
I'm not going
to let that happen again.

701
00:33:14,353 --> 00:33:15,385
Dad...

702
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,884
I can't.

703
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:29,109
Hi.
Hey.

704
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:31,543
God, that was close.

705
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,140
I know.

706
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:47,599
Are you all right?

707
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,500
No.

708
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:05,943
An emergency
peacekeeping force.

709
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,548
It was Hal's suggestion.

710
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:08,753
I think it works.

711
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:10,092
Charles,

712
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,066
aren't you afraid that
an edict of this kind

713
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,905
could do far more damage
than any

714
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:16,047
chemical weapon
ever could?

715
00:34:16,116 --> 00:34:19,427
Martha, CTU has been attacked.

716
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:21,669
Our first line of defense
is shut down

717
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:24,278
and people were killed
because of this chemical weapon.

718
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:26,286
And that's just a prelude
to what's going to happen

719
00:34:26,354 --> 00:34:27,558
in this city.

720
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:28,696
More nerve gas

721
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:30,102
will be released,
I can guarantee it.

722
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,109
Look, if you or Mike--
you have any better ideas--

723
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,749
please,

724
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:36,760
I would be glad to hear them.

725
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:49,508
What is it, Martha?

726
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:56,905
If you, Charles Logan,
really feel

727
00:34:56,971 --> 00:35:00,652
that martial law
is your only option,

728
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,525
I will support you.

729
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:08,683
But what I will not do
is stand by and watch
Hal Gardner use you

730
00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:09,820
to promote his own agenda.

731
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:11,728
Please, Martha,
give me some credit.

732
00:35:11,795 --> 00:35:13,167
He has done it before.

733
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:15,978
He is not the president.
You are.

734
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:19,758
I am doing this because
it's the right thing to do!

735
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:30,599
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

736
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:31,904
I really don't.

737
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:43,081
David's assassination,
the nerve gas,

738
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:45,022
the murder of those hostages,

739
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,937
Walt Cummings' betrayal,

740
00:35:49,004 --> 00:35:52,551
and you...

741
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,926
I almost lost you.

742
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:58,808
I didn't lose you, did I?

743
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:10,084
No, Charles.

744
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:18,049
You didn't lose me.

745
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:19,320
I'm still here.

746
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:32,537
Yes.

747
00:36:32,605 --> 00:36:35,448
Good.

748
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:36,587
The men are there.

749
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:37,758
They need the schematics.

750
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,888
( phone rings )

751
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:56,161
Who is it?

752
00:36:56,228 --> 00:36:58,503
Just a client.

753
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,284
Hello.

754
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:03,590
Have you got it yet?

755
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:04,962
I told you I'd call you

756
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:06,567
as soon as I have
everything.

757
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:08,073
I'm still waiting
on a few items.

758
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:10,148
I'm paying you
a lot of money, Collette.

759
00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:13,160
And if you could have
gotten the detailed specs

760
00:37:13,227 --> 00:37:15,804
of a facility this secure
from someone else,

761
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,074
you would have.

762
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:18,548
But you didn't.
You called me

763
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:21,860
and I'll have it for you
in a few minutes.

764
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:27,046
What's wrong?

765
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:28,586
Nothing.

766
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:29,991
Difficult client.

767
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,013
I wish I knew exactly
what it is you did.

768
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:37,922
I might be able
to help.

769
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,426
You do help me.

770
00:37:41,602 --> 00:37:44,279
Oh, I can't.

771
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,253
I have to go
and finish something.

772
00:37:52,411 --> 00:37:53,582
Finish this.

773
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:59,806
How long till the air
will be safe to breathe?

774
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:00,809
( phone ringing )

775
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:03,117
All right, thank you very much.

776
00:38:03,185 --> 00:38:04,121
Buchanan.

777
00:38:04,189 --> 00:38:05,225
Mr. Buchanan, this is

778
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:07,233
Karen Hayes
from Homeland Security.

779
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:08,907
Karen.
I'm running a damage

780
00:38:08,974 --> 00:38:11,015
assessment and I need
your body count.

781
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,256
We don't have a body count yet.

782
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,632
We'll know more
when CRT gets here
and the barriers lift.

783
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,971
What's your best estimate?

784
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,514
I'm guessing we'll need
at least 20 in Comm

785
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:21,823
and 35 in Tactical
and other departments.

786
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:22,961
All right, well,

787
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:25,035
I'm on my way over there
with a core team.

788
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:26,842
We can make adjustments
when I get there.

789
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,014
You coming here now?

790
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,653
Yes.

791
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,694
I see.

792
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,367
I'll be there soon.

793
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:35,074
How's your progress?
Good.

794
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:37,182
I've already reformatted
their main servers to our specs.

795
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,524
All their tactical protocols
will have to go through me.

796
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:40,897
Good.

797
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:42,603
I may have
to replace some
of their personnel

798
00:38:42,669 --> 00:38:43,672
with my people.

799
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:44,711
Do you have a problem with that?

800
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:46,183
Absolutely not.

801
00:38:46,251 --> 00:38:47,789
After what these people
have been through,

802
00:38:47,856 --> 00:38:49,797
most of them won't be up
to full capacity.

803
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:51,771
We need to identify
these people quickly

804
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,076
and send them home.

805
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,381
What about chain of command?

806
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:55,887
Am I going to need approval
from Bill Buchanan

807
00:38:55,954 --> 00:38:57,259
if I want to make
a personnel change?

808
00:38:57,326 --> 00:38:59,366
No, Bill won't be in charge
when we get there,

809
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:01,309
I will.

810
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:04,553
For all intents
and purposes,
CTU is no longer

811
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:06,194
an operation entity.

812
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:11,714
It's a building with workers
who will report to us.

813
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:17,670
We're clear.
I'm going back to Medical.

814
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,079
All right.

815
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:24,028
Kim, I have
to finish this now.

816
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:27,040
I know.
Good-bye, Dad.

817
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,175
Good-bye.

818
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:40,926
Excuse me, Jack.

819
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:42,599
I just wanted
to say thank you

820
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,272
for saving our lives.

821
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,054
I mean, we definitely
couldn't have gotten
through this without you.

822
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:50,864
Take her outside
of the city.

823
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:54,077
Don't make any stops.
You understand?

824
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:02,040
Bye.

825
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,146
Looks like he's dead.

826
00:40:12,214 --> 00:40:15,225
No. His nervous system
is shut down.

827
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,030
Well, can you wake him up?

828
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:18,202
No.

829
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,512
( phone rings )

830
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:26,032
Almeida.

831
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,441
Tony, it's Jack. I'm on my way.

832
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,587
Yeah, Jack,
Henderson's in a coma.

833
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:32,958
He's not coming out of it.

834
00:40:33,026 --> 00:40:34,431
You've had your chance.

835
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:35,970
He's mine now.

836
00:40:36,038 --> 00:40:38,447
Damn it, Tony, just wait
until I get there!

837
00:40:38,514 --> 00:40:40,421
No, I'm done waiting.

838
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:41,593
You don't want to do this.

839
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,233
It's not going
to bring back Michelle.

840
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:46,410
No, but I'll feel better.

841
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,217
Trust me, it won't.

842
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:51,831
You're probably right.

843
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:53,169
I'll let you know.

844
00:40:53,237 --> 00:40:56,115
Tony! Tony?!

845
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,427
What'd Jack say?

846
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:02,070
He's on his way here.

847
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:04,748
We'll figure out
what to do when
he gets here.

848
00:41:04,814 --> 00:41:05,817
There's nothing to figure out.

849
00:41:05,885 --> 00:41:08,261
This guy's cooked.

850
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:39,514
* *

851
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,230
( grunting )

852
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:23,015
Tony! Tony!

853
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,758
I-I couldn't do it.

854
00:42:25,826 --> 00:42:27,833
It's all right.
It's all right. Come on.

855
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,688
You stay with me.
Stay with me.

856
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:35,027
I need help!

857
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,837
Somebody help!

858
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:43,459
No, no... no, hang on.

859
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,232
Hang on!

860
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,048
She's gone, Jack.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
