1
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:12,967
Previously on 24:

2
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:15,134
We have waited patiently
for you to renounce

3
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,501
this unholy pact
with our oppressors,

4
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:19,401
but we have heard nothing.

5
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:21,267
This it the cost
of that silence.

6
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,101
If you choose to sign
this corrupt document,

7
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:27,234
understand that you will also
be staining it

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,733
with the blood
of the remaining hostages.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,900
If CTU can't
pull this off in time

10
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:34,101
that's upwards
of 60 people, Mike.

11
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,201
Mrs. Logan, if someone
altered the recording

12
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,067
of your conversation
with David Palmer,

13
00:00:38,134 --> 00:00:39,434
the president needs to know.

14
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:41,334
Between the summit
and the hostage situation,

15
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:43,600
he's not in the frame of mind
to deal with this.

16
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:45,534
Until the treaty's signed,

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not letting this
out of my sight.

18
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,767
What did she tell you?

19
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:50,934
She said it was a transcript

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,267
of the call she had
with David Palmer.

21
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,568
I under President Logan
wants us to go

22
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,067
into the terminal
as soon as possible.

23
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:04,367
Yes, before the treaty
is signed.

24
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,700
Curtis, what's your situation?

25
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,900
My men are in place,

26
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,267
and we're setting
the entry charges.

27
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,800
We should be able to make
our entry on target.

28
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,468
I assume Mr. Bauer's
been taken into custody?

29
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:14,034
Well, I plan
to debrief him here.

30
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,134
Bring him in now.

31
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,600
Diane, what's going on?
What's wrong?

32
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,401
Derek is inside the terminal.

33
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:21,267
I see him.

34
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:23,034
He's with the other hostages
but he's not hurt.

35
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,934
Please don't let anything
happen to him.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,401
This is not your fault.

37
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:27,967
I'm the reason you went
along with them.

38
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:29,867
This is not over.

39
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:37,900
We got a problem.

40
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,633
One of the hostages
is missing.

41
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,667
He was working
with the terrorists.

42
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,067
Give me a description;
I'll take care of it.

43
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:44,534
I'll help you now-
let's go.

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,234
Buchanan just gave orders
to take you into custody.

45
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,834
I watched Beresch
give this guy a key card.

46
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,934
Something else
is going down here.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,501
We've got to find this guy now.

48
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:54,234
Sorry we have to bring you in
like this, Jack.

49
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,700
It's all right, Mara.
I understand.

50
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,401
A year and a half.

51
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,967
How did you manage to stay
invisible for so long?

52
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:04,967
Apparently I wasn't as invisible
as I should have been.

53
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,434
Tyler.

54
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,267
Mara, it's Curtis.
Put Bauer on.

55
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:12,034
It's Agent Manning.

56
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:13,667
Yeah?

57
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,367
Jack, you say the suspect
was hiding among the hostages?

58
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:17,800
Yeah, right up until
the assault began,

59
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,367
somewhere around 10:30.

60
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:21,101
Then he must have broken
for an exit.

61
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,534
What exit was closest?

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,867
Without an alarm?

63
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,700
Between gates six
and seven.

64
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,568
Thanks, Jack.
Yeah.

65
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,468
Pull up external video
starting at 10:30.

66
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:32,568
All cameras covering
gates six and seven.

67
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,568
We're away.

68
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:13,501
Mrs. Logan?

69
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:17,434
Mrs. Logan?

70
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,468
Oh, my God.

71
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:21,867
Help!

72
00:04:21,934 --> 00:04:23,434
Something's happened
to the First Lady.

73
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,667
Get a doctor, now.

74
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:32,067
According to Jack, he should be

75
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:34,800
between gates six and seven,
just outside this view.

76
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,600
I got this feed
from ten minutes ago.

77
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,700
Try camera seven.

78
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,633
Camera four.

79
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,834
All right, there he is.

80
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,733
Tighten up.

81
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,301
Yellow Tie. Got him.

82
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,700
Now let's follow him.

83
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,600
Damn it. What camera covers
the adjacent sector?

84
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,367
14A, but it's a bad angle.

85
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,568
Pull it up, anyway.

86
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,900
Match the time codes.

87
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:09,900
Okay, here he is.

88
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,800
This is two minutes,
25 seconds later.

89
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,468
What hangar is that?

90
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:14,733
Hangar Double-B.

91
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:17,600
Has it been searched yet?

92
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:20,201
No. It was outside
the secured perimeter.

93
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,067
All right, I'm going to take
a field team, head over there.

94
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:23,201
Send this info to Comm.

95
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,334
Team A with me.
Let's go!

96
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,234
Hangar Double-B.
Let's go.

97
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,367
CTU. Stiles.

98
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:38,034
Edgar, Jack told us
about a suspect

99
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:39,267
hiding among the hostages.

100
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,134
We just picked up surveillance
on him.

101
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,234
He entered Hangar Double-B
at roughly 10:57.

102
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,334
Did you check it out yet?

103
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,468
No, we're going in now.
I'll need comm.

104
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,501
I'm on it. Chloe, what volume
is airport facilities on?

105
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,600
Hennessy Four.

106
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,900
Team Two, cover the rear.

107
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,101
* *

108
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,834
Check it out.

109
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,733
Everyone else,
search the building,

110
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,534
see what you can find.

111
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,267
* *

112
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,568
Craig, it's Curtis.

113
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,167
Send a forensics team
down here now.

114
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,334
Tell them they'll need
a full bio-pack

115
00:07:30,401 --> 00:07:32,600
with spectrum analyzers.

116
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,034
Any problems getting
the canisters out?

117
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:45,167
No. They were hidden exactly
where you said they'd be.

118
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,934
Everything on schedule
with our transport?

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,834
Customs documents are being
finalized at the port. Good.

120
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,767
The Russians will finally
understand the consequences

121
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,234
of occupying our homeland

122
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,834
when we turn Moscow
into a graveyard.

123
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,800
When did this happen?

124
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,201
A few minutes ago.

125
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:09,501
I came back in,
and I found her on the bed.

126
00:08:09,568 --> 00:08:11,334
What do you mean "came back in"?

127
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,700
You mean you left her alone.

128
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:20,367
What happened, Doctor?

129
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,800
Is she all right?

130
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,501
She seems to be now,
but I'd have to do some tests

131
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:24,633
to find out why she blacked out.

132
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,301
I didn't black out.

133
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,301
Someone did this to me.

134
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,800
Someone attacked me, Charles.

135
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:30,633
Shh, shh. Martha...

136
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,267
You have to do something.
You have to do something.

137
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,800
They're trying
to get me.

138
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:36,067
No, no one's trying to get you. Yes!

139
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:37,434
We just want you to
be well. Honey, listen.

140
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,834
Listen, listen.

141
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,134
I had the proof,

142
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,334
and now it's gone.

143
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:43,867
What proof?
What are you talking about?

144
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:46,534
The proof
that David Palmer called me

145
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,234
to warn me about today.

146
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,534
Are we still on this?

147
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,367
We've never been off of it.

148
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,534
You just wouldn't
listen to me.

149
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,101
Sir.

150
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,367
Is everything okay?

151
00:09:00,434 --> 00:09:01,934
I think so.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No. No, damn it,
it's not o... okay!

153
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,367
You people have got to listen
to me.

154
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:14,367
I had a document,
from the archive room.

155
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:16,301
Where was this document?

156
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:18,534
I am trying to tell you.

157
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,867
It was hidden in my blouse.

158
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:23,767
It's gone.
Someone stole it from me.

159
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,633
Martha, you've been under
a lot of stress.

160
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,800
We all have.

161
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,000
Let... let...

162
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,301
No, let Dr. Hill...

163
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,167
Let Dr. Hill examine you

164
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,267
and we can figure out
how to get you better.

165
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,767
You don't believe me.

166
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:42,501
You don't believe your own wife.

167
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:00,000
I have an important phone call
from the Secretary of State

168
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,667
that I have to get to.

169
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,101
If there's any sudden changes,

170
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,767
you get back to me
as soon as possible.

171
00:10:04,834 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes, Mr. President.

172
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:09,134
Charles, don't leave.

173
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:10,934
Honey, I'll be
right down the hall.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,767
No, no, no, honey,
honey, don't leave me.

175
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,134
You need to get some rest.

176
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,434
Ple...

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,201
Close that door.

178
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:34,568
What do I do about this, Walt?

179
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,101
This is what she was like
before you sent her to Vermont.

180
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,667
Are you suggesting
that I readmit her?

181
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,468
You have to consider
the option.

182
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,401
For her sake.

183
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:49,167
She said she'd rather die
than go back in there.

184
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,134
Sir,

185
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,201
if she's going to persist
with these conspiracy theories,

186
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,733
it's only a matter of time

187
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,167
before she talks to someone
who believes her.

188
00:10:57,234 --> 00:11:01,800
Then we really will
have a problem.

189
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,967
I wish you were wrong,
but I don't think you are.

190
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:13,700
Do you want me
to handle this, sir?

191
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:20,967
Make the arrangements.

192
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:23,900
But don't let Martha find out.

193
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,867
Let me be the one to tell her.

194
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:29,234
Yes, sir.

195
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,468
Yeah.

196
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,834
Have you handled
the problem there?

197
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,201
Yes.

198
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,267
Martha Logan won't be giving us
any more trouble.

199
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,367
Good. Erwich has just

200
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,800
completed transferring the gas
to the semi

201
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:51,633
and is on his way to the port.

202
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,000
And the authorities
don't know

203
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:54,434
anything's been stolen?
Not yet.

204
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:57,167
Then the only thing we have left
to take care of is Bauer.

205
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:58,367
Where is he?

206
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,534
On his way to CTU.

207
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,934
Mm. He's getting too close.

208
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,700
He's already started
putting the pieces together.

209
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:05,633
I know.
He needs to be taken out.

210
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,334
I'm handling it myself.

211
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,900
How?

212
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,700
Once he gets to CTU, your hitter
won't be able to get near him.

213
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,800
I've have someone on the inside
who can help us.

214
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,468
Then use him.

215
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,934
Done.

216
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,900
You sure those
readings are right?

217
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:43,867
They're right.

218
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:45,767
2,000 parts per million.

219
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,334
That can only be military grade.

220
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:48,800
I'll tell him.

221
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:50,767
Where are you going?

222
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:51,834
I need you to finish

223
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,134
the shell script.
Not now.

224
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,734
Since when do you say "not now"?

225
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,468
According to this,
the hangar was leased

226
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:58,334
to some offshore company,
but it's been vacant

227
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:00,001
for at least 18 months.

228
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:00,967
Sir?

229
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:02,301
I just heard from Curtis.

230
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:03,567
He was right.

231
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:05,633
There was nerve gas
in hangar Double B.

232
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,301
That's what killed the rats.

233
00:13:07,368 --> 00:13:09,368
There were trace amounts found
in the animals' blood.

234
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:10,667
But the concentrations

235
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,500
were definitely mil spec-
weaponized.

236
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:13,900
So this man in the yellow tie,

237
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:15,301
the suspect that Bauer's
telling us about

238
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:16,967
that's what he was
doing at the airport?

239
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,334
Stealing canisters of nerve gas
out of the hangar?

240
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,468
Stealing from whom?

241
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,533
Military destroyed

242
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,034
its stockpiles years ago.

243
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,167
Well, maybe this nerve gas
wasn't produced by the military.

244
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:31,867
Edgar, have forensics get a
signature off the trace samples.

245
00:13:31,934 --> 00:13:33,800
See if they can figure out
who manufactured it.

246
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,234
Chloe, elevate our alert status.

247
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,967
Activate all available personnel
and get Curtis back here.

248
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:37,934
We're gonna need

249
00:13:38,001 --> 00:13:41,468
everyone we have.

250
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,967
I wouldn't issue a statement
about the First Lady

251
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,234
for another couple days.

252
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:46,667
Let your successes today
run front and center

253
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:47,667
on all the networks.

254
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,567
That sounds right.

255
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:52,633
Dr. Hill, please, come in.

256
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,800
How's Martha doing?

257
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,167
Well, she's asleep now.

258
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,167
Have you figured out
what caused the blackout?

259
00:13:58,234 --> 00:14:00,001
I spoke with her psychiatrist,
Dr. Carlstrom,

260
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,267
and none of the medication
she's been prescribing

261
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,800
would have caused
this kind of collapse.

262
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,468
So we still don't know
what it was.

263
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,767
Not yet, no.

264
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:10,201
Mr. President, I need
to speak to you and Walt alone.

265
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,067
Thank you, Doctor.

266
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:14,667
Keep a close eye on her.

267
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:15,834
We'll talk soon.

268
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,834
Yes, Mr. President.

269
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:22,001
What's up, Mike?

270
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,101
I'm afraid the situation
at the airport

271
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,600
has taken an unexpected turn.

272
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,867
What's the problem?

273
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,067
The hostages were saved,
we've captured or killed

274
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,234
all the terrorists.

275
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:31,301
Not all of them.

276
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:32,533
One of the terrorists was

277
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,700
posing as a hostage.

278
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,401
He used the hostage crisis

279
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:37,267
to cover a theft.
A theft?

280
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,368
What was stolen?

281
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,434
A cache of chemical weapons.

282
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,800
What kind of chemical weapons?

283
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:45,301
Nerve gas.

284
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,600
Is it ours?

285
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,767
No, sir.

286
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:53,301
CTU is still trying
to source it.

287
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:54,301
But it was buried

288
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:55,767
in a bunker at the airport.

289
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:57,001
It seems this man

290
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,533
had another crew
waiting for him there.

291
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,434
Do we have any idea what
the terrorists are planning?

292
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,667
Well, they haven't
made any demands

293
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,167
or issued any threats, yet.

294
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:08,767
Well, what are we doing
to stop them?

295
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,201
CTU is running

296
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:11,434
an interagency search effort.

297
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,734
They're coordinating
ground operations,

298
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
filtering intelligence.

299
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:17,401
Has the press found out
about this, yet?

300
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:18,934
No, sir.
It's being kept internal.

301
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,967
Whatever retaliation

302
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,767
we were bracing for an hour ago

303
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,468
is nothing compared to what
these people

304
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,167
are capable of doing now.

305
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:33,500
Sir, I'll assemble
the Homeland Security team

306
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,001
to discuss evacuation scenarios.

307
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:51,301
I sent everyone updates
on the airport forensics.

308
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,767
What did you want me on next?

309
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:54,434
Check the task list.
You don't need to

310
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,134
ask me every time you need

311
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,734
something new to do.

312
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,468
I don't care if
you are my boss

313
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,167
or if you regret sleeping
with me last night.

314
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:04,667
No one talks to me like that.

315
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:05,734
Really?

316
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,900
I just did.

317
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,201
Now, what's your problem?

318
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:37,533
I don't have a problem.

319
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,900
Then what do you want?

320
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:40,967
Nothing.

321
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,834
Edgar.

322
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,633
Look, I'm sorry
that my private life

323
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,267
hasn't remained private today.

324
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,667
I'm thinking the opposite.

325
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:50,034
What do you mean?

326
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:51,167
You're too private.

327
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,201
We've known each other
for years.

328
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,500
And today I find out
you're keeping secrets from me?

329
00:16:55,567 --> 00:16:57,368
Haven't you ever taken
a psychology class?

330
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,334
People keep secrets.

331
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,368
I don't.

332
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:00,900
Not from my friends.

333
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:03,934
Why didn't you tell
me Jack was alive?

334
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:04,934
Oh, come on.

335
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:06,900
It's called national security.

336
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,934
Yeah, well, what about Spenser?

337
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,734
I didn't even know you
two were going out.

338
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,700
Give me a break.

339
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,767
Okay, when we find the nerve gas
and the alert level drops,

340
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,101
we can have some chamomile tea

341
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,900
and I'll tell you
all my secrets, okay?

342
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:31,934
You paged me.

343
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,734
Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

344
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,234
No, not yet.

345
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,234
When he does, I need you
to do something.

346
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:40,301
We have our hands full
searching for the nerve gas.

347
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:42,067
Bauer is a priority.

348
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:45,234
I need you to clear
an entrance into CTU.

349
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm sending it now.

350
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,867
Okay.

351
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,101
Miss Raines.

352
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,468
I'll get back to you. Yes?

353
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,767
I take it you're up to
speed on the nerve gas

354
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,767
stolen from the airport.
I was just filling in DOD.

355
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,434
Diane Huxley and her son were
brought in to be debriefed.

356
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,734
I'd like you to interview her.

357
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,967
Interview her about what?

358
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,201
Any information she has

359
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:03,800
that could help us
find the nerve gas.

360
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,334
What could she possibly
know about that?

361
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,334
I've reviewed the evidence
against Jack Bauer,

362
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,067
and I'm inclined to agree
with your assessment

363
00:18:10,134 --> 00:18:12,434
that he was framed for the
assassination of David Palmer.

364
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,934
Thank you.

365
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,167
I also think that whoever
framed Jack is also involved

366
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:17,667
with the theft of
this nerve gas.

367
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:19,201
Which means that Diane Huxley

368
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:21,234
could have had contact with that
person without realizing it.

369
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,468
I- I'm not
a trained interrogator.

370
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,368
But you know Jack Bauer
better than anyone else in here.

371
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:30,468
You have something in
common with this woman.

372
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,134
It might help her open up.

373
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:35,201
I realize it's awkward,
but I need you to do it.

374
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,034
Fine.

375
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,267
I'll see what
I can get from her.

376
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:44,468
Thank you.

377
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,101
Where is she?

378
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,700
She and her son just
cleared security.

379
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,401
Miss Huxley, I'm Audrey Raines.

380
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:01,334
Hi.
Hello.

381
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,600
This is my son, Derek.

382
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,667
Hi. I'm gonna be asking you
a few qutions.

383
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:06,167
And Derek, I want you

384
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:08,767
to be checked out by a doctor
while I speak with your mother.

385
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,001
There's nothing wrong with me.

386
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,234
It's just procedure.

387
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,667
When you're done,
you and I will speak.

388
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,800
Can you take him
to medical, please?

389
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:17,600
It's okay,
I'll see you in a bit.

390
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,167
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

391
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:27,301
Is Jack gonna be here soon?

392
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,101
He's on his way in.

393
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,167
Come with me.

394
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,134
I had no idea he worked
in a place like this.

395
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:37,834
It's just up these stairs.

396
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,201
Did you know him before?

397
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,800
Yes.

398
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:45,034
I knew him.

399
00:20:08,134 --> 00:20:11,001
A lot of people here thought
you were dead until today.

400
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:12,500
Yeah, I know.

401
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,034
Excuse me.

402
00:20:15,101 --> 00:20:16,067
Chloe.

403
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,867
Hi, Jack.

404
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:19,967
You all right?

405
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,734
Yeah, I'm okay.
We wouldn't have made it

406
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,067
out of that airport

407
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:24,201
without your help.

408
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:25,400
Thank you.

409
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:26,467
You're welcome.

410
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:29,334
Mr. Bauer, Lynn McGill
from division.

411
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Mara, I'll assume custody
at this point, thank you.

412
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:34,234
You're no longer a suspect

413
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,967
in President Palmer's murder,
but while you're here,

414
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,734
you will need this.

415
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,400
It'll give you level
two clearance. Thank you.

416
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:41,167
Was Agent Manning able
to apprehend the suspect?

417
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,334
No.

418
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,934
It seems the person
you identified

419
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:45,700
used the hostage
situation as a cover

420
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:48,101
to steal a cache of weaponized
nerve gas from the airport.

421
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,934
Nerve gas? How do
you know that?

422
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:52,600
McGILL: Following your lead, Curtis
found trace amounts in a hangar

423
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:54,067
adjacent to the terminal.
We don't know

424
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:56,034
how much there is and
where it came from,

425
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:57,734
but it is a military grade
chemical weapon.

426
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,268
Do you have any leads?

427
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,167
Not yet, but we're gonna run
the search operation from here.

428
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,034
You're not gonna be able
to track these terrorists

429
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:04,467
fast enough with a standard
search operation.

430
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,734
The only way you're gonna
get that nerve gas in time

431
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,467
is if you find out who ordered
the hit on David Palmer.

432
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,734
I agree.

433
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,634
I think Palmer was about
to expose this plot.

434
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,234
I think that's
why he was killed.

435
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:15,800
I also think that if you can

436
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,368
help us identify
who framed you,

437
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,567
we can intercept this nerve gas
while there's still time.

438
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:20,634
Hello, Jack.

439
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,934
Hey, Bill.

440
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:23,567
President's been informed
of the nerve gas.

441
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:24,567
He wants to ensure

442
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,268
the media doesn't find out.

443
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,867
Well, make sure Division
restricts information flow.

444
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:32,433
We'll continue this
conversation when I'm done.

445
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,867
Good to see you
again, Jack.

446
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:38,500
It's good to see you,
too, Bill.

447
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,134
I'm so sorry
about Michelle.

448
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,834
I never meant
to put her in jeopardy.

449
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,433
Of course, you didn't.

450
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,268
How's Tony doing?

451
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:48,967
He's still
unconscious,

452
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:51,001
but the doctor says he's
going to pull through.

453
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:53,001
Good.

454
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:55,334
We're gonna need to speak to him
as soon as possible.

455
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,467
They know to call us.

456
00:21:58,533 --> 00:21:59,834
Jack...

457
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,734
Audrey has been
working for us.

458
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,467
She's here in the building now?

459
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,433
She's debriefing Diane Huxley.

460
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,800
Why is she talking to Diane?

461
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,234
Lynn asked her to.

462
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:17,368
I'm not used to
calling him Jack.

463
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:19,334
He said his name
was Frank Flynn.

464
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,600
I thought he worked
for the oil company.

465
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,767
You probably know more
about him than I do.

466
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:28,667
We all thought he was dead
for the last year and a half.

467
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,767
So what do you want to know?

468
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,301
You said that Jack was living
with you for the last...

469
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:34,567
six months,
is that correct?

470
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,001
He was renting a room.

471
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:41,001
So, you don't have a personal
relationship with him?

472
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:45,067
I'm not sure that's any
of your business.

473
00:22:45,134 --> 00:22:46,834
I'm sorry, I just...
I need to know

474
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,234
how close you and Jack were,

475
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:52,400
whether he confided
in you or not.

476
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:54,901
Jack's a private person.

477
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,767
I always knew he was
keeping something from me.

478
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,268
I just never
pushed it.

479
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,433
I accepted him for who he was.

480
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,734
Ms. Raines...

481
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,301
whoever he was before...

482
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:13,967
it doesn't change
the way I feel about him.

483
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:19,001
He was good to me,
he was good to my son.

484
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:22,700
He meant a lot to us.

485
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,734
He still does.

486
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,167
I see.

487
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:34,334
Did anyone ever come by
and ask about Jack?

488
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,467
What do you mean?

489
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:38,368
Someone knew
that Jack was alive.

490
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,134
It's critical
to our investigation

491
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:41,901
that we find out who that was.

492
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:45,101
No. No one asked about him.

493
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:48,268
No one ever came
to see him.

494
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:11,433
Can you excuse me
for a minute, please?

495
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,301
Yeah.

496
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:20,234
Jack.

497
00:24:26,067 --> 00:24:28,967
I don't even know
where to begin.

498
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,001
You have to believe me.

499
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,800
I couldn't tell you
I was still alive.

500
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,467
Jack, you don't need
to apologize.

501
00:24:36,533 --> 00:24:38,533
I did it for your
own protection.

502
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,800
It's been hard for me,
thinking you died,

503
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:45,001
believing that I was angry
at you...

504
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,134
that I hated you.

505
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,934
I wasn't able
to forgive myself for that.

506
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:53,700
You had every
reason to hate me.

507
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,201
I was responsible
for Paul's death.

508
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:57,034
I lied to you.
Jack.

509
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:02,067
You made a hard decision.

510
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:12,368
I never imagined I'd get
another chance to tell you this.

511
00:25:14,767 --> 00:25:19,734
But I want...

512
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,433
I want you to know
that I don't blame you

513
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,767
for what happened with Paul.

514
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,600
Thank you.

515
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,467
Jack...

516
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,500
There's so much that I want
to say to you, I know its...

517
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,800
Mr. Bauer.

518
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,467
Mr. Buchanan needs
to see you.

519
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:41,901
I'll be right down.

520
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,734
I should go.

521
00:25:58,134 --> 00:26:00,500
Evelyn, is Mrs. Logan
still asleep?

522
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:03,867
Yes, she's finally
getting some rest.

523
00:26:03,934 --> 00:26:05,268
Good.

524
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:07,268
You should probably start
gathering some of her things.

525
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:09,901
I thought the president
was staying through the weekend.

526
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:13,334
He is... but she'll be
leaving today.

527
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,700
Where's she going?

528
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:18,001
Just make sure
she has the essentials

529
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,433
to make her trip comfortable.

530
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,934
Yes, sir.

531
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:48,734
Edgar said he saw you
come in here.

532
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,834
What are you doing?

533
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,001
Setting up a new socket.

534
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,268
We're overloaded
from the NSA database.

535
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:56,234
Why are you here?

536
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,734
Looking for you.

537
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,034
What for?

538
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:01,867
I need to get into
your utilities volume.

539
00:27:01,934 --> 00:27:03,700
Why didn't you message me?

540
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,134
Okay, I wanted
to say something, too.

541
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:06,967
Let's not make a big drama
out of it.

542
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:08,667
What?

543
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:14,368
I was unfairly harsh to you
a few minutes ago.

544
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:15,700
I didn't mean anything.

545
00:27:17,901 --> 00:27:19,201
All right.

546
00:27:19,268 --> 00:27:21,001
Apology accepted.

547
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,400
It wasn't really
an apology,

548
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:24,667
it was more of
an observation.

549
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:26,334
I mean, the fact...

550
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,167
Spenser.

551
00:27:31,034 --> 00:27:34,467
Damn it, why do I do that?

552
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,368
It's Chloe.

553
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,634
What is it?

554
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,567
I need to know
Spenser's clearance level?

555
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,067
Why are you asking?

556
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:10,867
Spenser works for me, and I need
to know his clearance level,

557
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,934
so could you please
open the header file

558
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:14,167
and give it to me, Edgar?

559
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,268
Fine.

560
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,268
Level three.

561
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,734
Chloe?

562
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,167
Call Buchanan, tell him
I need to talk to him now.

563
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:28,600
It's important.

564
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:34,500
Division sent me.

565
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:39,001
One of your mainframe
servers is cycling slow.

566
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:40,368
You're not on the manifest.

567
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:42,034
I was told it'd
be taken care of.

568
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:45,734
I'm going to have to clear this
with the systems administrator.

569
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:48,234
Are you Hank,

570
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:49,167
from on-site support?
Yeah.

571
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,368
My fault.

572
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:52,101
I was supposed to advance him

573
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,101
an emergency clearance. All right.

574
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,467
Place the bag
on the conveyor belt,

575
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,800
and walk right through, sir.

576
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:17,533
All clear.

577
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,734
Thank you.
Thank you.

578
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,867
Thank you.

579
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:22,268
I'll show you the way.

580
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,034
Mr. Cummings told me
it would be best

581
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,334
to keep you off the manifest.

582
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:31,467
Classified material
generally runs

583
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,967
on servers nine
and twelve.

584
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:35,433
All the information you need
on Bauer should be there.

585
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,567
I don't know what
files Mr. Cummings

586
00:29:40,634 --> 00:29:41,800
asked you to download,

587
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,700
but you need to keep vector
counts the same,

588
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:45,134
or it'll get flagged.

589
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,667
I got it.

590
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,800
Okay.

591
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,533
I need to get back
to my station.

592
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,534
Evelyn, what are you doing?

593
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,567
Mrs. Logan,
are you feeling better?

594
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,267
Why are you
packing my things?

595
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,634
Walt Cummings asked me to.

596
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:53,134
Why?

597
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,667
Where are we going?

598
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:57,467
I don't know if the president's
going with you.

599
00:30:57,534 --> 00:31:00,801
Evelyn, stop. What's going on?

600
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,200
They just asked me
to get you ready to leave.

601
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:15,000
They're sending me to Vermont,
aren't they?

602
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,134
Charles is having me committed.

603
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,033
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Logan.

604
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
I honestly don't know
anything else.

605
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:33,501
It's fine.

606
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,701
I'll getting dressed.

607
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,501
Edgar, my FGA is locked.

608
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:02,701
Where's Chloe?

609
00:32:02,768 --> 00:32:03,734
How should I know?

610
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,601
Can you unlock this?

611
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,000
No.

612
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:12,868
Mr. Wolff?

613
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:15,234
Please come with us.

614
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,067
What do you want?

615
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:19,933
Mr. Buchanan has ordered us
to take you to him immediately.

616
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,134
I'm in the middle
of a critical task here.

617
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,434
Mr. Stiles

618
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,900
has been authorized
to take over your work load.

619
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:28,200
Did you know about this, Edgar?

620
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:31,667
Yeah. I just got the bulletin.

621
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:33,334
Sorry.

622
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,167
Mr. Wolff.

623
00:32:35,234 --> 00:32:36,234
Please.

624
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,234
I'm coming.

625
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:58,768
Chloe?

626
00:32:58,834 --> 00:32:59,601
Sir.

627
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,033
What is going on here?

628
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,434
Sit down, Spenser.

629
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:12,033
You've been
burrowing

630
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,601
into classified CTU protocols

631
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,868
without authorization.

632
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,967
I don't know
what you're talking about.

633
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:19,434
Stop- I know you were logged
onto the security subsystem,

634
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:20,933
where you had
no right to be.

635
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,967
We're going through
your system

636
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,367
so you might as well
tell us now

637
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,300
what you were doing.

638
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:25,501
I told you I was opening...

639
00:33:25,567 --> 00:33:27,134
That's enough!

640
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:31,234
You've accessed files
outside your clearance level

641
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,667
at least 18 times in the
four months you've been here.

642
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:36,900
Sir, whatever you think
you've found,

643
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:38,900
it's a mistake.

644
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,634
I've done nothing wrong.

645
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,334
Come on, Spenser,
you obviously have

646
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:43,234
your own agenda
here.

647
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,601
I don't have an "agenda."

648
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,900
And while you're at it,
why don't you explain

649
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:46,834
why it was necessary
to crawl into my bed.

650
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,967
Which certainly
wasn't

651
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:48,768
what it appeared to be,

652
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:49,834
just like your work here

653
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,434
isn't what
it appears to be!

654
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,501
Chloe, Chloe.

655
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,534
Chloe, let me
handle this, please.

656
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,300
Sir, obviously you can't take

657
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:01,367
anything she says
into consideration.

658
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:03,267
I was careless.

659
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:04,933
And, inadvertently,

660
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,434
I caused her
some emotional pain.

661
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:08,134
Oh, please.

662
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,567
And now she's trying
to get back at me.

663
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:11,768
I don't think so, Spenser.

664
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,667
Sir, I'd like
to talk to a lawyer.

665
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:15,134
Forget about a lawyer!

666
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,768
We're in the middle
of a terrorist crisis

667
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:18,933
There are lives
on the line.

668
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,267
You're going to tell us

669
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,667
what you've been
doing here,

670
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:22,967
and you're going
to tell us now.

671
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,134
I hope this goes better

672
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,267
than when I sent her
up there the last time.

673
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:34,967
Dr. Hill and his staff
are on standby

674
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:35,967
if she overreacts.

675
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm not looking forward
to this.

676
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:38,868
Evelyn?

677
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:39,834
Mr. President.

678
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,067
Where is she?

679
00:34:41,134 --> 00:34:42,601
She's in the bathroom, sir.

680
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:47,601
Martha?

681
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:52,534
Marty?

682
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,501
Are you sure she's in there?

683
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,000
Yes, sir.
She's getting dressed.

684
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,667
Marty?

685
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,933
Aaron?

686
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,701
My wife is gone.

687
00:35:27,467 --> 00:35:28,334
This is Pierce.

688
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:30,267
We have a priority alert.

689
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,734
The First Lady has left her
quarters and is unaccounted for.

690
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:35,834
All agents in the main wing,
move to points north and west.

691
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,200
Anyone spotting her,
check in immediately.

692
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:55,668
So the only people
who knew you were alive

693
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:56,833
were David Palmer,
Tony Almeida,

694
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,367
Michelle Dessler
and Chloe O'Brian.

695
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:00,501
Yeah, and at least one other
person who killed David Palmer

696
00:36:00,568 --> 00:36:01,967
and tried
to frame me for it.

697
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,634
And you don't know who that
other person might be?

698
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,634
No.

699
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
Any theories?

700
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:11,534
About a year and a half ago,
David Palmer called me.

701
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:12,700
Told me there's someone
in Logan's administration

702
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:13,900
targeting me.

703
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,401
Which is why you faked
your own death

704
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,434
and assumed a new identity?

705
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:19,700
Yeah, except it didn't work.

706
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:23,000
I believe that whoever tried
to kill me 18 months ago

707
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:25,067
somehow found out
I was still alive,

708
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:27,401
and waited until today
to exploit that information.

709
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:29,900
Someone inside President
Logan's administration?

710
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:33,134
That's what David Palmer told me
a year and a half ago,

711
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:34,367
and I believe him.

712
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,767
Well, first of all,
that would mean

713
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,134
someone in this
administration is also tied

714
00:36:37,201 --> 00:36:38,934
to the theft
of the nerve gas.

715
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,434
Yeah. You're going
to have to look into that.

716
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,234
Well, even if you're right,

717
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,967
there are hundreds of people
in Logan's administration.

718
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:46,833
It would take an investigation
of that magnitude months

719
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,934
to gain any
traction-

720
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,501
and we don't have
months to work with.

721
00:36:49,568 --> 00:36:50,767
WOMAN
I'm sorry to interrupt,

722
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,601
but Dr. Paulson is calling
from medical.

723
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,534
Put him through.

724
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:55,434
DR. PAULSON
Mr. McGill?

725
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:56,601
Yes?

726
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:57,700
Tony Almeida's regained
consciousness

727
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,234
and is in recovery.

728
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,234
Can he talk?

729
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,201
Yes. He's very weak,

730
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:03,700
you'll have to be brief.

731
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,100
Let him know I'll be down
in a few minutes.

732
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:08,367
Tony asked if be could
speak to Jack Bauer first.

733
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,301
He says it's important.

734
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:11,434
He's a friend of mine.

735
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:15,234
Tell Mr. Almeida that Jack
will be down in few moments.

736
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:16,234
I'll let him know.

737
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,034
Thank you.

738
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,067
I'll be right back.

739
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:27,934
Jack.

740
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,034
What's going on?

741
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,467
I know
you're busy.

742
00:37:30,534 --> 00:37:31,634
I...

743
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,833
I just wanted to apologize.

744
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,967
You have nothing
to apologize for.

745
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:36,568
Yes, I do.

746
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:38,100
I thought you were
just another loser,

747
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:41,434
trying to take advantage
of my mom.

748
00:37:42,534 --> 00:37:43,534
I was wrong.

749
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:47,434
You were trying
to protect her.

750
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:49,601
Your mother is lucky
to have someone

751
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,134
who loves her
as much as you do.

752
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,201
As soon as this is over,
I promise you,

753
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:55,301
you and I are going
to get a chance

754
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:56,267
to sit down and talk.

755
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,601
But right now
I have to go.

756
00:37:57,668 --> 00:37:58,501
Yeah.

757
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,767
Take care of your mother.

758
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,134
Who gave you the Level Five
authorization?

759
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:15,568
Don't look at me.
Answer him!

760
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,900
I can't.

761
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,800
I can't talk to anyone here
about this.

762
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,800
Whatever you were doing
is over, Spenser.

763
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,501
Sir, I was able

764
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:27,501
to pull Spenser's screen
activity from the archive.

765
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:29,367
This is what he was looking at
ten minutes ago.

766
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,867
Looks like he was using

767
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,467
in-house surveillance
to track someone

768
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:35,334
through CTU.

769
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:37,800
Why are you

770
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,334
tracking Jack Bauer?
What the hell's going

771
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,867
on here, Spenser? I
was following orders.

772
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,900
I'm sure if they're tracking
Jack Bauer, they have a reason.

773
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,201
Who is they?

774
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,833
I won't say anything else.

775
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,000
Chloe, find security,
have them locate Jack now.

776
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:08,700
Dr. Paulson?

777
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,534
Yes.

778
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,800
I'm Jack Bauer.

779
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,301
Tony Almeida wanted
to speak with me.

780
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:14,534
Oh, of course, Mr. Bauer.

781
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,767
Just remember
to please keep it brief.

782
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,900
Thank you, sir.

783
00:39:25,201 --> 00:39:27,000
Tony.

784
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:29,201
Tony, it's Jack.

785
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:31,967
Jack,

786
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:34,267
you all right?

787
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:35,534
I think he cracked my rib.

788
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:36,900
I've been trying
to reach you,

789
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,501
but the lines
were locked out.

790
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:39,700
What happened?
Who is he?

791
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't know,

792
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:42,434
but he's a professional.

793
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:43,934
He killed Dr. Paulson,
then he tried to kill me.

794
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You have any idea
how he got into CTU?

795
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,334
We identified a mole working
in Chloe's department.

796
00:40:48,401 --> 00:40:49,601
Who?

797
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:51,100
Spenser Wolff.

798
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:52,800
We've been interrogating him,
but he hasn't talked yet.

799
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,234
Where is he?
Holding.

800
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:56,867
Get a doctor down here
to monitor Tony Almeida now.

801
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,568
Lock this room down.

802
00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:01,367
Contact Lynn McGill,
have him meet me in Holding.

803
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,534
Bring up visual surveillance
on Medical Room Two.

804
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:24,634
Open the door.

805
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:35,367
Get up!

806
00:41:38,034 --> 00:41:39,967
Did you let that man into CTU?

807
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,800
This man
is a professional assassin.

808
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,134
He just killed Dr. Paulson,

809
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,301
and he tried to kill me.

810
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,367
Did you let him into CTU?

811
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:46,700
No. They told me he was here

812
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:48,634
to place a tap
on one of the servers.

813
00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:50,601
That's all I knew.
Who told you?

814
00:41:50,668 --> 00:41:52,867
I was here as part
of an Internal Affairs

815
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:56,034
investigation.

816
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Are you starting to understand
how much trouble you are in?

817
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,934
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

818
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,234
Who told you
to let that man into CTU?

819
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:05,534
The White House.

820
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:07,601
Mr. Cummings

821
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:08,833
in the White
House.

822
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,267
Cummings recruited me

823
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:11,501
after I started working here.

824
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:12,867
He said that

825
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:15,067
they wanted to make
sure CTU was operating...

826
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:17,301
within the rules.

827
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:21,301
You have to believe me.

828
00:42:23,134 --> 00:42:25,900
I thought
I was serving the President.

829
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:29,934
Yeah. Take him back
to Holding.

830
00:42:36,134 --> 00:42:37,401
Walt Cummings

831
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:38,867
killed David
Palmer, and he tried

832
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:40,234
to have me killed.

833
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:42,301
Even if it is true,
we have to build a case

834
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:43,434
before we call
the President.

835
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:44,767
We don't call the President.

836
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,700
He's here in California.
We go see him now.

837
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,634
Cummings is the President's
Chief of Staff, Jack.

838
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,000
And his friend.

839
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,234
Without any hard evidence,
CTU can't touch him.

840
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:54,301
I'm not CTU.

841
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:58,334
I'll go get Walt Cummings
myself.
