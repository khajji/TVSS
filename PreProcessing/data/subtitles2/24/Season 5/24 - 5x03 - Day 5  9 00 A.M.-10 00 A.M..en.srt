1
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:14,833
Now, why would David
Palmer call my wife

2
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,034
about a national
security threat?

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,601
Can't risk having Mrs. Logan
obsess about this phone call.

4
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,401
David Palmer
called her yesterday.

5
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,067
Our communications office
will have a recording

6
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:24,267
of their conversation.

7
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,700
Get that for me.

8
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,733
You don't need to be concerned
that there's any connection

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,034
between David's death

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,967
and the phone call
he made to you.

11
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:33,800
He said it was a matter
of national security.

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,267
Those were
his exact words.

13
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:39,700
Martha, it's David Palmer.

14
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,601
I need to talk to you.

15
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:43,401
It's hardly a matter
of national security...

16
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:45,100
No, that's not what he said.

17
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,100
That is not
what he said!

18
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,201
Yes, it is.

19
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:50,534
CUMMINGS:
I have dealt with
the Martha Logan situation.

20
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,000
I was able to alter
the tape of the phone call

21
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:53,401
before the president heard it.

22
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,967
There's no longer any evidence

23
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:58,167
on my end that Palmer was trying
to warn her about the attack.

24
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:59,800
Sir, it's Edgar.
I think we can find Chloe.

25
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:01,601
She's accessing our system
through a laptop.

26
00:01:01,668 --> 00:01:03,167
I'm running a locate now.

27
00:01:03,234 --> 00:01:06,167
What'd you get for me
on Chevensky?

28
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,434
He's a baggage supervisor
at the airport.

29
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,000
Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian!

30
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:13,568
We know you're down here!

31
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:15,733
( tires squealing )

32
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:20,867
JENNINGS:
Don't fire!

33
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:24,000
Do not fire!

34
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,401
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

35
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:27,767
Jack didn't kill anybody.

36
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,733
He's being framed
to cover up the real reason

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,733
Palmer was assassinated.

38
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,501
Where is he?

39
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,867
I can't tell you.

40
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:33,501
Where can I find the
baggage claim supervisor?

41
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:34,700
Down that hall
to the left.

42
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:38,867
Chevensky!

43
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:40,434
Why was President
Palmer killed?

44
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,434
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,601
You are going to tell me
what I want to know.

46
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,434
It's just a question
of how much you want it to hurt.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,401
Mom, do you see those men?

48
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,000
I have to tell Jack.

49
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,167
Derek, where
are you going?

50
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,334
Come back here!

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,668
( gasps )

52
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,067
No!

53
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:10,467
Quiet!

54
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:12,634
Quiet!

55
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,067
You will not be harmed

56
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:18,134
as long as
your president

57
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,568
complies with our wishes!

58
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:28,934
( sirens wailing )

59
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:40,934
We have a critical
incident in progress!

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,134
I want a facility lock down
and a code five evac, right now!

61
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,634
Clear the area! Ma'am...
Officer...

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,800
Officer, my son
is in there.

63
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm sorry, ma'am.
We're evacuating the area.

64
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:50,833
Follow these people.
Ma'am!

65
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,267
Grab her!

66
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,067
I have to get my son!

67
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,067
( crying )

68
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,934
Sorry, lady.

69
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:01,067
I'm sorry,
you can't stay.

70
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,034
I have information
for CTU!

71
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,067
Please!

72
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,867
My son!

73
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,700
BERESCH:
Everyone, quiet!

74
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:10,134
Quiet!

75
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:38,067
If you cooperate,
you have a chance

76
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,833
of leaving this building alive.

77
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,401
If not, you will die.

78
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:45,134
Do you understand?

79
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,668
Take out all cell phones
and pagers

80
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,501
and drop them
on the floor.

81
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:00,568
( boy crying )

82
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:03,234
We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay...

83
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:04,668
Bring them in.

84
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:05,767
GUNMAN 1:
Everyone up.
Move it.

85
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,134
GUNMAN 2:
Let's go!

86
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,534
GUNMAN 3:
Chevensky?

87
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:19,601
Chevensky?

88
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,401
( phone rings )

89
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,700
Yeah.

90
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:30,767
Well?

91
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,867
Chevensky's not here.

92
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:34,467
We have to find him.
Keep searching.

93
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:35,501
( line disconnects )

94
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:36,934
( sirens wailing outside )

95
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,267
( garbled radio transmission )

96
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,401
( phone rings )

97
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,700
McClaren.

98
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,000
BERESCH:
Listen very carefully.

99
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,467
We have hostages.

100
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,134
If you wish to keep them alive,

101
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,501
you'll make no attempt
to re-enter the terminal.

102
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:12,034
I'm listening.

103
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,201
We are wearing
explosive vests.

104
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,267
We are prepared
to detonate ourselves

105
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:18,668
along with our captives.

106
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,234
If you make any efforts
to enter the terminal,

107
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,100
you will spend
the rest of the day

108
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,334
collecting body parts.

109
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,967
Hello?

110
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,401
Set up a security perimeter.

111
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:36,367
We'll operate from the northwest
apron behind hangar 12

112
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:38,534
and get those fire trucks
out of here!

113
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:40,034
Everybody out!

114
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,634
Claremont, grab that woman
in the yellow next to Bailey.

115
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,267
Bring her up here. Quick!

116
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,601
All right.

117
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:11,100
Yeah. Thank you.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,301
Bill, I just spoke to the
director of Secret Service.

119
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:16,867
Now that Suvarov
has arrived safely,

120
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,934
they're lowering their
security level by one.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,367
I think we should
do the same.

122
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:23,234
I'll take our Tac Teams
off standby.

123
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,767
Have we heard back
from our unit

124
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,867
that was sent out
to the refinery?

125
00:06:25,934 --> 00:06:27,301
Yeah. At least that part

126
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,900
of Chloe's story
checked out.

127
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,434
So it's possible that Jack
was set up

128
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,401
in Palmer's assassination.
We can't assume too much.

129
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,267
Jack still has
a lot to answer for.

130
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:36,201
( phone rings )

131
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,967
Buchanan.

132
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:40,067
MAN:
Mr. Buchanan, I've got
Jack Bauer on the line.

133
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,401
Put it through.

134
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:46,568
Bill, put it
on speaker phone.

135
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,234
Please.

136
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:54,234
Jack, it's Bill.

137
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:55,767
Bill, I'm in Ontario Airport.

138
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,568
Gunman have just attacked
and taken over Terminal One.

139
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,867
They are carrying automatic
weapons and they have hostages.

140
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,668
We haven't received
any alerts.

141
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,501
Trust me. You will.

142
00:07:03,568 --> 00:07:05,501
What are you doing
at the airport, Jack?

143
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,100
I was following up
a lead.

144
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,234
President Palmer knew
of the planned attack.

145
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,634
I believe that's why
he was assassinated.

146
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,000
We just received
an interagency flash.

147
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,967
There's been an attack
on Ontario Airport.

148
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,634
First reports are of
several men carrying
automatic weapons

149
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,833
and they've taken control
of Terminal One.

150
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,534
Go to alert level four.

151
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,034
Launch all available
Tac Teams.

152
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,234
Curtis is
in the air.

153
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,467
Redirect him to the airport.

154
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,000
Have him maintain
operational control

155
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,467
the moment he's on site.

156
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:28,733
Right.

157
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,134
Jack, we just
received confirmation

158
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,334
of the situation.

159
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:32,934
I want you out of there
now, Jack.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,134
Turn yourself in.

161
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:35,767
Let our people handle this.

162
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,467
Understand this, Bill.

163
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:39,367
I don't work for you.

164
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:40,534
I'm staying inside.

165
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:43,334
You want my intel, fine.

166
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:51,534
How many hostiles are there?

167
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,601
Approximately 15 to 20.

168
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:54,800
What's your situation?

169
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,034
Gunmen have locked down
the terminal.

170
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,733
Heads down!

171
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,301
I'm going to be sending
you photos of the hostiles.

172
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:00,767
They should be clear enough
that you can identify them.

173
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,867
Hold on.

174
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,134
Okay, they're transmitting.

175
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:09,167
All right, Jack.

176
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,401
We'll pull a schematic
of the airport

177
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,601
and forward it
to your cell.

178
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:13,501
Bill, hold on.
One more thing.

179
00:08:13,568 --> 00:08:14,833
A woman is going to contact you.

180
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,167
Her name is Diane Huxley.

181
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,867
I sent her and her son
to CTU for protection.

182
00:08:17,934 --> 00:08:19,467
Who are they?

183
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,134
I don't have time to explain,
but I'm responsible for them.

184
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,700
Just make sure
they're safe, okay?

185
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:25,401
We'll take care of them, Jack.

186
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:26,467
Thank you.

187
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:28,700
I'll be standing by.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,467
We have to alert
the president.

189
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:33,201
Right.

190
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,900
I'd like to personally
extend my condolences

191
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:00,467
on the loss your country
has suffered today.

192
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:02,301
Thank you, Mr. President.

193
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,833
I hope that what you and
I accomplish here today

194
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,267
will serve as
a fitting tribute

195
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:07,501
to David Palmer's legacy.

196
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:09,467
I can't imagine anything
more appropriate

197
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:13,067
than the two of us establishing
a... a comprehensive

198
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:17,067
antiterrorism alliance
between our nations.

199
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,767
If you would excuse me
for a moment, Mr. President.

200
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,967
Of course.

201
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,634
What's up, Mike?

202
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,000
Terrorists are controlling
the main terminal

203
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,634
of Ontario Airport
in Los Angeles.

204
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,800
Terrorists?!

205
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,568
Yes, sir. There are
eyewitness reports

206
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,067
of two casualties

207
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:42,501
and they've taken
hostages.

208
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:45,334
Who are they?

209
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:46,601
Unclear.

210
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:48,534
CTU Los Angeles is prepping
a briefing.

211
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:52,434
Mr. President.

212
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,867
I suggest we move
to the Situation Room.

213
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,167
Now?!

214
00:09:55,234 --> 00:09:56,867
CTU thinks this
may be related

215
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,700
to the summit.

216
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,434
Related in what way?

217
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,800
I don't know, sir,

218
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,767
but we'll find out
during the briefing.

219
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,967
Sir?

220
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,201
We should go.

221
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,100
Of course.

222
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:21,900
Mr. President, as you've
probably been made aware,

223
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:24,568
a situation
has developed

224
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,534
that requires
my immediate attention.

225
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:29,401
I have just been informed.

226
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,367
This is terrible
news, indeed.

227
00:10:31,434 --> 00:10:33,034
Please let me know if there
is anything I can do.

228
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,967
I will. Thank you, sir.

229
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,900
That's all for now,
ladies and gentlemen.

230
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,334
Spencer?

231
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:40,467
Pulling the ground plan

232
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:41,967
of the terminal
off the NTSB server

233
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:43,434
and sending it
to Jack Bauer now.

234
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:44,534
Good. Edgar.

235
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:45,800
Were you able to identify

236
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:47,234
the terrorists
from the photos Jack sent?

237
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:49,067
Still no matches
on the watch list.

238
00:10:49,134 --> 00:10:50,833
I tried three different
encoding arrays.

239
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,234
Did you try widening
the parameters?

240
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:54,134
If it was any wider, we
could use the phone book.

241
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:55,534
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on a second.

242
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,534
Try using NP-safe
adaptive search.

243
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:58,668
You okay?

244
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,934
Thanks for asking, Edgar.

245
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:03,534
Chloe...

246
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,900
you managed to rack up
four protocol violations.

247
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,100
Well, it's a lot worse
than that if you count
agency doc codes.

248
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,568
It's more like
26 violations.

249
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:15,334
Do you want me to figure
out whose face that is?

250
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:18,034
Or I could just go
wait in holding.

251
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,501
See what you can do.

252
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,733
Did it work?
We got something.

253
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,434
It's off an archive from
the Bureau of Consular Affairs.

254
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:28,434
Anton Beresch,
a former army officer

255
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,467
in one of the Russian
breakaway republics.

256
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,334
BUCHANAN:
Which means this definitely
has something

257
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,733
to do with the summit.

258
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,234
I'll data-mine
the interagency servers,

259
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:36,967
see what I can come up with.

260
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:39,467
DOD is receiving a localized
broadcast from the airport.

261
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:41,467
The networks are also
picking it up.

262
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,334
Spenser, put it on screen.

263
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:48,634
...citizens
of the United States,

264
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,100
today your president
and the president of Russia

265
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,767
have come together to sign
what they have called

266
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,934
an "historical accord,"

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,501
an "antiterrorism alliance."

268
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,067
BERESCH:
Your leaders claim
it will bring peace

269
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:05,700
and security
to their respective countries.

270
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,568
As you'll soon learn, it'll
accomplish exactly the opposite.

271
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,634
I have hostages.

272
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,934
Unless President Logan

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,100
and President Suvarov
make a joint statement

274
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,733
repudiating this accord,

275
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,668
I will order their execution.

276
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,668
You have exactly 90 minutes.

277
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,967
We have to get this lunatic
off the air.

278
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:43,067
Sir, we can contact
the networks,

279
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:45,034
but they're under
no legal obligation

280
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,034
to comply.

281
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,900
BERESCH:
We take these actions

282
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,501
with the full knowledge
that we will be called butchers,

283
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:55,067
but we are only responding
to the violence that has been

284
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:58,401
inflicted upon our own
sons and daughters.

285
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:03,034
Until we as a people
achieve our own due--

286
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,767
national sovereignty--
terror will be met with terror.

287
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,700
NEWSMAN:
That was a live feed

288
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,267
from the Ontario Airport
in Southern California.

289
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:16,700
As we just heard,

290
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,867
the terrorists are demanding
that President Logan

291
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:21,100
repudiate
the antiterrorism accord.

292
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,733
This is insane.

293
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,800
How did these people
get control of an
entire airport?!

294
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:29,100
We've been preparing
for this summit for 16 months!

295
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,367
Every news agency in the world
is here!

296
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:33,833
I-I've staked my entire

297
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,700
administration on this day,
and now these people

298
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:39,668
are demanding that
I go on national television

299
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,733
and publicly repudiate
everything we've done?

300
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,401
Mr. President,
perhaps you should take

301
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:45,634
a few moments...
Mike!

302
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:48,467
I want this handled!

303
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:49,867
Do you understand?

304
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:51,867
I don't care
how you do it,

305
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,267
I don't care what it takes--
fix it!

306
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:26,900
Go ahead.

307
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,301
Curtis, this is Jack.

308
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,434
I'm staring straight down
on the main concourse.

309
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:33,034
I've got six hostiles
wearing explosive vests.

310
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,833
Four of them are staying
near the hostages.

311
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,301
I expect their orders
are to detonate

312
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,434
if we try and make a move;
the other two are roaming.

313
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:41,601
I've got two security doors
on the northeast side

314
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:43,534
of the concourse--
both are chained,

315
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,967
but currently
unguarded.

316
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:47,301
All right, get a recon unit
over to the northeast wall.

317
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,867
All right, Jack,
I'm gonna need you

318
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:50,700
to quarterback this thing
from inside.
Copy that.

319
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,700
Hey, I got a woman,
Diane Huxley,

320
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,401
says she has info for CTU.

321
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:55,967
CURTIS:
Diane Huxley. Who is she?

322
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:57,501
Curtis, did you just say
Diane Huxley?

323
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,034
Yes, I did.
Is she there?

324
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,334
Yeah.
Let me speak to her.

325
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,833
I'll bring her over.

326
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:07,934
Hello?

327
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Diane, what's going on?

328
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,000
What's wrong?

329
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,401
Derek is inside
the terminal.

330
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,867
What are you talking about?
I left him with you.

331
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:17,167
He saw some men;
he wanted to warn you.

332
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:19,967
I tried to go after him.
There was an explosion.

333
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:20,900
Are you sure he

334
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,000
made it all the way inside?

335
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know.

336
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:25,833
Hold on.

337
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,634
Damn it!

338
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,800
I see him.
He's with the other hostages.

339
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,167
But he's not hurt.

340
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,234
Please don't let anything
happen to him.

341
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:02,601
Jack, I can't lose my son.

342
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:04,167
Diane, listen to me.

343
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:08,000
I promise you on my life, I am
gonna get Derek back to you.

344
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,367
Do you understand me?

345
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:10,668
Okay.

346
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,568
Let me speak to Curtis.
Okay.

347
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,034
Jack.
Hey, Curtis, I need
to ask you a favor.

348
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,601
I want you to let
Ms. Huxley

349
00:16:21,668 --> 00:16:23,534
stay with you
at the command post.

350
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:24,534
You got it.

351
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:25,967
I need you to let me know

352
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:27,234
if the hostiles adjust
their profile in any way.

353
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:28,334
Copy that.

354
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,067
I'll get back to you.

355
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,800
Son of a bitch!

356
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,867
His name is Anton Beresch.

357
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:56,934
He's a member
of the Dawn Brigade,

358
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:58,401
a separatist movement blamed

359
00:16:58,468 --> 00:17:00,134
for numerous terrorist bombings
in Russia.

360
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,500
Precisely the kind

361
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,633
of terrorist organization
today's accord

362
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,401
was designed to combat.
Bill, I have no
intention of calling off

363
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:07,600
this signing,
much less making

364
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,967
a public statement
to that effect.

365
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:10,301
So that gives you
less than 90 minutes

366
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:11,600
to rescue the hostages.

367
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,101
We're already operating
under that timetable, sir.

368
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,633
We have a unit
on the ground,

369
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,201
and we're making
an on-site assessment.

370
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,900
Spare the agency patter;
just get it done.

371
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,967
Sir, you need to be aware,

372
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:25,368
we should be prepared to accept
additional civilian casualties.

373
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:26,967
More casualties?

374
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,001
It's a possibility
we have to face, sir.

375
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,301
I'm not prepared to accept
any such thing.

376
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:32,767
Bill, it's your job

377
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:35,267
to make sure those people
get out of there alive.

378
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:37,234
Mr. President, the terrorists
are wearing explosive vests.

379
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:38,334
They've threatened

380
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:40,301
to detonate themselves
and the hostages

381
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:42,800
if any attempt is made
to retake the terminal.

382
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,267
I'm aware of
the situation.

383
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:45,434
Bill, have you tried

384
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,001
initiating a dialogue
with the terrorists?

385
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,700
Yes, what about talking to them?
Have you tried that?

386
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,234
Beresch placed
a call to

387
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:53,234
an Airport Police sergeant--
it was a blocked number,

388
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,001
but we're in the process
of back-tracing it.

389
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,167
Look, whatever you do, just make
sure it's done by the deadline.

390
00:17:57,234 --> 00:17:58,633
When I put my name
on that accord,

391
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,633
I do not want to be
signing the death warrant

392
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,967
of innocent
American citizens.

393
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,001
Yes, Mr. President.

394
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:04,867
Do you have that number?

395
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:07,101
Yes, sir.
We just completed
the back-trace.

396
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,334
Try it.

397
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:17,167
( woman crying )

398
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,867
( phone ringing )
It's gonna be okay.

399
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,134
It's gonna be okay.

400
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,267
( ringing continues )

401
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:26,767
Yes?

402
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:28,967
This is Bill Buchanan,

403
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:31,468
a director of the Los Angeles
Counter-Terrorist Unit.

404
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,867
I am listening.

405
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:35,234
The president has authorized me
to speak on his behalf.

406
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:37,767
I'm hoping we can
resolve this peacefully.

407
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,734
I've told you how
to resolve this peacefully.

408
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,867
Your president

409
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,401
must make a public statement.

410
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:44,134
I know he's considering
that option.

411
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:45,900
Then we have nothing
more to speak about.

412
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,700
There must be some other way
we can address your demands.

413
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:53,001
I don't think you understand
just how serious we are.

414
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,067
Wait. We can talk about...
( line disconnects )

415
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,067
Data-mine the call.

416
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:01,934
Yes, sir.

417
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,500
Get up!

418
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:05,401
Up!
What?

419
00:19:05,468 --> 00:19:07,234
Bring him.

420
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:09,900
Curtis, they're moving
one of the hostages.

421
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,500
On your knees!

422
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,934
Oh, my God.

423
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:37,468
Please...

424
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,567
I have a wife.

425
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,134
So do I.

426
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:43,934
No.

427
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,633
( people screaming )

428
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:14,867
* *

429
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,434
You!

430
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,567
No.

431
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,867
Curtis, they're moving

432
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,167
another one of the hostages.

433
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:39,533
I can't see where.
I'm changing position.

434
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,533
Derek?
Ma'am, please, ma'am.

435
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,001
That's my son.

436
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:08,167
Ma'am, please.
They're gonna kill my son!

437
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,034
( weeping ):
That's my son!

438
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,134
Derek!

439
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:14,533
No, let me go!

440
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:19,468
( Diane screaming )

441
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,734
In 15 minutes,

442
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,434
your president will get
another demonstration

443
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
of our commitment.

444
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,900
15 minutes.

445
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:32,967
I'm in position.

446
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:34,201
How much longer
till you're ready

447
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,734
to move in?
At least a half hour.

448
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,167
We're still transferring
personnel from the summit.

449
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:38,667
Negative. That's too long.

450
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:39,867
You need to advance your attack.

451
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:41,101
We can't.
We're just not ready.

452
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,301
Curtis, they're gonna
kill that kid.

453
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,101
Jack...

454
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:47,234
I heard that woman Diane's side
of the conversation...

455
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:49,533
This has nothing to do with her.

456
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,567
These people are gonna continue
to kill hostages

457
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:53,101
until the summit deadline.

458
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,101
We can't risk the lives of all
those hostages for this one kid.

459
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,234
You know that.

460
00:21:57,301 --> 00:21:58,301
I not gonna jeopardize
the mission.

461
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,067
Just tell your men to hurry.

462
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,501
It's all connected.

463
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:44,400
Maybe that's enough, Mrs. Logan.

464
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:46,400
The doctor said you
really shouldn't
be watching this...

465
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:48,367
Evelyn...

466
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,367
David Palmer called me
last night.

467
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:53,367
He said he had
something to tell me.

468
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:56,367
It was "a matter
of national security."

469
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:59,767
I think it has something
to do with this.

470
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:02,067
The terrorists?

471
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:06,133
Yes. I tried to tell my husband
and Walt Cummings,

472
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,601
but they think I
imagined the call.

473
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,200
So we checked
the phone recordings.

474
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,734
The conversations don't match.

475
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:17,133
Someone altered
the conversation, Evelyn.

476
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:19,801
Who would do something
like that?

477
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:23,467
I don't know.

478
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:29,033
Now listen to me.

479
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,734
You have got
to cover for me.

480
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:31,968
No one can know
that I am gone.

481
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:33,868
Do you understand me?

482
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:38,567
W-Where are you going?

483
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,567
( sighs )

484
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:04,234
( phone dialing )

485
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,534
( phone rings )

486
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,067
O'Brian.

487
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:08,467
Chloe, is that you?
Jack?

488
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,367
What's going on?
Why are you answering the phone?

489
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:11,367
Mr. Buchanan
needed my help

490
00:24:11,434 --> 00:24:12,734
with the
airport crisis.

491
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:13,968
Are you alone?
Yeah.

492
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,267
Okay, I'm going
to send a picture

493
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:17,133
of one of the hostiles
over to your screen. Hold on.

494
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,567
Okay, I got it.

495
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,234
I want you to enlarge

496
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,734
the upper right corner
of his vest.

497
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,167
Looks like
a secondary detonator,

498
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:35,367
cell phone activated.

499
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:36,901
Yeah, so the leader
can set off the charges

500
00:24:36,968 --> 00:24:38,901
individually in case
anybody gets cold feet.

501
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:40,834
I need the detonation
frequency.

502
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,501
Okay, I'll have to
I.D. the detonator.

503
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:43,501
It could take some time.

504
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,968
Just get started.

505
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,133
Did you clear this
with Buchanan?

506
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:51,100
No.

507
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:52,100
Chloe,

508
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:54,467
can you see the live feed?

509
00:24:57,367 --> 00:25:00,367
Oh, my God. It's Derek.

510
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:02,300
I need your help.

511
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,534
Okay. I'll get back to you.

512
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:06,868
( sighs )

513
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:09,701
Spenser...

514
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:11,400
I was really worried about you.

515
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,200
Uh, not now.

516
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:14,534
I need you to
reconfigure Jack's phone

517
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,634
to emit an
alternate signal.

518
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:24,868
What for?

519
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,968
Could you just work
up a procedure?

520
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,667
This is off protocol,
isn't it?

521
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,701
Yes.

522
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,300
Spenser, you have
more knowledge

523
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,300
about bandwidth processing
than anyone here.

524
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,033
I need you.

525
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,434
( computer keys clacking )

526
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,167
Got it?

527
00:26:02,334 --> 00:26:03,767
Yeah.

528
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,000
( knocking )
It's Agent Pierce.

529
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,534
I'm here to escort Mrs. Logan

530
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,434
to the Garden Room.

531
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:24,701
She's still

532
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,267
not ready.

533
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,901
President Logan is expecting her
15 minutes before the ceremony.

534
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,767
Could I speak
with her?

535
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,200
What's going on?

536
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,734
She's in one
of her moods.

537
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:48,501
If you push her,
it'll make it worse.

538
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:50,234
I'll wait out here.

539
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,234
Thanks.

540
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:03,601
( door closes )

541
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:21,200
( liquid flowing )

542
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,701
It's Mr. Burk,
isn't it?

543
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,367
Uh, Mrs. Logan...

544
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,868
You work in the
communications
office, don't you?

545
00:27:26,934 --> 00:27:28,334
Yes, Ma'am.

546
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,033
I know that all phone
conversations are recorded.

547
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,234
Where do they keep
those recordings?

548
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:41,267
Uh, well, the calls are recorded
onto a hard drive.

549
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,334
It's part
of the central server.

550
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,000
Is there, by any chance,
any hard copies?

551
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,167
Actually,
the-the President insists

552
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,467
on written transcripts
as backups.

553
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:52,334
He's-he's kind of
old-fashioned that way.

554
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,901
I know. Where do they store
those transcripts?

555
00:27:54,968 --> 00:27:57,000
Archive room down the hall.

556
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:58,467
Can you show me?

557
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,300
Access is restricted.

558
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm the First Lady.

559
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:02,534
I understand,
Mrs. Logan,

560
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:04,133
uh, but there are
security requirements.

561
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,200
You... you have to have
an entry card.

562
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,234
Do you have one?

563
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,234
Well, yes, I do...

564
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,734
Can I borrow it?

565
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:12,767
It's extremely important.

566
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,501
Mrs. Logan, I'm sorry.

567
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:18,067
Um... there's-there's
nothing I can do.

568
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:21,033
Mr. Burk...

569
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,701
we can continue
this little dance

570
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,534
if you really want to,
but you and I both know

571
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:27,200
I am going to get
into that room,

572
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,501
so you can save us
both the trouble

573
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:30,100
and just give me
your entry card.

574
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:33,067
Mrs. Logan, you wouldn't...

575
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:35,934
You know, in three
seconds, Mr. Burk,

576
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,334
I am going to scream

577
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,334
louder than any woman
you've ever heard in your life.

578
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,334
One... two...

579
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,267
Here's the card. Here.

580
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:46,834
Um...
Thank you.

581
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:49,334
Yeah.
Thank you.

582
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,234
O'Brian.

583
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,501
Chloe, they're going

584
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:19,801
to kill Derek
in less than three minutes--

585
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:20,834
I need that frequency.

586
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:22,100
We're still
trying to find

587
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,334
the manufacturer
of the detonator.

588
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,133
Hurry. We're
running out of time.

589
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,801
I know, but if we don't get
the frequency right,

590
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,334
we could accidentally detonate
all the vests.

591
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,968
Okay, there's no match
on any of the Czech

592
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:32,200
military components.
That leaves
the German manufacturers.

593
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:33,834
Jack, we're trying
to narrow it down.

594
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:42,367
Now, the first team
will enter

595
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:45,534
through the southeast door
and split into two flanks.

596
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:46,968
The primary kill
shots will take out

597
00:29:47,033 --> 00:29:48,367
the hostiles
wearing bomb vests.

598
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:49,300
Second team enters

599
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:50,567
through the southeast door,

600
00:29:50,634 --> 00:29:52,601
forms a protective ring
around the hostages.

601
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,701
We'll only have
a few seconds to
neutralize the hostiles,

602
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,667
so find your targets fast.

603
00:29:56,734 --> 00:29:59,067
Go.

604
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,501
What's your time frame?

605
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,534
We're on target to launch
the assault in 15 minutes.

606
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,334
Understood.

607
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,200
( sniffling and panting )

608
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,901
How old are you?

609
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:22,801
Fifteen.

610
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:26,801
BERESCH:
Try to control
your breathing.

611
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,667
Slow down.

612
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,067
( quiets )

613
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,801
See?

614
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:39,100
Better.

615
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:43,234
Please don't kill me.

616
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:46,801
That's up to your president.

617
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,367
( phone rings )

618
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:01,801
Bill Buchanan.

619
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:03,601
MAN:
Beresch is calling
from the airport, sir.

620
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,400
This is Bill Buchanan.

621
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,300
The boy hasn't long to live.

622
00:31:12,634 --> 00:31:14,234
We're haven't heard
from the president yet.

623
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,234
We need more time.

624
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,567
No.

625
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:18,834
The president must announce
the summit is canceled,

626
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:19,868
or I kill the boy.

627
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,567
We're doing our best

628
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,234
to get an answer
from the president.

629
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,400
I implore you
to resolve this

630
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,501
without further killing.

631
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,267
This boy's blood
will be on his hands.

632
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:34,634
Come on, Chloe.

633
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,534
Jack, we just got a match
on the manufacturer.

634
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:38,501
We're trying to figure out
the frequency.

635
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,133
There's no match
on the 2004 series.

636
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,801
It's got to be
one of these three.

637
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:45,934
Hold him!

638
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,901
Agent Manning!

639
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:54,234
I got it.

640
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,601
Here it is.

641
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,133
We've got the trigger frequency
for the detonator.

642
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,501
Go to submenu three
on your phone.

643
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,501
I'm at submenu.

644
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,000
Enter this code: 6-3-3-9.

645
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:04,234
JACK:
Now what?
The phone needs to reboot.

646
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,434
When it does, it'll give you
a ready message.

647
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:07,968
Then you press the star key,

648
00:32:08,033 --> 00:32:09,934
and it should send the signal
to set off the detonator.

649
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,100
Your president
has abandoned you.

650
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,100
I'm not getting
a ready message signal.

651
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,167
It takes time
to re-flash the ROM.

652
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,868
Son of a bitch, come on!

653
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,667
I'm sorry.

654
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,167
( erratic panting )

655
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:32,634
I got it. I got it!

656
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,968
( loud explosion )

657
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:41,200
Curtis, what was that?

658
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:42,501
CURTIS:
There was an explosion
in the terminal.

659
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:43,534
We can't tell
what it is from here.

660
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:45,133
Patch me through to Jack.

661
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,334
Stay in position!

662
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,467
Keep the hostages together!

663
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:53,634
Check the exits, make sure
the perimeter's secure!

664
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:05,534
It was Ibrim's vest.

665
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,400
It must have detonated
by accident.

666
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,534
Jack, what's going on?

667
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,167
One of the terrorists' vests
blew up.

668
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:12,767
But none of the hostages
were hurt.

669
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,801
BUCHANAN:
Were you responsible
for that, Jack?

670
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,501
Jack, answer me.

671
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:20,267
Bill, they were going to kill
another hostage.

672
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,734
I didn't have a choice.

673
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:24,234
I didn't compromise my position.

674
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,601
Now you tell me this.

675
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:26,734
Are Curtis and his team

676
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:27,901
on schedule?

677
00:33:27,968 --> 00:33:29,567
Yes. The backup units
are in position.

678
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,067
Go time is ten minutes.
Okay.

679
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,067
BERESCH:
Everyone.

680
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:33,801
Fall into formation "B"

681
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:36,534
and run circuit checks
on your vests.

682
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,767
The terrorists are revising
their formation.

683
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:40,834
I'll contact Curtis
in the next few minutes

684
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:41,901
with final positions.

685
00:33:41,968 --> 00:33:43,033
BUCHANAN:
Thanks, Jack.

686
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,934
( beeping )

687
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,467
EDGAR:
Mr. Buchanan, President Logan's
on the line for you.

688
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:52,934
Mr. President.

689
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,367
The news is saying

690
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,734
there was some kind of explosion
inside the terminal.

691
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,400
Everything is
under control, sir.

692
00:33:58,467 --> 00:34:00,133
Our tactical units
are in position.

693
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,367
Go time is ten minutes.

694
00:34:01,434 --> 00:34:02,868
Then what caused
the explosion?

695
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:04,534
Well, we're not
entirely certain, sir.

696
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,100
We believe that
our man inside

697
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:09,000
may have been trying to stall
the execution of a hostage.

698
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,934
He triggered the bomb vest
of a hostile.

699
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,501
Did you authorize
this action?

700
00:34:14,501 --> 00:34:16,767
No, sir, he acted independently.

701
00:34:19,234 --> 00:34:20,534
You should know,
Mr. President, the man

702
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,434
we're talking about
is Jack Bauer.

703
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:23,901
Jack Bauer?

704
00:34:23,968 --> 00:34:26,634
He was in the terminal
when the terrorists attacked.

705
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,300
He's been helping us
coordinate

706
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,634
our operation
from inside, sir.

707
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,200
I thought that Jack Bauer
assassinated David Palmer.

708
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:34,567
There's mitigating
evidence

709
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:35,767
to suggest that Bauer

710
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,434
may have been framed,
Mr. President.

711
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,434
What evidence?
What are you talking about?

712
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:40,634
It's complicated,
Mr. President.

713
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:42,434
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

714
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:45,167
I didn't want to distract you
with details

715
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:46,667
that could wait
until after we'd resolved

716
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:47,767
this hostage situation, sir.

717
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:48,868
You tell me

718
00:34:48,934 --> 00:34:50,133
everything and I will decide

719
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,701
which details are relevant.

720
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:52,801
With respect, Mr. President,

721
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,100
we don't have time.

722
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,567
Then talk faster.

723
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:21,267
PIERCE:
Mrs. Logan is due

724
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,067
in the Garden Room right now.

725
00:35:23,134 --> 00:35:24,534
Open the door, please.

726
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:26,900
Just a few more minutes!

727
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:29,733
Ma'am, it's my job
to make sure she's there.

728
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,568
If you don't open the door,

729
00:35:31,634 --> 00:35:33,900
I will open
it myself.

730
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,201
Mrs. Logan.

731
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:39,267
How dare you barge in here.

732
00:35:42,034 --> 00:35:43,067
Mrs. Logan.

733
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,967
This is a private
residence...

734
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:48,100
Evelyn, if something
happens to Mrs. Logan,

735
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,767
the blame will fall on you.

736
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,301
We both know that.

737
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:53,733
So I am urging you
in the strongest
possible terms

738
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,301
to tell me where she is.

739
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:17,601
We're moving to entry positions.

740
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,367
Davies, Matthews,
are your teams in place?

741
00:36:19,434 --> 00:36:22,067
MAN:
All teams in place and ready
to go, Agent Manning.

742
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:24,100
All right. Copy.

743
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:25,301
Go.

744
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:30,634
Oh my God...
It's okay.

745
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,301
Listen, listen.
Derek's alive.

746
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:33,267
He's okay.

747
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:34,467
Are you sure?

748
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,900
I can't go into details,
but he's okay.

749
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:37,967
I have to go.

750
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:40,134
We're mounting
our rescue operation.

751
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,367
Thank you.

752
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,634
Keep an eye on her.
Let's go.

753
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:01,833
They're waiting for you in
the Garden Room, Mrs. Logan.

754
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,501
( sighs )

755
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:06,301
I can get up myself.

756
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:07,434
All right.

757
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,167
But you still need
to come with me.

758
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,000
( sighs )

759
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:15,034
Whatever you say, Aaron.
Whatever you say.

760
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:35,867
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Logan...

761
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:36,867
It's all right.

762
00:37:36,934 --> 00:37:38,767
I'm really sorry.

763
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,367
Evelyn, will you
stop apologizing?

764
00:37:40,434 --> 00:37:41,434
It's annoying.

765
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:43,034
Besides, I got what I came for.

766
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:00,800
NATHANSON:
Yes.

767
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:02,334
You have a problem
at the terminal.

768
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:03,334
Explain.

769
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,700
Jack Bauer is inside

770
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,100
providing recon
for CTU's rescue operation,

771
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:08,601
which will launch shortly.

772
00:38:08,668 --> 00:38:10,000
Are you sure?

773
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:11,900
This came straight
from the Director of CTU.

774
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:13,334
And Bauer was responsible

775
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:16,067
for detonating the vest
of one of Beresch's men.

776
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:18,067
Can you tell me
Bauer's precise location?

777
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:19,501
No.

778
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:22,100
But I know he has a connection
to one of the hostages--

779
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:25,934
a 15-year-old boy
named Derek Huxley.

780
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:29,334
I have to go.

781
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:33,733
Tell them that's being handled
out of the press office.

782
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,234
Thank you.

783
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:38,034
Yes?

784
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,867
Mrs. Logan is back in her room,
getting ready.

785
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,034
Why the delay?

786
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,401
She was in one
of the archive rooms.

787
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:46,833
Archive rooms...

788
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,934
What was she doing there?

789
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,934
The First Lady is safe
and accounted for.

790
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,700
You'll need to ask her
about anything beyond that.

791
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,401
Thank you, Aaron.

792
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:07,000
C.T.

793
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,301
Go to the ticket counters.

794
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:16,601
Go to the west exit.

795
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Manning.

796
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:27,967
JACK:
Curtis, this is Jack.

797
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,800
Beresch's redeployed six men.

798
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,934
Are you ready
for final positions?

799
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,301
Go ahead.

800
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,067
Four men were deployed
to the east side of the terminal

801
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:36,301
in front
of the ticket counter,

802
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:38,134
the other two to the west side
of the terminal

803
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,534
in front
of the emergency exits.

804
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:40,767
Do you copy?
Copy.

805
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,401
Okay, once you deploy,

806
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,800
I'll give you real-time
updates on their positions.

807
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,700
All right, Jack.
I'm starting the countdown.

808
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:49,167
All teams stand by to execute.

809
00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:52,634
This is it.

810
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,467
NATHANSON:
He's in the terminal now.

811
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:03,534
Okay.

812
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:06,234
Hostages up!

813
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:09,900
Hold on one second.

814
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:17,000
Hold on.

815
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:19,501
Hold on, Beresch is
changing something.

816
00:40:21,301 --> 00:40:22,700
He's moving...

817
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:24,634
( loud electronic distortion
and static )

818
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,201
Jack? Jack!

819
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:27,167
Curtis, what happened?

820
00:40:27,234 --> 00:40:28,201
I lost Jack.

821
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:29,201
What do you mean,
you lost him?

822
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:30,267
The connection's broken.

823
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:32,334
Can you reconnect?

824
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:33,601
I'm trying.

825
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,800
Jack Bauer.

826
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,900
Derek is a very brave young man.

827
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,568
I will shoot him in the head

828
00:40:50,634 --> 00:40:52,201
if you don't show yourself
immediately.

829
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:54,034
( sighs )

830
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,767
BUCHANAN:
Curtis!
It's not going through, Bill.

831
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,334
Can you move in without him?

832
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:58,501
The last thing Jack said

833
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:00,201
was that Beresch
was moving something.

834
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:03,134
He could be moving the hostages
into the kill zone.

835
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:04,767
Abort.

836
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:06,467
All teams, abort the operation.

837
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:07,967
Repeat: This is an abort.

838
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:13,201
BERESCH:
Bauer, if you want
to save the boy,

839
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:15,900
present yourself now.

840
00:41:36,934 --> 00:41:39,234
Mr. Bauer!

841
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:43,867
Derek has five seconds
left to live.

842
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,267
Four.

843
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:46,334
Three...

844
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,134
JACK:
Beresch!

845
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:55,267
JACK:
I'm lowering my weapon.

846
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:01,733
Secure him.
