1
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:15,133
What's going on?
What do you mean?

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,501
I'm your brother.

3
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:19,033
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,767
It's all right, really.

5
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:22,667
Okay.

6
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,000
One more chapter and
we'll take a break.

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,167
( glass shattering )

8
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,100
David.

9
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,801
Get help!

10
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:33,334
Whoever did this,
I want them dead or in custody

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,067
by the time
the Russians get here.

12
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:37,534
BUCHANAN:
I would ask that you
consider postponing

13
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,501
the signing of the treaty, sir.

14
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:40,901
No. Absolutely not.

15
00:00:40,968 --> 00:00:44,167
I think... that David was killed

16
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,567
because of something
he was about to tell me.

17
00:00:46,634 --> 00:00:48,901
He said that it concerned
national security

18
00:00:48,968 --> 00:00:51,234
and that it involved you.

19
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,133
Was she all right?

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,000
No, Walt,
she's not all right.

21
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:57,734
She's having
another one of her delusions.

22
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,267
What is this,
an interrogation?

23
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:01,601
I just don't like being lied to.

24
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:03,767
No one's lying to you, Derek.

25
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:05,100
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,701
Sorry.

27
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,367
You don't owe me an explanation.

28
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:13,367
If you had wanted to tell
me about your past,

29
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,901
you would have
told me already.
( cell phone ringing )

30
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,367
Yeah?

31
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:19,567
Jack, I know this isn't
protocol, please don't

32
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,100
hang up on me, I need your help.

33
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:23,434
They got Tony and Michele,
Michele is dead,

34
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,601
Tony's in critical condition,
now they're gonna kill me.

35
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,100
What the hell
are you doing here?

36
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,734
I'm sorry I followed you,

37
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,701
I'm just... I'm just worried
about my mother.

38
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:31,501
You're going with me.

39
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:33,334
( gunfire )

40
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,400
( gunshot )

41
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,100
( gunshots )

42
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,467
Hold your fire, Chloe!

43
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,501
Palmer was
my primary target.

44
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:46,934
( coughing ):
Set you up.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,267
Make it look like
you did it.

46
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:50,734
You're the one
that killed Palmer.

47
00:01:50,801 --> 00:01:52,100
Yeah.

48
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:54,634
( gunshot )

49
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:04,100
AUDREY:
The President's retreat
is still vulnerable.

50
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,767
You need to post two more
people here at Delta.

51
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,767
It's a high probability
point of infiltration.

52
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,100
We'll have to pull assets
from somewhere else.

53
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,267
Yeah, Marcie, hi.
Can you give me the figures?

54
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,634
Excuse me, sir.

55
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,133
Sorry to interrupt.
What is it,
Edgar?

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,634
We have a visual
on a suspect,

57
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:19,100
I thought you might
want to know.

58
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,634
He may be
the Palmer shooter.

59
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:22,267
Were you able to make an ID?

60
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,067
I think you
should see for yourself.

61
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,968
About an hour before
President Palmer was shot...

62
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,200
( typing )

63
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:28,667
...someone broke into
the service ance

64
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:30,501
of the building
across the street,

65
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,834
the one the sniper used.

66
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,767
We have a frame grab
from a security video.

67
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,300
I ran it through
a high-res filter,

68
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,300
so it may take
a few seconds to render.

69
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:52,367
Audrey.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,667
What is going on
here, Jack?

71
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,033
They're setting me up

72
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,834
to take the fall for
Palmer's assassination.

73
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,667
Palmer's not even
president anymore.

74
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:18,300
Why would
they want him dead?

75
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:19,601
I don't know.

76
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,634
You need to get as far away
from here as you can.

77
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,067
Just disappear.
No, what
I need to do

78
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:25,067
is I need to find out who really
killed President Palmer.

79
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,767
How are you gonna do that?

80
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:28,801
Start at the beginning.

81
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:31,534
Investigate
the original crime scene.

82
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:33,801
David Palmer was visiting
his brother when he was shot.

83
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,167
Maybe he left something
there that can help me.

84
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,167
That's crazy. Palmer was
assassinated an hour ago.

85
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,501
The place is gonna be crawling

86
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:41,501
with Secret Service,
FBI, local police.

87
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,434
I need access
to a building schematic

88
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:44,901
and an interagency
deployment grid.

89
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:47,234
Can you get that
for me or not?

90
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,601
Yeah.

91
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,868
I should be able to log on
remotely from the site.

92
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:52,667
Okay.

93
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,767
Come on, let's go.

94
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:00,467
How could you kill that guy?

95
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,234
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Derek.

96
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,567
Gein the van.

97
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,701
I'm not going anywhere with you.

98
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,634
You're gonna do
exactly what I tell you

99
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,534
until I pass you off
to your mother.

100
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,334
Let go of me.

101
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,434
Let's get
something straight, kid.

102
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:20,534
The only reason you're

103
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:23,434
still conscious is because
I don't want to carry you.

104
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,501
Now get in the van.

105
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:38,701
EDGAR:
Preliminary analysis indicates
the video hasn't been doctored.

106
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:41,400
Then Jack was in the building
the sniper fired from

107
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,167
at the same time President
Palmer was assassinated.

108
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:45,834
That's impossible.
This whole thing is impossible.

109
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,701
Bill, you were there
when Jack was shot.

110
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,667
He had not pulse,
no vitals.

111
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,834
And I have no idea how Jack
staged his own death.

112
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:54,501
But I understand
his reasons.

113
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:57,267
He was about to be handed over
to the Chinese government

114
00:04:57,334 --> 00:04:59,067
to spend the rest
of his life in prison.

115
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,534
None of that explains why Jack
would want to kill David Palmer.

116
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,868
I had Curtis
pull the phone logs.

117
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,667
Palmer, Tony and Michelle
were all talking to Jack

118
00:05:06,734 --> 00:05:09,501
right before he was
supposedly killed.

119
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,167
Our working theory
is that they conspired

120
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,968
to help Jack
fake his own death.

121
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:15,234
Now you're saying that Jack

122
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,734
was behind the attack
on Tony and Michelle, too?

123
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,267
Why would Jack want to kill
the people who helped him?

124
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,968
CURTIS:
Something may have happened

125
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,667
and he stopped trusting them
to keep his secret.

126
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,801
Jack would
never murder his friends.

127
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:29,834
Audrey...

128
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:33,067
I don't want to believe
Jack did this, either.

129
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,234
But right now, it's
the best explanation

130
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,901
for the evidence
that we have.

131
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,434
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,901
The White House needs
to know about this.

133
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,133
Yeah, I'll call the President.

134
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:52,400
CURTIS:
Bill.

135
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,100
What is it,
Curtis?

136
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:57,300
I had Adamson run
a data recovery operation

137
00:05:57,367 --> 00:05:58,901
on Tony's phone
records.

138
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,601
They show Chloe
was on those calls

139
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,067
with President Palmer and Tony.

140
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,901
Chloe knew Jack
was alive?

141
00:06:03,968 --> 00:06:05,100
Apparently.

142
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,567
We called her in an hour ago,

143
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:08,033
she should
have been here by now.

144
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,133
EDGAR:
I've been trying
to call her on her cell,

145
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,167
but she's not answering.

146
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,501
I wanted to run
a locate

147
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,701
but Spencer talked me
out of it.

148
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,067
If anything happens
to her it's your fault.

149
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:16,133
Stop.

150
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,033
Have Adamson track her cell--

151
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,200
we need to get to her

152
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,300
before Jack does.

153
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:22,000
Put out
an interagency alert.

154
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,934
Jack Bauer is now
the prime suspect

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,734
in President Palmer's
assassination.

156
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,334
Emphasize that he's
a former agent,

157
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,801
well-trained and
should be considered

158
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:29,968
extremely dangerous.

159
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:40,367
CUMMINGS:
Excuse me, sir.

160
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,434
What is it,
Walt?

161
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,000
Mrs. Logan called again.

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,801
I can't keep putting her off
about this phone call

163
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:49,968
with David Palmer.

164
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,133
Why would David Palmer
call my wife

165
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,634
about
a national security threat?

166
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,501
That's what she says he wanted
to talk to her about.

167
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,634
A matter of
national security.

168
00:06:56,701 --> 00:06:59,100
Maybe if I investigated
the phone call?

169
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:01,067
No, you need to stay
focused on the Summit.

170
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,634
I am, sir, which is why

171
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:05,100
we can't risk having Mrs. Logan
obsess about this phone call.

172
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,501
Showing her the truth
might help her get on

173
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,067
with her
responsibilities today.

174
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,367
So what are you...
what are you suggesting?

175
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:13,834
Well, if David Palmer
called her yesterday,

176
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,033
our communications office

177
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,467
will have a recording
of their conversation.

178
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,067
Get that for me.

179
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,968
Yes, sir.

180
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:22,968
And Walt.

181
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,767
Thank you for doing this.

182
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:26,501
( over intcom ):
Mr. President,

183
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:30,334
Audrey Raines
is holding on line three.

184
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,334
Ms. Raines, this
is President Logan.

185
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,701
You're also on

186
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,667
with Walt Cummings.

187
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:38,934
Sir, CTU has a suspect

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,434
in the assassination
of President Palmer.

189
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,200
Good!

190
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:44,801
Who is it?

191
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,133
Ms. Raines?

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,934
It's Jack Bauer, sir.

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,200
Jack Bauer's dead.

194
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,934
We've all been living under
that assumption, sir.

195
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:57,200
I don't understand.

196
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,667
What makes you
think it's Bauer?

197
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:01,834
CTU has verified surveillance
video placing Jack Bauer

198
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:03,634
at the same time,
in the same building

199
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,767
as the sniper who killed
President Palmer.

200
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,400
Audrey, this
is Walt Cummings.

201
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,334
Let me get clear on this.

202
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,100
Are you saying that
Bauer shot David Palmer?

203
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,367
We're proceeding
under that assumption, yes.

204
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:16,267
Why? For what possible reason?

205
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,834
David Palmer might have known
that Jack Bauer s alive,

206
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:21,234
knowledge that he shared
with three other CTU agents,

207
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,567
all of whom have been targeted
in the last hour.

208
00:08:23,634 --> 00:08:25,467
The man does have a histor
of insubordination,

209
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,100
irrational behavior,
drug addiction.

210
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,133
Jack Bauer has a history
of great service

211
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,601
to this country.

212
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:33,801
How does thiaffect your threat
assessment for the Summit?

213
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:35,767
We're still recommending
that you delay or reschedule

214
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:37,934
until Jack Bauer's apprehended.

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,133
Ms. Raines, you have a suspect.
Find him.

216
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,467
Yes, sir.

217
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:46,067
Sir, President Suvarov

218
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:47,567
arrives within the hour.

219
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:49,300
Should we think about informing

220
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,501
his security chief that
he's a potential target?

221
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,501
No. No.

222
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,868
I-I want
this information limited

223
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,300
to those involved
in the manhunt for Jack Bauer.

224
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,834
Understood?

225
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,367
Yes, sir.

226
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,100
I found Haas.

227
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,634
He and his men
are all dead.

228
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,067
How did this happen?

229
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:14,167
I'm not sure.

230
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:15,834
The last time I spoke to Haas

231
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,534
was about to move
on Bauer and the woman.

232
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,200
Is there any sign of Bauer now?

233
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,434
No. I'll dispatch
a team and track him.

234
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:23,901
We'll have him in 24 hours.

235
00:09:23,968 --> 00:09:25,367
No, let CTU find Bauer.

236
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:28,200
Once they have him in custody,
we'll take him out.

237
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,567
You're not concerned Bauer
will impede the operation?

238
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,200
He won't have chance.

239
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:36,601
We launch in less than an hour.

240
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,167
All of their hardware's
military spec.

241
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:52,234
Fragmentation grenades,
percussion grenades.

242
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,100
Here's a comm unit we can use.

243
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,667
Who are these people?

244
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,033
( phone ringing )

245
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:01,968
Yeah?

246
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,334
DIANE:
Frank,

247
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,067
will you please tell me
what's going on?

248
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,567
Diane, I know it's hard,
but please try not to worry.

249
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:09,501
Derek is fine.
Where are you now?

250
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,834
Um, I'm-I'm about a half hour
outside of L.A.

251
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:15,467
Just tell me where
to meet you.
I don't know yet.

252
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:16,567
Just keep heading
towards the city.

253
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,367
I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

254
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:19,968
Can I talk to him?

255
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,200
Of course, yeah.

256
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,901
It's your mother.
Talk to her.

257
00:10:24,968 --> 00:10:26,300
Mom?

258
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:27,734
Derek,

259
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,968
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.

260
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,267
Are you sure?

261
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:32,934
Jack, we're about
a block away.

262
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,934
Say good-bye
to your mother.

263
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,868
I have to hang up now, Mom.

264
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:39,701
Derek, I love you.

265
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,501
Me, too.

266
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:42,834
Give me the phone.

267
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,767
Get to the back of the vehicle.

268
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,367
Go!

269
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,167
RADIO DISPATCHER:
Unit 14, clear.

270
00:10:48,234 --> 00:10:50,601
WOMAN:
While security agencies
are remaining hushed,

271
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,167
speculation begins to grow.

272
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,100
We're told, though,
that that speculation

273
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,601
will not be addressed

274
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,467
because the government says
security right now

275
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:59,234
is of utmost importance.

276
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,734
Now, look behind me,
you'll see

277
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:02,901
the Los Angeles
apartment building where

278
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,167
President David Palmer
was assassinated

279
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:05,968
a little more
than an hour ago.

280
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,033
You can also see Americans

281
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,801
of all ages
have started to gather

282
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,734
to mourn
and pay their last respects

283
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,534
to the beloved
former president,

284
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:15,567
who surprised many
almost three years ago

285
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,100
with his 11th-hour announcement

286
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:20,400
that he would not be seeking
a second term.

287
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,033
All right,
go on through.

288
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,400
...cordoned off the area
and security...

289
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,667
Let her through.

290
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:31,100
( inaudible police radio
transmission )

291
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,734
We're clear.

292
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:04,467
Go on up front.

293
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:10,501
Hold the light
on the bag.

294
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,834
Can you get a wireless
access point from down here?

295
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:25,334
Yeah, I'm reading
the agents' transponders.

296
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,634
I can track their locations

297
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:29,000
to within three feet.

298
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:38,400
Jack, there are 167 agents
in and around the location,

299
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,767
25 of them in Wayne Palmer's
apartment alone.

300
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,934
I know-- that's why
we better hope that this

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,767
is gonna be the last place
they're gonna be looking for me.

302
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,000
Testing one, two,
testing

303
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,033
one, two, three.

304
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,434
Okay.

305
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:57,033
This is field ops
communation unit.

306
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,400
All you need to do
is put it in your ear
and we're set to go.

307
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,567
Derek, put out the light.

308
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,467
Officer.

309
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:24,868
I live in
this building.

310
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,167
I was told that...
( inaudible )

311
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,334
What...
Relax.

312
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,334
He's really
good at this.

313
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,300
You sure he's okay?

314
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,601
Yeah.

315
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,167
I think.

316
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:08,267
All right, do you copy?

317
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,501
Yeah.

318
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,968
( keyboard clacking )

319
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:25,801
CHLOE:
Wayne Palmer's apartment
is the penthouse.

320
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,534
( bell dings )

321
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:32,634
I'm going up now.

322
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:38,734
Jack, there are four agents
waiting at the lobby.

323
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:40,167
Hold off on going up
if you can.

324
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,934
( bell dings, door opens )
Too late.

325
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:12,767
( bell dings )

326
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:37,167
This first room is a study.

327
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:41,767
He told my mother and I
if ahis name's Frank.

328
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,534
Who is he, really?

329
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:46,334
His name's Jack Bauer.
Up until a year and a half ago,

330
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,133
he worked for
the government.

331
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,701
Is that why we're
in the building where
the president was killed?

332
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:54,267
Please don't ask me
any more questions.

333
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,234
C-Can't you at least tell me

334
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,067
why he had to pretend
he was someone else?

335
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,934
Certain people thought
the best way

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,400
to cover up their mistakes
was to get rid of Jack.

337
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,033
You mean, kill him?

338
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,534
Yes.

339
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:15,367
Jack had to give up everything
and everyone in his life,

340
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,734
including his daughter.

341
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:19,234
He has a daughter?

342
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,534
I've already told you
more than I should.

343
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,534
JACK:
I have the computer in the study
booted up.

344
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:27,834
President Palmer had
a user account.

345
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,734
Is it password-secured?
No. There are about

346
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,567
a dozen files;
only one of them's encrypted.

347
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:33,033
That's where I'm gonna look.

348
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,834
Okay, give me the
computer's IP address.

349
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:36,634
I'll upload a decryption
program to it.

350
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:38,067
Hold on.

351
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:40,567
2-9-2-dot-1-6-

352
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:43,934
2-dot-1-2-dot-2.

353
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,200
( door opening )

354
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:47,367
Someone's at the door.

355
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,801
Not according
to the deployment grid.

356
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,100
There are no agents there.

357
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:57,234
Do not move.

358
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,767
Do not raise your voice.

359
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,267
You son of a bitch.

360
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,834
You killed my brother.

361
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:04,367
Mr. Palmer, you know
I didn't do that.

362
00:18:04,434 --> 00:18:06,834
Whatever evidence
they showed you against me
has been fabricated.

363
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:09,067
I served your brother
for years.

364
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,367
I would've gladly given
my life for his.

365
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,567
He was my friend.

366
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:19,767
The only reason
that I ahere

367
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,234
is to try and figure out
why and how he was assassinated.

368
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,901
I was hoping to find clues
on that computer.

369
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:26,567
Why don't you step
into the next room, Jack,

370
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:28,400
and ask the Secret Service
to help you find it?

371
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:30,467
Because I'm being set up.

372
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:32,434
Whoever's behind this
has planted evidence against me

373
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:34,067
making me the shooter.

374
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,567
It would be useless
to try and convince
the authorities otherwise.

375
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,434
You think
you're gonna convince me?

376
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,634
If I killed your brother,
why didn't I kill you

377
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:42,000
when you walked
through the door?

378
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,801
Think about this, Wayne.

379
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,100
Why would I be here?

380
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:54,067
Please... I need your help.

381
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,400
Jack, how do you expect me
to believe you

382
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:57,567
under these circumstances?

383
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,701
Take the gun.

384
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:08,334
Jack, what are you doing?

385
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,834
Take the gun.

386
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,934
MAN ( over TV ):
That after two terms
in the House

387
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,601
and one in the Senate,
he was elected president...

388
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,200
There you are,
Mrs. Logan.

389
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:54,133
...recapturing for his party
key states...

390
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,434
David and I first got
to know each other

391
00:19:56,501 --> 00:19:58,634
when he was elected to Congress.

392
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:02,501
He and Charles never saw
eye to eye politically, but...

393
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:06,234
David never let that get
in the way of our friendship.

394
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,467
Oh...

395
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:10,534
that picture's
from his inauguration.

396
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:12,000
At the ball,

397
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,467
I was one of the first people
David asked to dance.

398
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:16,133
...and above all, honor!

399
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,234
Mrs. Logan, I need
a few more minutes
with your hair...

400
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,667
I know! I can do it myself.
Just trying to help.

401
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:24,834
Um, I'm sorry, Evelyn,
I know. I'm sorry.

402
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,200
Mrs. Logan...

403
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,167
may I have a word?

404
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:30,634
Of course.

405
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,434
The president asked
me to look into

406
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,167
the call from David
Palmer that you...

407
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:39,133
told him about.
I was beginning to think
you were ignoring me.

408
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,100
Oh. So when did this
call take place?

409
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,467
Last night.
It woke me up.

410
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,968
I had fallen asleep
watching the news,

411
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:47,167
so it was somewhere
between 10:00 and 11:00.

412
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:50,200
Well, I'll have someone
pull up the call from
the audio archives.

413
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:52,534
PRESIDENT PALMER:
...very thing that will
defeat our enemies...

414
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:54,267
Walt.

415
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:56,701
He doesn't believe me, does he?

416
00:20:56,767 --> 00:20:58,534
Charles.

417
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:01,901
He thinks I'm making
the whole thing up.

418
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,634
( cheering over TV )

419
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,534
I wouldn't say that, Mrs. Logan.

420
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:08,033
( laughs ):
Well, of course
you wouldn't say it.

421
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,801
( sighs ):
Mrs. Logan...

422
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,934
Walt, you can go now.

423
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,067
NEWSMAN:
...partially scarred
and weakened.

424
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,300
He leaves behind
a son and daughter,

425
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:20,033
as well as a shocked
and grieving nation.

426
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,534
David Palmer,
dead today at age 55.

427
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,067
Your brother say
or do anything

428
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:27,267
out of the ordinary
before he was shot?

429
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:30,234
He was acting distracted ever
since he came to Los Angeles.

430
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,067
I finally called him on it
this morning.

431
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:35,167
What'd he say?

432
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:38,200
He never had the chance
to say anything, Jack.

433
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,834
Yeah.

434
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:42,067
The decryption program's
finished running.

435
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,033
You should be able
to open the file.

436
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,467
Okay, I'm going
into it now.

437
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:47,734
( keyboard clacking )

438
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:52,434
WAYNE:
That's the first chapter
of his memoir.

439
00:21:52,501 --> 00:21:54,467
That doesn't make any sense--
why would he encrypt that?

440
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:56,634
I mean, there are printouts
of it all over the place.

441
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,634
Maybe he hid some information
in the document.

442
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:00,901
We're gonna have to compare this
to the printout,

443
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:02,901
see if he added
or changed anything.

444
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:05,968
Got one right here.

445
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,167
You haven't sent the file
allocations; whas the problem?

446
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:14,567
I need a higher vel
access code.

447
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:17,701
Look, if you're still
upset about me and Chloe...

448
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,267
I don't care about that.

449
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:20,968
I care that if you hadn't left
her on her own this morning,

450
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,100
maybe she'd be okay right now.

451
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,701
Don't you think I know that?

452
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:31,167
Look, you're just making it
harder for me to do my job.

453
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:34,567
Use Chloe's access code: JJ72.

454
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,167
You won't get fire-walled
with it.

455
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:38,234
Thank you.

456
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,601
Edgar.
What?

457
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:48,934
This is weird.

458
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,167
I tried logging in
under Chloe's access code--

459
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,534
the system says
I'm already signed in.

460
00:22:53,601 --> 00:22:55,634
Let me see...

461
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:59,400
( typing )

462
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:00,968
That's because Chloe's
logged in, remotely.

463
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,133
Are you sure it's her?

464
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,968
Yes-- see the way
the traffic's redirected

465
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,868
through an external socket?

466
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:07,834
Even I don't know
how to do that.

467
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,100
( sighing ):
Then she's alive.

468
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,400
( phone ringing )

469
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,601
Buchanan.

470
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,100
Sir, it's Edgar.
I think we can find Chloe.

471
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,434
How?

472
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:28,067
She's accessing our system
through a laptop.

473
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,434
I'm running a locate now.

474
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,300
What's she using
our system to do?

475
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,968
EDGAR:
All I can see from here is

476
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,701
she's tracking Secret Service
and FBI deployments.

477
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,000
The locate came back.

478
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:40,234
She's at Wayne Palmer's
building.

479
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,434
The signal's faint.

480
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:42,834
It's possible she's
in t parking garage

481
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:43,968
under the building.

482
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:46,300
Let me know
if she changes location.

483
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,801
Why would Chloe
be at the scene

484
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:49,667
of Palmer's assassination,
tracking agents?

485
00:23:49,734 --> 00:23:53,400
She wouldn't be...
unless someone was forcing her.

486
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:55,067
What do you mean?

487
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,100
Maybe Jack left evidence behind
he needs to erase.

488
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,501
Surrounded by
all of those agents?

489
00:23:58,567 --> 00:23:59,901
Bill, that doesn't make sense.

490
00:23:59,968 --> 00:24:01,667
Jack can explain it to
us when we apprehend him.

491
00:24:01,734 --> 00:24:03,667
This is Bill Buchanan at CTU.

492
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,033
I need to speak to

493
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,033
Yes.

494
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,267
Have you left yet?

495
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:27,767
No, we were delayed.

496
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,300
We're still loading
the truck.

497
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,934
You should be
on your way by now.

498
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,701
Be there in 20 minutes,
as planned.

499
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,434
Call me when
you're approaching.

500
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,200
Wait, stop, stop,
stop, stop...

501
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:41,934
Right there-- he added something
in the middle of a sentence:

502
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,267
a name and an address.

503
00:24:44,334 --> 00:24:45,467
There.

504
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,400
JACK:
"Chevensky - 16 Transport Way."

505
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,167
Chloe, did you get that?
It looks like an address.

506
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes. Transport Way is a street
at the Ontario airport.

507
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:54,167
Okay, I want you to check all
inbound flights into Ontario.

508
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,000
Look for a
passenger Chevensky.

509
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:58,701
Try and make
the connection.

510
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:00,868
Jack, the Secret Service
is changing its deployment.

511
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,234
JACK:
How?

512
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,567
CHLOE:
Suddenly, there are a lot

513
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,300
of agents moving
into the building.

514
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:08,801
I'm on my way down.

515
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:11,100
They know that I'm here.

516
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,234
Let me help you
get out of here, Jack.

517
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,434
No.

518
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,767
You can't risk
being connected to me.

519
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:17,234
And until we know
who to trust,

520
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,067
you can't tell anybody
about what we found,

521
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,667
do you understand?

522
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:23,334
I'm going to do
everything I can to find out

523
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,934
who did this
to your brother.

524
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,567
I'll be in touch.

525
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:49,968
Chloe, I need
another way out of here.

526
00:25:50,033 --> 00:25:51,601
Checking.

527
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:55,434
Jack, across the hall,
through the kitchen.

528
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:56,868
One agent at the door.

529
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:58,167
Copy that.

530
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,400
( bell dings )

531
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,734
I'm in the elevator.

532
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:43,100
Where are they
concentrating their agents?

533
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:45,901
Jack, they cut off
accesso my grid;

534
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:47,200
I don't know where
the agents are.

535
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:48,467
They were grouping
in the lobby.

536
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:51,901
( bell dings )

537
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:53,601
I'm getting out
on the second floor.

538
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,434
Come on, Jack.

539
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,634
What'd you get for me
on Chevensky?

540
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:29,868
He's not a passenger,

541
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:31,667
he's a baggage supervisor
at the airport.

542
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:34,834
AGENT JENNINGS:
Jack Bauer! Agent O'Brian!

543
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,801
The perimeter is sealed!
There is no way out!

544
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:44,000
Step into view with
your hands in the air!

545
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:51,467
We know you're down here!

546
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:55,834
Step into view
with your hands in the air!

547
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,767
Do not shoot!
We need them alive!

548
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:08,300
JENNINGS:
No one fire!

549
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,567
No one fire!

550
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,234
JENNINGS:
Do not fire!

551
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,834
Step out of the vehicle!

552
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:28,000
Check the back!
Get the side!

553
00:28:28,067 --> 00:28:30,901
Step to your left!
Get down on your knees!

554
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:33,200
Cuff her!
Open the back!

555
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:35,968
Back.
Clear.

556
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,133
JENNINGS:
Bauer's not here.

557
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,667
Secure the area.

558
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,400
JACK:
Get in! Give me my bag!

559
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,501
Come on...

560
00:29:08,534 --> 00:29:10,100
Got it.

561
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:38,801
( phone auto-dialing )

562
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,334
( phone ringing )

563
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Frank.

564
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:44,434
Yeah, it's me.

565
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:45,667
Listen, Derek
is all right.

566
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,200
I just need to know
where you are.

567
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm on the 210
at the 10.

568
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,501
Okay, I want you to take the
10 East to the Ontario Airport.

569
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,000
When you get there,
I want you to go

570
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:55,868
to the parking lot
in front of the terminal.

571
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:57,767
I'll meet you on the west side
of that parking lot.

572
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:58,734
Do you understand me?

573
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:00,567
Yeah, yeah.

574
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:03,501
Diane, listen to me.

575
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:05,667
I am so sorry that I got you
involved in this.

576
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:07,067
But everything's
gonna be all right.

577
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,501
I'll be there in
a few minutes, okay?

578
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,834
Okay.

579
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,200
Okay. Thanks.

580
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,100
Mr. Buchanan, this
is Agent Jennings.

581
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,501
There's no sign
of Jack Bauer yet,

582
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,133
but we've apprehended
your agent, Chloe O'Brian.

583
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,133
She was trying to
escape our agents

584
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,901
and get away
from the building.

585
00:30:27,968 --> 00:30:30,033
You're telling me
she wasn't under duress?

586
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:32,534
Not as far as
I can tell.

587
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:34,701
Put her on the phone.

588
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,767
Uncuff her.

589
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:40,701
Bill Buchanan wants
to talk to you.

590
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,834
Hi.

591
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:44,567
Chloe, what the hell's
going on?

592
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,667
Jack didn't kill anybody.

593
00:30:45,734 --> 00:30:46,934
He's being framed to cover up

594
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,601
the real reason Palmer
was assassinated.

595
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:49,901
This is according to Jack.

596
00:30:49,968 --> 00:30:51,968
This is according to the
man who killed Palmer.

597
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:53,200
I heard his
dying confession.

598
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,067
You'll find his body
at the refinery,

599
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,334
just north of the city,
at Variel and Topanga.

600
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Chloe, do you have evidence
that Palmer's assassination

601
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:00,701
has anything to do
with the summit?

602
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:02,601
No. Jack's trying to
figure all that out.

603
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:04,000
BUCHANAN:
How? Where is he?

604
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,033
I can't tell you.

605
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,434
Why not?

606
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:08,868
Because I don't think
you believe him.

607
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,434
I think you're just
trying to arrest him.

608
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,000
Chloe, I'm not going
to ask you again.

609
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,567
I'm ordering you
to tell me where Jack is.

610
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,100
I'm sorry; I'd like
to tell you, but I can't.

611
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:21,434
Chloe!

612
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:24,334
JENNINGS:
Sir?

613
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,000
Bring her back to CTU.

614
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,434
Curtis, take a team
to the refinery.

615
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:30,767
See what you can find there.

616
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,267
Edgar, make sure
Chloe goes into

617
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:33,868
a holding cell
when she gets back.

618
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:42,801
That woman, Chloe...

619
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:44,767
she told me some stuff

620
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:46,767
about what you used to do.

621
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:48,501
( ghs )

622
00:31:50,968 --> 00:31:53,234
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have.

623
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:59,033
Why did you have to lie?

624
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,501
Couldn't you have just
told us the truth?

625
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:03,634
First of all, Derek,
you have to understand

626
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,534
that I never thought anything
like this could ever happen.

627
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:11,734
After your mother
rented me that room,

628
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:15,701
I started to remember what
it was like to have a family.

629
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,734
( gentle laugh )

630
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:20,934
How nice it was.

631
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,000
I started to believe
that a guy like me

632
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,701
could actually get
a second chance.

633
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:34,334
I know you don't
believe this now...

634
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,467
but I really do care
about you.

635
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:43,267
And I care about
your mother.

636
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,701
I hope, one day,
you can understand that.

637
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:58,133
MARTHA:
Charles?

638
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,100
Evelyn said you wanted
to talk to me?

639
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,868
I do.

640
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:03,501
Did Walt find the tape
of the phone call?

641
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,467
I told him approximately
when it took place.

642
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:06,767
Why don't we sit down?

643
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,701
No. I don't want to sit down.

644
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,501
All right.

645
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,033
You don't need
to be concerned

646
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,567
that there's
any connection

647
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:15,934
between David's death

648
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:18,367
and the phone call
that he made to you.

649
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:20,701
He said it was a matter
of national security.

650
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,534
Those were
his exact words.

651
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,634
There's got to be
a connection, of course.

652
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:25,801
There isn't.

653
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:28,767
David was killed

654
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:30,734
by an unstable
ex-CTU agent.

655
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,133
This was not a conspiracy.

656
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,400
This was one man acting out
some kind of grudge.

657
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,567
Did you hear the call?

658
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:39,267
Marty, can we just drop this?

659
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,567
Did you or didn't you hear it?!

660
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:55,934
Martha, it's David Palmer.
Did I wake you?

661
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,601
MARTHA:
No, no, David, not at all.

662
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,400
What's going on?

663
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:01,400
I need to talk to you.

664
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,400
It's hardly a matter
of national security,

665
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:05,434
but I'm hosting
a charity nner next month

666
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,133
for the Art in Action
Scholarship Program.

667
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,701
That sounds wonderful.
No. That's not what he said.

668
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,434
I would very much like you
No. That's not
what he said.

669
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:12,701
and the President
to be there.

670
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:13,868
Okay, David.
No, that is not it.

671
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:15,200
That is not it, Charles.
That's not it.

672
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:15,934
Thanks so much
for calling.
Let me...

673
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,667
Martha, listen!

674
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:19,000
Thank you, Martha.

675
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,033
Of course.

676
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,767
Please send
the president my best.

677
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:24,234
No, that's not...

678
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,033
that's not what he said.
Yes, it is.

679
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,400
No, that is...
that is a trick.

680
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,000
Listen to me...
I am not crazy.

681
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,234
Marty... Martha!
I know

682
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,234
what I heard!

683
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,834
I know what I heard.

684
00:34:32,901 --> 00:34:35,400
I spoke to Dr. Hill.

685
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,400
He said if you were

686
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,234
not consistent
with your medication,

687
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,734
you could become
disoriented.

688
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:45,000
Your memory can
be affected.

689
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:47,934
He said that?

690
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,067
Yes!

691
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:55,801
That's why you remember
something different.

692
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:56,968
I know you don't like

693
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:58,534
how these pills
make you feel,

694
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:03,267
but you need to take them.

695
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,601
( sighs )

696
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,067
If Jack was responsible

697
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,501
for President Palmer's
assassination,

698
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:13,767
why would Chloe
cover for him?

699
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:15,000
It just doesn't make sense.

700
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,667
There's something else
going on here,

701
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:17,801
and we're missing it.

702
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:19,801
NSA just intercepted
some chatter

703
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,567
identifying the summit
as a target.

704
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:22,801
We're sourcing it now,

705
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:25,167
but the reliability
is approaching 95%.

706
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:26,033
Is there a timeframe?

707
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,667
Within the next 15 minutes.

708
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,334
That's when the Russian
president is scheduled to land.

709
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,000
President Logan said he
will not postpone this summit.

710
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:35,400
In light of this,
he may not have a choice.

711
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,033
Put me through to Mike Novick.

712
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:47,834
NATHANSON:
I'm watching Suvarov's
helicopter leave the airbase.

713
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:50,601
His arrival at the retreat
is on schedule.

714
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:51,567
As are we.

715
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,434
We'll go dark now.

716
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:55,934
No communication
until after you strike.

717
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,100
I will monitor
yourrogress from here.

718
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,567
Understood.

719
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:01,167
( speaking foreign language )

720
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:07,467
Mr. President?

721
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:08,667
Yeah, Mike, what is it?

722
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,100
CTU has confirmed

723
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,667
intelligence suggesting
President Suvarov's helicopter

724
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,501
will be targeted.

725
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:16,000
How good is this
intelligence?

726
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:18,100
Very good. They're updating
their recommendation

727
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,400
that you delay
or reschedule.

728
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,868
No. I've told them,
I'm telling you.

729
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:23,868
I will not postpone this summit!

730
00:36:23,934 --> 00:36:27,234
Then at least have Suvarov
alter his arrival plan.

731
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,534
His chopper can land
at a different site

732
00:36:28,601 --> 00:36:30,467
and he can be brought here
by motorcade.

733
00:36:30,534 --> 00:36:32,434
The risk would be
substantially reduced.

734
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,601
And the impact of his arrival

735
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:35,100
would also be reduced.

736
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,634
I've got the media
waiting for a landing

737
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:37,934
five minutes from now!

738
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Mr. President...

739
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,934
I don't want to
hear it, Walt.

740
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,367
It's up to Secret Service
and the Air Force

741
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,133
to protect our airspace!

742
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,100
Make sure they do the job.

743
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,701
There's your mom.

744
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,701
Hey.

745
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:18,133
I'm sorry about the way
I treated you earlier.

746
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,400
You're a good kid.

747
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:28,901
Go get your mom.

748
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:33,167
Mom?!

749
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:34,267
Oh, my God!

750
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:39,801
Oh, are you okay?

751
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:42,434
I was so worried!

752
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,701
I'm sorry.

753
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:55,701
You got to tell me

754
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,901
right now what the hell
is going on here, Frank.

755
00:37:57,968 --> 00:38:00,167
My name's not Frank.

756
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,968
It's Jack Bauer.

757
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:04,501
I lied to you.

758
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,901
I lied to you
about a lot of things.

759
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,934
I'll explain as soon as I can,
but right now,

760
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,667
you and Derek need
to go to this address.

761
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:13,467
"CTU"?

762
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:14,634
Counterterrorist Unit.

763
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:16,000
I used to work there.

764
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,767
You need to ask for a man
named Bill Buchanan.

765
00:38:17,834 --> 00:38:19,067
Tell him I sent you.

766
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:23,033
I'm sorry.

767
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,467
I have to go.

768
00:38:27,567 --> 00:38:29,868
When we get there,
what do we tell him?

769
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,801
Tell him the truth.

770
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,067
Where can I find the
Baggage Claim Supervisor?

771
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,367
Down that hall
to the left.

772
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,467
Thank you.

773
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,501
DOD is still giving
us the all clear

774
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:05,334
on the air space
and the retreat.

775
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,901
Any word from our agents
on the ground?

776
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:14,901
Okay.

777
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:16,968
I'm all quiet so far.

778
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:19,400
But if they're going
to attack the helicopter,

779
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:20,634
it's going to be now.

780
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,868
Hi, Mr. President...

781
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:03,200
Our intel must have been wrong.

782
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:33,133
Mom, do you see
those men?

783
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Yeah.

784
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,334
That's where Jack went.

785
00:40:44,367 --> 00:40:47,334
Something's wrong.

786
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,567
I have to tell Jack.

787
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,167
Derek, where
are you going?

788
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:51,167
Come back here!

789
00:40:51,234 --> 00:40:52,601
Derek! Come back here!

790
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,601
Derek!
Come back here!

791
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:55,667
Wait! Excuse me!

792
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:57,167
I've got to get my son!
No! You...

793
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:59,434
Get off!
You can't...

794
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,434
Please move your car.

795
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,434
I've got to get
my son.

796
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,434
Derek!

797
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,501
Get back in!

798
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:38,200
Chevensky!

799
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:40,367
Why was President Palmer
killed?!

800
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:42,033
I don't know what
you're talking about.

801
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,234
( grunting )

802
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,734
You are going to tell me
what I want to know.

803
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:47,100
It's just a question
of how much you want it to hurt.

804
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:51,067
( gasps )

805
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:03,367
No!

806
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:08,834
( screaming )

807
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,200
( automatic gunfire continues )

808
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:19,934
( screaming continues )

809
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:44,334
Quiet!

810
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,067
Quiet!

811
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:48,767
( screaming stops )

812
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,601
You will not be harmed

813
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:56,300
as long as your president
complies with our wishes.

814
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:06,734
Derek!

815
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:09,834
Derek!

816
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:11,267
Ma'am, stop!

817
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:12,634
I have to get my son!
You need to go
the other way.

818
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:14,100
My son!
Go the other way.

819
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,400
This is a dangerous
situation.
I have to get my son!

820
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:30,100
CUMMINGS:
I have dealt with
the Martha Logan situation.

821
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:32,267
She's not going to be a problem?

822
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:34,501
No. I was able to alter
the tape of the phone call

823
00:43:34,534 --> 00:43:36,901
before the president
heard it.

824
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:39,033
There's no longer any evidence
on my end

825
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,868
that Palmer was trying
to warn her about the attack.

826
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:43,534
Good.

827
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:46,100
The terminal and the hostages
are secure.

828
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:47,868
It'll only be a matter of time

829
00:43:47,934 --> 00:43:50,567
until the president
is notified of the demands.

830
00:43:50,634 --> 00:43:52,434
All right.
