1
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:14,334
Jack, we've authenticated
the thumb-drive data.

2
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:16,900
Omicron definitely made
the Sentox for the military.

3
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:18,000
Who is this Henderson?

4
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,468
JACK:
Someone I used to work for.

5
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:22,301
Where?
CTU.
He's the man who recruited me.

6
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:24,201
Things ended badly between us.

7
00:00:24,267 --> 00:00:27,067
What are accusing me
now of, Jack, being in
bed with terrorists?

8
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:29,967
I need complete access
to Omicron's Sentox program.

9
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,234
HENDERSON:
I've got to merge
some files,

10
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,534
find out who was working
on this project.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,667
We need I.T.

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:34,967
They're next door.

13
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,000
I listened to everything

14
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,733
Bauer had to say
about the thumb-drives.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,733
CTU does not have enough
information to hurt us.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,000
WOMAN:
What about Bauer?

17
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,101
Well, in about one minute,
he'll be dead.

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,167
Oh, my God...

19
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,967
How could I be so stupid?

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,834
( yells )

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,667
Mr. McGill, we think
there might be an attack

22
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,967
on President Suvarov's
motorcade.

23
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,568
My people are not going to chase
that white elephant.

24
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:13,434
They're busy trying to locate 19
canisters of Sentox nerve gas.

25
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,633
Now let my people focus
on their work,

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,267
or I will have you
escorted out of here!

27
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:20,067
Lynn is mentally incapable
of running CTU.

28
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,834
What are you suggesting?
Section 112.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,867
Curtis, take Mr. Stiles
and Ms. O'Brian,

30
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:26,167
put them in holding,

31
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,167
and then escort
Audrey Raines out of CTU.

32
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,201
Lynn McGill,I'm relieving you
of your command

33
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,334
under the "incapacity clause"
of section 112.

34
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,201
Mrs. Logan is riding
with the Suvarovs.

35
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:36,267
Get my wife on the phone.

36
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:37,568
The terrorists were
very specific:

37
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:40,267
if I don't allow them
to attack the motorcade,

38
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,434
they're going to release
canisters of nerve gas

39
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:45,034
in multiple locations.

40
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,934
You need to get out of the car!

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,568
We're under attack;
we need backup now!

42
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:50,967
( gunfire )

43
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,134
( screams )

44
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:58,733
( sirens approaching )

45
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,000
I thought we had
an understanding.

46
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,267
It happened outside
of my authority.

47
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,733
I told no one.

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,568
If Russia isn't going to pay
with the life of its president,

49
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:10,434
then its new ally,
the United States,

50
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,167
will pay with the lives
of its citizens.

51
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:16,301
Mr. President, this is our
final conversation. Good-bye.

52
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:17,834
No... Wait!

53
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,034
How long has
he been conscious?

54
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,700
Ten minutes.
Before you go in,

55
00:02:29,767 --> 00:02:32,301
you should be aware
of something.

56
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,867
Tony's been asking
for his wife.

57
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,468
He doesn't remember?

58
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:39,934
He remembers the explosion,
but that's all.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,834
We have to tell him
Michelle is dead.

60
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,234
No, absolutely not.

61
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,301
He's undergone severe trauma.
This kind of stress will

62
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:49,034
raise his blood pressure and
make the vascular damage worse.

63
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:51,101
Please, just hold off
on telling him

64
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,134
until his condition
has stabilized.

65
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
Would you
excuse us, please?

66
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,733
Tony.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,568
How are you feeling?

68
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:13,367
They told me
they took Michelle to Cedars.

69
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,867
Yes, they couldn't treat
her here.

70
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:18,733
Why? How badly was she hurt?

71
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,633
Is she going to be okay?

72
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,600
As far as I know, yes.

73
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,834
What the hell's going on here,
Bill?

74
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,501
They killed President Palmer,

75
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:33,534
and they tried to kill
Michelle and me.

76
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,934
David Palmer was
the primary target.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,700
They killed him because he was
going to expose

78
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:39,201
someone inside Logan's
administration.

79
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:41,434
They set Jack up
to take the fall.

80
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,834
Did they get Jack?

81
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,867
No. He's alive.

82
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,101
He's working with us here
on a provisional basis.

83
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,867
Bill, I need to talk to Jack.

84
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:51,534
You need to rest.

85
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,934
No, I don't need to rest.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,568
I need to talk to Jack. Now.

87
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,067
I'll tell him.

88
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,568
Thanks.

89
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:02,267
Could you do me a favor?

90
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:04,401
Could you get a message
to Michelle?

91
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:05,600
Tell her I'm okay.

92
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,067
I will.

93
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:11,600
( softly ):
Tony...

94
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,568
we need you to get better.

95
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,667
( indistinct police radio
transmission)

96
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:35,967
( speaking in Russian )

97
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:42,633
( crying )

98
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,934
Copy, Blacktop One.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,301
We're standing by.

100
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:56,934
The Navy helicopter is
on its way, ma'am.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,301
It'll take us back
to the retreat.

102
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:05,367
He... didn't warn
the motorcade.

103
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:08,134
Ma'am?

104
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:14,301
Charles, he knew
about the attack, and...

105
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,900
he just let it happen, Aaron.

106
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,934
That can't be true.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,800
He didn't just let it happen.
He...

108
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,267
He gave the terrorists
the Suvarovs' motorcade route.

109
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,434
Ma'am, why would he do that?

110
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,101
( helicopter approaches )

111
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,234
How soon before
you're ready?

112
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:53,401
I'll be leaving
in a couple of minutes.

113
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:55,700
I just need to finish setting
the arming mechanism.

114
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,900
Make sure you place the canister
to maximize casualties.

115
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,967
It must look as if this
is one of our primary targets.

116
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:03,900
It'll be taken care of.

117
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,134
OSTROFF ( over phone ):
Yes?

118
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,633
Do you have the key card yet?

119
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,534
I'll have it within the hour.

120
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:12,234
They're can be
no miscues.

121
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:15,600
I'm using up one of my canisters
to create this diversion.

122
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,000
Without the key card,
it's all for nothing.

123
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,534
Call me when you have it.

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,167
I will.

125
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,534
( phone rings )

126
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,733
( sniffs )

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,234
Hello.

128
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:35,900
I'm going to be there soon.

129
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,568
Make sure you bring the money.

130
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:39,401
You'll have it.

131
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:41,600
And you'll have
your precious card.

132
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,134
Careful.

133
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:48,767
It's all we got left.

134
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:50,534
Don't worry about it.

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,834
In a little while, be
able to buy all you want.

136
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:03,733
Mrs. Logan and the Suvarovs
have been treated.

137
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,733
The chopper is picking
them up now.

138
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,568
What do I say to my wife, Mike?

139
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,767
She put you
in an impossible situation...

140
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:14,201
It's my job to handle
impossible situations,

141
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,534
and I failed,
and not for the first time.

142
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,667
Mr. President...
I should never
have given in.

143
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,568
I should have ordered
back the motorcade.

144
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,301
Sir, with all due respect,
you don't have time

145
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,501
for self-recrimination.

146
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,201
The terrorists' attack failed.

147
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:30,101
We have to assume they'll make
good on their threat

148
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,167
to use the Sentox
on American soil.

149
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,900
Has CTU made any progress,

150
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:37,568
or are they just waiting
for the other shoe to drop?

151
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:39,301
They're looking for a lead,

152
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:42,667
working the scene where
the motorcade was ambushed.

153
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,600
Bill, they're airlifting
the bodies

154
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,000
of the terrorists to CTU.

155
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,301
When will they be here?

156
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,534
Any minute. I'm meeting
them in the morgue.

157
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,967
Let me know what you find.

158
00:07:54,034 --> 00:07:54,967
You got it.

159
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,201
Jack's calling in.

160
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,700
Put him on speaker.

161
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,000
Jack, we're in an emergency
briefing with department heads.

162
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,301
Bill wants to put you
on speaker.

163
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,201
I thought Lynn took Bill
off the active roster.

164
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,834
AUDREY:
Bill's been reinstated, and
Lynn's been relieved of duty.

165
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,501
Okay, fine. Put me on.

166
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:08,834
All right.
You're on.

167
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,967
Jack, it's Bill.

168
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,934
What did you find
at Omicron?

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,034
Christopher Henderson was
responsible for setting up

170
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,501
the deal that allowed
the terrorists

171
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:16,767
to gain control of the Sentox.

172
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,967
He just tried to kill me
by blowing up a bunker

173
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,501
that the Sentox was
developed in.

174
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:21,967
I managed to survive,
but unfortunately

175
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,867
the servers that control
the data were destroyed

176
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,167
and Henderson managed to escape.

177
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:26,267
Chloe, are you there?

178
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,468
Go ahead, Jack.

179
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:29,468
Can you hack into
Henderson's office computer?

180
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:30,534
I already did it.

181
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,534
Henderson's
home workstation is clean.

182
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,201
He wiped his hard drive
five minutes ago.

183
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:36,434
There's still
an active socket.
What's that mean?

184
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,834
It means he's exchanging
data with an off-site link.

185
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,967
Can you locate it?

186
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:42,167
Yeah. The registry listing is

187
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,800
5714 Tarawood Drive,
Toluca Lake.

188
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:47,334
Tarawood Drive?

189
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,667
That's his home address.

190
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:49,967
I'll send a tac team.

191
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,334
No, Bill.
I need to go in alone.
Why?

192
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,000
Henderson's good; he'll be able
to detect a tac team moving in.

193
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,000
How do you want
to play this, Jack?

194
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,234
He left me for dead.

195
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,034
I'm the last person
he expects to see.

196
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:02,267
I should be able to walk
up to his front door.

197
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,468
All right.
But I want you

198
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:04,834
in constant contact
with CTU.

199
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,134
Right now, Henderson is

200
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:08,434
our primary link to finding
this nerve gas.

201
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:10,834
I know.
I'll get back to you.

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,201
WOMAN:
You've reached the private
client line

203
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:24,568
for Banco Buenos Aires.

204
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,468
Please leave a message
at the tone

205
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:30,501
or press the star button
for immediate assistance.

206
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:32,468
MAN:
Client identification code,
please.

207
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:36,568
Eight-four-seven-seven-C,
as in "Charlie."

208
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,301
How can I help you,
Mr. Henderson?

209
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:39,767
I'd like after-hours access

210
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:42,034
to my personal safety deposit
box, please.

211
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,700
Buchanan.

212
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:49,000
Bill, we found a schematic

213
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,700
of some kind
of ventilation system

214
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,000
on one of the terrorists.

215
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,501
It's from the Suvarov attack.

216
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:55,700
Since that's the most efficient
way to deliver the Sentox,

217
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,534
this could potentially be
their next target.

218
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,767
Do we know what building
the schematic is from?

219
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,501
Not yet. But I sent a copy
off to Building and Safety.

220
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,367
They're running it
against their archive.

221
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:05,733
Upload it to Chloe and Edgar.

222
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,201
I want them
working on this, too.

223
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:08,667
Better make it fast.

224
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,867
There's a number handwritten
in the margin-- 18:00 hours.

225
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:13,733
That means the attack could
happen in the next hour.

226
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,067
Yeah.

227
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,401
That was Curtis.

228
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:19,401
He's going to upload a set
of schematics to our server.

229
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,434
This is the likely target
of their next attack.

230
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,767
There was
a time-stamp on it.

231
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,401
The attack could occur
sometime in the next hour.

232
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,167
Where is it?
We don't know.

233
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,167
The only thing Curtis could tell
at first glance is

234
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:29,434
that it's the ventilation system

235
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,067
in some kind of
industrial building.

236
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:32,201
How big?

237
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:33,900
Big enough to hold
several thousand people.

238
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,101
Let's find it.

239
00:10:36,434 --> 00:10:38,700
How you doing, Tony?

240
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:41,067
Fine.

241
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:44,034
Have you heard anything else
on my wife's condition?

242
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,834
I haven't heard anything new.

243
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,301
Sorry.

244
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,134
( panting )

245
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,367
Tony.

246
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,867
You'll have to get
back to Recovery.

247
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,000
Get away from me.

248
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:03,167
Mr. Almeida, please...
I said get away from me!

249
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:13,034
Tony, come on.

250
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,867
Two cc's of Ativan.

251
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,234
Michelle...

252
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,468
Thank God that
you're all right.
Let go of me, or I'll...

253
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,134
Martha, please...
Listen, don't touch me.

254
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:24,334
Martha, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

255
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:26,134
I didn't think that
I had any choice.

256
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,434
Charles...

257
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:30,700
It isn't just
that you...

258
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:37,800
You didn't stand up to them.

259
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,468
You should have
stood up to them.

260
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,934
Martha...

261
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,201
Yuri, Anya, I can't tell
you how glad I am

262
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,667
that you're
both all right.

263
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:53,767
ANYA:
Thank you.

264
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,667
It was awful.

265
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:57,367
I'm deeply embarrassed that
something like this

266
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:58,834
could happen on U.S. soil,

267
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,767
but I promise you,
whoever did this

268
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,301
will be brought to justice.

269
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:05,034
( speaking Russian )

270
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,934
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,367
Of course.

272
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:14,134
We both know who is
responsible for this.

273
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:18,134
We believe it was the same group
who attacked Ontario Airport

274
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:20,468
this morning, but we thought
that they were all killed

275
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:21,767
in the siege.

276
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,301
Obviously, you were wrong.

277
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:29,733
The situation is much more
serious than you know.

278
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,000
These terrorists have possession
of a military-grade nerve agent.

279
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,434
And they've threatened
to use it

280
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,434
against the civilian
population of Los Angeles.

281
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,733
How long have
you known this?

282
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,067
We just found out
about it.

283
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:41,967
But given this
change of circumstances,

284
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:45,301
I'm asking you to honor
the terms of our treaty.

285
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,767
Allow my intelligence

286
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,667
and law enforcement agencies
access to whatever
intelligence

287
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,568
your security people have
on these separatists.

288
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:55,900
You will have our help.

289
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:57,434
Thank you, sir.

290
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:00,767
Mr. President, I hope
you won't find this offensive,

291
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,267
but there's something
that's been troubling me.

292
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,367
What is it?

293
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,767
Mrs. Logan-- her behavior.

294
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,967
She has not been
herself.

295
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:10,934
I'm sure that she is
very upset

296
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
by what just happened.

297
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,534
Yes, I imagine she would be,

298
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,867
but I noticed this
before the attack.

299
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:20,867
From the time she entered
the car with Anya and me.

300
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,201
Yuri, the truth is, my wife has
been under a doctor's care

301
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,367
for quite a while now.

302
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:30,401
She suffers

303
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:33,867
from depression and anxiety.

304
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,600
It's been very difficult
for both of us.

305
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:39,134
I'm sorry to hear that.

306
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,167
Thank you.

307
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,700
Guard said you wanted to see me?

308
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,600
How long are you going
to keep me here?

309
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,767
You're not going out there
any time today, Lynn.

310
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,134
District Marshal's
reviewing your case.

311
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:02,468
I need to ask you
a favor, Bill.

312
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,301
I know I don't
deserve it.

313
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:06,600
I was unfair to you earlier.

314
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,134
What is it?

315
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,000
I need to make a phone call.

316
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,767
Lynn, if you think you can
get out of this

317
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:12,934
with a few phone calls,
you're mistaken.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I won't let
that happen.

319
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,633
It's not that, I swear it.

320
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,767
I'll give you the number,
you can clear it yourself.

321
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:21,301
What's this about?

322
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:22,733
My sister.

323
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,267
I need to talk to her
about a personal matter.

324
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,501
It can't wait a few hours?

325
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,767
No, it can't.

326
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,101
Bill, please, she's in
a little bit of trouble

327
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,134
and I'm the only one
who can help her.

328
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't need to clear it.

329
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,767
Get Mr. McGill a phone.
Give him some privacy.

330
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:46,867
Thank you.

331
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,667
Thank you.

332
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,900
( phone ringing )

333
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,334
Hello.

334
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,800
Jenny, it's me.

335
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:07,000
Listen, I don't care
that you took my wallet.

336
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,201
Keep everything
that's in there.

337
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,267
I just need to get
my key card back.

338
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,501
What key card?

339
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:14,167
My CTU access card.

340
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,767
It's of no value to you.
It just lets me in and
out of this building.

341
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,800
Well, can't you just get them
to give you a new one?

342
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:21,301
I mean, that's what I did
when I lost the key

343
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:22,767
to my laundry room.

344
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,633
Damn it, Jenny, this isn't
a laundry room.

345
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,134
This is a secure
government building.

346
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:29,267
Now, if you don't want
me to call the police,

347
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,967
you'll get me back
the key card today.

348
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:32,301
You hear me?

349
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,900
Yeah, I do.

350
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,234
Listen, I got to go.

351
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,468
Where's that card
from Lynn's wallet?

352
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:44,834
Why?

353
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,633
'Cause I want to give him back
his key card.

354
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,334
We don't need it.

355
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,234
That's how I'm getting us
all this money.

356
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,434
You told me we were just
going to take his cash

357
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:53,568
and a credit card.

358
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:54,900
Yeah, we're taking
a credit card.

359
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:57,501
$20,000
line of credit,

360
00:17:57,568 --> 00:17:59,101
right here.

361
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:01,201
$20,000?

362
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,867
Who's going to pay you

363
00:18:03,934 --> 00:18:06,534
that kind of money?

364
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:19,367
Yes, Mr. President?

365
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,367
I'd like to speak
with my wife.

366
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,234
I'm sorry, sir.
She asked to be left alone.

367
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:25,134
Evelyn, I want
to see my wife now.

368
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,167
Move away from the door.

369
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:27,201
Sir, she ordered me

370
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,434
not to let anyone in.

371
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,167
I'm not anyone, Evelyn.

372
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:32,301
I know, sir,

373
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:34,401
but she specifically
mentioned you.

374
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:41,534
I have to get to a meeting.

375
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,934
Would you please tell my wife

376
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,733
that I would like
to speak with her?

377
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,501
Of course, Mr. President.

378
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,067
Thank you.

379
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:04,767
I'd like you to find
Aaron Pierce right now.

380
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,767
I want to know
how he's doing.

381
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,134
Is there a message

382
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,568
you want me
to get to him?

383
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:11,967
If he's all right, tell him
I'd like to see him.

384
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,767
Chloe, come here.

385
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:18,167
I think I got a match.

386
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:19,568
There's a discrepancy here.

387
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,267
That's because they're from
two different layers.

388
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,301
The one Curtis had
was structural,

389
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:24,867
but this is an
electrical blueprint.

390
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,468
You're right.
Mr. Buchanan.

391
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,633
Edgar matched the schematics
we got from Curtis.

392
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,867
Where is it?
Tyler Memorial.

393
00:19:30,934 --> 00:19:32,301
Westwood.

394
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,134
A hospital.

395
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,633
Tell Curtis to activate
a tac team.

396
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,334
I'll call Tyler Memorial,
tell them to evacuate.

397
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,934
This is Bauer.
I'm on-site

398
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,234
at the Henderson house.
Do you copy?

399
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:33,967
Jack, we found intel in the body
of a dead terrorist.

400
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,733
There is going
to be an attack.

401
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,767
Where?

402
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:37,867
Tyler Memorial Hospital.

403
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,301
We think it's happening
within the hour.

404
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:40,834
Okay, I copy.

405
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,367
I'm moving in now.

406
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:15,967
Miriam...

407
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:17,000
AUDREY:
Who?

408
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,134
Christopher's wife.

409
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,468
He's not here.

410
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:20,767
Tell Chloe I'll get
back to her

411
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:22,468
as soon as I have access
to his computer.

412
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:23,667
All right, we're on it.

413
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:27,867
This is Curtis Manning with CTU.

414
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:30,167
I need to speak to the ranking
security officer on site.

415
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:31,667
You're talking to him.
Tom Wegman.

416
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,501
Mr. Wegman, I'm heading to you
now with a tactical team.

417
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:36,234
The nerve gas will
most likely be released

418
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:37,367
into a ventilation unit.

419
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,267
You need to seal off
the sub-basement.

420
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:40,967
I've called in a second
security shift.

421
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,700
Good.
We'll get that area locked down.

422
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,201
How long before
the hospital's evacuated?

423
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,101
Uh, an hour, maybe two.

424
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:48,067
This attack could occur
within the next 30 minutes.

425
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:50,301
This is a large facility,
Agent Manning.

426
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:53,568
We have 600 patients,
many of whom need assistance.

427
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:54,767
Mr. Wegman,

428
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,633
if this nerve agent
is released

429
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,867
into the ventilation system,

430
00:21:57,934 --> 00:22:00,367
everyone inside that building
will die.

431
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:01,767
Do what you have to do,

432
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,934
but get those people
out of that building.

433
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,367
Right.

434
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:19,267
Hello, Miriam.

435
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:22,967
Oh, my God.

436
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,800
We thought you were dead.

437
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,900
Where is he?

438
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:29,067
What are you doing, Jack?

439
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,733
Miriam, where's Christopher?

440
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,134
He's still at work.

441
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:36,568
Did he call you?

442
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:38,700
You're scaring me.

443
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:39,900
In the last hour,

444
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:40,900
has he called you?!

445
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:41,967
No.

446
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:46,667
Now tell me
what the hell is going on.

447
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:47,867
I need to see
his computer.

448
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,401
What are you doing?

449
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:51,934
Where is his computer?!

450
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,267
I'm not going to tell you
anything until you tell me

451
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:57,767
what is going on.

452
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,301
Christopher developed
a chemical weapons system

453
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:04,301
called Sentox-VX nerve gas
for Omicron.

454
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,267
He enabled terrorists
to gain control of it,

455
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,700
now it's being used
against civilian targets

456
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:08,767
in Los Angeles.

457
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:12,234
So where is his
computer?!

458
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:13,568
Miriam,
I am telling you

459
00:23:13,667 --> 00:23:14,800
the truth.

460
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:17,101
We have proof
that he brokered

461
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,067
the deal.

462
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,267
That's impossible.

463
00:23:19,334 --> 00:23:22,167
Less than an hour ago
he tried to kill me.

464
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:27,568
Move towards the living room.

465
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,334
Keep walking
towards the den.

466
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:41,434
I want you to take
a seat on the couch.

467
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:43,667
Look, why don't we
just call him?

468
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:45,667
I'm sure there's an explanation.

469
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,867
Miriam, take a seat.

470
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,700
You don't need
the gun, Jack.

471
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,101
You're not going
to shoot me.

472
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,468
Chloe, it's Jack.

473
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,401
I need access
to Henderson's hard drive.

474
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:19,000
I need you to talk me
through it.

475
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:25,034
( knocking )

476
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:26,101
Yes?

477
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,934
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,900
Oh, yes, Aaron, come in.

479
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,468
I-I didn't really get a chance
to say thank you before.

480
00:24:39,534 --> 00:24:41,600
You saved my life.

481
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:42,667
I know that you'll say

482
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,568
it was all just
in the line of duty.

483
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:47,800
You're welcome.

484
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:58,401
The country's lucky
to have men like you.

485
00:24:58,468 --> 00:25:00,568
I'm lucky.

486
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,468
I hope you'll allow me
to say that.

487
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,267
NOVICK:
Mrs. Logan.

488
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:26,434
Would you excuse us,
Aaron?

489
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:32,534
What is it, Mike?

490
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,334
The President's been
trying to reach you.

491
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,600
I know.

492
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,834
But I don't want

493
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,900
to see him.

494
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:42,501
Would you like me
to convey that

495
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:43,568
to the President?

496
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:46,267
You can convey
whatever you want, Mike.

497
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,800
Mike...

498
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:02,934
Mike, I want you
to know nothing
happened in there.

499
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,934
Whatever didn't happen,

500
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,700
make sure it doesn't happen
again.

501
00:26:12,534 --> 00:26:14,834
( indistinct
radio transmission )

502
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:26,501
Manning?

503
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,034
Yeah.

504
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:30,067
Tom Wegman,
hospital security.

505
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:31,600
Thanks for mobilizing
your people so quickly.

506
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:32,934
Have you uplinked
with CTU yet?

507
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,134
We're doing that now.

508
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,067
We've doubled security
at all sub-basement

509
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:37,534
ingress points.

510
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,401
Nobody's getting down there
unless they go through us.

511
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:40,534
Good.

512
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,800
The bad news is we have
26 patients in ICU

513
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,067
that can't be moved.

514
00:26:44,134 --> 00:26:46,301
Seven of them are
high-dependency newborns.

515
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,700
We can't even
relocate them

516
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,201
without the
specialized transport units

517
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:50,568
which we don't
have on site.

518
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:51,900
What about nearby
hospitals?

519
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:54,867
All neonatal transport units
are in service.

520
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:56,201
All right, thanks.

521
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:58,267
I want a visual sweep of all
high-probability target points

522
00:26:58,334 --> 00:26:59,301
within the hospital.

523
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,800
Team A, start
at the north end,

524
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:03,534
Team B take south. Move.

525
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,034
It's Viktor.

526
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:35,534
I'm at the hospital.

527
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,234
And why are you calling me?

528
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:38,934
They must have found out
about the attack.

529
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,900
The hospital's being evacuated.

530
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:41,800
All of the elevators and

531
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:43,401
stairwells are guarded.

532
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:44,434
Calm down, Viktor.

533
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,301
Bring up the schematics
of the hospital.

534
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:56,034
There's another entrance
to the sub-basement.

535
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:57,767
An electrical conduit.

536
00:27:57,834 --> 00:27:59,134
There's a good chance
it isn't guarded.

537
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:01,067
How do I find it?

538
00:28:01,134 --> 00:28:02,633
In the Radiology wing
down corridor six.

539
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,800
Call us when
you're there.

540
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:04,834
We'll talk you
through it.

541
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,468
I'll call you
in a few minutes.

542
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:10,900
Viktor, I need you
to finish this task,

543
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,633
even if it means
you don't get out.

544
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,101
DOD just concluded a briefing
with Russian Intelligence.

545
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,367
We were given a name.

546
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,000
Vladimir Bierko.

547
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:38,134
He made billions in the
post-Soviet economy--

548
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:39,667
weapons and oil.

549
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,900
He bankrolled several
underground radical publications

550
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:42,967
promoting the separatist cause,

551
00:28:43,034 --> 00:28:44,334
but it's believed
that he was more

552
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:45,568
than just a sympathizer.

553
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:48,134
The Russians think he's
financing these attacks?

554
00:28:48,201 --> 00:28:50,700
They think that he's directing
the attacks himself.

555
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:51,800
Based on what?

556
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,600
A number of communiques
that were intercepted

557
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,101
by Russian security force,

558
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,667
supported by the fact
that Bierko vanished
from Russia

559
00:28:57,733 --> 00:28:59,167
three months ago.

560
00:28:59,234 --> 00:29:01,767
We posted Bierko's profile
to the interagency servers.

561
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:04,134
Homeland Security has issued
an emergency brief

562
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,767
to local law enforcement.

563
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:07,301
Do you think there's any hope
of finding him

564
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,767
before the attack
on Tyler Hospital?

565
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,733
The most promising lead we have

566
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,667
is a man named
Christopher Henderson.

567
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,733
Unfortunately, he escaped.

568
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,667
Jack Bauer believes there may be
files on Henderson's computer

569
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:18,934
that could lead us to Bierko.

570
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,967
He's trying to acquire those
files now, sir.

571
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:23,501
Well, let's hope he succeeds,
Bill.

572
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:26,367
The country's already suffered
three devastating attacks today.

573
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:28,767
We need to stop this madman.

574
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,000
Yes, Mr. President.

575
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,434
Chloe, it's Jack.
Have you found anything yet?

576
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:37,834
The only thing on Henderson's
hard drive is domestic stuff:

577
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,468
bill-paying programs,
downloaded music.

578
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:41,234
Chloe, Henderson isn't
trading music files
with his office.

579
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:43,600
There's something else
on the computer. Find it.

580
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,067
I'm doing the best I can.

581
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:46,633
Why don't you
face it, Jack?

582
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,167
Christopher is innocent.

583
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:50,267
He was innocent when you forced
him out of CTU,

584
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:51,401
and he's innocent now.

585
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:53,301
Maybe you didn't hear me
earlier, Miriam,

586
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:54,434
he tried to kill me.

587
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,000
If he did, then he was
defending himself.

588
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:58,568
No, he blew up the server room
at Omicron

589
00:29:58,633 --> 00:29:59,733
while I was still inside.

590
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,867
He was destroying
evidence that would

591
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,401
have implicated him
in this conspiracy.

592
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,800
This is so familiar.

593
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:07,501
You're accusing him
of being a criminal.

594
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:09,034
Why do you hate him so much?

595
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:12,700
I want you to know
something.

596
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,867
Chris never hated you,

597
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,301
not even after
what you did to him.

598
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:18,468
When he thought
you were dead,

599
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:20,600
he looked in on Kim.

600
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:21,834
He cared
about your daughter, Jack,

601
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,267
just like he cared about you.

602
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:25,101
We both did. You know that.

603
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:27,067
CHLOE:
I found something, Jack.

604
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:28,101
What is it?

605
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,667
It's a shadow drive.

606
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:31,067
It was partitioned from the
primary hard drive.

607
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:32,401
What's on the shadow drive?

608
00:30:32,468 --> 00:30:34,301
A backup log that contains
data points

609
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:35,967
for every satellite phone call
Henderson has made

610
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,034
in the last year.

611
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:38,367
Can you cross-reference
those numbers

612
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:39,834
with the telephone numbers
the terrorists used

613
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,000
earlier this morning?

614
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:42,401
I got into the log,

615
00:30:42,468 --> 00:30:44,201
but the phone lists
are password-protected.

616
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,568
Hold on.

617
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:46,867
Christopher had
a secret file on
his computer.

618
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:48,334
There's a list of numbers.

619
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,900
And that implicates him?

620
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,733
We need access to that list.

621
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,034
Do you know
the password?

622
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,401
No, I don't.

623
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:56,401
Miriam, we believe there's going
to be another attack

624
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:57,434
within 30 minutes.

625
00:30:57,501 --> 00:31:00,067
Thousands of lives
are at stake.

626
00:31:00,134 --> 00:31:04,034
Please, if you know
that password, I need it now.

627
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:07,600
I can't help you.

628
00:31:13,101 --> 00:31:16,367
Chloe, you're going to have
to try and hack into it.

629
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,301
I'll see what I can do.
Hurry.

630
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:23,201
I'll show this
to Manning. Good work.

631
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:24,568
Agent Manning?

632
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,101
One of our guards caught this.

633
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:29,401
This guy's dressed
as an orderly,

634
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:31,267
but I've never
seen him before.

635
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:35,101
An orderly has no business
being where he is.

636
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,401
That was five minutes ago.

637
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:37,401
Where is this?

638
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:38,534
Sub-basement.

639
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,267
Team A, meet me in the southeast
stairwell.

640
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:41,600
Team B, form a soft perimeter.

641
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:42,900
We have a possible suspect
in play.

642
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,934
CTU, did you copy that?
Yes, we copy.

643
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,501
Edgar, I need you to uplink
the hospital video surveillance

644
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:49,034
for facial recognition software.

645
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:51,334
See if you can get a match.

646
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:02,600
Curtis has a suspect.

647
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:04,534
We're running the image
through facial recognition.

648
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,667
Halfway through the database.

649
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,767
Got something.

650
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:09,600
All right, put it up.

651
00:32:09,667 --> 00:32:10,800
Curtis, we have a suspect.

652
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,000
His name is Viktor Grigorin.

653
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,334
He's a Russian national.

654
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:17,468
Served time for drug smuggling
and weapons trafficking.

655
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:19,434
Copy that.

656
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:21,934
All teams, suspect
is a confirmed hostile.

657
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,967
Repeat:
a confirmed hostile.

658
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,401
( faint clattering )

659
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,267
Freeze!

660
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,733
Don't move!

661
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,034
Agent Manning, you need
to come look at this.

662
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:45,000
Search him.

663
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,733
Don't! It might be set to
go off if it's moved.

664
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Chemical Response Team,
we need you down here now.

665
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:25,633
All teams,

666
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,401
we've located
the canister,
and it is on.

667
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:02,267
CTU, Chemical Response Team
is on the way in.

668
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,234
The hospital evacuation
is still in progress.

669
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,867
There are still
a lot of people in here.

670
00:35:05,934 --> 00:35:07,167
Copy that, Curtis.

671
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:10,834
Edgar, notify LAPD
and all relevant agencies.

672
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,834
I want a mandatory evacuation
of the downtown core.

673
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,733
Yes, sir.

674
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:19,201
Jack, Henderson is using
an interlaced encryption key.

675
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,334
What does that mean?

676
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,800
It could take me
a half a day to crack it.

677
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:24,733
Damn it, Chloe, we don't
have that kind of time.

678
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,334
I'm sorry. It's a little tougher
than it looked

679
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,867
at first glance, okay?

680
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah. All right.

681
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:30,867
Jack, you should know
that Curtis and his team

682
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:32,834
intercepted a terrorist
at the hospital.

683
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,267
Did they take him
into custody?

684
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:35,501
No. He's dead.

685
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,101
But they found
a nerve gas canister.

686
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,167
They're trying to disarm it now.

687
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:42,468
There are patients there
that can't be evacuated.

688
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:43,900
Chloe, listen to me.

689
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,568
There's nothing you can do
about the hospital.

690
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:46,834
There's still 18 canisters
out there.

691
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,700
I need you to
stay focused.

692
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:49,700
I know.

693
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,067
If I got you
more personnel,

694
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,568
would that help you
crack the code faster?

695
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:54,767
I've already got three analysts
working on it, Jack.

696
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,401
Miriam?

697
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,867
Miriam? Honey, I want you
to pack a bag.

698
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:02,034
I want you...

699
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:05,501
Don't you move!

700
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,101
Miriam, sit back down!

701
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,733
Put your hands
behind your head.

702
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,900
Get back up on your knees.

703
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:14,468
Now!

704
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:17,700
I want you to
handcuff yourself.

705
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,267
Behind your back.

706
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,534
Get up.

707
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,900
Take a seat
next to Miriam

708
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,101
on the couch.

709
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,501
You okay, honey?

710
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:34,367
Okay.

711
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:36,401
How do I find the nerve gas?

712
00:36:36,468 --> 00:36:38,201
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

713
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:38,967
Where is it?

714
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,101
That's right, Jack.

715
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:41,434
Start at my knee,
just like I taught you.

716
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:42,733
Sooner you do it,
sooner you'll see

717
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,633
I don't know what
you're talking about.

718
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,900
Where is it?!

719
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:46,800
He doesn't know, Jack!
He doesn't know!

720
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,067
For God's sake, leave him alone!

721
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:51,134
Christopher, CTU found

722
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:52,733
one of the canisters
at Tyler Memorial

723
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,501
Hospital.
It's armed!

724
00:36:54,568 --> 00:36:56,434
People are going to start dying.

725
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:57,733
How do I find
the nerve gas?

726
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,900
Jack, leave him alone!

727
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,800
He doesn't
know anything!

728
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:06,501
You really trust him?

729
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,468
Ask him what's
in the briefcase.

730
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,067
Unlock it!

731
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,434
Ask him what

732
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:39,501
he's doing with all the money!

733
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:40,934
Ask him!

734
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,134
Christopher?

735
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:43,568
Is this true?

736
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,733
Have you been lying
to me all this time?

737
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,167
I've been protecting you
all this time.

738
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:49,000
By lying?
It's not that
simple, Miriam.

739
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,633
I defended you.
I defended you, too,

740
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
against things you would not
want to know because
I love you, Miriam.

741
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:55,334
There's not one thing I've done
out of self-interest or greed.

742
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:56,633
Even when they

743
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,134
fired me--
even when they framed me--

744
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,334
I served my country.

745
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:00,867
I don't care how you

746
00:38:00,934 --> 00:38:02,067
justify this.

747
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:03,067
I am out of time.

748
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,234
You are going to tell me now

749
00:38:04,301 --> 00:38:05,967
how to find the rest
of the nerve gas.

750
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,234
Oh, go ahead
and do it, Jack.

751
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:08,334
Get it done.
Shoot me.

752
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:09,867
Kneecap me.

753
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:11,568
Go ahead and do it. Do it!

754
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:15,334
( shot fires )
( screams )

755
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,101
You son of a bitch!

756
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,334
I shot her above the kneecap!

757
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:20,034
Son of a bitch!
She can still walk!

758
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,167
You make me shoot her again,
she'll be in a wheelchair for

759
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:23,401
the rest of her life!
Damn you!

760
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,434
Where do I find the nerve gas?!

761
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:28,101
Damn you!

762
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,667
Where is it?

763
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,334
Please, please, baby.

764
00:38:32,401 --> 00:38:34,201
Don't you make me do this.

765
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:35,867
Tell him what he wants to know.

766
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:37,733
I can't.

767
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,700
I can't.

768
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:40,733
Forgive me,

769
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,534
Miriam. I can't.

770
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,600
You son of a bitch.

771
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:51,034
( gasping )

772
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:53,834
You don't care about anybody.

773
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,800
Not even her.

774
00:38:58,034 --> 00:38:59,267
Chloe, this is Jack.

775
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:02,301
I need an ambulance on site.
I repeat:

776
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,733
I need an ambulance
on site.

777
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,733
Miriam Henderson's
been shot in the leg.

778
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,067
I'm bringing
Christopher Henderson

779
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:08,867
in to CTU.
It's all right.

780
00:39:08,934 --> 00:39:10,167
I'll need an interrogation room
prepped,

781
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:12,700
and a medic standing by
with hyocine-pentothal.

782
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,834
It'll be ready
when you get here.

783
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,867
You okay, Jack?

784
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:15,867
Yeah, I'm fine.

785
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,201
Just get the
ambulance here now.

786
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:18,267
Team's on its way.

787
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:20,367
Put Buchanan on.

788
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:22,234
Mr. Buchanan,
Jack's on line one.

789
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,967
Jack, it's Bill.

790
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:26,134
What's happening
at the hospital?

791
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:28,034
There's a CRT team on site.

792
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,967
Stand by, Jack.

793
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,234
Curtis, what's your status?

794
00:39:32,301 --> 00:39:34,334
We're still trying
to defuse the detonator.

795
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:37,301
Look what we found
on the hostile.

796
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,967
Hold on, Bill.

797
00:39:40,034 --> 00:39:42,134
It's a remote timing display.

798
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:44,767
Can we defuse the detonator?

799
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:45,900
Not in 60 seconds.

800
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,401
We'll have to get it
out of here.

801
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,600
It could go off
if we move it.

802
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:50,934
( wheezing breaths )

803
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,234
It's a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

804
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:55,234
All teams, we're moving
the canister

805
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:57,034
to the containment unit.

806
00:39:57,101 --> 00:40:00,101
All right, go, go, go, go, go!

807
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,301
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Move, move!

808
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,667
All right, clear off!

809
00:40:18,733 --> 00:40:19,700
Clear off!

810
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:23,201
Go, go, go!

811
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:26,034
Get out of the way!

812
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:28,167
Everybody clear!

813
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:32,201
Go, go, go!

814
00:40:34,234 --> 00:40:37,034
All right,
get 'em out of the way!

815
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,000
Move!

816
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:41,367
Move, move!

817
00:40:41,434 --> 00:40:43,267
Get that door open!

818
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,134
( grunting )

819
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:52,800
Come on!
Get that thing sealed!

820
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:08,234
We're clear!

821
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,534
CTU...

822
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,633
the canister detonated inside
a containment unit.

823
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,867
The hospital's safe.

824
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:18,367
Good work, Curtis.

825
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:24,067
( muffled whimpering )

826
00:41:28,934 --> 00:41:30,900
( silenced shot fires )
( screams )

827
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:35,800
( whimpers )

828
00:41:35,867 --> 00:41:37,301
( silenced shot fires )

829
00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:50,534
I have the key card.

830
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,067
How long will it take for you to
reprogram it?

831
00:41:53,134 --> 00:41:55,733
Five minutes.
Then we will be able to use it

832
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,834
to access CTU.

833
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,301
Good.
