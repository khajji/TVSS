1
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,868
Has Bauer arrived at CTU?

2
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:16,300
No, not yet.

3
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,834
I need you to clear an entrance.

4
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,000
Why are you tracking
Jack Bauer?

5
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:20,968
What the hell's going on here,
Spenser?

6
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,501
I was following orders.

7
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,667
I'm sure if they're tracking
Jack Bauer, they have a reason.

8
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:26,033
BAUER:
This man is
a professional assassin.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,367
He just killed Dr. Paulson.

10
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:28,400
He tried to kill me.

11
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:29,601
Did you let him into CTU?!

12
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:31,300
They told me he was here

13
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:32,901
to place a tap
on one of the servers.

14
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:34,868
That's all I knew.
Who told you?

15
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,501
The White House.

16
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,834
Mr. Gomez.

17
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:41,534
David Palmer was murdered
because he was about to expose

18
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,901
Walt Cummings' connection
to the terrorists.

19
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:45,067
You want the nerve gas?
Cummings is your connection.

20
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:47,167
McGILL:
Cummings is the President's
chief adviser.

21
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,367
How exactly do you suggest

22
00:00:48,434 --> 00:00:49,634
we get to him?

23
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,834
I could secretly meet
with Mike Novick.

24
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:52,834
JACK:
Who did you tell?

25
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:54,067
Who did you tell?!

26
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,133
I didn't tell anybody, Jack!

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,167
Tell your men to stand down!

28
00:00:57,234 --> 00:00:58,534
I'm sorry, sir.
We can't do that.

29
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,734
Put your hands
in the air!

30
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:02,901
Sentox gas is being
smuggled out of the country

31
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:04,934
by separatists who think
they're going to use it

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,334
against the Russians.

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,934
However, that nerve gas

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,067
will never reach Russian soil.

35
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,501
And you know this how?

36
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,400
We control the remote detonators
on those gas canisters.

37
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,133
As soon as they've reached
the terrorist base,

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,534
we'll trigger the canisters
by satellite

39
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:17,567
and release the gas.

40
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:18,834
You're a traitor.

41
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,400
You'll let things
play out as they are.

42
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,834
Otherwise,
your administration
will be implicated,

43
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:26,167
and your presidency
will be destroyed.

44
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:27,234
Mr. President,

45
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,534
my name is Jack Bauer

46
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:30,934
and I'm sorry to have
to confront you like this.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,601
But your Chief of Staff
is withholding information

48
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,234
that is vital
to this nation's security.

49
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:38,634
Stop this!

50
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,501
I'm done talking with you.
You understand me?

51
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,734
So for the last time,
where is the nerve gas?

52
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:46,434
Stop! Stop!

53
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,267
Stop! Stop!
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you!

54
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:49,567
It's on a freighter

55
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:51,534
leaving the port of Long Beach
at 2:30.

56
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,400
CTU, we've located
the target container.

57
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:54,367
No hostiles present.

58
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,367
You have a green light.

59
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:57,634
Take possession
of the canister.

60
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,467
Open 'em up. Let's go.
Open 'em all up.

61
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:01,801
Empty. Next. Moving on.

62
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,701
What do we got, nothing?!

63
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:06,200
There are no gas canisters
here, CTU.

64
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,734
The nerve gas is not here.

65
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:09,367
Where are the canisters?

66
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:11,100
I've told you everything.

67
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:14,834
We know you've altered
the arming codes, Mr. Cummings.

68
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,234
Erwich, listen.

69
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,434
We can negotiate something.

70
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,267
I don't negotiate
with my enemies.

71
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:21,133
I eliminate them.

72
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,968
Your country is about to pay

73
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:27,300
a very steep price
for betraying us.

74
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:37,734
I was approached six months ago
by a man named James Nathanson.

75
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:38,734
He was my contact.

76
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:39,834
Who is he?

77
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,067
Former CIA.

78
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:43,000
Said he was recruiting
like-minded individuals

79
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,234
for this initiative.

80
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,367
"Initiative."

81
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,434
Is that what you call this?

82
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,334
You helped terrorists
acquire weaponized nerve gas!

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,968
I told you we were gonna
trigger the canisters

84
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:56,501
once the separatists reached
their base in Central Asia.

85
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,067
This was not
supposed to happen.

86
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,501
But it happened!

87
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,634
You got into bed with these
people, and now they're

88
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,601
threatening to use the gas
on American citizens!

89
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,167
Oh, you make it sound like
our goal was to kill Americans!

90
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:07,968
What the hell was
your goal, Walt?

91
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,968
Explain that to me.

92
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:14,534
We're patriots, Mr. President.

93
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:16,734
We were acting in the best
interests of this country.

94
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:21,367
How is any of this
in our best interest?

95
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,701
Shoring up a strategic partner

96
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,667
in the war on terror,

97
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:26,367
ensuring a stable flow of oil.

98
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,467
How is any of that not
in our national interest?

99
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:31,467
WOMAN:
Chloe O'Brian's on the line.

100
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,634
Chloe, are you set up
for the trace?

101
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,200
All set, Jack.

102
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:37,000
We're ready to call Nathanson.

103
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,667
How long do I have
to keep him on the line?

104
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:39,968
Until I give you a signal.

105
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,234
Chloe, dial the number.

106
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:48,100
The line's been
disconnected, Jack.

107
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,901
There's nothing to grab onto.

108
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:51,234
They must know
something went wrong.

109
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,868
He's gone dark.

110
00:03:52,934 --> 00:03:54,300
Damn it, Walt!
I don't want

111
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,567
this weapon deployed on US soil
any more than you do,

112
00:03:56,634 --> 00:04:00,234
but Nathanson cannot help you
now and neither can I.

113
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,667
These terrorists
are operating on their own.

114
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. President, I think
he's telling the truth.

115
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,067
He can't help us, not anymore.

116
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:18,901
Aaron, get him out of here.

117
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,767
Yes, sir.

118
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,167
Jack.

119
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:37,200
What do we do now?

120
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,300
I need to be debriefed.

121
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,701
After that, I'm leaving, sir.

122
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,100
Given the current situation,

123
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:43,300
things have become
more complicated.

124
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,834
CTU is gonna have
to be responsible

125
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,767
for the retrieval
of the canisters.

126
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,267
Why are you leaving?

127
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,567
Sir, I have a daughter

128
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:52,501
that doesn't know
that I'm still alive.

129
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,634
If I have to disappear again,
in all fairness to her,

130
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:57,834
I don't think she should know.

131
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:00,734
Jack, terrorists just threatened

132
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,267
to deploy chemical weapons
on US soil.

133
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,634
They have the ability
to kill millions of people.

134
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,033
I understand that,
Mr. President,

135
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,767
and I believe that
CTU can handle this.

136
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,100
Jack, your experience can make

137
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,067
a crucial difference
in stopping them.

138
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:20,067
Look... you and I have
a complicated history.

139
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,100
I realize that.

140
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,000
And I'm not naive enough
to expect

141
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,634
any special personal
allegiance from you.

142
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,334
But I know your respect
for this office

143
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,667
and your concern
for this country

144
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:30,901
is just as strong
as it was when you served

145
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:33,868
under David Palmer.

146
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,601
I'm asking for your help,

147
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,200
just until this crisis is over.

148
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,834
I will reinstate you.

149
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:39,834
I will give you

150
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:40,968
all the support you need.

151
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,167
Mr. President, you and I...

152
00:05:42,234 --> 00:05:43,534
Jack, please!

153
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:46,801
For God's sake, we need
to recover this nerve gas

154
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:52,334
before it's too late.

155
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:58,634
Micro-circuitry on this remote
has been tampered with.

156
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,400
As far as I can tell,
unless we can repair it,

157
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:02,734
we can't arm the canisters.

158
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:05,501
Rossler will have a way.

159
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,968
He should have called by now.

160
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,534
Our real enemy is Russia.

161
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,400
We should be figuring out
another way to get back home,

162
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,734
not wasting time trying to use
the gas against the Americans.

163
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:21,634
Question my orders again,
and I will kill you.

164
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,701
Do you understand?

165
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,834
They've closed the ports.

166
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,601
They will hunt us
until they find us.

167
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,934
So if we cannot use
the gas against Russia,

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,067
we will use it against America.

169
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:37,300
Get up.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,334
( phone rings )

171
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,334
Hello?

172
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,934
Lynn?

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,033
Jenny, now is a really bad time.

174
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,167
Yeah, I know you're busy,

175
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:54,868
but I need to see you, please.

176
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:56,501
What is it?

177
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,767
I need some help.

178
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:00,300
You mean money.

179
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,767
Lynn, I'm clean.

180
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:06,234
I'm working two jobs
and busting my ass

181
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,834
to put my life back together.

182
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:09,567
How much?

183
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,367
$500.

184
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,734
Can I, can I come over there?

185
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,534
Absolutely not.

186
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,968
Why?

187
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:19,200
Are you afraid
I'll embarrass you?

188
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, I am.

189
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,767
Lynn, I got nobody else
to turn to.

190
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:28,801
You know, I can't go back
on the street again.

191
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:29,901
If you don't help me,

192
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,501
I swear I'm going
to hurt myself.

193
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,868
For God's sakes, Lynn,
I'm your sister.

194
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,767
All right, listen.

195
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,767
Jenny, listen.

196
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,000
There's a parking lot
across the street from CTU.

197
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,200
I'll meet you there
in 20 minutes.

198
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:44,567
Okay.

199
00:07:44,634 --> 00:07:46,734
Thank you, Lynn.

200
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,300
( sighs )

201
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,767
Sorry I'm late.

202
00:07:57,834 --> 00:07:59,567
BUCHANAN:
I was just explaining that

203
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:01,634
Cummings provided us
with a schematic

204
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,934
of one of the canisters.

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,501
Triggering mechanisms

206
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:08,868
on the canisters can only be
activated via satellite relay.

207
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:10,801
Cummings says the terrorists
have been given

208
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:12,334
invalid detonation codes.

209
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,067
Then these canisters
are useless to them.

210
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:15,334
Unless they can find a way

211
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,634
to control
the triggering mechanism.

212
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,734
McGILL:
Are we running
evacuation scenarios?

213
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,467
Evacuation isn't feasible,

214
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:22,434
not without a time frame
or a target.

215
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,934
Erwich's threat was
intentionally vague.

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,934
What are we doing to track
these canisters?

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,968
Chloe?

218
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,067
I pulled a voice print

219
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,434
from Erwich's call to Cummings

220
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,367
and I'm doing a scan
of all satcom chatter.

221
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:35,100
If Erwich is in contact
with anyone on that bandwidth,

222
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,267
we should be able to intercept
and trace the call.

223
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,701
We better get lucky

224
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:41,234
'cause we just got a new
assessment from Civil Defense.

225
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,901
They're estimating that the
nerve gas from each canister

226
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,734
will create kill zones between
one and three square miles.

227
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:49,934
The terrorists are
in possession of 20 canisters.

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,968
We're talking about
potential casualties

229
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:55,133
in the hundreds of thousands,
perhaps over a million.

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,334
( phone rings )

231
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,501
Yeah?

232
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,267
Ivan Erwich?

233
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,267
Go ahead.

234
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,968
Jacob Rossler.

235
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,667
I was asked to call you
by a friend in Moscow.

236
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:09,868
You've been briefed
on our situation?

237
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:11,968
You need to reconfigure

238
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:15,934
the remote trigger for an Aatox
chemical delivery system, right?

239
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,033
Yes.

240
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,901
You have the canisters
with you?

241
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:20,200
Yes.

242
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,801
You'll need to start
by cutting into them.

243
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:25,200
Listen carefully
to my instructions.

244
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,834
( phone rings )

245
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,000
O'Brian.

246
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,334
WOMAN:
We just got a pattern match.

247
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
Send me the hit.

248
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:36,334
All interagency search protocols
are being run through CTU.

249
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,367
Ken, no one is
going around you.

250
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:39,434
All right, I'll make sure

251
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:40,901
that you're apprised
in real time.

252
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,968
Audrey, I thought
you should know.

253
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,133
Logan has asked Jack

254
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,901
to be reinstated
on a provisional basis.

255
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:47,834
He's been given
full autonomy and access.

256
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,200
We got a possible intercept
on Erwich.

257
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:50,801
This just happened.

258
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:52,400
ROSSLER:
On the inner casing,

259
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:56,200
you will find a display window
with a seven-digit readout.

260
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:57,868
I'll need them.

261
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,467
ERWICH:
And then what?

262
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:02,033
ROSSLER:
I will program a new chip
for your remote trigger.

263
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,067
Put me through to Jack Bauer.

264
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,734
Voice print is a 95% match.
It's Erwich.

265
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,000
EDGAR:
He was on a sat-phone.

266
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,367
I can't trace it,

267
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:12,400
but the call originated
from a landline downtown.

268
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:16,567
This is Bauer.

269
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,767
Jack, we may have
a lead on Erwich.

270
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:19,934
I'm listening.

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
We intercepted a call
between Erwich

272
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,400
and an unknown associate.

273
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:24,667
We weren't able
to trace Erwich,

274
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:25,901
but we may have a location

275
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:26,934
for the associate.

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,701
22 North Figueroa,
a penthouse.

277
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,067
Chloe, bring up
the building manifest.

278
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:32,501
See who's in there.
On it.

279
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,033
From what we heard,
Erwich is trying to acquire

280
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,567
some kind of activation code.

281
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:38,834
Yeah, he's trying to reconfigure
the trigger mechanism

282
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:41,234
so he can disperse the Sentox.

283
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,701
Bill, we're running out of time.

284
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,934
Okay, the penthouse is leased

285
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,467
to a man named Jacob Rossler.

286
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:47,501
Cross-checking.

287
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:48,834
He's a software programmer

288
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:50,033
indicted for high
security code infiltration,

289
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,400
identity theft.

290
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:52,734
Never convicted.

291
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,634
Okay, I'm gonna need
schematics on the building

292
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,234
and vectors for every entrance.

293
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,267
We'll have it for you
by the time you get there.

294
00:10:58,334 --> 00:10:59,868
Bill, we're going to need
to go in covertly.

295
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,033
Have Curtis meet me
at the location

296
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,400
with a small team of four.

297
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,467
But tell them
to stay out of sight
until I get there.

298
00:11:04,534 --> 00:11:05,501
Right.

299
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:06,567
We'll be in touch.

300
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,033
This is our
new destination.

301
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,934
They'll clear
a landing zone for you.

302
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:14,968
Mr. Buchanan, this building's
security system

303
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,701
uses proprietary technology.

304
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:17,767
It's a high-end platform.

305
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,100
It's a bitch
to hack into,

306
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,434
especially with
the time constraints
we're under.

307
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:21,601
So, get Edgar to help you.

308
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,801
Spenser is better.

309
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,100
Chloe, absolutely
out of the question.

310
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,501
CHLOE:
Spenser can
do this faster

311
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,934
than Edgar
and I put together.

312
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He wrote an infiltration code

313
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,567
that took us
four months to hack.

314
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,167
That's a bad idea.
CHLOE:
Stay out of
this, Edgar.

315
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,000
He didn't know
Cummings was dirty.

316
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,200
His polygraph
proved that.

317
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:37,300
He's was spying on us.

318
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:38,434
He was spying on you.

319
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:39,834
He lied to you.

320
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,968
Sir, if you don't let
Spenser help us do this,

321
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,267
we're not going
to get it done in time.

322
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:49,367
He has to wear
a security wristband

323
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,501
and be under
constant supervision.

324
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:52,868
Fine.

325
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,400
( phone ringing )

326
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,067
Audrey Raines.

327
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,367
Audrey, it's Jack.

328
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:01,434
Hey.

329
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:02,868
Listen, I wanted
to tell you myself,

330
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,300
the president asked me
to stay on

331
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,067
until the canisters
were retrieved.

332
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,467
I heard that you
were reinstated.

333
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,167
Jack, you know
what this means.

334
00:12:09,234 --> 00:12:10,200
You'll be exposed.

335
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:12,467
CTU can handle the crisis.

336
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,534
Audrey, I have to do this.

337
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,634
Jack, you don't owe them this.

338
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,100
Listen, Audrey,
the reason why I called:

339
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,167
I need to ask you
to do me a favor.

340
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,701
What?

341
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,033
Kim doesn't know
I'm alive yet.

342
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,133
I don't want her to find out
the wrong way.

343
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,701
Do you want me to tell her?

344
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:28,300
No, I just want you
to call her

345
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,434
and bring her in
to CTU.

346
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:30,734
I'll see her
when I get back.

347
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:32,100
All right.

348
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:33,901
Are you sure you're comfortable
doing this for me?

349
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:35,033
Of course.

350
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,834
Thank you.

351
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,734
Sure.

352
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,601
Yeah.

353
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:57,834
Well, your swing arm
needs to be replaced.

354
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:04,701
With parts you're
looking at $475.

355
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:07,634
Yeah. We're open
till 5:00.

356
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:08,934
Okeydoke.

357
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,100
Can I help you?

358
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,334
Do you have
some kind of

359
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,667
precision tool
for cutting metal?

360
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:16,234
Sure.

361
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,901
Where is
everyone else?

362
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,367
Lunch. Why?

363
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,834
I need you to do
some work for us.

364
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:23,868
And we need it done fast.

365
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,367
If you do it,
you'll live.

366
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:26,534
Do you understand?

367
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:27,868
Yeah, yeah.

368
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:29,334
Just take it easy.

369
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,200
Why haven't I gotten an update?

370
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:46,234
Bauer left here
on some sort of lead.

371
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,100
Find out if CTU is any closer

372
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,367
to recovering the nerve gas.

373
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:50,501
Yes, sir.

374
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,033
How are you feeling?

375
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,767
Remarkably well...

376
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,601
for someone whose husband
tried to have her committed

377
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:06,234
without so much
as a good-bye.

378
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,267
I'm sorry.

379
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:10,934
I didn't come here
to fight with you.

380
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,267
You have every right to.

381
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:21,267
The two of us used to be
a pretty good team.

382
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you remember?

383
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:30,534
I was the one you would
always come to first for advice.

384
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:33,934
I remember.

385
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,400
We've got to get back
to that relationship, Charles.

386
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:40,934
You're right, things are
going to get rough for you.

387
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,901
And you are going to need me

388
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:46,601
and everything
that I can give you.

389
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:52,968
I don't know what to say,
Martha.

390
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,868
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

391
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,467
( knocking )

392
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:10,167
Mike, please, come in.

393
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:13,167
Mr. President.

394
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:14,200
Mrs. Logan.

395
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,334
Mike.

396
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,167
Mike, I owe you
a profound apology.

397
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
You were in an impossible
situation, sir.

398
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,100
I understand why you did

399
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,000
what you did.

400
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,367
No.

401
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,534
I panicked, Mike, that's it.

402
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:28,300
Plain and simple.

403
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,968
I'm not proud of
how I handled myself.

404
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:32,133
I intend to make it right

405
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,133
from this point on.

406
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,334
I'd like you
to resume your duties.

407
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,133
Of course, sir.

408
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,334
Thank you, Mike.

409
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,267
( sighs )

410
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:44,534
CTU is in the process
of tracking down

411
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,367
the canisters,

412
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,467
but we still have to deal

413
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,467
with the issue
of Walt Cummings.

414
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,467
It's all right,
Mike.

415
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,334
I would like
Martha's input on this.

416
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,467
So what do we do about Walt?

417
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,367
We can't detain him
indefinitely.

418
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:01,834
Maybe not, but we can keep him
out of sight long enough

419
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:03,734
for us to construct
a credible narrative.

420
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:05,400
Mike...

421
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,400
are you talking about
a cover-up?

422
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,634
I mean,
exercising discretion

423
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:13,434
to spare this country
unnecessary humiliation.

424
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:18,067
Walt Cummings was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

425
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,901
He has allowed
these terrorists

426
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,234
to get their hands
on weaponized nerve gas

427
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,767
that is at this point
With respect...

428
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,167
a very real
and present threat

429
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:25,167
With respect...

430
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,234
Mrs. Logan,

431
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,234
if we go public with Cummings,

432
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,067
the president's reputation
won't be the only casualty.

433
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:34,033
The credibility
of this office
will be destroyed.

434
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,901
Charles, you are going
to take a hit on this.

435
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:39,534
But you won't be destroyed.

436
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:42,033
You did nothing wrong
except to trust someone

437
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,834
who betrayed you.

438
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,033
You are human.

439
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,200
You might be overestimating

440
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,434
the public's capacity
for forgiveness.

441
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:50,901
No. I'm not.

442
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,467
The only thing
they won't forgive

443
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:56,467
is being lied to.

444
00:16:56,534 --> 00:16:58,934
I think you should issue
a statement to the press,

445
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,033
and the sooner
the better.

446
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,033
I agree.

447
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,968
Why don't you and I
work on it together,

448
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,133
see what we come up with.

449
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:11,501
Great.

450
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:20,000
Chloe.

451
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,234
Go to Station 3.
We don't have much time.

452
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,067
Thanks for getting me
reinstated.

453
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:25,934
I only did it
because I need your help

454
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,934
getting Jack through
the high-security building,

455
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,033
not because I forgive you
because I don't.

456
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,234
Have a seat.

457
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,234
We need to gain access
to the security server

458
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,934
at 22 North Figueroa.

459
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,067
It's a proprietary network,
so get to work.

460
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:43,934
Chloe?

461
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,801
I swear, I thought
I was falling...

462
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:46,934
I don't care, Spencer.

463
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,000
( keyboard keys clacking )

464
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:26,133
CTU, they've got eyes and ears
on building security.

465
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,167
We have two units,

466
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:29,200
one east, one west
of the building.

467
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,033
Chloe, do you copy?

468
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,300
CHLOE ( on earpiece ):
We're here, Jack.

469
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,801
Spenser's countervailing

470
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:37,234
the building's
security protocols.

471
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,501
What are you talking about?

472
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,067
Spenser's under arrest.

473
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,000
Buchanan released him
from Holding.

474
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,367
Fine, just give me
Rossler's position.

475
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:47,434
I've hacked into
the building's motion sensors.

476
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,434
According to them,
Rossler is still

477
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,667
in the penthouse.

478
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:53,667
I have two guards
on the penthouse level.

479
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,901
What about
the ground level entrance?

480
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,601
SPENSER:
There's one guard,
three surveillance cameras.

481
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,133
Okay. Stand by to take out
all security cameras

482
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,334
that are covering the front desk
and the elevators.

483
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,868
I can only shut them down
for 60 seconds.

484
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,367
After that, they will
reboot automatically.

485
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:07,234
That's as long as you have
to subdue the lobby guard.

486
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,601
Copy that.

487
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,267
Teams A and B, you will
remain in a holding position

488
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:11,267
till you get a "go" code.

489
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:12,434
We are three minutes out.

490
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:13,734
We have to cross
the street

491
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,701
to get to
Rossler's building.

492
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:22,067
ROSSLER ( on phone ):
Yes?

493
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:23,033
We're ready to cut

494
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,767
into the canisters.

495
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:28,133
You have to cut precisely
ten centimeters

496
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,634
from the bottom
of the casing

497
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,133
to reveal the trigger.

498
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,033
How thick is
the outer casing?

499
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,767
Five millimeters.

500
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:37,968
Call me with the identification
numbers when you're done.

501
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:57,667
We're in position.

502
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,167
We're set. We're ready to go.

503
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,701
Give me a few seconds
to access control.

504
00:20:06,067 --> 00:20:08,067
Okay.
Here we go, Jack.

505
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,000
On my mark.

506
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:11,434
Camera's dark.

507
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
Federal agent.
Let me see your hands!

508
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:17,634
Let me see your hands!

509
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:19,901
Elevator code, let's have it.

510
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,801
Uh... four, zero,
seven, three, pound.

511
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:23,701
Unit one, status check.

512
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,501
Just lost cameras A and C.

513
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,601
Tell him you don't know
why the cameras went down,

514
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:29,701
but everything is okay.

515
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,067
Everything is okay.

516
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:33,901
Status check: blue.

517
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,367
Don't know why
the cameras are out.

518
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,067
Everything's fine down here.

519
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,534
Turn around.

520
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:41,667
Back up to me.
Back up to me.

521
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:44,334
Where are the elevators?

522
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,367
The elevator's
almost there.

523
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:46,534
You have
two floors to go.

524
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:48,501
The camera reboots
in ten seconds,

525
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,167
then you'll be
visible.

526
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:53,467
( elevator bell dings )

527
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:54,968
Move. Move!

528
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:07,100
Unit one, status check.

529
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:07,801
Where are you?

530
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,868
You tell him you had
to use the men's room.

531
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:13,267
Base,

532
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:15,000
headed to the men's room.

533
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:23,834
Something's wrong.

534
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:27,000
( machine beeping )

535
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,100
( phone beeps )
Yes?

536
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:34,901
GUARD:
Mr. Rossler?

537
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:35,868
We may have a situation.

538
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,534
What kind of situation?

539
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:38,467
I'm not sure.

540
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:39,400
Please remain
in your office

541
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,534
until you get
the all clear.

542
00:21:43,501 --> 00:21:45,200
The guards look suspicious.

543
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:46,834
One of them has
an automatic weapon.

544
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,934
Copy that.

545
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,868
Federal Agents.

546
00:21:51,934 --> 00:21:54,200
( gunfire, shouting )

547
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,200
You okay?

548
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,534
Yeah. Go ahead.
Get my vest.

549
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,100
Rossler's
on the move.
Where is he?

550
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,501
9:00.

551
00:22:09,968 --> 00:22:13,267
( gunfire )

552
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,067
Federal agent.
Drop the weapon!

553
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,100
Drop the weapon!

554
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,834
Put your hands
behind your head.

555
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:22,467
Do it!

556
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:25,300
Interlock your fingers.

557
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:31,734
Rossler is in custody.

558
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:33,767
I repeat:
Rossler is in custody.

559
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:35,667
All backup teams move in.
I need a medic.

560
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:37,267
We're patching you
into the Situation Room.

561
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:38,868
Someone else is
in the penthouse, Jack.

562
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:40,100
Where?

563
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:41,767
In the bedroom,
to your right. North side.

564
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:46,334
Curtis, cover him.

565
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,267
I got him.

566
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,734
Let me see your hands.

567
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:57,167
Let me see your hands!

568
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:02,534
Don't shoot.

569
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,501
Who are you?

570
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,834
I'm Inessa.

571
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,601
Who did that to you?

572
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,334
You are the police?

573
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,267
Counterterrorist
unit, Los Angeles.

574
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:19,767
He is holding me here.

575
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:29,100
I want to go home.

576
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,334
You need to cut

577
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,667
into the outer casing exactly
ten centimeters from the bottom.

578
00:23:47,734 --> 00:23:49,467
The casting
is five millimeters thick.

579
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:52,034
You cannot puncture
the inner lining.

580
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,368
What's in these things?

581
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,834
Don't worry. Just do what I say.

582
00:23:57,901 --> 00:24:02,034
Just... Can't you tell me
what this is all about?

583
00:24:02,101 --> 00:24:04,400
Do you have a family, Cal?

584
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:06,101
A wife.

585
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,800
My wife is
in prison.

586
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,467
She's been there
for seven years.

587
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:17,301
Her only crime was to support me
while I fought for my country.

588
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:19,800
My son lives in a
state-run facility

589
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,934
He does not even remember
what I look like.

590
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,533
You want to know
what this is about?

591
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,368
Justice. It's
about ending tyranny.

592
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,634
When you're
finished,

593
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,901
we will leave.

594
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:37,667
You won't hurt me?

595
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,500
You're not my enemy.

596
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:42,634
The government is my enemy.

597
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,834
Hey.

598
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,901
You have my word.

599
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,368
Begin.

600
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:20,667
It's all right.

601
00:25:20,734 --> 00:25:21,734
You're all right.

602
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,734
Just take a seat.

603
00:25:33,934 --> 00:25:35,368
You're safe now.

604
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:41,201
Have a medic
take a look at her.

605
00:25:41,268 --> 00:25:44,234
I want CT to do a full
background check.

606
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:46,268
I don't mind that
they've dressed his wound,

607
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:48,334
but make sure they don't give
him anything for the pain.

608
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,433
Yes, sir.

609
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:58,134
Curtis. Put him in a chair.

610
00:25:58,201 --> 00:25:59,700
All right, let's go.
Get him up.

611
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:06,533
Easy on my leg.

612
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,500
CURTIS:
Just get him
over there.

613
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,967
My name is Jack Bauer.

614
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:16,368
I'm with CTU.

615
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,368
25 minutes ago you contacted
a man named Ivan Erwich.

616
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:20,433
What did he want you

617
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,767
to do for him?

618
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,500
I want my lawyer.

619
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:25,901
You'll get a lawyer
as soon as I get what I need.

620
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:28,067
Mr. Erwich is in possession
of 20 canisters

621
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:30,268
of Sentox-VX nerve gas,
which he has

622
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:33,467
threatened to deploy
here in the United States.

623
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:35,400
I guess you have a problem.

624
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,967
No, sir. You
have a problem.

625
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:43,467
You've been conspiring with
and aiding a known terrorist,

626
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:47,268
which means I get to hold you
for as long as I want.

627
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:50,234
Now, we know Mr. Erwich
can't deploy the canisters

628
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:51,934
unless he reconfigures
the trigger mechanism.

629
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,301
Is that what
he wanted you to do?

630
00:26:54,368 --> 00:27:01,167
Trust me. You don't want
to go down this road with me.

631
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:04,034
Go to hell.

632
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:07,734
( yells )

633
00:27:11,334 --> 00:27:12,901
That's exactly where
I'm going to send you

634
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,767
unless you start
to cooperate.

635
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:19,934
You like hurting girls?

636
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:22,001
Curtis.

637
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,634
( yelling )

638
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,834
JACK:
When I finish with
you, you're gonna wish

639
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,101
you felt this
good again.

640
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,400
Where is Erwich?!

641
00:27:31,467 --> 00:27:33,533
( moaning )

642
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,634
I want full immunity.

643
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,301
Unfreezing of all my assets.

644
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:49,334
And transport

645
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,167
to a foreign country
of my choosing.

646
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,067
No.

647
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,767
I need Inessa.

648
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:59,034
She comes with me.

649
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:01,034
That's the deal.

650
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:03,400
Maybe I'm not
making myself clear.

651
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,567
We're not making a deal.

652
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:07,167
Curtis.
( yelling )

653
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:11,433
( yelling )

654
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,767
( groaning and panting )

655
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,034
Jack, it's Lynn.

656
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:19,001
Go ahead.

657
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:21,034
We don't have the luxury
to engage in brinkmanship.

658
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:23,067
He's gonna tell us
what we want to know.

659
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,167
You may be right, but we're not
gonna wait around to find out.

660
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:26,500
Accept the deal.

661
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,034
That's an order.

662
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:31,167
Fine. It's your call.

663
00:28:31,234 --> 00:28:33,234
We're signing off.

664
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:35,700
Make sure he follows through.

665
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,834
I'll be back in a few minutes.

666
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,400
I've been instructed
to accept your proposal.

667
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:01,500
A certified agreement,

668
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:04,400
signed by the
Attorney General.

669
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,767
When I see that, I'll
tell you what you want.

670
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:08,767
But remember,

671
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,067
I want Inessa.

672
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:25,334
Your immunity agreement
is being drawn up.

673
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:26,667
Now I want something.

674
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:28,734
Where's Erwich?

675
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,267
I have no idea.

676
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,734
I don't know the man.

677
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:36,501
Not even what he looks like.

678
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:40,367
I first spoke with him
30 minutes ago.

679
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:43,200
We were put in contact
through a mutual

680
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,167
associate in Russia.
Who?

681
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,200
Sergei Voronov.

682
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:48,967
He's a commander

683
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:50,501
in the resistance
movement.

684
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,900
What's Erwich want?

685
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:53,501
He wants to reprogram the chip

686
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:54,768
of the trigger.

687
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,967
He's calling me back

688
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:57,667
with the identification keys.

689
00:29:57,734 --> 00:29:59,200
What's your time frame?

690
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:00,834
Within the hour.

691
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,900
How is he going
to receive the package?

692
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,467
I was going to deliver it.

693
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,768
We haven't agreed
on a meeting place.

694
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,834
I want that chip.

695
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:15,401
It's in a safe place.

696
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:18,467
Once I see some paperwork,

697
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:21,033
I'll show it to you.

698
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:27,033
I want you to be ready to fit
that chip with a transponder

699
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,267
so we can track him.

700
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:29,734
Okay.

701
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:34,000
( touch tone beeps )

702
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:36,900
( phone ringing )

703
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,033
Buchanan.

704
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,367
Bill, it's Jack.

705
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:41,033
Where are we with Rossler's
immunity agreement?

706
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,267
We have the Attorney
General's sanction.

707
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:44,667
You should have the documents
in a few minutes.

708
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,033
Okay, good.

709
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,900
Did we get any
information
on the girl?

710
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,100
There isn't much.

711
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:51,234
Inessa Kovalevsky.

712
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,367
Reported missing
19 months ago from Kiev.

713
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,300
The assumption is,
she was kidnapped

714
00:30:55,367 --> 00:30:57,634
by traffickers
in the sex slave trade.

715
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:59,367
She's 15, Jack.

716
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,167
15?

717
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:05,967
Okay, thanks, Bill.

718
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,033
I'll get back to you.

719
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:27,000
You can't take the girl.

720
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,267
Then you don't have a deal.

721
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:29,467
You'll have your
immunity, your freedom.

722
00:31:29,534 --> 00:31:30,634
Leave the girl out of this.

723
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:33,868
No.

724
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,601
Inessa is all
I care about.

725
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:40,234
She comes with me,

726
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
or you lose Erwich.

727
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
( sighs )

728
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,300
I've almost finished compiling
those surveillance protocols.

729
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,634
Whatever you have, port it over
to Edgar's station.

730
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,467
Why?

731
00:32:03,534 --> 00:32:05,167
He'll be finishing that task.

732
00:32:05,234 --> 00:32:07,100
Fine.

733
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:10,167
Chloe, don't you
understand?

734
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:12,033
I know.

735
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,701
I'm glad you do.

736
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,634
You don't work here
anymore, Spenser.

737
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:19,200
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

738
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:20,868
What?

739
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:22,834
Your reinstatement
was temporary.

740
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,834
Just until we got Rossler
into custody.

741
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,501
But there's still
a lot of stuff that
has to be done here.

742
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:28,033
We pulled people from Division.

743
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,134
We don't need you anymore.

744
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,267
These men will escort you out.

745
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:50,667
I know that was hard,
but you did the right thing.

746
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,300
Shut up, Edgar.

747
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:02,567
You're right.
We don't need that part.

748
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:05,567
Okay, "I promise a full
and open inquiry

749
00:33:05,634 --> 00:33:06,967
"into this matter.

750
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,100
"I will not rest
until I've restored

751
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:11,768
"the faith that you have
placed in this office,

752
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:14,667
"and I can demonstrate to you,
the American people,

753
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:17,401
"that I bear its mantle
of responsibility

754
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:20,234
with respect
and deep humility."

755
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,401
See, this way,

756
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,801
you're assuming responsibility
for Walt's actions,

757
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:27,300
but you're also personally
taking the initiative

758
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:29,601
to bring him to justice.

759
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:35,267
Well, I'd like to run it by
Mike, but I think it works.

760
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:37,234
I think it's
the right move, Charles.

761
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,868
Thank you for
letting me help you.

762
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:44,267
I'm glad to have your help.

763
00:33:44,334 --> 00:33:48,100
Been a long time since you and I
have worked together like this.

764
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:51,100
( phone ringing )

765
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,601
Yes?

766
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,401
Mr. President. Mike.

767
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,467
What is it, Mike?

768
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,801
I think you should come here.
I'm in the west hallway.

769
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:01,501
What's going on?

770
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:03,100
Just come here, sir.

771
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,734
I'm on my way.

772
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:11,768
( machinery whirring )

773
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:21,367
( whirring stops )

774
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:41,967
Good.

775
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,667
Cut him down.

776
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:44,100
Thanks for meeting me.
You got the money?

777
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:47,434
Jenny, I'm not here
to bring you money.

778
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,334
Here's the name of a doctor.

779
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,334
He's a good man.
I want you to call him.

780
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,701
I'll pay all
the expenses.

781
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,367
It won't cost you a cent.

782
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:58,934
We'll call him together.

783
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:00,001
I can't.

784
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,701
( grunting )

785
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:04,634
Don't hurt him.
Oh, my God.

786
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,500
Hurry up.

787
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:16,801
( coughing, groaning )

788
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:17,968
Let's go.

789
00:36:18,034 --> 00:36:19,767
I'm sorry.

790
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:21,567
Come on!

791
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:31,667
( coughing )

792
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:34,534
( groaning )

793
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,133
Rossler's been given
a shot for the pain.

794
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,001
We have air and land
pursuit units on standby.

795
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,467
As soon as he moves out,
we'll be ready.

796
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:48,068
No one's going anywhere
unless Erwich makes that call.

797
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,233
Stand by the phones.
Excuse me.

798
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,901
Audrey Raines.

799
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,400
It's me.

800
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,701
Hey.
Did you manage to get
a hold of Kim?

801
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,500
No. I tried her,
but she wasn't in.

802
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:07,834
I left a message.

803
00:37:07,901 --> 00:37:10,867
Would you mind trying
again for me, please?

804
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,068
Sure.

805
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,467
Okay, thanks.

806
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,867
I want to contact my family.

807
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:28,001
When can I go?

808
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:32,901
I-I need to explain
something to you first.

809
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:37,834
Please, sit down.

810
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,200
For now...

811
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:57,567
we need you to go
with Mr. Rossler.

812
00:37:57,634 --> 00:38:01,068
Just-Just for now.

813
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:04,534
Men like me, agents,
are going to follow you.

814
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:07,834
And when we get what we need
from Mr. Rossler,

815
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:09,267
they're going to move in

816
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:11,634
and they're gonna take
you away from him.

817
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:16,167
You don't know what he
does to me when we're alone.

818
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,734
I promise you, I won't
let him be alone with you.

819
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:20,901
I don't believe you.

820
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,467
I won't do it.

821
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,634
Please, let...

822
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:30,100
Let me go.

823
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,834
I'm sorry. I can't.

824
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:36,267
Then you are no different
than Rossler.

825
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:40,801
I am not Rossler.

826
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:43,034
Look at me.

827
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,901
I won't let anything
happen to you.

828
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:50,167
I promise.

829
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:58,133
We need you to get dressed,
please.

830
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,634
Thank you.

831
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,767
( machinery whirring )

832
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:29,300
Good job.

833
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,034
( silenced gunshot )

834
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:53,367
That's it.

835
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:57,400
Load the canisters.
Get rid of the body.

836
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:17,267
( phone ringing )

837
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,767
JACK:
Pick it up.

838
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,367
Yes?

839
00:40:22,434 --> 00:40:23,901
We have the identification keys.

840
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:25,667
I'm messaging them to you now.

841
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:28,901
I've got them.

842
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,200
How long will it take
you to reprogram the chip

843
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,634
and deliver it back to us?

844
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:34,133
I'll be ready in ten minutes.

845
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,500
You and I need a place
where we can meet.

846
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,001
You're coming
personally?

847
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,133
Unless you have someone
who can install

848
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,068
and program a coded
binary chip.

849
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:44,534
I'll call you back in five
minutes with the location.

850
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:45,701
I'll be here.

851
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:52,167
Get him set up for a wire.

852
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,634
I'll get the girl.

853
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,667
Yes, sir.

854
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:56,467
Mr. Rossler, in a minute,

855
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:58,400
we're going to be
implanting a transmitter.

856
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:04,467
We're ready to go.

857
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,133
It's going to be fine.

858
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:31,867
What's happening?

859
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:33,167
Couldn't complete
the trace.

860
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,667
We've narrowed it down
to a ten-block radius.

861
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:35,734
( phone ringing )
Okay. Thanks.

862
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:40,133
( gunshots, shouting )

863
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,233
No! Hold your fire!

864
00:41:44,434 --> 00:41:45,867
Get a medic in here now!

865
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,467
Inessa, give me the gun.

866
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:53,467
I know you don't want
to hurt anybody else.

867
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:55,300
I couldn't go with him.

868
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:57,267
( gun hits floor )

869
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:59,834
Is he gonna make it?

870
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,601
No. He's dead.

871
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:08,167
Rossler was our only link
to those canisters.

872
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,500
Erwich's gonna
call here any minute.

873
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:11,767
He's gonna expect
to talk to him.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
