1
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,734
Evelyn, I need you
to stay focused.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,600
The recording of the phone call
that you made

3
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,201
between President Logan
and Henderson

4
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,567
is in a safety deposit box.
Which bank?

5
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,900
City Trust and Savings
in Agoura Hills.

6
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:24,934
Jack knows there's no point
in going public

7
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,600
till he has
that evidence in his hand.

8
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:28,101
None of this
should have happened.

9
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:30,234
This whole thing was planned
to make our country safer.

10
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,800
and it all spiraled
out of control

11
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,134
when you decided
to kill David Palmer.

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,134
We have to focus
on stopping Bauer

13
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:37,633
before he finds that recording.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,401
Karen, I'm issuing
an executive order

15
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:43,067
for the immediate apprehension
and arrest of Jack Bauer.

16
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:45,301
I want you to run point on this

17
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:47,434
and I want you
to make this CTU's top priority.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,934
Understood, sir.

19
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,167
You know, if we really
want to find Bauer,

20
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:54,167
we need to keep watch on anyone
he might contact for help,

21
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,301
starting with Audrey Raines.

22
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,034
Don't fill your father in
on the particulars.

23
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,434
Just set up the meeting.

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,867
I'll get back to you
as soon as I have the recording.

25
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,533
I need to see you in person.

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,633
Can you reroute
your plane to Los Angeles?

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,734
All right, yes.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,134
I'll see you there.

29
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,301
Jack, are you aware
President Logan's issued

30
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:11,600
a warrant for your arrest?

31
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,767
The vice president's
not the one

32
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,800
who's behind this, is he?
No. It's Logan.

33
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,633
As soon as we have
the evidence in hand,

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,934
we're going to pass it off
to Secretary of Defense Heller.

35
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:22,767
HENDERSON:
It had to be done, sir.

36
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,134
LOGAN:
I decide what needs
to be done, Mr. Henderson.

37
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,301
I never authorized you
to kill David Palmer.

38
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:28,134
You know what we need.

39
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:30,867
The instant that Bauer steps
outside that bank building,

40
00:01:30,934 --> 00:01:32,567
you take him down.

41
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,401
Kill the others
and secure the recording.

42
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:36,767
( gunfire )

43
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:42,900
( gunfire )

44
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,167
( gunfire )

45
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:50,567
( bullets hitting metal )

46
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,167
( machine gun fire )

47
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:53,167
We got the evidence.

48
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,600
Have you listened to it?

49
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,201
Yeah, there's no doubt
it's Logan.

50
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,500
We're talking about taking down

51
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:00,034
the president
of the United States.

52
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:09,867
This checkpoint is just one
of many that have been in place

53
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:11,234
for several hours now.

54
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,934
Despite his announcement
that Los Angeles

55
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,867
is no longer
under threat of attack,

56
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,834
President Logan has ordered
that martial law

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,001
remain in effect.

58
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,067
While the move
has drawn criticism

59
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:24,767
from lawmakers
and civil rights advocates,

60
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:26,368
the president
is defending his decision

61
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:27,700
as a necessary precaution.

62
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,468
( phone ringing )
He's citing the need...

63
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,434
( mutes TV )

64
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,334
Yes.

65
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:37,533
HENDERSON:
It's me.

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,234
Is Bauer dead?

67
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,201
Not yet,

68
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,900
Mr. President.

69
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,401
You said your men had him.

70
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:45,101
Bauer triggered
the bank alarm.

71
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,234
The authorities came before
our men could get to him.

72
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,667
Bauer used the cover of
the firefight to slip away.

73
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,034
He has the recording?

74
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,234
Yes, sir.

75
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,101
That evidence directly
implicates me

76
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,234
in David Palmer's death.

77
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,201
Only if he gets it to someone

78
00:02:58,267 --> 00:02:59,434
who can do something about it.

79
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,334
We'll have Bauer
before that happens.

80
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,334
How?

81
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:03,633
Mr. President,
you've established

82
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,167
direct control over CTU,
and CTU is heading up

83
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:07,767
the search effort
for Bauer.

84
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,034
You're putting an awful lot
of faith in their ability.

85
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:11,267
This city is locked down.

86
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:14,401
CTU will find Bauer,
and when they do,

87
00:03:14,468 --> 00:03:17,800
make sure you're the first to
know so my men can intercept.

88
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:32,967
( intercom beeps )

89
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,067
Yes, Mr. President?

90
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:35,167
Karen Hayes at CTU.

91
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:36,401
Put it through to my office.

92
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:38,468
We're sifting satellite
and CalTrans video

93
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:39,834
for Audrey Raines's
vehicle.

94
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,500
I've distributed her file photo

95
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,401
to military checkpoints
throughout the city.

96
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,301
If she used her DoD credentials
at any of them,

97
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:46,734
there should be a record.

98
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,734
Well, I hope we're not wasting
our resources on Raines

99
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,368
when we don't even know
she's helping Bauer.

100
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:51,633
Karen, she dumped
the tracker.

101
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,434
There's a reason she doesn't
want to be followed.

102
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,434
( intercom beeping )

103
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,434
MAN:
Miss Hayes,

104
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,834
the president's on line one.

105
00:03:58,834 --> 00:03:59,767
Yes, Mr. President.

106
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,533
Where are we, Ms. Hayes?

107
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,834
Still running
active manhunts

108
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,034
on both Jack Bauer and
Christopher Henderson.

109
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,434
I told you
to prioritize Bauer.

110
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,700
I have, sir.

111
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,001
I've allocated my
resources accordingly.

112
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:10,667
If David Palmer's killer
is still at large

113
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:12,734
when the morning
news cycle begins,

114
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,700
then all the success we've had
handling these terrorists

115
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,368
will be undermined.

116
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,134
I will find Bauer, sir.

117
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,967
You let me know
the moment you do.

118
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:23,667
Yes, Mr. President.

119
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:26,667
Bauer, right?

120
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,667
Audrey Raines.

121
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,167
She knows where he is,

122
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,201
and those protocols aren't going
to be enough to track her.

123
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:32,368
You still
think Chloe

124
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:33,267
helped Audrey
break surveillance?

125
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm sure of it.

126
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:38,767
Remember, Audrey insisted
Chloe be assigned to her.

127
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,368
Then we need to
confront Chloe.
No, no, no, no, no.

128
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:42,633
She'll just deny it.

129
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,267
There's a way we can
use her to find Bauer.

130
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:59,834
It's all right. It's him.

131
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,767
JACK:
Bill, over here.

132
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,134
Jack.

133
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:07,867
Bill Buchanan,
Wayne Palmer.

134
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,368
Sorry about
your brother.

135
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,900
What the hell's going on, Jack?

136
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:12,301
The military authority,

137
00:05:12,368 --> 00:05:13,900
every law enforcement agency
across this country

138
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,167
has a warrant for my arrest.

139
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,034
What for?

140
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,334
Killing David Palmer.

141
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,767
That's impossible.

142
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:19,667
We cleared you
this morning.

143
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,167
I'm being set up again,

144
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,434
this time
by President Logan.

145
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,600
He was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

146
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,101
My God, you're serious.

147
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,567
Logan's using the military
to try and stop me

148
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,734
from exposing him.

149
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,001
Mr. Buchanan, we
have the evidence:

150
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,533
a digital recording
of a conversation

151
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,034
made between President Logan
and Christopher Henderson.

152
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,734
I need to get the recording
to Secretary Heller.

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,067
He's gonna take it
to the Attorney General,

154
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,834
and they'll file
for the warrant.

155
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,101
But until then,
Wayne's a target.

156
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:46,334
I need you
to take him

157
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,267
somewhere safe.
Of course I will.

158
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:49,834
Where are you
gonna meet Heller?

159
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,101
Van Nuys Airport.

160
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:54,800
( engine starts )

161
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,967
JACK:
Yeah.

162
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:09,967
Jack, my father landed.

163
00:06:10,034 --> 00:06:11,234
Where are you?

164
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,934
I just dropped Wayne Palmer off
with Buchanan.

165
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:13,934
I'm on my way

166
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,334
to the airport now.

167
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:17,201
All right, I'm on the north
side of the emergency runway

168
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,067
at hangar 112.

169
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:20,401
I'll be there in
a few minutes.

170
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:21,468
All right, hurry.

171
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,867
Dad.

172
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,734
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.

173
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,600
Thank you so much
for doing this.

174
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,867
Well, I don't know
what it is I'm doing,

175
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,167
so don't thank me yet.

176
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,600
These men in your
security detail,

177
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,067
do you trust them?

178
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:26,967
With my life.

179
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,167
Dad, I need to be sure
that they are loyal to you.

180
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,301
What's going on?

181
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:32,500
( car approaches )

182
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,234
Dad, I will tell
you, but only you.

183
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:40,334
Stay here.

184
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:45,468
You know I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

185
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,567
Tell me what this is all about.

186
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,500
I promise, I will.

187
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,567
I just need a minute.

188
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:53,533
Mr. Secretary.

189
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,001
What the hell are
you doing here?

190
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,434
He's a fugitive.

191
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,468
Every law enforcement
agency in this state

192
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,468
is looking for him.

193
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:00,633
He's innocent.

194
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,567
Then why don't you
turn yourself in?

195
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:06,001
Mr. Secretary, I swear to you,
I had nothing to do

196
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,533
with David Palmer's
assassination.

197
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,800
I'd like to believe you, Jack,

198
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,134
but you're acting
like a criminal.

199
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,468
I don't have a choice;
they're setting me up.

200
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,201
Mr. Secretary, I only need you
for a few minutes.

201
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:18,067
I need to show
you something,

202
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:19,500
but privately,

203
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,767
inside the building, please.

204
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:27,468
Thank you, sir.

205
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,368
HENDERSON:
It had to be done, sir.

206
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:48,667
LOGAN:
I decide what needs to be done,
Mr. Henderson.

207
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,633
I never authorized you
to kill David Palmer.

208
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,667
HENDERSON:
Palmer was nosing around.

209
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:52,800
President Logan?

210
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:53,934
And a man named
Christopher Henderson.

211
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:54,934
HENDERSON:
He'd have found out

212
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,201
about your involvement.

213
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,800
For God's sake, sir,
he called your wife.

214
00:08:57,867 --> 00:08:59,800
LOGAN:
I can handle my wife.

215
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,667
Right now, my concern is keeping
this operation from collapsing

216
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,067
like a house of cards.

217
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:05,567
HENDERSON:
You're protected, sir.

218
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:07,201
Every thread ends with Cummings.

219
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:08,800
He thinks he's running this,

220
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:11,368
and you need to keep
playing it that way.

221
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,301
LOGAN:
I know my part, Mr. Henderson.

222
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:14,934
You just do as you're told.

223
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,334
( recording clicks off )

224
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,301
JACK:
President Logan
supplied the terrorists

225
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,867
with the Sentox
nerve gas.

226
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,401
What?

227
00:09:22,468 --> 00:09:25,101
His plan was to deploy the
nerve gas en route to Moscow.

228
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,134
That way, he could expose
the terrorists and use them

229
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,434
as an excuse to invoke the
military terms of the agreement

230
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,834
that he made earlier
with Suvarov.

231
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
This was all in an effort
to gain control

232
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,301
of the oil supply
in Central Asia.

233
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,734
David Palmer found out about it,
and that's why they killed him.

234
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
How do you know that recording
hasn't been fabricated?

235
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:42,967
I trust the source.

236
00:09:43,034 --> 00:09:44,533
Mr. Secretary, I promise you,

237
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,101
this will stand up
under scrutiny.

238
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:49,867
I wish I could say
I was surprised, but I'm not.

239
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,434
I watched Charles Logan

240
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,101
rise on the tide
of his own ambition.

241
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:59,767
I was terrified
when he took the oath.

242
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,600
Sir, I'm very sorry
that I had to involve you,

243
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,167
but I needed someone
who had access

244
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,734
to hand-deliver this to
the Attorney General.

245
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,734
So you contacted me.

246
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,134
You're the only one
I could trust.

247
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,700
All right, then.

248
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,900
Thank you, sir.

249
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:26,867
You need to go
with your father.

250
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,201
He's going to need someone

251
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,633
to corroborate the evidence
to the Attorney General.

252
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,633
What about you?

253
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,767
I'm going to go dark

254
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,267
until the Attorney General
comes forward.

255
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:35,800
I'll call Buchanan; I'll let
him know what's happening.

256
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:38,034
All right. Jack,
everything's going
to be okay now.

257
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,633
Yeah. Go.

258
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,167
Okay.

259
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:46,734
Jack, one more thing.

260
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,368
What, sir?

261
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:50,468
( grunts )

262
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,600
Dad, what are you doing?!

263
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:52,900
Secure my daughter.

264
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,600
You're playing
a dangerous game here, Jack,

265
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,267
and you're
playing it wrong.

266
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,834
Turning Logan's crime
into a public spectacle

267
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,101
will not bring back
David Palmer.

268
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,834
It'll tear this nation apart.

269
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,034
You're not only destroying
the president,

270
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,067
you'll be destroying
the presidency.

271
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,767
The collateral damage
of the truth

272
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:12,567
will cripple this nation.

273
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,734
So what are you going to do?
Bury the evidence?

274
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,767
No.

275
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:19,301
You're coming
with me, Audrey,

276
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:22,134
and we'll use the evidence
to get Logan

277
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,401
to step down quietly.

278
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:24,900
Once he's gone,
we'll have a chance

279
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,734
to set things right again.

280
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,134
Doug, I'm trusting you

281
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,267
to keep this
item safe.

282
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,334
Audrey, are you coming
with me or not?

283
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,600
Dad, I can't.

284
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:37,234
Then secure them both
until you hear from me.

285
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,967
Dad, please, no!

286
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:41,267
Mr. Secretary,

287
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,633
you can't make
a deal with him!

288
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,001
Do you know what's going on
in the Situation Room?

289
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,901
It's some sort
of briefing.
No one told me.

290
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,268
It's a Class 3.
That's all I know.

291
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,368
I'm a department head.
I should be in all Class 3s.

292
00:12:11,433 --> 00:12:13,800
That's all I know.

293
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,734
Shari, what was
that briefing about?

294
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,567
Just a protocol review.

295
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:21,600
I don't believe you.

296
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:23,368
Why not?
'Cause you're a bad liar.

297
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:24,667
Miles just gave me
a bunch of busywork

298
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:25,667
to do in the
Archives Room

299
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:26,901
to keep me out
of the briefing.

300
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,034
Do you ever think
there might be a reason

301
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:29,001
he kept you out?

302
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,533
He thinks I helped Audrey

303
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,201
break her
surveillance.

304
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,334
Is that what it was about?

305
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,767
I've already said too much.

306
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,268
Please don't ask me
any more questions.

307
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:37,800
Come on, Shari,

308
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,067
you owe me.

309
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,867
I stuck my neck out for you
with Miles.

310
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:43,433
Tell me what happened in there.

311
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:46,134
Miles found Audrey.

312
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,268
He activated a transponder
on her car.

313
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,667
So they know where she is?

314
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,334
We're running an operational
support right now.

315
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,600
That's what
the briefing was about.

316
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:55,667
They sent a tac team

317
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:56,800
ten minutes ago.

318
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,700
Please don't tell anyone
I said anything.

319
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,634
Here she comes.

320
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:14,134
( phone ringing )

321
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,001
Damn, she's good.

322
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,734
She set up
a proprietary com channel.

323
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,901
How long will it take
to track her call?
Not long.

324
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:24,967
Pick up.

325
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:27,301
( line continues ringing )

326
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,634
Somewhere in
the Valley.

327
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,634
Looks like
a pay phone.

328
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,634
I've got the
receiving end

329
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,034
narrowed down to
a one-mile radius.

330
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,400
Why isn't Audrey
picking up?

331
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:42,967
MILES:
Narrowing...

332
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:43,967
Got it.

333
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,101
Where?

334
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:48,734
Van Nuys Airport--
the emergency runway

335
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,834
adjacent to
the main field.

336
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,334
Move the tac team out now.

337
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,533
Van Nuys Airport.

338
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,500
Miles is forwarding
the coordinates.

339
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Get me the president.

340
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,500
You said they sent the tac team

341
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,301
ten minutes ago.

342
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:24,500
Miles set me up, and you helped.

343
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:25,901
You're working

344
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,700
against us, Chloe.
You have no idea
what you've done.

345
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,800
Miles said that...

346
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:30,167
Miles is an idiot.

347
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:31,433
If anyone should know that,
it should be you.

348
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,834
I can't believe you
went along with him.

349
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:34,400
Please come with us,

350
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,201
Ms. O'Brian.
Where are we going?

351
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:37,268
Let's go.

352
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,934
Mr. President, I need to remind
you that we still don't have

353
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,500
confirmation that Audrey Raines

354
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:45,734
and Bauer are at the location.

355
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,500
You'll find out soon enough.

356
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,301
I'll have the military authority
follow up on it.

357
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:50,800
The military?
Sir, I just dispatched

358
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:52,034
my tac team.

359
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,634
Call them back.

360
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,734
I don't understand...

361
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,634
Jack Bauer is a very
sensitive problem.

362
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,667
There are political
ramifications.

363
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,734
I've decided
to handle him directly.

364
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,368
And besides, you must have
your hands full,

365
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:06,734
transitioning CTU
to Homeland Security.

366
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,634
I'll recall my team, sir.

367
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,533
Good.

368
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,368
Now the president
wants oversight

369
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:15,634
on the Bauer operation.

370
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,634
MILES:
He's the president.

371
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,433
He can do what he wants.

372
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,101
( phone rings )

373
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,334
Yeah.
CTU thinks they
found Bauer.

374
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,433
Where?

375
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,901
Jack, what if
my father's right?

376
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,634
What if he can get Logan
to step down quietly?

377
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,834
Maybe that is the best thing
for this country.

378
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:44,067
These people brokered
chemical weapons to terrorists.

379
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,167
They've killed an ex-president
of the United States.

380
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:49,400
Logan's not going
to make a deal

381
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:50,800
with your father,
and even if he did,

382
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,800
he wouldn't keep it.

383
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,101
Henderson wouldn't
let him.

384
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,700
The only thing
your father's doing right now

385
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,368
is making himself a target.

386
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,767
You want to help him?

387
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,901
Help me get the recording back
before he speaks to Logan.

388
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:05,201
Look, Mike,
this isn't me being territorial,

389
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,700
but if the president
wants Jack Bauer,

390
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,201
why doesn't he let
us take care of it?

391
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:09,700
Now, look, I've been
on other things.

392
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,234
Let me find out
what's going on.

393
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,533
I'll get back
to you, Karen.

394
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,567
Thank you, Mike.

395
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,700
...Will be lifted
within the next two hours,

396
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:20,334
but the curfew
will remain in effect...

397
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,533
( knocking )

398
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,134
HAL:
Come in.

399
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,433
That's only

400
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,067
six hours from now.

401
00:16:33,134 --> 00:16:35,967
Okay.

402
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,533
David Palmer's body's being
flown back to DC at 7:00 a.m.

403
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,634
The president and I both want
to be there when the coffin's

404
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,433
put onto the plane.
That's a good idea.

405
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,234
Yeah.

406
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:45,700
What's up, Mike?

407
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:50,368
I just got a call
from Karen Hayes at CTU.

408
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,500
Do you know
about the president's decision

409
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:55,201
to pull them off the acquisition
of Jack Bauer?

410
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:59,400
No, but what's the problem?

411
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:00,934
The problem is it doesn't
really make sense.

412
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,867
Karen's teams
are closer.

413
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,867
They can do it
more efficiently.

414
00:17:04,934 --> 00:17:07,034
Bauer's more likely
to cooperate with them

415
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:11,201
than with a group of military
police he doesn't know.

416
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:12,533
Well, Karen and her team

417
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,433
have barely gotten CTU
back on its feet.

418
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,201
I'm sure the president
just feels more confident

419
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,001
with the military units
already in place

420
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:19,533
because of martial law.

421
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,234
Well, the military has
its hands full, Hal.

422
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,700
What do you want me
to say, Mike?

423
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,134
It's the president's call.

424
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:29,901
I can see it both ways.

425
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,901
( phone rings )

426
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,567
Yeah?

427
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,734
WOMAN:
Operations.

428
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,400
Beth, it's Mike Novick.

429
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,867
Put me through
to General Warren, please.

430
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,034
Yes, sir.

431
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,734
( phone rings )

432
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,334
This is Warren.

433
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,167
BETH:
Sir, I have Mike Novick
on the line for you.

434
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,667
Go ahead, Beth.

435
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:09,867
BETH:
He's on.

436
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:11,567
What is it, Mike?

437
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:14,034
General, can you give me
an update

438
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,867
on your search
for Jack Bauer?

439
00:18:15,934 --> 00:18:17,201
What are you
talking about?

440
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:18,700
The one
the president ordered.

441
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:21,067
We never received such
a call from the president.

442
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,201
I see.

443
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,101
I-I'm sorry to disturb you,
General.

444
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,234
You should try to get some rest,

445
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:46,201
Mr. President.

446
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:47,700
Yes, I know.

447
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,334
I should try to get some rest.

448
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,834
What is it
you want, Mike?

449
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,533
I just got off the phone
with General Warren,

450
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,334
who's running
military operations

451
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,368
here in Los Angeles.

452
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,567
Why would
you be talking with him?

453
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:06,101
Karen Hayes

454
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,001
over at Homeland raised
a few good points

455
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,500
I thought I'd
follow up on.

456
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,934
What good points, Mike?

457
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,800
She doesn't understand
why she was taken

458
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:16,734
out of the loop on this
Jack Bauer situation.

459
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,967
You know, I really don't care
what Karen Hayes understands.

460
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,667
She should be doing her job
and not bothering my advisors,

461
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:26,001
asking questions
that diminish my authority.

462
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:29,368
Be that as it may,
I did follow up,

463
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,134
and, uh, now, frankly,

464
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm a little mystified

465
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,201
by some things.

466
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:37,901
What things
mystify you, Mike?

467
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,533
Well, you told Homeland

468
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,001
that you wanted
the military

469
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,201
to pick up Jack Bauer,

470
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:45,034
but I just spoke
with General Warren,

471
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:48,567
and he's unaware of
any such directive.

472
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:51,167
Because I didn't go
through General Warren.

473
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:55,234
May I ask who you
did go through?

474
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:58,567
Mike, let's get
one thing straight:

475
00:19:58,634 --> 00:20:00,867
I don't answer to you.

476
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,901
Of course not, sir.

477
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,234
However, I will
tell you this:

478
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:12,234
I-I have decided to use
a covert task force

479
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:13,734
to bring in Jack Bauer.

480
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,400
The reason I'm doing that
is because Bauer presents...

481
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,767
special circumstances.

482
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,467
Special circumstances?

483
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,867
I want this
completely off the radar, Mike.

484
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,334
The Chinese government may still
believe that Jack Bauer is dead.

485
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,134
If they find out
that he's alive,

486
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:32,134
they're going to blame us.

487
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:33,934
They're going to, uh, accuse us

488
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:36,368
of fabricating the story
of his death.

489
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:39,433
Um, wouldn't we be keeping
the circle smaller

490
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,800
if we let Karen handle this?

491
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:44,433
Her people already
know about Bauer.

492
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,301
They're working
under a secretive mandate.

493
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,734
You know what, Mike?

494
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,234
I am tired of being

495
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,867
second-guessed.

496
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:55,301
I've been dealing
with-with-with...

497
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,734
wall-to-wall crises
for the last 18 hours,

498
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,400
and I think I've done
a pretty damn good job

499
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,400
of leading the country.

500
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,533
Of course, Mr. President.

501
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,268
You came in here suggesting
that I should get some rest.

502
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,368
That's the one
recommendation
of yours

503
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,467
that I intend
to take.

504
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,834
Thank you, Mike.

505
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,300
to a public phone
at Van Nuys Airport.

506
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,900
If Audrey Raines
is at that location,

507
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,501
you're in a lot of trouble.

508
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:55,734
Miles, this situation is more
complicated than you think.

509
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:58,334
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.
But you do.

510
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,367
Yes.

511
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:00,634
Then why didn't you tell me?

512
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,434
Because I can't.

513
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,634
You think the rules

514
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:06,933
don't apply to you
because you're smarter

515
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
than the rest of us,
but I have news for you.

516
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,434
They do, and you're not.

517
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,200
I won't miss you
when you're gone.

518
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:18,100
Miles.

519
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,234
Don't touch me.

520
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,768
What?

521
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:28,701
Jack Bauer did not kill
President Palmer.

522
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:30,100
He's a Federal fugitive

523
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,367
wanted for the murder
of a former president,

524
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,868
which means you're going

525
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:35,701
to jail, O'Brian.

526
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,367
For a long time.

527
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:40,967
Miles.

528
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:42,834
I don't think

529
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,134
you're as big of a jerk
as you pretend to be.

530
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:48,467
I need to speak to you.
Yes, sir.

531
00:23:00,801 --> 00:23:02,701
No, sir, I've been there
the whole time.

532
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,267
What are you doing, Chloe?

533
00:23:26,334 --> 00:23:29,401
You're supposed
to be in custody.

534
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,000
Miles let me out.

535
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,768
You're a worse liar than I am.

536
00:23:33,834 --> 00:23:35,067
Shari, don't do that.

537
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:38,267
You helped Audrey Raines
break surveillance.

538
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,768
Yes, I did it
for a good reason.

539
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,100
I can't get
into it right now.

540
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,601
Well, I don't really think
you have a choice.

541
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,701
Listen to me for a minute.

542
00:23:45,768 --> 00:23:49,134
Jack Bauer did not
kill President Palmer.

543
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,300
He knows who did it.

544
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:51,634
He may need
my help to prove it

545
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,367
and I can't help him
if I'm in custody.

546
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,267
Then why don't you
just tell Karen?

547
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,900
Because she won't believe me.

548
00:23:56,967 --> 00:23:58,868
Nobody will,
not without evidence.

549
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:03,534
It's President Logan.

550
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:06,300
What are you talking about?

551
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:08,601
The evidence Jack is trying
to get implicates Logan

552
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,134
in the assassination of Palmer.

553
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,167
That's ridiculous, Chloe.

554
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,367
You know your
sexual harassment
charges against Miles?

555
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,467
I know you were lying.

556
00:24:17,534 --> 00:24:19,267
You're sick and you need help,
and if you try to stop me

557
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,334
and it turns out I'm right
about Jack, and I am,

558
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,601
I will recommend you for
a psychiatric evaluation.

559
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,467
And you won't like that,
trust me.

560
00:24:41,801 --> 00:24:43,900
MARTHA:
Charles.

561
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,534
You coming to bed soon?

562
00:24:48,434 --> 00:24:50,567
I doubt if I'll get
much sleep tonight.

563
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:52,100
You should try.

564
00:24:52,167 --> 00:24:53,801
Yeah.

565
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:54,868
You okay?

566
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:57,701
I'm fine.
It's just, uh...

567
00:24:57,768 --> 00:25:00,134
It's been
a challenging day.

568
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,801
Okay.

569
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,601
Come to bed.

570
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,434
I will. Soon.

571
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,900
( phone ringing )

572
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:13,967
Yes?

573
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:15,534
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Mr. President,

574
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,100
but Secretary Heller
is on the line.

575
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,501
He insists on talking to you.

576
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,134
Tell him I'll call
him back tomorrow.

577
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,367
He says it's urgent, sir.

578
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:26,367
Put him through.

579
00:25:29,134 --> 00:25:30,334
Yes, James.

580
00:25:30,401 --> 00:25:32,334
Thanks for taking my call,
Mr. President.

581
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:34,900
You said it was urgent.

582
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,100
I need to see you, sir.
See me about what?

583
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,401
I'd rather speak
to you in person.

584
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:42,534
Fine, but I won't be back to
Washington for a couple of days.

585
00:25:42,601 --> 00:25:43,967
I'm in L.A., sir.

586
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:45,634
I need to see you
tonight.

587
00:25:45,701 --> 00:25:48,134
Tonight? What is this about?

588
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,900
I'll be there shortly
and we can discuss it then.

589
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,534
I don't like your tone, James.

590
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,734
In case you've forgotten,
you're addressing

591
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:55,868
the President
of the United States.

592
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:57,667
I know who I'm addressing.

593
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:01,300
And I think you know exactly
what this is about.

594
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,834
When will you be here?

595
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,100
Five minutes.

596
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,334
Fine.

597
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:09,868
James Heller? What does he want?

598
00:26:12,234 --> 00:26:13,267
He's getting flak

599
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,601
from the Joint Chiefs

600
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,567
about my decision
to maintain martial law.

601
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:18,434
You would think
that these people

602
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:19,634
would show some allegiance.

603
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:22,501
Can't James handle it himself?

604
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,501
Apparently not.

605
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:30,534
Come to bed when you're done.

606
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:33,000
I will.

607
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:48,367
( speed-dialing )

608
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:50,667
( phone ringing )

609
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,801
We're leaving now.

610
00:26:55,868 --> 00:26:58,200
How long will it take you
to get there?
Ten minutes.

611
00:26:58,267 --> 00:26:59,801
We may not have
that much time.

612
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,401
James Heller is
on his way here.

613
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:03,000
He insisted on
seeing me right away.

614
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,234
Jack got to him.

615
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,667
What if Bauer's given
him the recording?

616
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:07,701
Heller's not stupid enough
to carry it with him,

617
00:27:07,768 --> 00:27:09,200
and without it,
whatever he knows

618
00:27:09,267 --> 00:27:11,634
or whatever he thinks
he knows won't matter.

619
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,467
You think Bauer still has it?
I'm sure of it.

620
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:15,200
I'll hold Heller off
as long as I can,

621
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:18,467
but you phone me the second
you have the evidence in hand.

622
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:19,768
Right.

623
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,500
What is Secretary Heller
doing here?

624
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,534
I don't know, ma'am.

625
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,934
But you have an idea.

626
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:34,068
My husband says
it's about his order

627
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,134
to maintain martial law,

628
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,500
but I think
it's something else.

629
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:42,333
If you know what it is,
will you please tell me?

630
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,500
I can't.

631
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,467
You can't?

632
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:48,400
Or you won't?

633
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:54,001
Please don't ask me
anything more, Mrs. Logan.

634
00:28:58,233 --> 00:29:00,667
Whatever you tell me will remain
between the two of us.

635
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:04,634
I promise you.

636
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:09,534
Aaron...
you can trust me.

637
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,934
You know that.

638
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:17,034
Not here.

639
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:19,834
Meet me in
a couple minutes.

640
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:22,734
Where?

641
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,967
Outside the south stable.

642
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:36,567
James.

643
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:39,068
Thank you, gentlemen.

644
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,867
I hope this was important.

645
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:54,834
I know what you did.
I know what you're doing.

646
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:57,367
And I'm here
to put an end to it.

647
00:29:57,434 --> 00:29:59,168
You have to be
a little more specific.

648
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:02,400
You are responsible
for the murder of David Palmer.

649
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,200
That's outrageous.

650
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:10,367
I heard a recording--
a conversation

651
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,001
between you and man named
Christopher Henderson.

652
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:16,233
When Palmer found out
about your insane plan,

653
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,801
Henderson had him killed.

654
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:20,367
And you let it happen.

655
00:30:20,434 --> 00:30:22,200
Where is this recording?

656
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,300
It's in a safe place.

657
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:24,333
I would like to hear it.

658
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,434
Why?

659
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,967
You know exactly
what you said,

660
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,333
and so do I.

661
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,367
It's burnt into my memory.

662
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,634
How dare you stand there
and judge me?

663
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:40,734
You have no idea.

664
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,901
Until you sit in my chair,

665
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,634
you don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

666
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:48,333
Your chair
is not a throne, Charles.

667
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,967
I'm protecting the interests
of our country.

668
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:51,233
You mean oil.
Yes.

669
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,667
Yes!

670
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,534
This country needs energy
more than you or anybody

671
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,367
in this gridlocked
government cares to admit.

672
00:30:57,434 --> 00:30:58,701
We'll see how you judge me

673
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,967
when the cost of oil
goes up over $100 a barrel

674
00:31:01,034 --> 00:31:02,667
and the people
who put me in office

675
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:04,333
can't afford to heat their homes

676
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,834
or run their cars.

677
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:09,701
And you think that justifies
the blood on your hands?

678
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,667
What do you want?

679
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:27,168
I want you to drop
the trumped-up charges

680
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:30,101
against Jack Bauer.

681
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:32,701
And leave my daughter alone.

682
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,500
Anything else?

683
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:38,701
Announce your resignation
by tomorrow morning.

684
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:42,233
Blame it on the crushing
stress of today's events,

685
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,834
or blame it on
whatever you want,

686
00:31:44,901 --> 00:31:46,967
just as long as you go public

687
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:50,001
by the start of
the morning news cycle.

688
00:31:50,068 --> 00:31:51,333
And then what?

689
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,701
The recording will be kept
under lock and key,

690
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:58,600
and this will remain
between us.

691
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,534
Call in Vice
President Gardner.

692
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,134
I want to be here when you hand
him your letter of resignation.

693
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,101
Get in here.

694
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:40,333
I haven't been able
to contact Jack or Audrey.

695
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,168
I haven't talked
to them either.

696
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:43,333
CTU might have them
in custody.

697
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,967
I need to tap into
their current protocols.

698
00:32:45,034 --> 00:32:46,200
Where's your workstation?

699
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,834
This way.
Homeland changed my access code.

700
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,534
I can create
a workaround.

701
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,967
If CTU has Jack,
it's all my fault.

702
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:12,867
( beeping )

703
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,634
( phone rings )

704
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:41,867
( grunts )

705
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,367
I can get us out of here.

706
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,134
Watch the door.

707
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,233
( grunts )

708
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,467
He's got restraints
in his pocket.

709
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:23,434
Wexler, status report.

710
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:26,401
Mark, come in.

711
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:34,500
Don't move.

712
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,334
Don't... move.

713
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,734
Slowly put the gun on the ground
and kick it towards me.

714
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:40,567
Do it!

715
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,167
Put your hands
where I can see them.

716
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,268
Give me the recording.

717
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:57,067
Slowly.

718
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:04,301
Stand up.

719
00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:05,567
What did you do
to my partner?

720
00:36:05,634 --> 00:36:07,433
He's fine.

721
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,400
Son of a bitch!

722
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,533
Take cover behind
the wheel! Now! Move!

723
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:14,301
Move!

724
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:25,967
What the hell's going on?!

725
00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,234
They've come
for the recording!

726
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,634
If you and I are gonna get

727
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,067
through this alive,
we need to work together.

728
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,067
Give me my gun!

729
00:36:56,467 --> 00:36:57,934
( grunts )

730
00:36:58,001 --> 00:36:59,634
( grunts )

731
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,001
( gunfire continues )

732
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:11,500
( explosion )

733
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:36,268
Audrey?

734
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:38,234
HENDERSON:
I have her, Jack.

735
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:41,067
Now don't make me kill her.

736
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,067
There's been too much killing
today already, so just throw out

737
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:45,734
that recording.

738
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,167
Let her go, Christopher.

739
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:49,134
After I have the recording.

740
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,600
Why are you doing this?

741
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:52,268
Why are you protecting Logan?

742
00:37:52,334 --> 00:37:54,467
I'm protecting something

743
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:56,101
much more important
than Charles Logan.

744
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,734
What?

745
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,734
The integrity
of our government.

746
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,034
Our government has no integrity.

747
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:04,600
Not when someone
like Charles Logan occupies

748
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,500
the Presidency.

749
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:08,433
Christopher,

750
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,634
you can make this right.

751
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,533
You can help me stop him.
Sorry, Jack.

752
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,368
Now throw me the recording.

753
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:19,201
I'll give you the recording
if you let

754
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:20,433
Audrey go.

755
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,667
I wish I could believe that.

756
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:24,767
I give you my word.

757
00:38:27,533 --> 00:38:30,001
I'll tell you what.

758
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:32,201
I'll meet you halfway.

759
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,268
What does that mean?

760
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:35,934
( muffled groaning )

761
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:37,134
Get up.

762
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:39,201
Audrey?

763
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:41,667
Just hold still,
Ms. Raines.

764
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,834
( muffled screams )

765
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:45,201
Damn it, Christopher!

766
00:38:45,268 --> 00:38:46,467
Here she comes, Jack.

767
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,901
Walk out slow,
or I'll kill you.

768
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:53,834
Audrey.

769
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:58,400
( panting )

770
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,901
HENDERSON:
That's far enough,
Ms. Raines.

771
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,301
What have you done to her?

772
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:10,067
The left brachial artery.

773
00:39:10,134 --> 00:39:12,433
She has about three minutes
before she bleeds to death.

774
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,734
Now throw me that recording.

775
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,234
Jack, don't.

776
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:19,767
HENDERSON:
She's 15

777
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,167
seconds closer to dying, Jack.

778
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,834
Give me
the recording.

779
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:25,234
Jack, don't do it.

780
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:27,067
HENDERSON:
She's running
out of time.

781
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,600
Don't do it, Jack.

782
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:34,301
Don't. Don't
give it to him.

783
00:39:34,368 --> 00:39:35,667
Here it is!

784
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:38,234
( pained groan )

785
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:46,834
( Audrey whimpers )

786
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:50,767
Audrey.

787
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:52,433
( panting )

788
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,433
Easy, easy, easy.

789
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,734
Easy. Stay with me.

790
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,734
Stay with me.
Jack, go get him.
Go get him. Go.

791
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,234
Stay with me.

792
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:02,533
( Audrey panting )

793
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
I'll be right back.

794
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:06,301
( groans )

795
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,901
Here you are.

796
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:18,667
( groaning )

797
00:40:18,734 --> 00:40:20,634
( Jack panting )

798
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:24,867
( groaning )

799
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:27,067
( panting )

800
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:30,967
( groaning )

801
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:32,967
I need to move you.

802
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:34,400
Come on.

803
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:35,700
( groans )

804
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:41,101
All it needs is your
signature, Mr. President.

805
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,433
James, we can find another way
to handle this.

806
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,467
There must be something
I can give you,

807
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:47,634
something that you want.

808
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,167
You're giving me
exactly what I want.

809
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,034
You asked to see me,
Mr. President?

810
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:57,034
Hi, Jim.

811
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:59,101
I thought you'd be on a
plane back to Washington.

812
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,734
What are you
doing here?

813
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,967
I'll let

814
00:41:02,034 --> 00:41:04,967
President Logan
tell you.

815
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,600
Mr. President.

816
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,134
Hal...

817
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:19,700
( phone rings )

818
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:23,500
Yes.

819
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,734
HENDERSON:
I have the recording.

820
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,167
Really?

821
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,567
I'll call you back

822
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:30,533
after I've secured a vehicle.

823
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,634
Thank you.

824
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:40,567
Hal,

825
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:42,167
I'm asking Secretary Heller

826
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:43,467
to tender his resignation.

827
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:46,067
I wanted you here
as a witness.
What?!

828
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,001
He came here to accuse me
of being complicit

829
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,800
in today's
terrorist attacks.

830
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:51,101
I don't know
how he can

831
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,500
make such an accusation
without any evidence.

832
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:55,334
He orchestrated a conspiracy

833
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,934
to let terrorists acquire

834
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:58,234
stolen nerve gas.

835
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:00,268
That's insane, James.

836
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:04,533
He sanctioned the assassination
of David Palmer!

837
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,834
And I have the evidence.

838
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,934
Where? Show it to us.

839
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:16,201
Who was on the phone?

840
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:17,767
Who made that call?

841
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,134
( two beeps )

842
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:24,567
I want your resignation
on my desk by the morning.

843
00:42:24,634 --> 00:42:26,700
If any harm comes
to my daughter...

844
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:27,700
Gentlemen!

845
00:42:27,767 --> 00:42:29,567
Please

846
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:31,467
escort Secretary Heller
out of my home.

847
00:42:52,301 --> 00:42:53,634
( Audrey whimpers )

848
00:42:57,967 --> 00:42:59,467
( Audrey screams )



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
