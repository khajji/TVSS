1
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:15,101
This is Bauer.

2
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,267
Jack, Air Traffic Control

3
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:17,934
just received
a VCI distress signal

4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,834
from your aircraft
that effectively authorizes

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,500
President Logan
to shoot you down.

6
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,900
Start taking us down.

7
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,967
Do it now.

8
00:00:27,034 --> 00:00:30,001
BUCHANAN:
<i>Jack, the F-18</i>
<i>is within 15 miles.</i>

9
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:32,867
PILOT:
My radar is locked
onto the target.

10
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:33,967
Lower the landing gear!

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,967
We're going too fast!

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,101
Touch it down!

13
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:39,167
( <i>screaming</i> )

14
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:41,034
( <i>screeching</i> )

15
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:46,567
We're ready to move Bierko.

16
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:47,500
Thank you.

17
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,900
<i>I'll be right out.</i>

18
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,834
<i>Vladimir Bierko, </i>
<i>you're being transferred</i>

19
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,533
to a primary holding facility

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,434
in our district
headquarters.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Jack, the attorney general
is on his way

22
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,101
to his office
right now.

23
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,734
He'll be ready for
a video conference
in ten minutes.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,267
JACK:
<i>Chloe, I want you to prepare</i>

25
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:04,500
the recording
for playback.

26
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:05,500
I want you
to clean it up

27
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,201
and apply
a digital signature

28
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,533
so we can establish
a chain of evidence.

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,567
You work alone.

30
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,267
We got the evidence.

31
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:12,834
President Logan's going to pay

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,101
for David Palmer's
assassination.

33
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,267
The spectacle of a sitting
president on trial for murder

34
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:19,867
would be devastating.

35
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,700
Yes, it would.

36
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,201
<i>If only there were a way that</i>

37
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,667
<i>we could prevent</i>
<i>such a trial from taking place.</i>

38
00:01:25,734 --> 00:01:26,667
( <i>phone rings</i> )

39
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,667
MILES:
<i>Mr. President?</i>

40
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,034
<i>You don't know me.</i>

41
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,301
My name is Miles Papazian,
I work under Karen Hayes.

42
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:33,067
What is this about?

43
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,800
It's about a recording, sir,

44
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:39,368
if leaked, could significantly
compromise national security.

45
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,700
Why are you telling me this?

46
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,934
I feel compelled to intervene,

47
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,034
and I just I wanted to make sure

48
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:47,067
that you would approve.

49
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:48,401
I do, Mr. Papazian,

50
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:50,201
I do approve.

51
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:51,368
Get out of here, Miles.

52
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:53,201
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.

53
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,267
Well, if your job is
is to slow things down,

54
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:56,934
then you're doing
really good work.

55
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,967
I'll tell Karen
you'll be ready.

56
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,800
The attorney general
will be on the line
in five minutes.

57
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,201
Did you tell him
that the recording

58
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:12,267
implicates President Logan
in Palmer's assassination?

59
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,734
No. I feel he needs to hear it
directly from the source.

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,700
Fine.

61
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:28,201
We're minutes away, Chloe,
what's your status?

62
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,600
Everything is set up.

63
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,834
I've got a T-1 line hooked in
to the attorney general,

64
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,134
the other two lines are secured
on dedicated channels.

65
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,600
What other two lines?

66
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:36,667
We're patching in
a representative

67
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:37,600
from the House
Judiciary Committee

68
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,600
and a Congressional liaison.

69
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:40,301
We need their support
to call for

70
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,533
an emergency session
of Congress

71
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,500
to begin impeachment
proceedings.

72
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,533
Impeachment proceedings?

73
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,934
What about an arrest warrant?

74
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,700
We'll never get Justice
to indict a sitting president.

75
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,700
Removing him from office
is a necessary step

76
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,434
to begin full
criminal prosecution.

77
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,301
All right, Chloe,
let's check the sound levels.

78
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:54,368
Play the recording.

79
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,767
( <i>recording playing</i>
<i>white noise</i> )

80
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:03,767
What's wrong?

81
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:04,734
I don't know.

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,700
What do you mean
you don't know?

83
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:06,834
Where's the recording?

84
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,334
This is what's on
the digital medium.

85
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,700
That's impossible.

86
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,201
See if there's an overlay,
check your connections.

87
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,001
There are no mistakes.

88
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,401
Damn it, Chloe,
you were responsible
for this recording.

89
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:20,401
What the hell happened?

90
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,834
I just told you,
I don't know.

91
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,234
But if there was something
on this memory chip,

92
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:24,234
it's been erased.

93
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,401
( <i>phone rings</i> )

94
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:26,667
Yes?

95
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:27,967
STAFFER:
Excuse me, Ms. Hayes.

96
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:30,533
The attorney general's
holding on the line.

97
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:33,600
Ms. Hayes?
I heard you.

98
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,134
Bill Buchanan will
take the call in a moment.

99
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,834
I'll tell him we're having
technical difficulties,

100
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
we need to postpone
the conference.

101
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,134
Someone got to
that recording.

102
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,334
Perhaps it was damaged in
your attempts to retrieve it.

103
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,700
It wasn't.

104
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,334
Chloe, who had
access to this room?

105
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,834
No one.
Someone did!

106
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,034
Who had access to this room--
think about it!

107
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,667
Miles was in here.
What?

108
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,368
You sent him in here
to check up on me

109
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:56,401
while I was setting up.

110
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:57,834
HAYES:
I never sent him in here!

111
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:00,967
Jack...

112
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:10,434
HAYES:
Security, stop Mr. Bauer.

113
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,900
Mr. Bauer!

114
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,067
Jack, don't!

115
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,134
You son of a bitch.

116
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,368
Let go of me, Bauer.

117
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,234
Do you know how many
people lost their lives

118
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,700
so I could bring
that evidence in?

119
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,067
I don't know what
you're talking about.

120
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,567
We know it was you.

121
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,067
Let him go, Jack.

122
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:32,167
Jack, let him go!

123
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,667
Where are you going, Miles?

124
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,434
I've been transferred.

125
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:42,900
I was told to report
immediately.

126
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,034
The order should be
coming through any minute.

127
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,633
Transferred to where?

128
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:51,101
The White House.

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,201
How could you do this, Miles?

130
00:05:06,368 --> 00:05:08,633
This is not over.

131
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
There will be
an investigation.

132
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,034
Do what you
have to do, Karen...

133
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:15,767
...but I work for
the president now.

134
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,600
Jack, I'm so sorry.

135
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,967
I don't know how he did it,

136
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,368
he didn't even
touch the recorder.

137
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:38,967
Karen, Audrey Raines
heard the recording

138
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,334
when I played it
for Secretary Heller.

139
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,700
I know that she will
sign an affidavit...

140
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:42,967
Jack, not now.

141
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:46,034
Chloe, take the recorder
down to Processing.

142
00:05:46,101 --> 00:05:47,700
Break down the memory chip
and see if

143
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,867
you can
restore anything.
Fine.

144
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,067
Ms. Hayes?

145
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,101
The president's calling for you.

146
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,434
Line two.

147
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,800
Mr. President.

148
00:05:57,867 --> 00:05:59,067
LOGAN ( <i>over phone</i> ):
Karen,

149
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:00,800
what's this I hear
about a conference call

150
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:02,301
you've scheduled
with the attorney general?

151
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:04,468
Is there some problem
I should know about?

152
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,201
HAYES ( <i>over phone</i> ):
It's nothing, sir,
a mistake.

153
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,067
The conference call
was canceled.

154
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:11,700
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

155
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:14,334
Listen, the real reason
for my call is Jack Bauer.

156
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:16,267
What about Jack Bauer?

157
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,234
I'm embarrassed to say
that after further review,

158
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:21,567
it appears that the evidence
against him is, at best,

159
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:22,567
inconclusive.

160
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,600
Now, we'll have our lawyers

161
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,967
continue to work on it,
of course,

162
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:28,867
but for the time being,
I'm suspending the arrest order.

163
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:31,600
You're dropping the charges
against Bauer?

164
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,567
That's correct.

165
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,001
Mr. President, you have had
this office, other agencies,

166
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,201
and the military dedicate
all manpower and resources

167
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,500
into apprehending Jack Bauer.

168
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:44,067
Yes. Based on evidence I
initially thought was credible.

169
00:06:44,134 --> 00:06:46,334
And now I have new information

170
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,034
that's convinced me that
the original intel was faulty.

171
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,834
Am I to release
Bauer, sir?

172
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,567
I'll leave that
to your discretion.

173
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,334
Thank you, Karen.
Good work.

174
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,600
We'll be in touch.

175
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,067
Yes, Mr. President.

176
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:07,201
He's letting me go
because he knows he's won.

177
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,967
What does he gain
by releasing you?

178
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:10,567
I'll be on my own.

179
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:13,401
Alone, unprotected,
a perfect target.

180
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,633
Word just came in--
Bierko's escaped.

181
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,434
What?!

182
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,734
How long ago?!

183
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,267
The convoy that was moving him
to District was hit

184
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,434
about ten minutes ago.

185
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,201
They took out all
our agents except one:

186
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,633
Davis, on line three.

187
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:25,700
( <i>phone beeps</i> )

188
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,368
Davis, Karen Hayes.
What happened?

189
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:29,434
Our lead car got taken out
by an IED.

190
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,468
I counted six attackers.

191
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:32,800
Bierko got away

192
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,101
before I could call in backup.

193
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,401
Did you see the vehicle?

194
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:37,434
Negative.

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,101
I blacked out when I took one
in the shoulder.

196
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,667
There's a medevac team
on the way.

197
00:07:40,734 --> 00:07:41,934
DAVIS ( <i>over speakerphone</i> ):
Before I lost consciousness,

198
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:44,401
I overheard Bierko
talking to his men.

199
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:47,533
He said they're
not finished.

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,700
"Not finished"?

201
00:07:48,767 --> 00:07:50,867
Yes, ma'am,
I'm certain he said

202
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:52,401
something about a
nerve gas canister.

203
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,301
Did he say anything else?

204
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,401
I'm sorry, Ms. Hayes,
that's all I heard.

205
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:57,934
All right, Davis, stand by.

206
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,533
The medical team will
be there in a minute.

207
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,567
Copy that.

208
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:01,700
Why would Bierko even mention

209
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:03,134
the Sentox?
I don't know.

210
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,667
I assumed all the canisters
were destroyed in the explosions

211
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,067
at the distribution
center.

212
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,834
How many canisters has
forensics accounted for?

213
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,468
By the time the fires
were put out,

214
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,301
there was not enough left
to do a full accounting.

215
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,700
Damn it.

216
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,967
Bill, raise
an inter-agency
alert.

217
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:17,600
I need LAPD to do a sweep

218
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,934
of the ambush area
for witnesses.

219
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:20,900
I want search helicopters.

220
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,401
I want Chloe to have full domain

221
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,267
over surveillance
satellites.

222
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,334
This is priority one--

223
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:28,633
we have got to find
Vladimir Bierko.

224
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,434
( <i>metal door rattling</i> )

225
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:36,201
We held one in reserve,
just as you ordered...

226
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,533
but I still don't
understand why.

227
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,434
We can't do much damage

228
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,234
with one canister
of nerve gas.

229
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,301
You're so wrong.

230
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:53,867
E-Excuse me?

231
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,100
Agent...

232
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,234
It's Agent Cole,
ma'am.
Cole.

233
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:58,667
I'm sorry, Agent Cole.

234
00:09:58,733 --> 00:10:00,733
My husband said
that Aaron Pierce

235
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,267
had been transferred
to Washington,

236
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:04,367
and this is
Agent Pierce's phone.

237
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,167
I was wondering
if you'll be so good

238
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,367
as to make sure that
it's returned to him?

239
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,100
Of course.

240
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,533
Was there anything else, ma'am?

241
00:10:18,566 --> 00:10:20,433
No.

242
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,733
There's nothing else.

243
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:36,167
Oh, my God.

244
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry about this, Aaron.

245
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,934
Listen to me, Aaron.

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,566
You think you know
what's going on.

247
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:06,833
( <i>sighs</i> )

248
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,034
I'm here to tell you, you don't.

249
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,267
Then why don't you explain it
to me, Mr. President?

250
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,800
I understand Jack Bauer
led you to believe

251
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,934
that there was a recording--

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,733
something that tied me
to David Palmer's murder.

253
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,967
That recording doesn't exist.

254
00:11:26,034 --> 00:11:28,067
That's not what I've been told.

255
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:31,566
You're not hearing
what I'm saying.

256
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:36,700
The recording
doesn't exist.

257
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:40,667
It's over.

258
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,334
You have a choice here, Aaron.

259
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,301
You are a good man.

260
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,466
You're a fine agent.

261
00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:49,267
I see no reason
to throw away your career.

262
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:54,067
But I need to know
that we can put this behind us.

263
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:59,500
If you'll give me your word
that you'll let this drop,

264
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,466
I will make sure that
you are reassigned

265
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:05,533
to whatever post you want.

266
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,633
Except for the White House,
of course.

267
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,633
So...

268
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,401
what's it gonna be, Aaron?

269
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:16,367
Are my terms acceptable?

270
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:20,334
There is nothing
that you have said or done

271
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:24,367
that is acceptable to me
in the least.

272
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:28,167
You're a traitor to this country
and a disgrace to your office.

273
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,466
And it's my duty to see
that you're brought to justice

274
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,301
for what you've done.

275
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:38,200
Is there anything else, Charles?

276
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,767
I know Pierce,
Mr. President.

277
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,733
Served with him
for five years.

278
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,533
And his loyalty is
to David Palmer.

279
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,566
Believe me when I tell you,
he's going to be a problem.

280
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,100
( <i>dialing</i> )

281
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:54,167
( <i>cell phone ringing</i> )

282
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,167
Mr. President.

283
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,767
I confess, I didn't expect
to hear from you again.

284
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,466
The situation's
changed.

285
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,000
Everything's
under control.

286
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,867
The recording's been destroyed;
it's no longer a problem.

287
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:15,934
That's very good news,
Mr. President.

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,633
But what about the people
who've already heard it?

289
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,533
Can't do anything without proof.

290
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I don't think any further action
needs to be taken.

291
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:25,500
Then can we assume you've got
the rest of your house in order?

292
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:28,267
If by that you mean
my wife, yes.

293
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,667
Yes, she's cooperating fully.

294
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:34,600
As for Aaron Pierce, that's
another matter, but, um...

295
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:35,733
I'm taking care of that.

296
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,900
Of course.

297
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,301
What about Jack Bauer?

298
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,833
I've already given Karen Hayes
permission to release him,

299
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,700
and the arrangements that we
discussed about taking him out

300
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,301
have already been
set in motion.

301
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,234
It appears you have
everything well in hand,

302
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:51,433
Mr. President.

303
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,134
Yes, yes.
I said I would handle it,

304
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,633
and I have.

305
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,067
Situation's contained, there's
nothing more to worry about.

306
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,867
I'll call you back.

307
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:07,134
Mike?

308
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,466
Sir.

309
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,466
What is it, Mike?

310
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:11,967
I just got off the phone
with Karen Hayes.

311
00:15:12,034 --> 00:15:14,633
Vladimir Bierko has escaped.

312
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,167
What? How?

313
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:19,833
The caravan transporting him
to District was ambushed.

314
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,067
Damn it!

315
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:23,267
I thought we rolled CTU
into Homeland Security

316
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:25,200
just to avoid
screwups like this.

317
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,167
There's more, sir.

318
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:28,800
They have reason to believe
Bierko might be

319
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,367
readying another
terrorist attack.

320
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:31,600
What kind of attack?

321
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,633
Well, CTU's working on that now.

322
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,200
I want constant updates.

323
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,034
You keep me apprised
of the progress.

324
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,433
Yes, sir.

325
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,401
Chloe, any luck?

326
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:52,533
Only the bad kind.

327
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,733
None of these satellites
were positioned

328
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,767
toward the ambush site.

329
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,034
By the time I
queued a redirect,

330
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,334
Bierko and his men
were long gone.

331
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:58,334
You try CalTrans?

332
00:15:58,401 --> 00:15:59,466
I'm back-streaming now.

333
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,067
So far, I've
come up dry.
Keep trying.

334
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:02,600
We've got to get
an ID on the vehicle.

335
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:03,733
I know.

336
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,934
That was LAPD command.

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,067
They've combed the area,

338
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:07,234
but they can't find
any witnesses.

339
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,867
None?
4:00 a.m. in
the middle of

340
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,600
a curfew; there simply
wasn't anyone there.

341
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,800
Then we have nothing.

342
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:16,000
We've got Henderson.

343
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:17,566
What about him?
Henderson set up Bierko

344
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:19,234
with the nerve gas
to begin with.

345
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:20,934
No, we've already been
down that road.

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,466
He won't talk to us,
and you know that.

347
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:23,767
That was about
protecting Logan.

348
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,100
If Henderson's the
patriot he says he is,

349
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:26,667
he's not gonna want those
terrorists to succeed.

350
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,900
Trust me,
you're wasting your time.

351
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:28,900
He's not gonna help us.

352
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:30,401
He will if we offer him a deal.

353
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:33,134
That's not gonna happen.

354
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,833
Jack.
No.

355
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,767
Not this time.
Not this man.

356
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,867
We're running
out of options here.

357
00:16:38,934 --> 00:16:41,600
This is about saving lives,
not indulging a grudge.

358
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,967
You think this is
about a grudge?

359
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,566
He killed an ex-President
of the United States.

360
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:47,200
He tried to kill the
Secretary of Defense.

361
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,234
You want this man to walk
with full immunity?

362
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:50,334
It's not about
what anyone wants,

363
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:51,767
it's about doing
what has to be done.

364
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,934
Nobody knows that
better than you.

365
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,267
Bierko is going to
kill innocent people.

366
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,533
Henderson might be
our only chance

367
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,401
to stop him.

368
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:01,100
Jack...

369
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:03,533
what would David Palmer want
you to do if he were here?

370
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,767
The best way to honor his
memory is to make the choice

371
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,367
to save others.

372
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:15,700
Obviously, I can't stop you
from doing this.

373
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:18,633
If you're gonna give him a deal,
at least let me present it.

374
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,267
All right.

375
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:23,200
Thank you.

376
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,234
Since you're clearly
no longer a fugitive,

377
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,433
I assume they retrieved
that recording.

378
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,833
Someone got to it
and erased it.

379
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,967
I'm not here to talk
about the recording.

380
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,600
Bierko escaped
about a half an hour ago.

381
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,700
He's gonna carry out

382
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,433
another attack.
I'm sure he will.

383
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,800
You bruised the man's ego when
you stopped his first attempt.

384
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,067
You know him.

385
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:07,301
You know how he thinks.

386
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,967
You studied him
before you set up this deal.

387
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,267
What's he gonna do?

388
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:13,733
Why should I help you?

389
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,466
You call yourself
a patriot.

390
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,034
Prove it.

391
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,401
These terrorists
are gonna attack

392
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:22,334
the country that you love,
because you betrayed them.

393
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,566
Why don't you help me put out
the fire that you started?

394
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:35,067
They sent you in here
to broker a deal, didn't they?

395
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,566
What's the offer, full immunity?

396
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:46,733
That just must be
really eating you up inside.

397
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,566
What do you think?

398
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:50,234
You were responsible
for the murder

399
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:51,767
of people that I cared about.

400
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,100
I am sorry
about David Palmer, I am.

401
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,733
But what I did
was in the interest

402
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,067
of the destiny of this country.

403
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:59,100
And I'm not talking about
the version you read on

404
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,367
the op-ed pages pages
ofthe <i>New York Times.</i>

405
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm talking about
the politics of survival--

406
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,067
the way the world really works.

407
00:19:05,134 --> 00:19:07,700
Do you want immunity or not?

408
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,767
Immunity is worthless.

409
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,833
Yeah.

410
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:17,234
( <i>beeping</i> )
Jack.

411
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,433
That recording
was my only immunity.

412
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,867
They give me a piece of paper,

413
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:24,733
I walk out of here,
I'm a dead man.

414
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,934
It's two days, two hours,
two months, who cares?

415
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,667
They're gonna take me down.

416
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,600
Who's they?

417
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,267
Same people that made Walt
Cummings look like a suicide.

418
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:36,867
Come on, Jack.

419
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:38,833
You can't really believe
that Charles Logan

420
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,234
masterminded all of this
by himself.

421
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:42,600
Give me the names.

422
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,067
You can't touch them.

423
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,600
But they can touch you.

424
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,134
I'll help you catch Bierko.

425
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,134
But not for an immunity deal.

426
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,466
I need something more,

427
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,301
and you're the only person
can make it happen.

428
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:58,433
What do you want?

429
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,466
To disappear,

430
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,000
just like you did

431
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,433
so they wouldn't turn
you over to the Chinese.

432
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,200
Except, I'm not gonna
make your mistake.

433
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm gonna leave the country,
I'm gonna take Miriam with me.

434
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,234
You don't need my
help for that.

435
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,533
Actually, I do.

436
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,267
All of my contacts are still
loyal to the President.

437
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:15,733
I need somebody I can trust
to cover our tracks.

438
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
I need somebody who can do
a better job of it

439
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:20,401
than those incompetents
who failed to cover yours.

440
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,700
What makes you think
that I'm not gonna kill you

441
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,633
the second this is over?

442
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Because you're
gonna give me

443
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,466
your word.

444
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,700
And I know what your word
is worth to you.

445
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,733
So it's all I need.

446
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,500
Anything less than
Bierko's head on a plate,

447
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:42,800
this deal is off.

448
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,867
Fine.

449
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:49,000
Now, Bierko is gonna hit hard,
so you gonna think fast

450
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,800
Chloe, do a phone
check on these 14 names.

451
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,067
I want you working out
of the Situation Room.

452
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,333
What do we have?

453
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,333
Henderson gave us 14 names
that he believes

454
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,867
Bierko's gonna contact first.

455
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:18,134
Chloe's doing a phone check
and pulling up relative data.

456
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,067
Is Tactical standing by?
They're on priority alert.

457
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:22,333
I put Curtis Manning in command,
if it's all right with you.

458
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,633
I trust your judgment, Bill.
Security's getting ready

459
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,666
to bring Henderson in here
for a debrief.

460
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:30,933
Excuse me for one second.

461
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:35,566
Audrey.

462
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,666
Jack, I just heard
about the recording.

463
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:39,833
Has it really
been destroyed?

464
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,700
President Logan managed
to get to it.

465
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,167
My God.

466
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,700
We have a more
immediate problem.

467
00:21:44,767 --> 00:21:46,666
Bierko. I heard that he escaped.
That's why I came back out here.

468
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:47,833
I was hoping that I could help.

469
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,399
Why is Henderson
coming out of Holding?

470
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:52,200
We're using him

471
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,067
to help us find Bierko.

472
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:56,033
Audrey, Karen
made a deal.

473
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,566
She gave him immunity.

474
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,433
What?! Jack,
how can you let this happen?

475
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,000
You know what that man has done.

476
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,500
We didn't have a choice.

477
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:05,234
Bierko's our number
one priority.

478
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:06,767
We know
he's planning another attack.

479
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,767
Without Henderson's help,
we won't find him.

480
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,967
BUCHANAN:
Jack!

481
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,000
I think we've
got something.

482
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,900
Audrey, I'm sorry.

483
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,134
I've got to go.

484
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,666
CHLOE:
Out of the 14 names on the list,

485
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:27,100
only one has an active
cell phone-- Joseph Malina.

486
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,833
Joseph Malina's an arms dealer.

487
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,700
Used to be
a military contractor

488
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,333
until they accused him
of selling secrets.

489
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:33,500
But they couldn't
prove anything,

490
00:22:33,566 --> 00:22:34,900
so he beat
all the charges.

491
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,333
You know him?

492
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:38,900
Well enough. I did business
with him before and after

493
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,566
he was arrested.
HAYES:
What do you have on him?

494
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:44,433
Malina got a 12 second call
on his home phone at 4:03 a.m.

495
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,900
from a pay phone in Van Nuys
not far from the ambush site.

496
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,366
A minute later, the same
pay phone got a call-back

497
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,533
from a GSM Sat phone.

498
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,566
In other words, he
took down the number,

499
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,266
called from an
untraceable line.

500
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,566
Sounds like our guy.

501
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:56,967
Tell Curtis
to mobilize his tactical team.

502
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,134
Hang on, hang on.

503
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,900
What good is that going
to accomplish?

504
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,666
You're going
to bring Malina in here.

505
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:03,399
You think he's just going
to roll over on Bierko?

506
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,366
He didn't cut a deal

507
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:05,366
when he was busted before,

508
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:06,767
he's not gonna cut a deal now.

509
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,266
And even if you can crack him--

510
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:09,666
I don't think
you can--

511
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:11,733
you're going to need hours,
and you don't have hours.

512
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,900
What do you suggest?

513
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:15,833
I suggest you send me in
to talk to Malina.

514
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,833
I'll find out
what Bierko got from him.

515
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't think so.
Jack, don't be stupid.

516
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,167
You know you can't get anything
out of this guy,

517
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:24,466
and his computer makes
this place

518
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,266
look like
an Internet cafe.

519
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,867
He's got the absolute,
most sophisticated,

520
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,566
state-of-the-art
security system,

521
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,533
including a Phoenix Shield.

522
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,733
We can get through it.

523
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,833
Not a Phoenix.
It's a poison pill firewall.

524
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,266
Any attempt
at circumventing it,

525
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,666
and the hard drive does
a cold-start erase,

526
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,800
at which point, you can forget
about retrieving any data.

527
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:43,000
Take him back to Holding.

528
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,666
I don't think
we have a choice here.

529
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,867
Karen, please, don't do this.

530
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,800
Jack, I know
how you feel,

531
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,000
but Henderson's right.

532
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,067
We can't afford
to gamble on this play.

533
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,067
Damn it, Bill,
you cannot trust this guy.

534
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:03,500
HAYES:
I agree.

535
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,067
That's why I'm sending you
with him.

536
00:24:05,134 --> 00:24:07,299
I want him under your guard
on a tight leash.

537
00:24:07,366 --> 00:24:09,333
If he tries anything,
I swear to you,

538
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:10,666
I will kill him.

539
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:14,100
Then don't let it get
to that point.

540
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,666
* *

541
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,333
* *

542
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,366
Get in.

543
00:25:27,433 --> 00:25:29,100
Adams, listen to me.

544
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:31,600
You don't have to do this.

545
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:33,033
Logan isn't worth protecting.

546
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,433
You know that.

547
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,767
He's not going
to get away

548
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,266
with any of this,
and neither will you.

549
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,867
Shut up and get in the trunk.

550
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:40,234
Use your head.
Logan wants me

551
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,234
dead because he thinks
I know too much,

552
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,500
that I'm a liability.

553
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,867
How soon before
you're just another liability?

554

00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,967
MARTHA:
What are you doing?

557
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,500
Ma'am please stay
where you are.

558
00:25:58,566 --> 00:26:00,500
Aaron?

559
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:06,833
You're going to shoot me?

560
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm the First Lady.

561
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,366
You're going
to shoot the First Lady?

562

Who are you calling?

563
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:26,134
Mrs. Logan,
this is my last warning.

Martha.

Aaron!

571
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:02,733
( <i>crying</i> )

572
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,500
Aaron, stay with me.

00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:07,600
Aaron! Oh, God.

574
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:11,466
Oh, God, Aaron.

575
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:32,767
CURTIS:
Jack, we're coming up
on Malina's place.

576
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,366
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

( <i>engine revving</i> )

578
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,466
Curtis, I want you
to set up a perimeter.

579
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,667
I want a man at each
possible escape route.

580
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,733
You got it.
As for you, you
got ten minutes.

581
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,667
You don't get the
intelligence from
Malina by then,

582
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:02,567
we come through the door,
and we interrogate him.

583
00:28:02,633 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm gonna tell you again, Jack,
interrogating won't work.

584
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,733
This guy won't break.
Then you better hope
your way does.

585
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,833
Get me an audio pack.
Undo your shirt.

586
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,567
Wait a minute.
You can't wire me.

587
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,800
Why not?
Well, think
about it, Jack.

588
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,066
You heard Malina's file.

589
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:15,800
This guy didn't get where he got
by being careless.

590
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,533
He's got a scanner, frequency
detector, God knows what else.

591
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,633
The second I walk
through that door with a wire,

592
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,333
the bells go off,
this thing's over.

593
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:28,366
Look, you don't
trust me, fine.

594
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:30,733
And just so we're straight,
I don't trust you, either,

595
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,366
but neither one of us can afford
to blow this operation.

596
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,034
We're all set. Men
are in position.

597
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,600
No games, Christopher.

598
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:41,633
I don't need another reason
to put a bullet in your brain.

599
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,934
You got ten minutes.

600
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,133
Have CTU in-monitor
channel 8.

601
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,433
Hold up.

602
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,800

We have to talk.

608
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:31,500
What, at 4:30 in the morning?

609
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:33,800
About Vladimir Bierko.

610
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:36,700
You don't waste my time,
I don't waste your time.

Hey!

621
00:31:02,466 --> 00:31:04,066
What's so important
it couldn't wait?

622
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
What are you
looking for?

623
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:12,600
Is there another way out
of here?

624
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,800
What the hell are
you talking about?

625
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,099
Jack, I don't like this.

00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,366
What's Henderson doing?

627
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:18,934
I don't yet.
Maintain your position.

628
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,800
I repeat,
maintain your position.

629
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,099
Secure-cache the files.

630

Anything you can't do without.

631
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,466
Why?

632
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,199
Because there
is an entire phalanx

633
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:28,066
of CTU agents outside,

634
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:30,233
including an ex-agent
named Jack Bauer.

635
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,934
He's selling us out, Jack.

636

HENDERSON:
Now, Bauer is running me.

637
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,099
I cut a deal with him,
but I know

638
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,967
this guy's gonna kill me
first chance he gets.

639
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:38,400
JACK:
Curtis, move your team in now.

640

He was coming here anyway.

00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,133
So secure the files,
crash the system.

644
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,266
Stop wasting time, and do it!

645
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,633
( <i>panting</i> )

646
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,700
( <i>whirring</i> )

647
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,733
( <i>blow torch hissing</i> )

648
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,633
( <i>panting</i> )

649
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,233
Give me a weapon.

650
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,934
( <i>glass shattering in distance</i> )

651
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,867
Freeze! ( <i>yells</i> )

652
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:10,733
( <i>groans</i> )

653
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,066
( <i>grunts</i> )

654
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,099
( <i>Curtis groans</i> )

655
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,767
Christopher!

656
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,433
Let me see your hands! Now!

657
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,867
Slowly stand up.

658
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:27,066
Put the weapon
on the counter.

659
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,867
Step back.

660
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,099
Curtis,
how are your men?

661
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,567
CURTIS:
My men are fine.

662
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:39,133
I've been hit,
but I'm okay.

663
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:41,066
Call in medical;
get him transferred back to CTU.

664
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,366
What's Malina's condition?

665
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:43,400
Gunshot to the hip.

666
00:33:43,466 --> 00:33:44,366
He's losing blood.

667
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:46,199
Stabilize him,
keep him alive.

668
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,233
I had him, Jack.

669
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,800
30 more seconds
was all I needed.

670
00:33:48,867 --> 00:33:49,867
You played me.

671
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:51,400
This is over;
you're going back.

672
00:33:51,466 --> 00:33:52,900
No, you blew it, Jack.

673
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,466
What are you talking about?

674
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,166
I got him to life the firewall,
and he was about to dump

675
00:33:57,233 --> 00:33:58,800
all of his files
onto a flash drive

676
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,800
before you jumped the
gun and busted in here.

677
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,833
Now you're going to waste a hell
of a lot of time

678
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,400
trying to decrypt those
files off a mainframe,

679
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:07,433
so you'd better pray there's
something on there you can read.

680
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,266
Cuff him.

681
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,000
Bill, this is Jack.

682
00:34:14,066 --> 00:34:15,600
Get Chloe to open up a channel.

683
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm going to send you some files
from Malina's computer.

684
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:19,300
I'm on it, Jack.

685
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:21,133
Chloe, I need you
to access these files,

686
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,867
find out which ones were opened
in the last ten minutes.

687
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:25,066
They'll tell us
what Malina sold Bierko.

688
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:26,366
They're coming through now--
hang on.

689
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,567
Bill, Curtis was hit--
he's stable,

690
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,233
but I'm having him transported
back to CTU.

691
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,700
All right, Jack,
I'll tell Medical.

692
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:33,400
Send a chopper
over to this location.

693
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,199
As soon as we know
what Bierko's target is,

694
00:34:35,266 --> 00:34:36,600
we're going to need
to move fast.

695
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:38,266
Okay, I got through
the firewall.

696
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,099
It's still going to take me
some time to decrypt the files.

697
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,000
Chloe, just do it as quickly
as you can.

698
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,633
Bierko's going to release
the Sentox gas soon.

699
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,133
We need to know where.

700
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,533
There, you should
have everything.

701
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,633
Let's go.

702
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,934
Aaron?

703
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,233
Charles lied to me.

704
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,667
He said you'd been transferred
to Washington.

705
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,533
That agent, um...

706
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Adams,

707
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:20,467
my husband ordered him
to kill you, didn't he?

708
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:22,934
Yes, ma'am.

709
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:26,600
But I'm sorry
to tell you...

710
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:30,467
the president was involved with
much worse things than that.

711
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:34,001
I know.

712
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:40,734
I was going to let him
get away with it... all of it.

713
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,333
I was going to keep quiet.

714
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,734
We have to do something.

715
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,067
I'll hide the body,
get him in the trunk,

716
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:54,834
but I can't drive it
out of here.

717
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,634
The president has to believe
that I'm dead.

718
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,934
I need to lay low,
keep out of sight.

719
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,467
I can do it.

720
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:06,200
No. No.
Yes, Aaron, I can drive it.

721
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:09,667
No, you need to get back
inside the residence.

722
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:13,800
Your husband can't suspect
that anything has gone wrong.

723
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,867
You need to find Mike Novick.

724
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:18,634
Mike?

725
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,233
Tell him everything.

726
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,433
And tell him
to meet me here.

727
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,467
Okay.

728
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:31,567
Aaron, promise me...

729
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:36,067
promise me that
if something goes wrong

730
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:38,533
and you're in danger
of getting caught,

731
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
you will find a way
off these grounds,

732
00:36:40,667 --> 00:36:44,101
and you will leave.

733
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,900
Promise me.

734
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:49,367
You have my word.

735
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,067
Secure him
by the tailgate.

736
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,934
( <i>dialing</i> )

737
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:25,433
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

738
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,734
Buchanan.

739
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,767
Bill, it's Jack.

740
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:28,900
How is Chloe doing
with the files?

741
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:30,300
Almost there, Jack.

742
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:31,667
Okay, I got it.

743
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:33,934
Wait, there's something more.

744
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:38,934
Classified defense contracts
and plans.

745
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:42,133
It's a Russian submarine, Jack.

746
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,600
The <i>Natalia-K524,</i>
Delta-IV class.

747
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,600
It's here for inspection
by our navy.

748
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,300
Why is the U.S. Navy inspecting
a Russian submarine?

749
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,700
It's part of the treaty
that President Logan

750
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,266
and President Suvarov signed.

751
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,400
There's a provision that calls
for the sharing of technology.

752
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:57,800
Where is it docked?

753
00:37:57,867 --> 00:37:59,333
Docking Station 8.

754
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,533
It's a non-military shipyard
at the Port of Los Angeles.

755
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,967
I'll deploy TAC teams
to the port.

756
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:04,133
Good.

757
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,367
Chloe, hold on.

758
00:38:06,433 --> 00:38:09,200
What's the armament package
on a Russian Delta IV-class sub?

759
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:12,433
Best of my knowledge, 12
Scorpion land attack missiles.

760
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,634
Are they nuclear?

761
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,101
No, but they're fast
and accurate.

762
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,400
ey carry multiple warheads.

763
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:18,300
One could take out
several city blocks.

764
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,667
( <i>helicopter propeller</i>
<i>whirring</i> )

765
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:20,734
Uncuff him.

766
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,433
Karen, it's Jack.

767
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,600
Are you still there?

768
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:24,634
Yes, Jack, I'm here.

769
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,333
Okay, I need you
to put me in touch

770
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,767
with the ranking U.S. officer
on the <i>Natalia.</i>

771
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:31,634
We need to get them to lock out
their onboard weapons systems!

772
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,734
All right, I'll have Audrey
call DOD

773
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,567
and open a priority line
to the sub,

774
00:38:35,634 --> 00:38:36,667
and she'll get back to you.

775
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:38,467
Okay, thank you.

776
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:39,834
You're coming with me.

777
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,800
I found Bierko's
target for you.

778
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,734
The deal was Bierko's head
on a plate.

779
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,101
What do you want me to do
now-- kill him for you?!

780
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,500
The only reason
you're going with me

781
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:49,834
is 'cause you know
the weapons systems.

782
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,233
Go!

783
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:07,333
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

784
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,800
This is Bauer.

785
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:10,767
Jack, I've got the U.S. Navy's
ranking officer

786
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:12,467
on board the <i>Natalia--</i>
I'm putting you through.

787
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,467
Okay, Audrey,
stay on the line.

788
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:16,667
All right, Jack, hold on.

789
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,133
AUDREY:
Lieutenant Southern,
you're on with Jack Bauer.

790
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,001
Agent Bauer, what is this about?

791
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,200
JACK:
Lieutenant,
we believe the <i>Natalia</i>

792
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:26,200
has been targeted for
a terrorist attack.

793
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:27,867
You need to
secure your vessel

794
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:29,533
and lock down your weapons
systems immediately.

795
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,667
Ski!

796
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,266
Call all hands,
set Condition Delta,

797
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,400
seal the bridge

798
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,600
and aft hatches.

799
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,667
Aye, sir.
You need to put
your men on alert.

800
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:37,967
There's a threat
to your submarine.

801
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,767
( <i>speaking Russian</i> )

802
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,433
Now, what is the nature
of this threat?

803
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,533
We think the terrorists are
after your missiles on the sub.

804
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,467
I'm going to check right now.

805
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:07,667
Sailor! I've got that.

806
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:08,967
Report aft.

807
00:40:14,734 --> 00:40:15,934
Bauer.

808
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,400
I'm checking topside.

809
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,867
Lieutenant!

810
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:31,101
Damn it, Audrey, I've lost him.

811
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:32,200
Notify DOD.

812
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,400
All right, Jack, I'm on it.

813
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,634
Captain, how far out
are we?

814
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,101
Just over five minutes, sir.

815

( <i>device beeps</i> )

816
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,067
( <i>typing</i> )

817
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:02,800
Read me the code
we got from Malina.

818
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:04,567
PETROV:
"Alpha 255

819
00:42:04,634 --> 00:42:06,067
Tango Romeo 99."

00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:09,800
( <i>beeps</i> )

821
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,467
We have control
of the weapons system.

822
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,500
Are the missiles loaded?

823
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,266
Vertical tubes are loaded
and ready.

824
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,133
Loading horizontal tubes now.
