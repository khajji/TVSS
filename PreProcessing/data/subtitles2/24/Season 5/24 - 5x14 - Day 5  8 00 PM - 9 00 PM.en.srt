3
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:14,401
Have you got it yet?

4
00:00:14,468 --> 00:00:16,434
Told you I'd call you
as soon as I have everything.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,034
I'm paying you a lot of money,
Collette.

6
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:20,667
And if you could've gotten

7
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:22,800
the detailed specs of a facility
this secure

8
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,734
from someone else, you would've.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,734
CTU is no longer
an obstacle.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,167
MAN:
This facility
has been contaminated

11
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:31,567
with Sentox VX1 nerve gas.

12
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:34,767
Repeat: this facility
has been contaminated.

13
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,468
Everybody, leave
the situation room.
Move! Now!

14
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,001
Seal it.

15
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,567
Lynn, it's Jack.

16
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:41,167
We found a computer interrupt

17
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,734
in the AC control unit.
Now if we can

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,101
shut that down in the next few
minutes, we can stop the gas

19
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:46,633
from permeating the safe zones.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,001
The problem is
you're the only person

21
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,234
close enough to get to it.

22
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:51,234
Lynn, the truth is
if I could get there,

23
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,934
I would do this myself,
but I'm not close enough.

24
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,234
And I'm going to have
to ask you to do it

25
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,401
without any protection.

26
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,067
He did it.

27
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,368
Oh, my God.

28
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,667
( groans )

29
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:10,734
CTU is protecting
this city.

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,167
Are you saying
they're no longer

31
00:01:12,234 --> 00:01:13,567
capable of doing that?

32
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,201
I'm saying they've been
seriously compromised here.

33
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:18,001
We've got terrorists with nerve
gas canisters out there.

34
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:19,967
Who is going to stop them?

35
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:21,500
Mr. President, I suggest

36
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:23,134
an emergency restructuring.

37
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:25,700
CTU is no longer
an operational entity.

38
00:01:25,767 --> 00:01:28,533
It's a building with workers
who will report to us.

39
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,167
I can see
no other option right now

40
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,600
but to impose marshal law
on the city of Los Angeles.

41
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,500
What I will not do

42
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:38,234
is stand by and watch
Hal Gardner use you

43
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,101
to promote his own agenda.

44
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,201
You killed my wife

45
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,734
Michelle Dessler this morning.

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,234
She was my life.

47
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:47,967
And you took her.

48
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:48,900
My God, he's got a gun.

49
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:50,034
You can't do this.

50
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,600
We have to get him talking.

51
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,800
He's our only lead to Bierko
and the Sentox gas canisters.

52
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,034
You've had your chance.

53
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:58,167
He's mine now.

54
00:01:58,234 --> 00:01:59,134
Tony!

55
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,934
Oh, my God!

56
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,301
Jack, I am so sorry.

57
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:37,201
Security find Henderson yet?
No, he got

58
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,067
out of the building
before the lockdown.

59
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:42,034
An external cam got a shot
of him as he was leaving.

60
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,900
And the car that he was using
was found a block away.

61
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:46,001
But I think that we might've
got what we needed from him.

62
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,468
What are you talking about?

63
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,800
Chloe was able to decrypt
a file from his computer.

64
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:52,134
She got a name of someone
connected to Bierko.

65
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:53,667
Who's Collette Stenger?

66
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:56,067
She's an international
intelligence broker.

67
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,967
State secrets,
intellectual property.

68
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,967
What's her connection
to Bierko?

69
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,334
Interpol claims
that she and Bierko

70
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:02,834
met at least twice over
the last eight months.

71
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,301
And we think she helped
broker the deal.

72
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:05,533
Is she still in Los Angeles?

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,434
She gave a name of
a hotel to customs.

74
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,101
But nothing's to say
that she's actually there.

75
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,567
Curtis is prepping
a tactical team

76
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,834
to try to bring her in.
Okay.
Good work.

77
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,500
( cell phone rings )

78
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:17,667
Manning.

79
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:18,667
Curtis, it's Jack.

80
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:19,700
When is the tac team
leaving?

81
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,934
Right now.
I'm going with you.

82
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,034
All right.

83
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,267
I have no intention...

84
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:28,767
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

85
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,134
member of the press corps...

86
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:32,267
Just so you're aware,
there will be no Q&A

87
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:34,234
following
the president's statement.

88
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,533
But you can submit questions
to my office...

89
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,767
You're having
second thoughts?

90
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,867
Putting soldiers
on the streets of L.A.,

91
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,401
this will not be
a popular announcement.

92
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:44,533
Maybe not.

93
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,800
But it's the right move.

94
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,301
Hal, would you
excuse us, please?

95
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:50,001
Mrs. Logan, the president's
about to go on the air.

96
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,001
I'll be brief.

97
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,301
I would like a moment
alone with my husband.

98
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,468
BROWN:
Now, before we begin,

99
00:03:56,533 --> 00:04:00,334
I want to take a second to
address an issue of security.

100
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:02,834
I understand that many of you
have been here since early...

101
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,167
I've made up
my mind, Martha.

102
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,167
I'm not debating
this anymore.

103
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:07,234
Just listen, listen please.

104
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,734
Mike Novick spoke
to someone at CTU.

105
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,600
They think they have
a lead on this man,

106
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,301
this man Bierko.

107
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:12,567
They think they may

108
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:14,734
find him before he launches
another attack.

109
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,368
CTU was just hit.
40% of their people

110
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,334
are either dead
or unable to work.

111
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,800
To think that they
would be able

112
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,500
to stop this attack, that's
just wishful thinking.

113
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,834
Maybe not.

114
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,368
( sighs )

115
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:25,767
Bringing the military in

116
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,834
is the best way
to maintain order.

117
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,301
The Vice President's
right about that.

118
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:31,533
Of course he is.

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,700
What's that mean?

120
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:36,134
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

121
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,834
that he proposed this whole
thing to set you up for a fall?

122
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,301
So he gets the nomination
next year.

123
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,700
That's insane.

124
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,167
Hal's only motivation
is what's best for the country.

125
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:49,734
There's going to be fallout.

126
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,034
Hal knows it.

127
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,067
And you know it.

128
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,834
I have to go.

129
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,201
Charles...

130
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:03,368
Ladies and gentlemen,

131
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:06,934
the President of
the United States.

132
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:14,834
As you all know,
America has been hit today

133
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,167
by a series
of terrorist strikes,

134
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,900
beginning with the assassination
of former President David Palmer

135
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:25,101
and the murder of innocent
Americans at Ontario Airport,

136
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,034
followed by
the attempted assassination

137
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:28,201
of Russian President
Yuri Suvarov.

138
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:30,434
These events
are being orchestrated

139
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,101
by terrorists
operating within our borders.

140
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,767
Our most recent intelligence
suggests

141
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:40,800
that they will strike again
and soon.

142
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,533
I can and will
do my sworn duty

143
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
to ensure the safety
of the American people.

144
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:51,101
Therefore I am issuing
an executive order

145
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,867
imposing a curfew
on all civilians

146
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,167
in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.

147
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,967
This curfew will be effective
immediately and will be

148
00:06:00,034 --> 00:06:03,101
enforced by the military.

149
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:06,934
As disruptive and distasteful as
I know this is for many of you,

150
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:11,500
I would ask that you remember
that we are at war.

151
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:12,734
Bracing ourselves
against future attacks...

152
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,201
D.O.D. is asking for a list
of our casualties.

153
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:18,001
I don't want any
names released

154
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,667
until the next of kin
have been notified.

155
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,101
Let me know when that happens.

156
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:31,633
This place is
a sinking ship.

157
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,533
We should be
taking over now,

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,334
not going through the
charade of an assessment.

159
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,500
Until we're ready to transition,

160
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,234
we need everyone here
functioning.

161
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,301
Once the remaining canisters
of nerve gas have been found

162
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:42,500
and the terrorists captured,

163
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,167
then we'll assume full control.

164
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:45,167
Karen.

165
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:46,500
Hello, Bill.

166
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,667
Bill Buchanan,
Miles Papazian from my office.

167
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:51,034
I appreciate your coming,
but that wasn't necessary.

168
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:52,667
We just need to replace
some key personnel.

169
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,734
We're all sorry
about the loss of lives here,

170
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,434
but the White House feels
you may need more than that.

171
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,700
They want an assessment

172
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,034
of how Homeland
may best assist CTU.

173
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,834
I'll brief you in my office.

174
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,034
Fine.

175
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:07,368
Miles, familiarize yourself

176
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,001
with the networks,
and then start the survey.

177
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,700
Let's go.

178
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,201
Upstairs.

179
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:20,267
Chloe O'Brian?

180
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:21,301
Who are you?

181
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:22,667
Homeland Security.

182
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,167
I asked your name,
not who you work for.

183
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,434
I need a vacant station set up.

184
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,001
I'm kind of busy right now.

185
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,834
I'm seeing Edgar Stiles
listed on my report

186
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,401
as a casualty.

187
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:35,533
Is that right?

188
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,401
Yeah.

189
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,301
Then his station
should be available.

190
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:41,633
I'll set up over there.

191
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:45,734
I'll be reinstalling
operating protocols

192
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,767
for everyone in your group,

193
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:47,900
so I'll need your keycard.

194
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,034
No.

195
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm sorry?

196
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,800
You can't have my keycard.

197
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,533
We're here with a priority
admin directive.

198
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,234
You can confirm that with your
supervisor on your own time.

199
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,734
REPORTER:
We're live in Los Angeles,
where just a few minutes ago,

200
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,234
Army units
stationed in L.A. County

201
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,201
began moving in force
across city limits.

202
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:28,600
This is the first time a
military presence of this scale

203
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,234
has been activated
in a major metropolitan area.

204
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,700
While White House officials
have stopped short

205
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,201
of officially declaring
full-scale martial law...

206
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,167
Where are you going?

207
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,967
I just need some fresh air.

208
00:08:40,034 --> 00:08:41,667
These mobile Army divisions
were activated

209
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:42,934
shortly after
the President's press conference

210
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:46,633
in which he declared
an enforced curfew.

211
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,067
Officials are hoping
the curfew will prevent

212
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:50,468
further acts of terror.

213
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,267
I do not trust him.

214
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,600
Ma'am?

215
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,234
The Vice President.

216
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:04,800
( cell phone ringing )

217
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,434
This is Aaron Pierce.

218
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,267
Aaron, it's Wayne Palmer.

219
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,334
Sir, I am so sorry

220
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:18,167
about President Palmer,
more sorry than I can describe.

221
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,234
Aaron, I know how close
you were to my brother.

222
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:22,500
You must have known
he felt the same way about you.

223
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,667
Thank you for saying that.

224
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:27,201
Actually, Aaron,
he's the reason I'm calling.

225
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,434
There's something
from my brother

226
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,834
I need to give you
personally.

227
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,434
I should be there
within the hour.

228
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,800
You're coming here?

229
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,134
Yeah, I know
it sounds impulsive, Aaron.

230
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,600
But I'd rather see you
sooner than later.

231
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:38,468
There's a curfew in effect, sir.

232
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,533
I know, I know.
I left before it was declared.

233
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,134
If I may say so, this
is an odd request.

234
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:47,468
Aaron, my brother
trusted you with his life.

235
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,633
I am asking you to trust me.

236
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,201
All right.

237
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,667
I'd also appreciate it if
you would keep this between us.

238
00:09:53,734 --> 00:09:57,368
I'm hoping there's somewhere
we can meet discreetly.

239
00:09:57,434 --> 00:09:58,900
I'll find a place.

240
00:09:58,967 --> 00:09:59,900
Thank you, Aaron.

241
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,900
I'll call you when I'm close.

242
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:10,134
REPORTER:
The effects of this action
will no doubt

243
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,201
ripple across the country, as
other cities begin to take note.

244
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,867
So while legislators debate

245
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,934
the legality
of President Logan's action,

246
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:18,734
martial law is already a fact...

247
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,001
Mike, turn it off.

248
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,167
...on the ground,
here in Los Angeles.

249
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,101
( TV turns off )

250
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:27,201
"Debate the legality
of President Logan's action."

251
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:28,301
Did you hear that?

252
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:29,734
They're talking about this

253
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,834
like it's
an illegal action.

254
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,500
Don't worry, Mr. President.

255
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,700
I'm in control of the situation.

256
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,633
Our legal people are
working on it right now.

257
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:48,734
Do we have
anything more from CTU?

258
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,001
They're still following
up on this Bierko lead.

259
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,468
As soon as they have
something to report,

260
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,600
we'll be the first to hear.

261
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:04,134
Give me details of the current
threat assessment.

262
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,167
There's a high probability

263
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,500
that Bierko is
planning an attack

264
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,600
on a much larger scale
than anything we've seen today.

265
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,667
That's why he
targeted CTU--

266
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:12,401
to cripple our ability
to stop him.

267
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:15,134
And the question is:
Was he successful?

268
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:16,967
When you look
at the numbers,

269
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,034
you were harder hit
than you thought, Bill.

270
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,334
We're still functioning.

271
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,767
Maybe not at a 100%,

272
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:24,001
but when you install
the people I've asked for...

273
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,234
we'll be back
to fighting strength.

274
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,368
Have you made any progress
finding Bierko?

275
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:29,600
We've identified a woman
we believe might lead us to him.

276
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,234
Collette Stenger.

277
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:33,401
We've just sent a tac team
to bring her in.

278
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:35,700
Good.

279
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,934
I enjoy watching
you get dressed

280
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:47,434
almost as much as I enjoy
watching you get undressed.

281
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,201
You should get dressed yourself

282
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:51,401
and send
the bags down.

283
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,800
This deal you're working on,

284
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:55,867
I hope you're getting
a lot of money for it.

285
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:58,633
I never talk about my business,
you know that.

286
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,900
I know...

287
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,301
but Maria called about
this villa in Positano.

288
00:12:02,368 --> 00:12:04,633
She said when you see it,
you'll love it.

289
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,734
We'll call her later.

290
00:12:13,034 --> 00:12:14,633
I'll see you at
the airport, okay?

291
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,334
In 45 minutes.

292
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,401
I'll be there.

293
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,700
( cell phone ringing )

294
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:27,700
Yes.

295
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,301
I'm on my way.

296
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:31,368
And you have
everything I asked for?

297
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:32,201
Of course.

298
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:33,401
Good.

299
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:34,434
Do you have
the money?

300
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,468
As soon as I verify

301
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,667
the merchandise,

302
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,834
I'll have it transferred
to your account.

303
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,401
I'll be there soon.

304
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,301
Does she have the schematics
and the access codes?

305
00:12:45,368 --> 00:12:46,600
Yes.

306
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,067
Everything we need.

307
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,867
The Distribution Center is
a difficult target.

308
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:53,633
It would be much easier
to hit a less secure location.

309
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,067
No, Mikhail, this is the place.

310
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:59,234
Release
the Sentox here...

311
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:04,767
and 200,000 people die.

312
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:19,934
And we need a second satellite

313
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,467
repositioned as
soon as possible.

314
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,734
Good. Thank you.

315
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,201
I saw a request

316
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:26,634
for proficiency evaluations
for all CTU personnel

317
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,034
on my secondary
screen.

318
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,301
That's a formality.

319
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,901
The fact is, we don't have time
for evaluations

320
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,667
right now.
Then why was it put
in the pipeline?

321
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:34,234
Like I said, it's a formality.

322
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:36,767
You're here to shut
this place down, aren't you?

323
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:38,234
And the evaluations
will be filled in later

324
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,301
as a matter of protocol.

325
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,467
I told you before,
the White House...

326
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,268
I know what you told me before.

327
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:45,800
Now tell me the truth.

328
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,001
The truth is, CTU is being
absorbed by Homeland.

329
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,301
Which means,
from now on,

330
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,433
every operational decision
needs to go through me.

331
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,800
Bill, what
did you expect?

332
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:01,800
You've been infiltrated.

333
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:02,800
56 of your people

334
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:03,867
have been killed.

335
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:04,834
The others are
demoralized...

336
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,201
They're not demoralized,

337
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:07,167
they're angry!

338
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:08,334
They want to fight back.

339
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,301
They're willing
to lay down their lives.

340
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:11,634
Some already
have...

341
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,734
It's done, Bill.

342
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,134
The decision's been made.

343
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,167
And I know
neither one of us

344
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,301
wants this transition
to interfere

345
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:18,301
with ongoing protocol,

346
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,533
so let's just
keep it between us.

347
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,101
At least until
this crisis plays out.

348
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:34,567
There.

349
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:39,034
Bill?

350
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:43,301
Homeland is being overly
aggressive with their survey.

351
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:44,301
What is going on?

352
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:45,667
Nothing.

353
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,600
It's just a formality.

354
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:50,533
They'll be gone as soon as
they finish their evaluation.

355
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,067
Where are we on
the military mobilization?

356
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:57,400
Martial law is in effect

357
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:58,967
in nine of the
15 L.A. districts.

358
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:01,433
I'm setting up checkpoints for
the rest of the county now.

359
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,268
I hope the president's
doing the right thing.

360
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,134
CURTIS:
Alpha Team,

361
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,667
we're approaching
Collette Stenger's
apartment

362
00:15:20,734 --> 00:15:21,700
and we're ready to move.

363
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:22,967
Are you in position?

364
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:23,901
AGENT ( over radio ):
Affirmative.

365
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,500
We've got the lobby covered.

366
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:26,567
CURTIS:
Copy.

367
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:05,700
I think she went for the roof.

368
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:06,901
Cover the stairs.

369
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:11,001
Let's go.

370
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,500
We're going up top.

371
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,467
JACK:
Drop the gun!

372
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,167
Stand down or he dies!

373
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,301
I said stand down!

374
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:28,834
Our people are all around you.

375
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:32,901
They will drop you before
you could pull that trigger.

376
00:17:32,967 --> 00:17:34,667
Put the gun down!

377
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,201
What do you mean
your "people?"

378
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:37,433
Who are you?

379
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,567
Counter Terrorist Unit,
Los Angeles.

380
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:44,834
Show me identification.

381
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,533
I'm with the German Federal
Intelligence Service.

382
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,567
My name's Theo Stoller.

383
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,101
What are you doing
in this country?

384
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,901
I'm here on
special assignment...

385
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,934
by agreement between
our governments.

386
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,834
Now you can get
the hell out of here

387
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:12,400
before you
destroy my cover.

388
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,600
That's not going to happen.

389
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,167
CHLOE ( over phone ):
O'Brian.

390
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,201
Chloe, it's Jack.

391
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,600
I want you to check

392
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,234
on a foreign agent
on the SA list.

393
00:18:26,301 --> 00:18:27,700
"Theo Stoller."

394
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,767
Okay.

395
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,201
Got it:
"Theo Stoller,

396
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:35,901
height, 5'll",
brown hair, brown eyes."

397
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:36,934
He's a German operative,

398
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:38,901
but trained in England
at MI-6.

399
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:41,134
There's even contact
information: cell phone...

400
00:18:41,201 --> 00:18:42,167
That's all right,
Chloe.

401
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:43,167
That's enough,
thanks.

402
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:45,400
I told you,

403
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:46,667
you have to get
out of here now.

404
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:47,800
We can't do that.

405
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,134
You were with
Collette Stenger.

406
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,201
We need her to help us
find Vladimir Bierko.

407
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,201
I don't know him.

408
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:53,201
Bierko's responsible

409
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:54,433
for the terrorist attacks

410
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,734
that took place
in the city earlier today.

411
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,967
He's preparing to mount
another one as we speak.

412
00:18:58,034 --> 00:18:59,967
Collette Stenger is the only way
we can find him.

413
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:01,034
Where is she?

414
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,268
I can't help you.
Why not?

415
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:07,567
Giving you Collette
jeopardizes my operation.

416
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,667
What operation?

417
00:19:09,734 --> 00:19:11,600
I've been undercover
for the last six months

418
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,433
gathering intel
on Collette's clientele.

419
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,301
We've identified cells
in three countries,

420
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:18,334
but she's connected
to a dozen more.

421
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
She's too valuable to give up.

422
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,167
If we don't find Bierko,

423
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:22,800
hundreds of thousands
of innocent people

424
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,334
will die here today.

425
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,567
That is more important than
your preemptive operation.

426
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,467
It's not a question
of importance,

427
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,301
it's a question
of different agendas.

428
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,734
Your job is to save
American lives.

429
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,368
Mine to save German lives.

430
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,867
You're asking me
to betray

431
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:39,001
my duty to my country.

432
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,767
Ask yourself what you
would do in my position.

433
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,067
You better start
asking yourself

434
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:44,368
what you would do
in mine.

435
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,667
Now, let's go.

436
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,134
I'm here by permission
of your government--

437
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:48,167
you can't touch me.

438
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:49,167
Right.

439
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:50,268
We'll see about that.

440
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,500
Well, make sure that
your superior understands

441
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:47,168
that if this attack happens,

442
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:50,433
my government will hold
your country accountable.

443
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,433
Jack, it's Buchanan.

444
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,934
Audrey will be joining us
momentarily.

445
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,634
You're also on the line
with Karen Hayes

446
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,300
from Homeland Security.

447
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,433
She's been providing support
to CTU, and she's also

448
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,067
been in contact
with the White House.

449
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:04,268
Did President Logan get in touch
with the German Chancellor?

450
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,567
He's tried;

451
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:06,901
the chancellor's
unreachable for
another hour.

452
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,467
We don't have
another hour.

453
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,667
They're stalling, there's
nothing we can do about that.

454
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,034
Jack, this is Audrey.

455
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:13,333
I was just speaking
with German Intelligence.

456
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,168
They're refusing
to order their agent

457
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,734
to cooperate with us.

458
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,134
Maybe you can get
a deal with him.

459
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:19,700
Okay, I'll talk
to Stoller again.

460
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:21,734
Good. Call me
if you get him
to change his mind.

461
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,433
Yeah.

462
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,567
Curtis?

463
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,801
Let me have a moment
with him alone.

464
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,101
Jack, what are you doing?

465
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:33,034
It's all right.

466
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:35,001
All right.

467
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,967
Your intelligence service

468
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:47,168
denied our request
for cooperation.

469
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:48,467
So has your government.

470
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:50,201
I'm not surprised.

471
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,367
Collette Stenger
is a golden goose.

472
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,667
There's no upside
in giving her up.

473
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:58,333
Maybe I could provide you
with one.

474
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,967
Meaning?

475
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,400
I will give you something

476
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:07,901
that is more valuable
than Collette Stenger.

477
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:13,268
It's hard to know
what that might be.

478
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,600
Our roster of all known
terror suspects

479
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,034
working around the world,
our WET list.

480
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:22,534
As allies, we've requested
this WET list

481
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,534
many times before.

482
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,967
But the NSA has always said,

483
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:28,867
giving us the
list would

484
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:30,634
jeopardize their operations.

485
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,333
It will.

486
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,734
I don't work for the NSA,
I don't work for CTU.

487
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,734
This is personal.

488
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:39,567
And right now, you're not
giving me another choice.

489
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,001
All right.

490
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:43,201
I'll give you Collette

491
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:45,201
in exchange for the WET list.

492
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:46,433
Okay.

493
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Let's see what we can do.

494
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:52,767
Agent Bauer.

495
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:56,234
I'm aware of several names
that should be on that list.

496
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,268
Don't try and pass me a fake.

497
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:00,567
( phone ringing )

498
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:01,567
O'Brian.

499
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:02,801
Chloe, it's Jack.

500
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,534
Do we still have a back door
into NSA's

501
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,667
secured mainframe?

502
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:07,001
I can't really talk
right now, Jack.

503
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,101
Okay, fine. Then, listen.

504
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:11,867
I need you to log on to their
server, download the WET list,

505
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,268
and send it to my
PDA immediately.

506
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,600
Why?

507
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,400
The WET list is what
we're gonna have to pay

508
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:17,600
to get Collette Stenger.

509
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:20,534
Jack, that list is
as top secret as it gets.

510
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,934
Homeland Security
sent a team over here.

511
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,634
You're gonna have
to clear it with them.

512
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,001
We can't afford
to take the chance
of them saying no.

513
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:28,333
I'm not saying I won't do it
without their approval.

514
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,534
I'm saying I can't.

515
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,767
They took my keycard.

516
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:32,834
I can't get into the NSA
mainframe without it.

517
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:34,001
Just do what you have to.

518
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,500
It's our only way
to get Bierko.

519
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,834
Fine. I'll call you back.

520
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,801
Excuse me, Miles.

521
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,333
Oh!
( gasps ):
My God!

522
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,834
What is the
matter with you?

523
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,134
Sorry.

524
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:08,500
What's wrong with you?

525
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:12,134
I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

526
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,967
JACK:
Yeah?

527
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,667
Jack, I got on the NSA server.

528
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:38,834
Did you get the file?

529
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,201
Not yet. They put
an extra layer

530
00:24:40,268 --> 00:24:41,268
of authentication
in place.

531
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,367
Can you get around it?

532
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,534
Hold on.

533
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,067
Okay, I got it.

534
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,700
I hope you know
what you're doing.

535
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:52,300
I'm uploading it now.

536
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,600
Thanks.

537
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,367
I got it.

538
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,168
Well, that appears legitimate.

539
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:41,901
It is.

540
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,634
Give me back the memory card.

541
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,667
You can't upload the WET list
to your people

542
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:49,067
until I have Collette Stenger
in custody.

543
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,268
Well, fair enough.

544
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,801
We have to go now.

545
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:57,101
I'm supposed to meet her
at the Van Nuys airport

546
00:25:57,168 --> 00:25:58,567
in less than 20 minutes.

547
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:00,168
What kind of a car
is she driving?

548
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:01,767
I don't know.

549
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,234
I'm supposed to
park in car Lot C
and wait for her.

550
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
She'll probably
recon the area before
she makes contact.

551
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,700
She's, uh, cautious by habit.

552
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,834
Curtis, we're on the move--
Van Nuys Airport.

553
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:13,400
We'll give you the details
when we're on the way.

554
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:19,201
When you receive the funds,
transfer them immediately

555
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:20,500
into the Caymans account.

556
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:22,300
In Euros.

557
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:27,700
My bank is ready
to accept the transfer.

558
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,034
The file is encrypted.

559
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:41,801
What is the decryption key?

560
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:45,333
Transfer the funds.

561
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:53,901
It's been sent.

562
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:57,500
Thank you.

563
00:26:57,567 --> 00:27:00,300
E-mail me confirmation
of the transfer.

564
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:16,300
The decryption key is
Charlie alpha three nine

565
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,433
alpha.

566
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:22,700
It worked.

567
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,067
This is what you wanted.

568
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,367
Of course it is.

569
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:31,433
Until next time, gentlemen.

570
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:39,467
Are the men ready?

571
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:40,634
Yes.

572
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,934
Torch this place.

573
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,067
We're moving out.

574
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:58,767
Governor, I'm not trying
to co-opt your authority,

575
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:01,467
but we are in the middle
of a crisis here.

576
00:28:01,534 --> 00:28:04,601
Now, you can either transmit
my orders word for word

577
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,868
to the National Guard,
or I can federalize them,

578
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:07,934
and give them
my orders

579
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,634
directly, your choice.

580
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:11,267
Excellent.

581
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:12,667
Thank you, Governor.

582
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,367
I look forward
to your cooperation.

583
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:16,400
Sir, we have a situation
at one of the roadblocks

584
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,400
that the region three commander
needs your call on.

585
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,234
Tell me.
Wayne Palmer is insisting

586
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,334
he be let through one
of our roadblocks.

587
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,434
He claims he still has
his clearance and that he's on

588
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:27,200
official business.
And where exactly is that?

589
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:29,067
He was stopped trying
to get on the access road

590
00:28:29,133 --> 00:28:30,167
coming towards
the retreat.

591
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:32,000
He's on his way here?
To do what?

592
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,868
He wouldn't give
the officer in charge

593
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:36,367
of the roadblock
any information.

594
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,367
What should I tell
the roadblock, sir?

595
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,033
Captain, all I'm asking you
to do is call and confirm

596
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,968
I have a grade two clearance,
that's it.

597
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,234
Sir, regardless
of your clearance,

598
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,067
authorization to let you through

599
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:53,667
must come down through the
appropriate chain of command.

600
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:56,033
And just who would that be,
huh, Captain?

601
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,734
Who's in charge
of the military's role in this?

602
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:00,934
( phone ringing )

603
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,701
Riggs.

604
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:07,534
Understood.

605
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:11,234
Thank you, sir.

606
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,133
You can go on through
now, sir.

607
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,534
Let him through.

608
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:16,701
Thank you, Captain.

609
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,434
CURTIS:
All teams are in position, Jack.

610
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:32,067
No one moves in

611
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:33,834
until I confirm that it's her.

612
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,367
Copy that.

613
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:38,267
Collette won't show herself
if she senses anything's wrong.

614
00:29:38,334 --> 00:29:40,200
Make sure he stays hidden.

615
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:42,367
Don't worry. He will.

616
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:45,234
What will happen to her?

617
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,067
To Collette.

618
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,501
I don't know yet. Why?

619
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,834
Uh, just curious.

620
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:53,767
You've been in
my situation?

621
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:58,167
I've been undercover for long
stretches of time, yeah.

622
00:29:58,234 --> 00:30:00,601
And been involved with a woman
during that time?

623
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,968
There's no question we are doing
what has to be done

624
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:10,133
for our countries,
but sometimes it's
harder than others.

625
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,767
Chloe, could you join us in
the Situation Room, please?

626
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,868
Sure.

627
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,067
What's going on?

628
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,634
Why don't you tell us,
Ms. O'Brian?

629
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:36,501
I don't know.

630
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:40,868
We've got you hacking
into a top secret NSA archive.

631
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:42,567
I don't know what
you're talking about.

632
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:43,834
MILES:
I pulled a mirrored archive

633
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,000
of your web traffic.

634
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,234
Whatever you took from NSA

635
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,634
was uploaded to Jack Bauer's

636
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:49,801
remote node.

637
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:51,834
Ms. O'Brian, tell us exactly
what document

638
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:53,534
you passed to Jack Bauer.

639
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,200
BUCHANAN:
Chloe,

640
00:30:57,267 --> 00:30:59,434
this is going to get much worse
if you force me

641
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:00,834
to have NSA run a back trace.

642
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,934
What is it?

643
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,000
Jack needed the WET List.

644
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,701
What?!

645
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,968
Why on earth
would you give him that?

646
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,601
Theo Stoller wouldn't lead us
to Collette Stenger without it.

647
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,267
Chloe, giving that list

648
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:17,300
to another intelligence
agency could be disastrous.

649
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:18,601
Years of work could
be rendered useless,

650
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,267
our own agents could be exposed.

651
00:31:20,334 --> 00:31:21,534
Jack needed it, okay?

652
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:22,968
No! No, it's not okay.

653
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,133
And you expected us
to give your agents a chance?

654
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:29,534
Get me Bauer.

655
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,000
( phone ringing )

656
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:39,868
Put it on speaker phone, or
I'm getting out of this car.

657
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:42,934
Fine.

658
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:46,934
This is Bauer.

659
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,534
BUCHANAN:
Jack, it's Bill.

660
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:49,968
Karen Hayes is here, as well.

661
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,133
If you're with
Theo Stoller,

662
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
get some place you
can talk privately.

663
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,934
I can't. We're in the middle
of an operation.

664
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,567
If I move,
I'll jeopardize our position.

665
00:31:57,634 --> 00:31:59,834
Then you'll have to have this
conversation in front of him.

666
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,667
Have you given him
the WET List yet?

667
00:32:01,734 --> 00:32:02,901
Yes.

668
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:04,567
Has he given it
to German Intelligence?

669
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:05,968
No.
Then get it back. Now.

670
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,367
I can't.

671
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:10,000
If I do that,
Stoller won't cooperate.

672
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,467
And then
we'll lose Collette Stenger.

673
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:13,234
Bill, will you explain this
to her?

674
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,734
It's not his decision.

675
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,033
Retrieve the WET list now,

676
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,801
or I will order Agent Manning
and his team to do it.

677
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:21,868
Right now, Collette Stenger is
our only connection to Bierko.

678
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:23,901
If you blow this operation,
you will be responsible

679
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,868
for every life lost
in his next attack.

680
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:28,133
I don't like to be threatened,
Mr. Bauer.

681
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,234
Ms. Hayes, that's not a threat,
that's a fact.

682
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,534
HAYES:
German Intelligence
will move preemptively

683
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,033
on people
that we have been

684
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,334
watching for years.

685
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,067
Our ability to prevent
terrorist attacks

686
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,534
will be severely threatened.

687
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,067
Then that's a risk
we'll have to take.

688
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,067
Right now, we have to deal
with this situation.

689
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,067
It's not your call.

690
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,367
It's not mine, either.

691
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:46,234
We need authorization
from the President.

692
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,400
Then get it.

693
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,767
CURTIS:
Jack, one of our forward teams

694
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,367
I.D.'d a woman fitting
Stenger's description

695
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:53,934
driving a red Lexus making its
second circuit around the lot.

696
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,234
This could be her.

697
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,901
We have a possible suspect
approaching.

698
00:32:57,968 --> 00:32:59,133
Ms. Hayes, are you

699
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,501
telling me that I have
to abort this operation?

700
00:33:01,567 --> 00:33:02,534
Yes or no?

701
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:05,267
Ms. Hayes, this is your call.

702
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,534
You don't know for certain
that this woman

703
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:08,868
will lead us to Bierko.

704
00:33:08,934 --> 00:33:10,000
No, not for certain.

705
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,267
But, right now,
she's our only lead.

706
00:33:12,334 --> 00:33:14,400
Are you willing
to take this chance?

707
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,300
You've left me no choice.

708
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,701
Proceed.

709
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,067
But you have severely
compromised this situation

710
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:23,267
and I promise you there
will be repercussions.

711
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,367
Fine.

712
00:33:26,534 --> 00:33:28,400
Are we all right?

713
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,434
We're fine.

714
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,234
CURTIS:
Red Lexus turning the corner.

715
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,400
A hundred yards away
and approaching.

716
00:33:38,467 --> 00:33:41,167
No one move until I give a go.

717
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,501
The red Lexus is parked.

718
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:56,133
Move the center mirror,
so that I can see the car.

719
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,033
There.

720
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,901
Now get her out of the car.

721
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,300
Hi.

722
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:24,501
Hello.

723
00:34:26,234 --> 00:34:28,200
JACK:
I have a positive I.D.

724
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,467
All teams move in.

725
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,067
All teams move, move, move!
Let's go!

726
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:33,801
Put your hands
where I can see them!

727
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:34,934
Theo, get in the car, now.

728
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,367
Let me see your hands!
What are you doing?

729
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,033
Now!
Let me go.

730
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,367
Theo, get out of there.

731
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:40,901
I'm sorry.

732
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:42,634
Theo, who are you?

733
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:43,467
Move!

734
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:44,968
Letting him go.

735
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:45,834
He's given us
what we want!

736
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:47,734
Put your hands up!

737
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:51,801
Turn and face the car!

738
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:52,868
Put your hands on the roof!

739
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:58,934
Do it!

740
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,634
Where is Bierko?

741
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,234
We know you're
working with Bierko.

742
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,167
Where is he?

743
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,567
Fine.

744
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,100
Take her back to staging.

745
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,868
I want a team
searching this car.

746
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,100
Take everything back
to the staging area.

747
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,667
Now!

748
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:50,634
It's Theo.

749
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:52,601
I'm en route to the hotel.

750
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,534
Tell Heinrich
I'm uploading something

751
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:56,400
he's been wanting
for a long time.

752
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,567
( phone rings )

753
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:28,434
Stoller.

754
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:29,734
Theo, it's Jack.

755
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:30,767
I'm sorry.

756
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:31,968
I thought we had a deal.

757
00:36:32,033 --> 00:36:33,434
When this is over,
I promise you,

758
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,501
I will help you rebuild
your investigation.

759
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:36,501
I give you my word.

760
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:38,234
I had your word.

761
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:58,301
What have you got?

762
00:36:58,368 --> 00:36:59,334
Nothing.

763
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:00,467
She's covered
her tracks.

764
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:01,467
There's no sign

765
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:03,368
of what she sold to Bierko.

766
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:04,800
Come with me.

767
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:11,767
Collette Stenger,
my name is Jack Bauer.

768
00:37:11,834 --> 00:37:13,600
Who is Theo really?

769
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,101
German Intelligence.

770
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:16,834
Then he sold me for a price.

771
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,567
German and American Intelligence
don't work together often.

772
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:21,767
Where is Bierko?

773
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:26,767
The fact is, I actually
had feelings for Theo.

774
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:28,134
I never once suspected.

775
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,867
He was very good.

776
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:32,034
I always thought that there

777
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:33,700
were some things
that you cannot fake.

778
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,433
Bierko.

779
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:43,101
Tell them to leave.

780
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,800
Jack?

781
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:46,467
It's all right.

782
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:48,500
Curtis, have your men
move back.

783
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:50,467
Just give us a second.

784
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,834
Let's go.

785
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,167
Theo had a price.

786
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:02,001
What's yours?
I'm not for sale.

787
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,433
Everyone is for sale.

788
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,433
This isn't a game, lady.

789
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,567
We're running out of time.

790
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:06,901
You better tell me
what you want.

791
00:38:08,001 --> 00:38:09,867
All right.

792
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:12,667
Full immunity.
No holdbacks.

793
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:15,368
Signed by your president
and transmitted to lawyers

794
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:17,134
in Zurich and Tripoli.

795
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:18,134
But I can't tell you
where Bierko is.

796
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:19,700
Why not?

797
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:20,867
Because he's already gone.

798
00:38:20,934 --> 00:38:22,400
I met him at a safehouse,

799
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,533
but he was already on his way
to carry out the attack.

800
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,034
What were you selling him?
I don't know.

801
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,268
What do you mean,
you don't know?

802
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:28,533
I mean I don't know.

803
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,800
It was a schematic.

804
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,368
What kind of
a schematic?

805
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,268
I'm paid to broker
the information,

806
00:38:33,334 --> 00:38:34,600
not dwell on the details.

807
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:36,034
I make it my firm policy.

808
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:38,101
You expect me to believe
that you acquired information

809
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,400
for a terrorist group and you
didn't know the specifics?

810
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:42,067
You can believe
whatever you want.

811
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:44,433
The fact is, I got the
schematics from a source

812
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,134
and they were
digitally encrypted.

813
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,800
That source can tell you
what they mean.

814
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:51,600
Give me immunity and
I'll give you my source.

815
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,467
Those are my terms.

816
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:58,767
You haven't offered us
very much.

817
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:01,001
I'll see what I can do.

818
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:10,567
( phone rings )
Buchanan.

819
00:39:10,634 --> 00:39:11,800
Yeah, it's Jack.

820
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:14,500
She wants full immunity
signed by the president.

821
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,201
She claims that she doesn't know
where Bierko is.

822
00:39:16,268 --> 00:39:18,867
That she just brokered a deal
for a set of schematics,

823
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:20,101
and then delivered them.

824
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,700
She doesn't know
what building they're for,

825
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,934
but she can provide us with
the source of the schematics.

826
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,334
She doesn't know
what she sold him?

827
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,067
She said it was
digitally encrypted.

828
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:28,734
Do you believe her?

829
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,834
She's an independent contractor.

830
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:31,967
In her line of work,
sometimes

831
00:39:32,034 --> 00:39:33,400
what you don't know
will save your life.

832
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,800
Either way,

833
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:36,533
if she's telling the truth,
we don't have a lot of time.

834
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,533
She said Bierko already left
to set off his next attack.

835
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,234
Miles, call Mike Novick,
let's get this started.

836
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:43,533
Jack, this better work.

837
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
And for the record,
I don't like it.

838
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:47,101
We've paid a steep price.

839
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,234
There'll be fallout
on the WET List.

840
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,433
No, there won't be.

841
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,934
The fallout will be from
German Intelligence.

842
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:54,301
I programmed the memory card
to self-destruct.

843
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,867
Why didn't you tell us this
before?

844
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:58,767
I told you, I was in the car
with Stoller.

845
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:02,433
Get back to me as soon as this
is done, we need to move fast.

846
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,234
I think it's clear.

847
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:08,967
CTU was hit,

848
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,734
but we're still doing our job.

849
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,201
I believe
that's an argument

850
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:13,867
to maintain our autonomy.

851
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,734
Well, I'll withhold
judgment on that.

852
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,433
We're giving a free pass
to a terrorist collaborator,

853
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,034
and I have yet to see
what we're getting from it.

854
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,467
( tires screeching )

855
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:29,767
( panting )

856
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:12,001
Has the document been received
in Tripoli as well?

857
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:14,201
And it meets with
your approval?

858
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:15,500
So, there's no way

859
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:19,234
that they can fail
to live up to the terms?

860
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:22,368
Merci, Herve. Au revoir.

861
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:25,500
The safehouse

862
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:29,934
is a manufacturing facility
at 12451 Saticoy Boulevard.

863
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,667
As for the data
I sold to Bierko,

864
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:34,101
it's something that I
received from a contact

865
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,433
at the Department
of Defense.

866
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,400
What's his name?

867
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:37,867
Her name.

868
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,467
Audrey Raines.

869
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,234
You are lying to me.

870
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:47,600
She sold me the information, Mr.
Bauer.

871
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:50,134
Apparently she had a price.

872
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:54,268
Put her in the car.

873
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,600
