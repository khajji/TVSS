1
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:15,101
What we're doing here is
very simple.

2
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:17,468
We're going to release
a certain substance

3
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,867
so that it flows
into your pipelines.

4
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:23,800
Take the canisters to the main
distribution tank quickly.

5
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,034
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

6
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:26,134
No.

7
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:27,734
Explain.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,600
We rolled his car,
but he survived and got away.

9
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:32,567
It was sloppy work,
we'll make it right.

10
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,967
Well, you damn well better.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,267
You know what's at stake.

12
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:36,500
Get down!

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,900
( gunfire )

14
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:42,134
Get in the car.

15
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,301
( gunfire )

16
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,633
It's the truth.
Audrey Raines was my contact

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,368
at the Department of Defense.

18
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:52,667
You met with her
face-to-face?
Yes.

19
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,101
Damn it, Audrey!

20
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:55,767
Tell me the truth!
I am

21
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:56,967
telling you the truth.

22
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:58,567
You already
lied to me once.

23
00:00:58,633 --> 00:00:59,867
You tell me what you know

24
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,700
or I promise you this
will become very unpleasant.

25
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:04,401
Bill, we have a connection

26
00:01:04,468 --> 00:01:05,967
between Collette Stenger
and Henderson.

27
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,034
She received eight calls from
him she didn't tell us about.

28
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,567
That voids her agreement,
it's off.

29
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,567
You have three seconds
to tell me

30
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:13,800
where the target is
or I will kill you.

31
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:15,834
Where is the target?!

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,001
A natural gas
distribution center.

33
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,201
Our analysts tell us

34
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:22,301
once the Sentox
hits the main tank,

35
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:23,633
it goes right
into the pipes

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,101
where it becomes
impossible to stop.

37
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,967
From there, it goes straight
into people's homes.

38
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,867
JACK:
Sentox is already
in the system.

39
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,500
Give me the C-4 and a timer,
then get

40
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:35,533
these people out of here.

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,800
Jack, what are you doing?

42
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,334
In order to deliver the Sentox,

43
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,867
it had to mix with natural gas.

44
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:42,267
If we can ignite that gas
before it leaves the plant,

45
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:43,567
the Sentox will be incinerated.

46
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:52,401
Bierko!

47
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,301
Jack, that's it,
the main tanks are going.

48
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:02,867
Get out!

49
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,734
BUCHANAN:
Jack, respond.

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,700
Curtis, Curtis, this is Audrey.

51
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,934
Any sign of Jack?
Nothing so far.

52
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:27,533
I've got men searching
the main tank area.

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,934
Fire and rescue units
just arrived.

54
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,934
They're assessing
the situation now.

55
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,867
Chloe, what are we getting
from the air monitors?

56
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,633
Come on, Jack.

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,034
Chloe.

58
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,500
Just minimal trace readings
of the nerve agent.

59
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,134
Well below danger levels.

60
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:44,067
It looks like the Sentox
was incinerated in the blast.

61
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:45,468
Jack's plan worked.

62
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:46,867
I'm going to brief
the White House.

63
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,167
Apprise me of any developments.

64
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,500
Miles.

65
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,301
Curtis, have we done a full
search of the area for Jack?

66
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:56,734
It's underway.

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,934
We know he hasn't gone out
the north exit.

68
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:16,834
CTU, Jack's okay.

69
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,234
Get a medical team
over here now!

70
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,001
Jack!

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,734
Give me a hand.

72
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:30,234
Bierko!

73
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:31,600
Bierko!

74
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:33,334
Bierko!

75
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,167
I need him conscious.
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,967
The nerve gas, did it
leave the plant?

77
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:43,267
There's no trace of it.
Explosion worked.
Good.

78
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:45,767
He's going into severe shock.
We need to transport him now.

79
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,334
I want him taken back
to CTU Medical.
Yes, sir.

80
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:50,500
Curtis, organize
an escort team.

81
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:52,167
You get him back to CTU alive.

82
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:53,834
You got it.

83
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,934
On my count.

84
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,800
Three, two, one.

85
00:03:58,867 --> 00:03:59,934
Let's go.

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,067
( cell phone rings )

87
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:06,134
Buchanan.

88
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,267
Bill, it's Jack.

89
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,667
Is your line still secure?

90
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,967
Yes.

91
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:12,334
What's your status on Henderson?

92
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:14,567
Henderson's still
an active protocol.

93
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,368
You need to make him a priority.

94
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,034
Bill, listen to me.

95
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,734
I know Henderson.

96
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,201
He couldn't have planned this.

97
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,500
He's a soldier and a patriot.

98
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,533
However misguided, he believes
what he's doing right now

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,734
is right for this country.

100
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,900
He was willing to let his wife
die in order

101
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:31,001
to protect someone,
someone very powerful.

102
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,267
Who?

103
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,301
I don't know.

104
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:36,600
Bill, I'm scared.

105
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,301
I think this is bigger
than anything

106
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:40,101
we could ever have imagined.

107
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,934
Karen, you're not hearing me.

108
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,800
They managed to prevent
an attack,

109
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,301
but that doesn't negate the fact
that CTU's performance

110
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:50,167
has been comprised of
one misstep after another.

111
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:53,368
I'm not disputing that,
Mr. Vice President.

112
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,533
Then why the hesitation to carry
out your mandate

113
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,533
and have Homeland absorb CTU?

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,067
CTU is still actively

115
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,834
looking for
Christopher Henderson.

116
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,034
A shakeup right now
could hamper that search.

117
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:04,700
I'm not going to
hold up this takeover

118
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,434
because of a
procedural mop up.

119
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,834
Henderson will be caught,
you can be sure of that.

120
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,301
Is that understood?
Clearly.

121
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,667
Whatever bureaucratic hoops
you have to jump through,

122
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:12,734
that's your business.

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,401
Just get it done.

124
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:15,967
Yes, sir.
And keep me informed.

125
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,101
I guess we should
get started.

126
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,201
Buchanan is not going to take
this lying down.

127
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:23,700
Despite what
the vice president said,

128
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,368
CTU just saved a lot of lives.

129
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:28,201
If Buchanan mounts a challenge,
it will be seen in that light.

130
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:30,900
This action could be
easily reversed.

131
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:35,734
If we were to find someone
who would go on record

132
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,368
citing Buchanan's
mismanagement,

133
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,900
how he superseded
Lynn McGill's authority,

134
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,468
how he allowed CTU
to be compromised...

135
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:45,500
go a long way to mitigating
his successes,

136
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,468
give us the
protection we need.

137
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:50,368
Buchanan's people
are extremely loyal.

138
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:53,767
I'm not thinking
about a member of CTU.

139
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm thinking
of Audrey Raines.

140
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,567
She was here
all morning,

141
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,401
she saw what went on.

142
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,234
And her loyalty is split
between CTU and DOD.

143
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:05,134
We could take
advantage of that.

144
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:09,468
Let me draft a statement
and present it to her.

145
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,134
BUCHANAN:
We're being
rolled up, Audrey.

146
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,834
Homeland's taking over.

147
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,401
That's impossible.

148
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:19,468
Karen told me herself.

149
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:22,867
No, they can't do that,

150
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:24,600
not after what you've
accomplished today.

151
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,234
I'd like to think we've earned
a reprieve, but I doubt it.

152
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:32,667
CTU is in the middle
of an investigation.

153
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:35,101
Henderson is still at large.

154
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:39,567
I know, it doesn't
make any sense.

155
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,800
Karen's taking orders
from Vice President Gardner.

156
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,201
He wants this to happen.

157
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:45,134
Why?

158
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:48,001
I've been asking myself
the same question.

159
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,167
HENDERSON:
Yeah.

160
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,334
Well, how in the hell
did you lose him?

161
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,867
Palmer knocked Cobb out
and retrieved his weapon.

162
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,734
We tried to pursue, but
someone came to Palmer's aid.

163
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Who?

164
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,734
That's unclear.

165
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,967
They got away.

166
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,600
All right.

167
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:11,101
We're going to a fallback, scrub
the scene and get over here.

168
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,368
Yes, sir.

169
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:36,700
You're all right,
Mr. Palmer.

170
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,368
Just take it slow.

171
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,667
Aaron?

172
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,934
We're at
the presidential retreat.

173
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,201
Can you try to sit up?

174
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,533
I think we need to get
you looked at, sir.

175
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,368
No, no, Aaron, there's not
enough time for that.

176
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:53,834
I'm all right.

177
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,401
Then maybe you can explain
to me what's going on.

178
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,734
Why were those men
trying to kill you?

179
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,934
Because David had a source
inside the White House

180
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,934
and someone is trying to
prevent me from seeing her.

181
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:08,900
Who is this source?

182
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,434
Mrs. Logan's assistant.

183
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,067
Evelyn Martin?

184
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:15,434
Yeah.

185
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,867
Yeah, she and David were trading
e-mails.

186
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:18,134
Listen, Aaron,

187
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:20,967
I need to find out the content
of those messages.

188
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,401
I think David was killed because
of information Evelyn gave him.

189
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:33,600
Mrs. Logan,

190
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,834
I drafted a letter to
the families of the victims

191
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
at the Sunrise Hills Mall.

192
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,201
It's here for your review.

193
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,434
Thank you.

194
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,934
And your schedule's
there as well.

195
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,800
You have a 9:00 a.m.
with the press office

196
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,001
and the president
wants you in

197
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,533
on his morning briefing.

198
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,533
Evelyn...

199
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,633
you all right?

200
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm fine.
Just tired.

201
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:53,234
It's been a long day.

202
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:57,667
I'm surprised any of us
got through it.

203
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:58,934
Oh, do you have your credentials

204
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,034
with you?

205
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,800
There's still
a curfew in place.

206
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,767
I have them with me.

207
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,134
Good.

208
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:06,434
Try to get some rest.

209
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,034
Good night.

210
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,434
Good night.

211
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:21,368
Evelyn.

212
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:22,700
Hi.

213
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,834
I really need to talk to you.

214
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,101
I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer,
I need to go home.

215
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,468
Ma'am.

216
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,667
Please.

217
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:33,334
This won't take but a second.

218
00:09:50,934 --> 00:09:53,734
You were sending e-mails
to my brother, Evelyn. Why?

219
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Mr. Palmer, I don't know
what you're talking about.

220
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,201
I traced the IP account.

221
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,600
I traced it right
to your address,

222
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,667
so, yes, you do know
what I'm talking about.

223
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,767
I need to know
what you told David.

224
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:10,468
I didn't tell him anything.

225
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:15,034
Evelyn, I have the record
of your correspondence.

226
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,834
David deleted the content
on the messages,

227
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,434
but I know, Evelyn,

228
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,734
I know you were
in contact with him,

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,267
so please don't
lie to me again.

230
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,401
Tell me what I need to know.

231
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:32,667
Someone killed David--

232
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,767
they killed him--
and they just
tried to kill me.

233
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,700
Now, I think
they knew I was

234
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,134
coming here to see you.

235
00:10:39,201 --> 00:10:41,533
So I think that means
we're both in danger, don't you?

236
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,934
Please, I have
to go now.

237
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,368
Tell me what I need!

238
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,368
Talk to me!

239
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:46,900
I can't.

240
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,533
They kidnapped my little girl.

241
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,934
They kidnapped my little girl.

242
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,201
They said they would
give Amy back to me
if I gave them

243
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:07,001
the evidence.
What evidence?

244
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,368
I have proof about
who is behind everything

245
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:12,967
that's happened today.

246
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,368
They're going to kill my baby.

247
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:19,334
Evelyn, okay...
They're going to kill...

248
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:20,401
Listen to me,
all right? Listen.

249
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:21,600
Even if you turn
over this evidence,

250
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,967
they're not
just going to

251
00:11:23,034 --> 00:11:24,401
give you back
your daughter
and let you go.

252
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:26,234
That's not what
these people do.

253
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:29,134
Now, you've got to
trust me, Evelyn.

254
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:31,633
Please, talk to me.

255
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,500
If I may?

256
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:38,734
Mr. Palmer's right.

257
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,700
You know too much.

258
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,700
They'll kill you both.

259
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,734
I'll give you
the evidence that I have

260
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
if you get me back
my daughter.

261
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:12,468
I pulled up Henderson's work
records for the past ten years.

262
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:13,800
It's a lot of material.

263
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,167
I'll start data-mining,
see if there's anything

264
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,733
we can use
to track him down.

265
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,101
That's Chloe O'Brian.

266
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:26,867
SHARI:
Who are those people?

267
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,568
That's Jim Hill,
from Homeland.

268
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,101
I'm Jim Hill,
Homeland Security.

269
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,834
Could you show me
your station.

270
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,067
Chloe O'Brian?

271
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:37,167
Yeah?
I'm taking
over your station.

272
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,201
I'll need all your
relevant access codes.

273
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:41,334
Who are you?
What's going on here?

274
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,599
May I have your
attention, please?

275
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,132
These men and women

276
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:46,466
are from Homeland Security.

277
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,633
I've just authorized
a unit-wide backslash protocol.

278
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:52,166
CTU is being

279
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:55,633
absorbed by the Department
of Homeland Security.

280
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:59,699
Ladies and gentlemen,
I realize this is sudden,

281
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:02,065
and this has been
a very difficult day,

282
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,900
but let's all cooperate

283
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:06,699
to make this transition
as smooth as possible.

284
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,833
There is still work to be done.

285
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,299
Vladimir Bierko
is en route to CTU,

286
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:12,566
and Christopher Henderson

287
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,900
remains an open protocol.

288
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,466
Thank you.

289
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:24,666
Ms. Raines, would
you mind joining me

290
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,999
in the Situation Room?

291
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:27,466
Why?

292
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,833
We need to speak in private.

293
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,399
Fine.

294
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:41,766
( phone rings )

295
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,065
This is Bauer.

296
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:44,699
Jack, it's  Wayne Palmer.
Wayne.

297
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:46,065
Are you all right?

298
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:48,065
I just heard about that
explosion at the gas plant.

299
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:50,433
Yeah, I'm fine. Listen, Wayne,
I wish I could tell you

300
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:51,999
that all the people
that were responsible

301
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,366
for your brother's assassination
are in custody, but I can't.

302
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,099
Yeah, Well, maybe
I can help you with that.

303
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:58,032
How?

304
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,733
Jack, I'm at
President Logan's retreat.

305
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,466
I'm here with Evelyn Martin,
Mrs. Logan's personal assistant.

306
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,965
What does Evelyn Martin
have to do with this?

307
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,900
She says she has proof
there were other people involved

308
00:14:05,965 --> 00:14:07,232
in the plot to kill my brother.

309
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,299
And I believe her.
Who?

310
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,800
She won't tell me.

311
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:13,065
Why not?

312
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:15,499
Her eight-year-old daughter's
been kidnapped.

313
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,433
They're going to kill her

314
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,232
unless Evelyn
hands over the evidence.

315
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,833
This has to be Henderson.

316
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,466
They're supposed
to call any minute
with a place to meet.

317
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:24,833
Okay. I want to be
on that call when it comes in.

318
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,866
CTU will provide
operational support.

319
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,332
We're going to need
a place to meet.

320
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,399
I passed an old barn about
a mile west of the retreat

321
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,900
off Service Road 19.

322
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:36,965
Service Road 19.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

323
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:39,032
See you then.

324
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:41,499
Jack's going to meet us.
We should go.

325
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:43,399
Evelyn, listen.
They may be watching you,

326
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,266
so I don't think
we should leave together.

327
00:14:45,332 --> 00:14:46,599
What do you
want to do?

328
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,166
We'll separate.

329
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:51,332
Get to your car, and we'll
meet up in the parking lot.

330
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,866
I'll see you soon.

331
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:04,699
"...the acting director's
failure

332
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:07,099
"to enhance security measures,
especially in the light

333
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,800
"of the heightened
threat, effectively

334
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,132
"invited the subsequent attack

335
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:13,433
that resulted
in loss of personnel."

336
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:15,633
You can't possibly
expect me to sign this.

337
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,299
It's a complete
distortion of
today's event

338
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:19,999
designed to place blame
on Bill Buchanan and CTU.

339
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,733
But you would agree
that today's attacks

340
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,132
represent a serious
intelligence failure

341
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,466
that needs to be addressed.

342
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:26,633
Thanks to CTU,

343
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,299
hundreds of thousands
of people are alive

344
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:29,800
who would
otherwise be dead.

345
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,166
But, if CTU had been
operating effectively,

346
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:35,466
those people would never
have been at risk.

347
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:38,166
I couldn't more strongly
disagree with this statement.

348
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:42,666
Well, I'm disappointed
with your decision,

349
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,299
but I appreciate your loyalty.

350
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:46,499
Of course.

351
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,800
Oh, just to confirm.

352
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,166
As on-site liaison
for DOD,

353
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:56,866
you participated in today's
decision-making process.

354
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:58,566
What's your point?

355
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:01,199
Serious mistakes
were made here today

356
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,399
that resulted in the loss
of American lives.

357
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:06,399
It would be a shame
to see the taint

358
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,499
of CTU's mismanagement

359
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:13,499
spread to your agency...
and your career.

360
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,466
By signing this,

361
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:20,733
you isolate the fallout
for today's mistakes

362
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,099
to Bill Buchanan
and CTU...

363
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,900
where it belongs.

364
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:44,399
I'm proud of what we did
here today.

365
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,866
The people of
CTU are heroes,

366
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:50,666
especially Bill Buchanan.

367
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:54,566
This takeover
is completely unwarranted,

368
00:16:54,633 --> 00:17:00,232
and I won't help you justify it.

369
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,733
( phone rings )

370
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,965
Hello.

371
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,065
Audrey, it's Jack.
Jack, where are you?

372
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:10,833
I'm on my way
to see Wayne Palmer.

373
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,800
Wayne Palmer?

374
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,366
Wayne just told me
that Evelyn Martin,

375
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,566
Senior Aide to the First Lady
has evidence that would prove

376
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,733
who was really behind
David Palmer's assassination,

377
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,633
but she won't
give the evidence to Wayne

378
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:21,866
because her daughter's
been kidnapped

379
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:23,766
in an effort to try
and keep her quiet.

380
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,900
I think Henderson's
behind this.

381
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:26,166
They want to
make a trade:

382
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,399
the evidence
for the girl.

383
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:28,833
My God, Jack.

384
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,800
Yeah, I'm going to need you
to retask a satellite

385
00:17:30,866 --> 00:17:32,666
to those coordinates--
I'll have them in a few minutes.

386
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,766
Jack, that could be difficult
right now.
Why?

387
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,466
CTU is being rolled up.

388
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,266
Karen Hayes is
replacing everyone

389
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:39,900
with people
from Homeland.

390
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,299
What are you talking about?
That doesn't make sense.
I know.

391
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:44,433
Even if she has a reason
to, we're in the middle

392
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:45,866
of tracking down
Christopher Henderson.

393
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,166
We'll never be able to
bring her team up to speed.

394
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,633
I know she's taking orders from
Vice President Gardner himself.

395
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:53,299
Gardner.

396
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:56,099
Jack, maybe you should talk
to Karen directly.
No.

397
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,599
She's the one in control here.

398
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,999
When I was interrogating
Henderson,

399
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,666
it was obvious that he was
protecting someone,

400
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,332
someone very powerful.

401
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:03,999
He was willing to
let his wife die

402
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,266
rather than
give him up.

403
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,232
and now, all of a sudden,
Vice President Gardner

404
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,099
is shutting down CTU
when we're actually

405
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,666
in a position to
bring Henderson in?

406
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:15,633
Do you really think that
Gardner's involved with this?

407
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:17,633
We can't afford to take
the chance that he's not.

408
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:20,633
All right,
what do you want me to do?

409
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,499
I want you to get Chloe
to retask the satellite.

410
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:23,800
I'll get the coordinates
over to you.

411
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,332
Jack, Chloe has
been let go,

412
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,232
along with the rest
of her department.

413
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,566
Audrey, I need the satellite.

414
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,699
Just figure out a way
to get Chloe back on.

415
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:35,099
All right, all right,
I'll call you back.

416
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:42,999
MILES:
I could approach some of
the senior CTU staffers.

417
00:18:43,065 --> 00:18:44,833
I told you,
that's a waste of time.

418
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,999
They're worried
about their jobs.

419
00:18:46,065 --> 00:18:48,299
We could promise them
some security.

420
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:50,566
Excuse me.

421
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,733
I've reconsidered my position.

422
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,366
I'll sign your statement.

423
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:03,166
May I ask why the sudden change
of heart?

424
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:05,166
I don't necessarily agree
with everything

425
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,232
that is in the statement,
but I do see

426
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,299
the need to shield DOD
of any possible controversy

427
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:13,800
that could reflect
back on my father.

428
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,833
HAYES:
Miles.

429
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,332
Thank you.

430
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,032
I want one thing in return.

431
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,366
What's that?

432
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,232
That Chloe be kept on
and assigned to me.

433
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:30,399
Why Chloe?

434
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:31,633
I'm going to need
considerable

435
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,466
server access to compile
my report for DOD.

436
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:36,866
Chloe can help me finish it
in half the time.

437
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:39,533
There are other people
who can do that job.

438
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:42,132
I have a working relationship
with Chloe.

439
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,766
She's an asset
that you cannot afford to lose.

440
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:52,433
Do we have a deal?

441
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,433
Yes.

442
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:02,965
Good.

443
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:07,766
All right.

444
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,533
Evelyn Martin will be leaving
the presidential retreat

445
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,166
in a couple of minutes.

446
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:12,965
It's time to get going.

447
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:15,266
What about the girl?

448
00:20:15,332 --> 00:20:17,366
( sighs )

449
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,499
I'll take care of her.

450
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,340
MAN ( over phone ):
Wayne Palmer.

451
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:40,307
I'm at my car.

452
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:41,806
No one's around.

453
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,406
We're on our way.
Okay.

454
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:48,740
I'm extremely uncomfortable

455
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,907
sending the two of you off
without protection.

456
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:52,274
Aaron, we've
been over this.

457
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,606
If you leave the
compound again,

458
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:54,840
we're going to risk
raising suspicion.

459
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,439
I know it, sir,
but I don't like it.

460
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,473
Wayne.

461
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,207
Well, this is a surprise.

462
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:06,606
We didn't know you were coming.

463
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,673
Are you here to
see the president?

464
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:12,007
No.

465
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,606
Mr. Palmer came here

466
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:17,406
to give me
a memento

467
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:18,406
from his brother.

468
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:19,907
It's a service medal.

469
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:21,374
Sorry, I just...

470
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,907
I knew you and the president

471
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:24,907
were going to be dealing
with this crisis today,

472
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,173
and I just...

473
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,107
I don't want you people
to feel obliged to see me.

474
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:31,940
There would never, ever be any
obligation on our part, Wayne,

475
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,240
especially under
the circumstances.

476
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:36,406
I just want
you to know

477
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:39,173
how sorry I am.

478
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,173
Your brother was one
of the greatest men

479
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,473
to ever occupy the office.

480
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,107
And his loss,

481
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,340
to all of us,

482
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:52,240
can't be expressed in words.

483
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:55,606
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

484
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:57,439
And I know that the president
would also like

485
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,307
to express his condolences

486
00:21:59,374 --> 00:22:00,340
to you personally.

487
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,506
That means a lot, sir,

488
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:03,539
but unfortunately
I have a plane to catch.

489
00:22:03,606 --> 00:22:09,539
I'm, uh... flying David's body
back to Washington, so...

490
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:11,940
Oh, I understand.

491
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,439
Safe trip.

492
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,340
Thank you, sir.

493
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:19,673
I'll walk you out, sir.

494
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,140
Excuse me.

495
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,573
( typing )

496
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,740
CHLOE:
Mr. Buchanan.

497
00:22:37,374 --> 00:22:39,307
Miss O'Brian,
we're not done here.

498
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,973
How can they get away
with this?

499
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,340
Chloe, this
is not over.

500
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,973
Just follow your instructions.

501
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,007
Oh, it sure seems over.
Everyone's getting fired.

502
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:51,406
I'm going to do everything I can
to get that order rescinded.

503
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:54,173
Once the details of what we
accomplished here today

504
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,007
are made public, I'm confident
we'll be back at our posts.

505
00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:58,940
The best thing you can do
is stay focused

506
00:22:59,007 --> 00:23:00,973
and follow your orders,
do you understand me?

507
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,907
Yes, sir.

508
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:04,274
It's going to be
all right.

509
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,439
O'Brian, don't transfer
your station to Valerie.

510
00:23:06,506 --> 00:23:07,640
You got a pass.

511
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:08,473
I did?

512
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:11,374
Yeah. So get back to work.

513
00:23:11,439 --> 00:23:12,406
I don't understand.

514
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:13,806
Why am I staying
and everybody else

515
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:15,307
is being let go?
Because Miss Raines

516
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,806
requested that you
keep your position.

517
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:19,907
What has Audrey Raines
have to do with this?

518
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:23,240
Miss Raines signed
a detailed statement

519
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:27,007
documenting the numerous
missteps made today by CTU.

520
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,806
And by you
in particular.

521
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:34,506
So, for the moment,
she gets what she wants,

522
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:35,973
and she wants O'Brian.

523
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,873
Audrey would never sign
anything like that.

524
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,140
AUDREY:
I did sign it, Bill.

525
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:44,940
Why?

526
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,840
Because it's the truth.

527
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:50,673
You realize this effectively
kills any chance we have

528
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,307
of rescinding that order.

529
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:53,973
Yes, I know.

530
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,374
I'm sorry.

531
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:02,473
O' Brian.

532
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:12,940
I got a call from a man
about an hour ago

533
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:15,073
who told me
that he had my daughter.

534
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,973
That if I wanted
to see her alive again,

535
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,207
that I would have to follow
his exact instructions.

536
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:20,374
Did he give you
proof he had her?

537
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:21,340
I talked to her.

538
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,406
She sounded so scared.

539
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:25,673
You told anybody else
about this?

540
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,539
I couldn't. He said that
if I did, he would know.

541
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:32,107
Evelyn, listen,
I know we have a deal.

542
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:33,840
And I'm going to do
everything I can

543
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,107
to get your
daughter back.
No, I told you before.

544
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:38,840
I can't tell you anything
until I have Amy back.

545
00:24:38,907 --> 00:24:42,173
You called David
with this information.

546
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,506
Why him?

547
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:45,406
I knew him.

548
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:47,840
He and the First Lady
were friends.

549
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:51,806
He was truly a wonderful man.

550
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:57,473
Yes.

551
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,840
Yes, he was.

552
00:25:03,673 --> 00:25:07,207
I still can't accept talking
about him in the past tense.

553
00:25:07,274 --> 00:25:11,040
I just...

554
00:25:11,107 --> 00:25:13,907
I just can't believe he's gone.

555
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:17,473
I told him this information
because I trusted him.

556
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:22,040
I never thought for a moment
that it would endanger him.

557
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:25,040
I have your brother's blood
on my hands,

558
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,307
and for that,
I will never forgive myself.

559
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:31,073
Evelyn, you did nothing wrong.

560
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:34,374
( cell phone rings )

561
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,007
It's them.

562
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:39,007
( speed dialing )

563
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,539
( cell phone rings )

564
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,606
Bauer.

565
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:42,773
Jack, the call's
coming through.

566
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,673
Patch me in.

567
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,640
( Touch-Tone beeps )

568
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:50,340
You're ready for this?

569
00:25:51,706 --> 00:25:52,706
( phone beeps )

570
00:25:54,907 --> 00:25:56,340
Hello.

571
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:59,040
What took you so long
to answer, Evelyn?

572
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:00,406
I was just passing
through security.

573
00:26:00,473 --> 00:26:01,573
I just left the retreat.

574
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,840
HENDERSON:
Are you alone?

575
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:04,040
Yes.

576
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:06,806
Why was Wayne Palmer
at the retreat?

577
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,207
Wayne Palmer?

578
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:09,640
Please don't
waste my time.

579
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,173
He was there
for a reason,

580
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,140
and it wasn't to
drop off his resume.

581
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:15,673
I think he was there
to speak with you.

582
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,007
I didn't even know he was there.

583
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:19,506
I don't believe you.

584
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:20,940
I didn't see him.

585
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:22,406
Evelyn, if you're lying to me,

586
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:24,073
it's your daughter
who will suffer.

587
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,340
I'm telling you the truth.

588
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:27,340
Please, you have to believe me.

589
00:26:27,406 --> 00:26:29,873
Did you bring what we discussed?

590
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,873
Yes.

591
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,107
Please, let me talk to Amy.

592
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:36,340
Very well.

593
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:42,207
All right, sweetheart,
this is your mommy.

594
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:43,506
Say hello.

595
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:44,539
Mommy?

596
00:26:44,606 --> 00:26:46,307
It's me, honey.
Are you okay?

597
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:48,506
Uh-huh. Are you
coming to get me now?

598
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:53,073
Mommy's going
to be there real soon.

599
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,374
I want you to keep being brave.

600
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:56,539
Okay?

601
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:58,007
Promise me?

602
00:26:58,073 --> 00:26:59,873
I promise.

603
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,274
I love you, my baby.

604
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,040
I love you, too.

605
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,539
Okay, that's enough,
sweetheart.

606
00:27:05,606 --> 00:27:08,706
Very good.

607
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:10,673
Now take down this address.

608
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,640
4615 Tarpin Street.

609
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,539
Got it?

610
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:18,706
EVELYN:
Yes, I've got it.

611
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:21,107
( speed dialing )

612
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,374
( cell phone rings )

613
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:23,374
Hello?

614
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,640
Audrey, it's Jack.

615
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:25,940
I just got off the call.

616
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:27,274
It was Henderson.

617
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,740
Have you got Chloe
back on line?

618
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,706
Audrey?
Sorry, Jack.

619
00:27:31,773 --> 00:27:33,240
Yes, Chloe's still here.

620
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:35,740
Okay, I'm going to give the
address for the satellite sweep.

621
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:37,673
All right, go ahead.

622
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,107
4615 Tarpin.

623
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,140
All right.
Give me a few minutes.

624
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:53,307
Chloe, I need you
to come with me.

625
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:54,307
Don't talk to me.

626
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:55,374
It's for Jack.

627
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:56,406
Jack?

628
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:58,207
Chloe,
Jack needs your help.

629
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:01,307
Please.

630
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:04,940
Fine.

631
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:08,140
What the hell's
going on?

632
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:10,073
I had to keep Karen
from replacing you.

633
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,406
That's why I signed
the document.

634
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:12,406
I didn't have a choice.

635
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:13,773
I don't understand.

636
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,940
Chloe, you're the only one
that Jack and I trust here.

637
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,740
Jack needs one
of the satellites retasked.

638
00:28:18,806 --> 00:28:19,907
Why?

639
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:21,007
Here's the address.

640
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:23,140
We need a full infrared sweep.

641
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,773
I'm going to need
an explanation.

642
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,940
Chloe, I promise you,
I will give you one,

643
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,473
but right now we
need to hurry.

644
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:54,374
( vehicle approaching )

645
00:29:05,173 --> 00:29:07,374
( car door slams shut )

646
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,840
( approaching footsteps )

647
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,639
Something's wrong.

648
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,940
Wayne.

649
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:32,307
Jack.

650
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:33,673
You all right?

651
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,773
Yeah.

652
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,240
It's good to see you.

653
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:37,673
Good to see you, too.

654
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:43,973
Evelyn,

655
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,140
my name is Jack Bauer.

656
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:48,639
I promise you, we're going
to get your daughter back.

657
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:52,474
Right now I need to
know what you know.

658
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:56,107
I already told them I wouldn't
give up any information

659
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:57,840
until I have my daughter.

660
00:30:01,606 --> 00:30:02,873
Fine.

661
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,673
Excuse me for one second.

662
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,506
( dialing phone )

663
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,639
( over phone ):
Audrey Raines.

664
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:18,740
Audrey, it's Jack.
Let me speak to Chloe.

665
00:30:18,806 --> 00:30:21,040
Okay, Jack, hold on.

666
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:22,740
Jack, you're
on speaker.

667
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:24,340
Jack, Audrey told me
what's happening.

668
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,639
I can't believe

669
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:27,307
the vice president's
involved in this.

670
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:28,307
Yeah, I know.

671
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:29,539
Where are we with the satellite?

672
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:31,173
It's coming up now.

673
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,073
I'm sending the
image to your PDA.

674
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,506
There are men
all over the place.

675
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,207
How many?

676
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:40,773
I'm counting ten.

677
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,506
Okay. I want you to keep
the satellite on target.

678
00:30:43,573 --> 00:30:46,273
I want you to download
real-time images to my PDA.

679
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,273
CHLOE:
Okay.

680
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,240
Jack.

681
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:52,506
I'm going to go with Evelyn
in her car to make the exchange.

682
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:53,873
I want you to find
somewhere safe,

683
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,207
and I want you to stay there

684
00:30:55,273 --> 00:30:56,940
until this
is over.
No, I'm going
with you.

685
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,273
I can't allow that.

686
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,773
This is going to be
extremely dangerous.

687
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,773
I was a Marine, Jack.

688
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,906
I know that, Wayne.

689
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:04,273
And you never
saw a combat.

690
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,440
There's a big difference

691
00:31:05,506 --> 00:31:06,873
between training
to kill someone

692
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,474
and actually
having to do it.

693
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,806
I can't put you
in harm's way

694
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,240
out of respect
to your brother.

695
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:15,440
Your family needs you now.

696
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:22,240
These are the people
who killed my brother, Jack.

697
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:29,340
They shot a bullet
right through his neck,

698
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:32,273
and then he died in my arms.

699
00:31:34,474 --> 00:31:37,940
Put yourself in my position.

700
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,639
Could you just walk away?

701
00:31:42,673 --> 00:31:44,639
No.

702
00:31:44,706 --> 00:31:47,639
Neither can I.

703
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,806
I'm coming with you, Jack.

704
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,573
( laughing )

705
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,906
Thank you for your support,
Mr. Prime Minister.

706
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:03,706
Give my regards to
your lovely wife.

707
00:32:03,773 --> 00:32:05,173
We'll talk soon.

708
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:07,840
It's going to take me
better part of the day

709
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:09,107
to return all these phone calls.

710
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:11,007
That's wonderful,
Mr. President.

711
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:13,806
World leaders,
prominent Americans.

712
00:32:13,873 --> 00:32:16,374
They're all lining up
to offer their congratulations.

713
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,539
Uh, sir, were you aware
that Wayne Palmer

714
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,207
was on the premises?

715
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,474
He was?

716
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:24,773
Yes, I just spoke with him,

717
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,474
not a half hour ago,
he just left.

718
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:27,906
You didn't speak with him?

719
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:29,906
No.

720
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:31,374
What was he doing here?

721
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,740
Well, he said he had
a memento from President Palmer

722
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:36,374
he wanted to give
to Aaron Pierce.

723
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,606
It was
a service medal.

724
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:39,140
That explains it.

725
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,706
David and Aaron
were very close.

726
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:45,906
I'm just surprised he didn't
want to speak with you.

727
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:49,973
Well, it's no secret
that his brother and I

728
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,806
had our share of
disagreements over the years.

729
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:55,940
It's possible Wayne harbors
ill feelings towards me.

730
00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:00,173
That must be the reason.

731
00:33:10,473 --> 00:33:12,606
You clear on the plan?

732
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:15,006
I don't think I can do this.

733
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:17,273
Evelyn, do you want to see
your little girl again?

734
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:19,406
Because these men
didn't hesitate

735
00:33:19,473 --> 00:33:20,906
to kill President Palmer
and they're gonna hesitate

736
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:23,373
to kill you and your daughter
once they get what they want.

737
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,672
Right now, I am
your last chance.

738
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:28,640
We have to stick to the plan,
do you understand me?

739
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:32,306
Okay, once you have your
daughter in your arms...

740
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:34,540
I know what to do.

741
00:33:34,606 --> 00:33:37,506
We are going to get her back.

742
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:42,606
Let's go.

743
00:33:46,813 --> 00:33:49,046
( engine starts )

744
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:58,513
Call out testing--
one, two, three.

745
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:02,213
Testing,
one, two, three.

746
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,113
Chloe, did you get that?

747
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,647
You're coming through now.
I'm refreshing your screen.

748
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,513
Okay, we're at the southeast
corner entrance.

749
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,647
Jack, there's
a tunnel through that door

750
00:34:12,713 --> 00:34:15,446
that leads to a conveyor belt
that lets out

751
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,813
into the middle
of the plant.

752
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Be careful, there's
a hostile at the exit.

753
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:23,014
Copy that.

754
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,914
Draw your weapon.

755
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:29,846
Let's go.

756
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:55,446
Bravo, check.

757
00:34:55,513 --> 00:34:57,112
Have you got
a visual on the mark?

758
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,213
Negative, sir.

759
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,413
All units holding.

760
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,346
Copy.

761
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:09,479
This way.

762
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:31,779
( silenced gunshots )

763
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:39,412
Let's go.

764
00:35:46,846 --> 00:35:48,978
Damn it,
there's too many of them.

765
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:50,245
We're running
out of time.

766
00:35:50,312 --> 00:35:52,579
I'm gonna need you to take
out one of their guards

767
00:35:52,645 --> 00:35:54,746
so I can climb to the top
of this structure

768
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:56,011
and take out the sniper.

769
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:57,712
He's about a hundred yards
north of here,

770
00:35:57,779 --> 00:35:59,178
just on the other side
of the conveyor belt.

771
00:35:59,245 --> 00:36:00,512
Can you do that?

772
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:01,512
Yeah. I can do it.

773
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:04,379
Wait. One of them's moving.

774
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:12,011
( silenced gunshots )

775
00:36:12,078 --> 00:36:14,212
Go.

776
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,645
Mr. Palmer,
can you hear me?

777
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:32,579
Copy. I'm on the south side
of the lower belt moving west.

778
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:35,011
Continue to the end, your
target's to the north.

779
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,245
( silenced gunshots )

780
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:04,779
Jack, it's all clear.

781
00:37:33,145 --> 00:37:35,679
( vehicle approaching )

782
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:37,412
This is Bravo.

783
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:41,512
I think I hear a car.

784
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,379
Vehicle headed north.

785
00:37:43,445 --> 00:37:45,078
Single occupant, female, over.

786
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:57,078
HENDERSON:
Bravo, what have you got?

787
00:37:57,145 --> 00:38:01,479
I repeat, Bravo,
what have you got?

788
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:05,911
Come in, Bravo.

789
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:08,379
( garbled transmission )

790
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:11,579
Say again.
I didn't get that.

791
00:38:11,645 --> 00:38:13,911
I repeat, woman is alone...

792
00:38:13,978 --> 00:38:15,779
( static hisses ):
...in the car.

793
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:20,846
Copy.

794
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:37,612
Chloe, we've
taken out four men.

795
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,245
Evelyn has moved
into position.

796
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:42,112
Wayne, I want you
to wait for my signal.

797
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:43,112
Copy.

798
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:44,379
We need Henderson alive.

799
00:38:44,445 --> 00:38:46,312
Do not shoot to kill.

800
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:48,545
( cell phone ringing )

801
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:50,345
Yes?

802
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,078
Evelyn, open all the doors

803
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:53,679
and the trunk
of the car.

804
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:08,746
Very good, Evelyn.

805
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:10,078
Now go to the front of the car

806
00:39:10,145 --> 00:39:12,645
and drop the keys
on the ground.

807
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:17,112
I have the evidence with me.

808
00:39:17,178 --> 00:39:19,445
I want my daughter.

809
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:22,679
Bravo, hold your position.

810
00:39:22,746 --> 00:39:24,779
I'm coming out.

811
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:33,846
I have a visual on
Henderson and the girl.

812
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:40,379
Okay, Evelyn,
give me the evidence.

813
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,445
I'll give you the evidence
once you give me Amy.

814
00:39:44,812 --> 00:39:46,512
Come on, let her go.

815
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:49,145
Okay, honey, go see Mommy.

816
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:50,779
Mommy!

817
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,145
She's moving.

818
00:39:53,412 --> 00:39:55,612
Give me the evidence, Evelyn.

819
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,812
Get down. Get down.

820
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:02,045
Bravo, check. Come in.

821
00:40:02,112 --> 00:40:04,412
Bravo. Come in, Bravo.

822
00:40:05,846 --> 00:40:10,545
( gunfire )

823
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:11,812
( screaming )

824
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:17,645
( gunfire continues )

825
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:20,911
Wayne, I didn't get him.
If you got a shot, take it.

826
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,078
( engine starting )

827
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:28,445
( grunting )

828
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:33,245
( gunfire )

829
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:39,945
Chloe, it's Jack.

830
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:41,612
Henderson escaped
in Evelyn's car.

831
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,078
Do you have him on satellite?
We saw it, Jack,

832
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:45,379
but he's leaving
the search grid.

833
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:46,345
We're thermal-scanning
the plant,

834
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:47,612
not the entire
neighborhood.

835
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,045
Well then reprogram it!
We can't lose him!

836
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:52,978
Is she all right?

837
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,645
Evelyn's been hit.

838
00:41:11,078 --> 00:41:13,312
The bullet passed
right through.

839
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:14,846
It hasn't hit
an artery.

840
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:17,379
It's not serious, but it's
gonna have to be dressed.

841
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:18,779
Evelyn, you've got
your daughter back,

842
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:20,545
now tell me what
I need to know.

843
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,812
Who is behind this?
Is it the vice president?

844
00:41:22,878 --> 00:41:25,112
Evelyn, is it
the vice president?

845
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:28,712
The vice president
has nothing to do with this.

846
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,078
You promised me you would
control the situation.

847
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:37,712
I didn't count on
Jack Bauer showing up, sir.

848
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:39,746
He outmaneuvered me.

849
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:42,345
Sir, Bauer and Wayne Palmer
won't be around long enough

850
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:44,612
to tell anybody else
what they know.

851
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:46,479
I'm putting together
another team.

852
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,945
I will handle this, sir,
I promise you.

853
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:53,746
I will not let you down.

854
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,579
See that you don't.
