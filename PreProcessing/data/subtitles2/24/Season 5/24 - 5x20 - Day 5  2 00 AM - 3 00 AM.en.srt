1
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,168
What happened to David Palmer
wasn't supposed to happen.

2
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,400
He put himself in harm's way,
and he got involved

3
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,734
with something
that he shouldn't have.

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,801
You know who killed David?

5
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,801
He works for me.

6
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,701
MARTHA:
You lied to me.

7
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:28,767
This entire day has
been one giant lie!

8
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,967
What you've done
makes me sick!

9
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:32,434
Martha, enough!

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,701
I need you to swear
to me that you will do

11
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:39,267
as I ask for the country.

12
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,034
I hate you.

13
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:43,934
The situation with Martha
is taken care of.

14
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:45,634
There are too many loose ends
lying around.

15
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:46,901
We cannot afford to have her

16
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,200
pull on one
and unravel everything.

17
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:49,434
She won't.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,767
I have the recording.

19
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:51,967
Have you destroyed it?

20
00:00:52,034 --> 00:00:53,233
No, sir, I have not.

21
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,434
You and I have been in this
from the beginning.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,400
Destroying that recording
protects both of us.

23
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:01,300
I've got O'Brian.

24
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,801
Where is she?

25
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:05,168
She's working
out of Bill Buchanan's house.

26
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,967
Did Chloe tell you why she was
helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

27
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,634
'Cause she thinks
Jack is innocent,

28
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:13,600
that President Logan
framed Bauer.

29
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,300
This is Karen Hayes-- Miles
traced Chloe to your house.

30
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,001
You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out of there.

31
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:20,333
Karen, why are you warning us?

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,434
Because I may have made
a mistake earlier.

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,767
Chloe, if they find you
here, you'll be arrested.

34
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,001
You have to go now.

35
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:27,834
Not yet.

36
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:39,134
BAUER:
It's over, Christopher!
Turn around!

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,867
Give me the recording.

38
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,467
I don't have it.
Where is it?!

39
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:44,934
BAUER:
Henderson wasn't lying.

40
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,168
He doesn't have
the recording on him.

41
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,534
There must've been
some kind of a hand-off.

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,300
Henderson stopped and
rendezvoused with another car.

43
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:50,434
Can you track the other car?

44
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,701
We're tracking it now, Jack.

45
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:53,867
It headed back to Van Nuys--
looks like

46
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,200
the civilian side
of the airfield-- pulled onto

47
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:58,434
the tarmac; whoever it was
got out and got directly

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,367
onto the plane.
CHLOE:It is a chartered
diplomatic flight.

49
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:03,367
BUCHANAN:
Jack, we've tried
everything we can.

50
00:02:03,434 --> 00:02:06,300
There's no way
to delay the plane.

51
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,467
Okay, call me
when you've got 'em. Yeah.

52
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,867
Bill, are you out?
The field team's almost there.

53
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,534
Chloe's packing
the comm gear she needs

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,967
to stay in touch with Jack.

55
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:31,233
Where is Jack?
Van Nuys Airport.

56
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,967
He stowed away
on a diplomatic flight

57
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:35,001
that just took off.
What? Why?

58
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,534
He's trying to find a recording
that implicates President Logan.

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,300
And someone
on that flight has it?

60
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:40,767
Yes, and we don't know who.

61
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:42,667
That's what Chloe's been trying
to find out.

62
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:45,567
Hang on. Yeah?
Field team's a block
away from Buchanan's.

63
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll set up here for the
remote debrief of O'Brian.

64
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,034
No. Put it in
the Situation Room.

65
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:54,634
Oh, I thought you wanted...
I want it in
the Situation Room. Go.

66
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,068
Bill, the field team's

67
00:03:00,134 --> 00:03:01,300
gonna be there any second.

68
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,400
Get Chloe out of there now.
How close are they?

69
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:04,734
One block.

70
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:06,467
All right, I'm gonna have
to run interference.

71
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,034
It's more important
that she gets away.

72
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:09,168
Good. I'll bring you in.

73
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,500
You'll be treated
as a suspect.

74
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:11,734
We never talked.

75
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,367
BUCHANAN:
Understood. They're here.

76
00:03:13,434 --> 00:03:15,200
Out the back.
Bill, wait.

77
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:17,634
Have Chloe call me
on a dry channel.

78
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,701
Either one-five
or two-seven.

79
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:22,967
Dry channel,
one-five or two-seven. Got it.

80
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,767
There's a gate in back.

81
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:27,200
Follow the path
between the houses
to the alley,

82
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,967
turn right and go
to Ventura Boulevard.

83
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,434
What about the curfew?

84
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,934
There's a hotel
on the boulevard,
the Miramont.

85
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:33,934
You should be able to make it
there without being spotted.

86
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,434
What about you?
I'm gonna make sure
you're not followed.

87
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,267
I'll be at CTU,
probably in Holding.

88
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,734
Why in Holding?
Karen's gonna place
me under arrest.

89
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,701
If you need anything,
contact her.

90
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,667
Why is she...
Chloe, please, just go.

91
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,101
( knockingat door )

92
00:04:00,168 --> 00:04:02,500
Who is it?

93
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,168
MAN:
Homeland Security.

94
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,168
Mr. Buchanan,
we need you

95
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,400
to open the door.

96
00:04:07,467 --> 00:04:09,400
We're under order
from Karen Hayes.

97
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,267
I'll be right there.

98
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,001
What, uh, what's going on?

99
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:22,801
Please step aside, sir.
We need to search the house.

100
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:25,134
No, I'm not stepping aside.
Do you have a warrant?

101
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,300
Where's Chloe O'Brian?

102
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,267
I have no idea.
Sir,

103
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,267
don't make us use force--
we know she's been here.

104
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,200
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

105
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,434
Where is she?

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,600
I don't know

107
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,701
where Chloe O'Brian is.

108
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,834
She's gone.

109
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:55,667
Sir? This is a recent
file from Comm.

110
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,367
Only O'Brian
could access it.

111
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,367
Talk to us, sir.

112
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,701
I'm not talking to you.

113
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,867
I'll talk to Karen Hayes.

114
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,734
Mr. Papazian,

115
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:19,500
we are on site-- it appears
Chloe O'Brian was here,

116
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:20,834
but she is gone.

117
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,134
Is Bill Buchanan there?

118
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,233
Yes, sir.
We lost O'Brian.

119
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,333
Damn it!
Put him on the
phone, please.

120
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,701
Hello?

121
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,101
Don't play games with me, Bill.

122
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:32,467
Just give me
O'Brian's location,

123
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,901
or I will make it
very bad for you.

124
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,068
From what I understand,
Miles, she got out of CTU
right under your nose.

125
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:40,367
You're the one who ought
to be concerned, not me.

126
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,901
Bill, this is Karen Hayes.
Tell us what you know now.

127
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,534
Stop wasting our time.

128
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,434
I'm not saying any more.

129
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,333
This is Ed.

130
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,667
Ed, bring Buchanan in.

131
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,667
Set up a grid search for Chloe.

132
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:57,534
She's probably got a car,
which means

133
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,901
she's about 15 miles out.

134
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,267
Copy that.

135
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,200
But the agents on site

136
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,200
are trained for
interrogation.

137
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,734
Why are you
bringing him in?

138
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:07,567
Because I want
to run this, Miles.
But now it's us

139
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,734
who are wasting
time here.
Don't worry.

140
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,967
I will make him talk.

141
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:13,500
I'll be in my office.

142
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,834
( phone line ringing )

143
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,134
HAYES: Yeah?
I'm set up
at the Miramont Hotel.

144
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,068
Make sure no one looks
for me here.

145
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:21,467
I'll take care of that.

146
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,134
Tell me what else you need.

147
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,534
Jack's on diplomatic flight 520.
Pull up the manifest.

148
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,667
Got it. Flight 520 to Frankfurt.

149
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:35,567
Okay, put everything you've got
from that flight under

150
00:07:35,634 --> 00:07:37,168
the shared volume so I can get
to it.

151
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,734
Crew, passengers, cargo,
everything.

152
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,134
Done.

153
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,134
Okay, I see it.

154
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,500
Thanks.

155
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,200
( phone rings )

156
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,300
( panting )

157
00:07:57,367 --> 00:07:59,001
Yeah.

158
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,200
CHLOE: Jack, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Did you get what I need?

159
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:02,834
I've got the passenger list--
it's gonna take

160
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,233
some time to cross it
against Henderson.

161
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,400
What about the air marshal?

162
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:06,901
That I'll have
in a couple of minutes.

163
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,434
Okay, good. What's
happening at CTU?

164
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,667
They're still under orders
from the president to stop you,

165
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:13,001
but Karen Hayes
is backing us.
Openly?

166
00:08:13,068 --> 00:08:14,634
No, but she's
letting me help you.

167
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,734
If there's proof against Logan,
she wants it found.

168
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:18,233
The proof is
on this plane.

169
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,068
Check the flight manifest,
figure out which passenger

170
00:08:20,134 --> 00:08:22,467
has a connection to Henderson
and get back to me

171
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,434
with the air marshal's
seat number.
I will.

172
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,534
I don't think so.

173
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, hey. I was
just asking.

174
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,168
You don't have to go
all feminist on me.

175
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,834
Did you see that?

176
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,233
21st-century woman.

177
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,267
We better get
used to it.

178
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,901
( computer beeps )

179
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,567
( phone rings )

180
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,134
Yeah.

181
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,634
Jack, I found the air marshal--
his name is George Avila.

182
00:08:57,701 --> 00:09:00,068
He's sitting in 7A.
Anyone sitting
next to him?

183
00:09:00,134 --> 00:09:01,500
No.
Okay, good.
Get back to me

184
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,901
when you've got the
connection to Henderson.

185
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:04,967
Got it.

186
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,034
( quietly ):
Excuse me.

187
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,168
Is that seat taken?

188
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,801
No.

189
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,333
Thanks.

190
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,500
The stewardess said I could
change seats-- I was next

191
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,434
to the galley,
it's kind of noisy.

192
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,300
I'm trying to get some rest.

193
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:40,167
Yeah?

194
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:42,501
Okay, the man you're looking
for is in seat 12D.

195
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:44,167
His name is Hans Meyer.

196
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:45,568
He's with
the German government.

197
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,034
He's been connected to Omicron
since the mid-1990s.

198
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,467
He's worked directly
with Henderson.
That's it.

199
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,134
Okay, I've got it.

200
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:07,867
Mr. Meyer?

201
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,467
Yes?

202
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:12,067
My name is George Avila.
I'm the air marshal
on this flight.

203
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:14,668
What's wrong?
It's nothing serious.
We found something

204
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,733
that we think is yours.
It should have been

205
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,767
in the baggage
compartment.

206
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,067
We'd just like you
to come back

207
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:20,434
to the galley and
identify it for us

208
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:21,733
so we can properly
stow it.

209
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,900
Please, sir. We'd
really appreciate it.

210
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,467
If you have any
carry-on bags,

211
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,467
you should bring
them with you.

212
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:29,668
I don't.

213
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,568
Very well.

214
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,501
What makes you think
it was mine?

215
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:41,867
Ticket stub.

216
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,367
They have taken away

217
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,634
all my medication.
I need to get to it.

218
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,568
I'm sorry, ma'am. They won't
let me give that to you.

219
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,367
What do they think I'm going
to do? Kill myself?

220
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,467
Over that son of a bitch?!

221
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:40,767
I just called the president
of the United States

222
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,201
a son of a bitch.

223
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,767
No reaction?

224
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,900
He must have some kind of law
on the books against that,

225
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,867
or am I immune, just like he is?

226
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,934
Do you have a first name,
Agent Adams?

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,501
It's Justin, ma'am.

228
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:06,434
You don't have much of
a personality, do you, Justin?

229
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:19,100
This is Novick.

230
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,034
It's Martha.

231
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,833
Are you still in the retreat?

232
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,167
Yes. I'm just down the hall
from your room.

233
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:28,467
I need you to come here
right away.

234
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,267
I'll be right there.

235
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,967
They've cut me off
from my medication.

236
00:13:52,034 --> 00:13:53,401
You haven't been cut off.

237
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,134
Dr. Hill said you had enough

238
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,634
in your system right now.

239
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,534
You need to wait
a few hours.

240
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:00,100
I don't want to wait
a few hours, Mike.

241
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:01,401
I need something now.

242
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,534
What's going on, Mrs. Logan?

243
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,334
I don't need counseling, Mike.

244
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:09,867
I just want a damn pill.

245
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,767
Sit down. Sit down.

246
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,601
Thank you, Agent Adams.

247
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:22,733
We've been through some
tough times before, Martha.

248
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Just follow the doctor's
orders for now.

249
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
This is more than
just a tough time, Mike.

250
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,867
None of this is going
to go away.

251
00:14:31,934 --> 00:14:33,401
I just have to live with it.

252
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,134
What do you mean,
"It's not going to go away"?

253
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,668
What are you talking about?

254
00:14:40,134 --> 00:14:42,733
I... I shouldn't have said that.

255
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,201
Martha, it's me.

256
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,534
Say what needs to be said.

257
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:56,700
What needs to be said
I can't say to you.

258
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,967
Why not?

259
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,967
Listen, Mike,

260
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,100
I just...
I just need

261
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,700
to get some sleep.
I'm just...

262
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,201
My nerves

263
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,067
are shot from today.

264
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:12,601
I just need something
to calm me down.

265
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:15,067
I just need
to get to my medication.

266
00:15:15,134 --> 00:15:18,067
The president doesn't want
you to leave the room.

267
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,201
Then you can bring it here.

268
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,967
I just want to take
a couple of pills.

269
00:15:23,034 --> 00:15:25,434
I need to sleep.

270
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:27,434
You can watch me take them.

271
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:33,934
I'll see what I can do.

272
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,733
( phone rings )

273
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:47,367
Yes?

274
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:49,034
GRAHAM:
They found Bauer yet?

275
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,134
No, they haven't.

276
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,167
That's not good.

277
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,267
I know that's not good.

278
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm putting pressure
everywhere I can.

279
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,568
I don't think I have to tell you
how disastrous it would be

280
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:02,534
if Bauer gets his hands
on that recording.

281
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,534
That's exactly right.

282
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,767
You don't have
to tell me. I know.

283
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:09,000
When I find him,
I will call you.

284
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,568
Is there
anything else?

285
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:12,867
No.

286
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:14,434
Good.

287
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:20,668
Mr. President?

288
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,700
What is it, Mike?

289
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:27,301
There's something I think
I should call to your attention.

290
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,668
Yes?

291
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,067
Your wife is in
a very agitated state.

292
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:32,568
I don't know
how to proceed.

293
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,067
Proceed with what?

294
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:36,934
She wants me to bring
her her medication

295
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,534
against doctor's orders.

296
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:42,234
That's all I need right now
is to deal with her!

297
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,833
No! No!

298
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,301
No more pills.

299
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:48,067
And she shouldn't be wasting
your time with this anyway!

300
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:49,601
Mr. President.

301
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:54,334
Is there something
going on that I
should know about?

302
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,900
Why? What did she say?

303
00:16:56,967 --> 00:17:00,501
She needs more medication
to calm herself down.

304
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:02,301
Something's clearly
bothering her,

305
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,367
but she didn't want
to talk about it.

306
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,733
I don't see where any of this
becomes your business, Mike.

307
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,367
I'll tell you where,
Mr. President.

308
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,067
I'm your Chief of Staff.

309
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,568
If there's something going on
that I don't know about

310
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:20,733
that involves national security,
it is my business.

311
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,367
This isn't national security,
Mike.

312
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:31,934
It's our marriage.

313
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,800
I think both of us
realized today,

314
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:38,034
at this point,

315
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,067
our relationship is nothing
more than a facade,

316
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:43,167
and one that we're going
to have to keep up

317
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:44,601
for as long
as I'm president.

318
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:46,601
I think that

319
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:49,367
she's reacting to that, Mike.

320
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:53,900
I see.

321
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,501
I'm sorry, sir.

322
00:17:56,568 --> 00:17:58,434
Mike?

323
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,634
Give her what she wants.

324
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,700
Lord knows, she's
in a lot of pain.

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,100
( groaning )

326
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,833
Where are you hiding it?

327
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,467
Hiding what?

328
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,167
What-What do you want?
What the hell is this?

329
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,334
I know who you are.

330
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:25,134
I know your connection
with Omicron.

331
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,501
I know your history
with Christopher Henderson.

332
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:27,700
He asked you to take something

333
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,501
out of the country for him.
Where is it?

334
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,967
Christopher Henderson?
I have not seen him in months.

335
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:34,301
Don't you lie to me!

336
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,934
I'm not lying, I swear!

337
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,634
I know Henderson,
but I don't know

338
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,668
what you're
talking about.

339
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:42,000
Did you check your luggage?

340
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,334
Yes.

341
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:44,467
Find it.

342
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:45,568
Move!

343
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,000
What are you doing?

344
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:53,401
Nothing.

345
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,501
Homework?

346
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,034
Homework, yeah.

347
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,334
I didn't know they
had WiFi in here.

348
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,100
Could you leave me alone?

349
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,367
I can't talk right now.

350
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,967
( laughs ):
You're a little, uh,

351
00:19:05,034 --> 00:19:06,934
freaked out
because of the curfew thing.

352
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,334
Join the club.

353
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:12,134
Yeah, okay.

354
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:15,467
When you come up
for air, I'm buying.

355
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:24,900
MAN:
Airport Customs.

356
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,467
This is Chloe O' Brian
from CTU Los Angeles.

357
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,867
I need to talk to somebody
in passenger clearing.

358
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,134
I'll need verification.

359
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:33,867
Agency ID: CTU 99A-12.

360
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,234
( bell dings )

361
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,733
The captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign,

362
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,833
as we are expecting
some turbulence.

363
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,301
Please return to your seat

364
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,733
and make sure your seat belt
is securely fastened.

365
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,733
( rumbling )

366
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:54,167
( rumbling )

367
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:58,733
The passenger in 12D must
be in the forward lavatory.

368
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,167
You should get him out.

369
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,867
The captain said it's
going to shake pretty hard.

370
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,733
There's nobody in those.
I just checked.

371
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,067
Then where is this guy?

372
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:06,967
MAN:
I don't know. Maybe
he changed seats.

373
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:09,634
( loud rumbling )

374
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,167
( screaming )

375
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,867
( quietly ):
Call the captain, and tell him
the air marshal's down,

376
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,334
and a passenger's
missing!

377
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:22,167
What's going on here?!

378
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,301
Please be seated, sir.
Now, sir!

379
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,800
Yeah?

380
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,067
Captain Cotter, this is Dan.

381
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:30,568
The air marshal's
been assaulted.

382
00:20:30,634 --> 00:20:31,733
What?

383
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,167
Assaulted?

384
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:34,334
What's going on back there?

385
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,100
I don't know, sir,
but he's been

386
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,900
knocked out,
and a passenger's missing.

387
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:39,334
Okay, okay. Secure the cabin.

388
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:41,301
Keep the passengers
under control.

389
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,134
What's going on?

390
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,634
There's a problem
in the cabin.

391
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,067
Make sure our
door is secure.

392
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,767
It is. What kind of problem?

393
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,833
The air marshal's
been knocked out.

394
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,634
Call L.A. Center,
get vectors

395
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,334
for an emergency return.

396
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:56,434
Mr. Avila, what happened?

397
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:59,000
The man seated next to me--
where is he?

398
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:01,501
I didn't see him.

399
00:21:01,568 --> 00:21:04,034
We got to find him.

400
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,634
Damn it.
What?

401
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,333
Mike, come in.

402
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,101
So, do you have

403
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,634
something for me?

404
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,001
This is just enough
for a couple of days.

405
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:41,068
Dr. Hill's going
to come in...

406
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,767
Thank you, Mike.

407
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:55,101
Thank you.

408
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:56,901
I'm going to get ready
for bed now.

409
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:58,367
Is there
something else?

410
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,400
Yes, there is.

411
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,034
Earlier you said
something to the effect

412
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:07,567
that I didn't know
everything that
was going on.

413
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:10,600
I was confused.

414
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,600
I wanted my pills.

415
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:14,101
I don't think so.

416
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:17,101
Are you calling me a liar?

417
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:19,634
I just spoke with the president.

418
00:22:21,068 --> 00:22:23,834
And I got the same feeling
from him I get from you.

419
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,333
Which is?

420
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,767
That you're both
covering something up.

421
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,534
You know, Mike, I'm the one
around here

422
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,801
who's supposed to be paranoid,
not you.

423
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,267
I know you, Martha.

424
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,101
And I know
the president.

425
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:42,134
He said this was all about
marital difficulties.

426
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,901
I think there's
something else.

427
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:45,600
What is it?

428
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,634
Don't shut me out.

429
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:53,101
Maybe I can help you.

430
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:54,901
There is something
else, Mike,

431
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,233
but it's between me and Charles.

432
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,001
If that changes, I promise

433
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:02,834
I'll let you know.

434
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,500
I don't know what you think
Henderson gave me.

435
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:14,600
I saw no one.

436
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,767
I was picked up
at the Consulate

437
00:23:15,834 --> 00:23:16,901
and brought directly here.

438
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:18,367
There are witnesses,
you can ask them.

439
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:19,867
Is this your only
piece of luggage?
Yes.

440
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,434
If you're lying to me,
I'll find out.

441
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,367
I am not lying.

442
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:25,300
Please, if there is someone
on this plane

443
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,867
that has something you want,
it is not me.

444
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:28,867
( phone ringing )

445
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,134
Yeah.

446
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,134
Jack, I don't think Hans Meyer
is our guy.

447
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,233
Why not?

448
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,667
The timeline
doesn't match.

449
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:36,767
He's been in customs
for the last three hours

450
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,001
clearing himself
onto the flight.

451
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:40,333
The plane's turning.

452
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,500
What does that mean?
It means they
know I'm on board.

453
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:43,834
Chloe, keep looking.
Okay.

454
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,534
( metal rattling )

455
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:58,400
Are you sure
he's down there?

456
00:23:58,467 --> 00:23:59,834
There's nowhere else
he could be.

457
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,967
Tell the pilot

458
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:03,701
he can do it.

459
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,767
But there's a passenger
down there with him. He'll die.

460
00:24:05,834 --> 00:24:07,967
There's over 50 passengers
up here. Call him now.

461
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,034
Do it.

462
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:19,333
Captain, the air marshal says
the baggage area

463
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,068
is secure,

464
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:23,967
and that you should begin.

465
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:27,001
( gasping )

466
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:29,767
( loud hissing )

467
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,534
Air's coming in.

468
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,967
It's not coming in,
it's going out.

469
00:24:34,034 --> 00:24:35,101
What do you mean?

470
00:24:35,168 --> 00:24:36,901
They're depressurizing
this area.

471
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,200
What's going to happen to us?

472
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,534
If we don't get
into the main cabin,

473
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,001
we're going to lose
consciousness.

474
00:24:43,168 --> 00:24:44,801
( phone ringing )

475
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:48,300
Jack, what's going on in the
plane? Security net just issued

476
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:51,701
a bulletin.
Chloe, I need you to patch
me through to the pilot.

477
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,101
I don't know
if I can do that.

478
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:54,667
Chloe, they're depressurizing
this area.

479
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:55,834
We're going to lose
consciousness.

480
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:56,934
Okay, okay.

481
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:05,667
( phone ringing )

482
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:07,134
Yeah, Chloe.

483
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,034
Jack needs us to patch him in
to the pilot of the flight.

484
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:11,767
Can you get through
on a CTU sub-channel?

485
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:12,901
I'll try. Hold on.

486
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,168
I'll stay on the line.

487
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:19,500
MAN:
Air control operator 44.

488
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:22,101
Yes, I need you to patch me
through to the pilot

489
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:24,701
of diplomatic flight
five-two-zero out of Van Nuys.

490
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:27,967
Hey, what
do you got?

491
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,168
A little voice-over
IP going on there?

492
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,600
Please leave me alone.

493
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,634
No, seriously, I can help.

494
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:36,267
I know a way for you
to get some free bandwidth.

495
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:38,934
Really?

496
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,168
Absolutely.

497
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,367
Sit down.

498
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,333
Cool.

499
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,801
Wow, nice piece.

500
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:49,701
Never seen one
of these before.

501
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,001
What is that?

502
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:53,934
( electrical crackling )

503
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:56,134
It's a CTU Series four.

504
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,567
Chloe, they've opened the line

505
00:25:57,634 --> 00:25:59,767
to the pilot.
I'll patch him through.

506
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:02,701
Thanks. Okay, Jack, I'm putting
you on with the pilot.

507
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,934
Go ahead.

508
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:07,200
This is Captain Stan Cotter.

509
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:08,434
Who am I speaking to?

510
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,867
Captain, my name is Jack Bauer.

511
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:11,534
I'm with the counterterrorist
unit in Los Angeles.

512
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,034
I'm the man
in your baggage hold.

513
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:14,400
What do you think you're doing?

514
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:15,567
I'll explain everything
in a moment,

515
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:16,901
but you're going to have
to restore

516
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,667
air pressure to this area.

517
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,834
Sir, I remind you,
I am a federal agent.

518
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:22,068
What kind of a
federal agent

519
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:23,467
knocks out
an air marshal?

520
00:26:23,534 --> 00:26:24,767
I don't believe you.

521
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,001
Sir, I was patched through
to you by a CTU sub-channel.

522
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:28,934
I couldn't have done that
unless I had clearance.

523
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,734
All I know is,
you have a gun

524
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,034
and you have breached
airplane security.

525
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:33,667
Captain, this is a matter
of national security.

526
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:36,567
Now open the damn hatch!
( air hissing )

527
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:38,467
What do you think?

528
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:41,168
He couldn't have patched in
through CTU if he was hostile.

529
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,734
There's no point
in taking a chance.

530
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,434
In a couple of minutes
he'll pass out.

531
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,168
From there,
the air marshal can handle it.

532
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:49,168
Captain, we are running out
of air down here.

533
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,867
( air hissing )

534
00:26:50,934 --> 00:26:53,200
Captain, I know you can hear me.
There is a man on board

535
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,667
your plane that is a danger to
you. That's why I am here.

536
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:57,801
Open the hatch!

537
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,934
I can't do that.

538
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,300
Okay, you son of a bitch.

539
00:27:23,634 --> 00:27:26,101
( air hissing )

540
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,467
( shouting )

541
00:27:56,534 --> 00:27:58,600
What the hell was that?

542
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:00,734
The aileron conduit's
been breached.

543
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:02,867
What?!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

544
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:04,767
You're going to kill
everybody on this plane.

545
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:05,901
That's up to you.

546
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:07,467
Open the hatch.

547
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:09,034
I'm not letting
you up here.

548
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:11,434
Then you'll be responsible
for everything that happens.

549
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,434
( people screaming )

550
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,801
All right, all right,
all right.

551
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,567
Sue, I'm going

552
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,101
to stabilize the pressure
and I'm letting him up.

553
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:22,767
I want you to unlock
the hatch.

554
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,267
The cockpit's secure.
He can't get in here.

555
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,901
Yes, Captain.

556
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,134
What do you think
you're doing?

557
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,767
The captain ordered me
to open the hatch.

558
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:40,233
Both of you,
turn around
and grab the wall.

559
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,701
Now!

560
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,001
You...

561
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,701
in the baggage hold.

562
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,701
Do it.

563
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:57,901
Now.

564
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,233
Close it.

565
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,500
Lock it.

566
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,233
Out of the galley now.

567
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,333
Get back to your seats.

568
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,801
What's going on?
Sit down!

569
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:23,467
He has a gun!
( people screaming )

570
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:24,667
Everybody just stay
in your seats.

571
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:26,134
Face forward.
Put your hands on your head.

572
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,001
Do what I tell you
and no one will get hurt.

573
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:30,701
If you don't,
people will start to die.

574
00:29:30,767 --> 00:29:33,333
Get the captain
on the phone now.

575
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Sir, he's in
the main cabin.

576
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,001
He has a gun.

577
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:39,168
Get the first-class passengers,
move them into the main cabin.

578
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,867
Everyone to the main cabin.

579
00:29:41,934 --> 00:29:44,534
Captain, this is Jack Bauer.
I want to assure you

580
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,034
I have no intention
of hurting any of
your passengers.

581
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:48,767
I need to find something
that's on the plane.

582
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:50,967
It's a matter
of national security.
What do you want, Bauer?

583
00:29:51,034 --> 00:29:52,867
I want you to remain
in a holding pattern

584
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,068
so I can search
your passengers.

585
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:55,333
If you're really
a federal agent,

586
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,267
then you know I have
to land this plane.

587
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,867
Sir, that won't give me
enough time.

588
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:00,367
That's not my problem.

589
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,400
I have a gun.
Your air marshal is down.

590
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,101
Captain, it is
your problem.

591
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:06,333
You need to remain
in a holding pattern,
do you understand me?

592
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,168
You do what you have
to do, Mr. Bauer.

593
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:10,068
My job is to land
this airplane.

594
00:30:10,134 --> 00:30:12,068
And that is what
I am going to do.

595
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:15,400
Captain? Captain...

596
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,567
MAN:
That's all we have
on Flight 520, sir.

597
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,501
Okay, look, I want updates
on the situation

598
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:41,134
on a minute by minute basis
if necessary.

599
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,134
GRAHAM:
Yes.

600
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,701
I just got word
from the FAA

601
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:57,033
about a hijacking aboard
a diplomatic flight that left

602
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,801
Van Nuys a half hour ago.

603
00:30:58,868 --> 00:30:59,801
So what?

604
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:02,801
Jack Bauer is
the hijacker.

605
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:04,967
What is he doing
on that flight?

606
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:06,734
Looking for the recording
that implicates me

607
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,067
in David Palmer's death.

608
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,467
Henderson handed it off
to somebody

609
00:31:11,534 --> 00:31:12,768
before he was arrested

610
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,768
and Jack must know
that it's on board.

611
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,967
Then you shouldn't be
wasting your time
talking to me.

612
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:18,134
Order the plane down,

613
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,701
and grab Bauer before
he can hurt us.

614
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,701
Wait, what are you saying?

615
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,834
That he hijacked the plane?

616
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,267
Not exactly.

617
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,401
He has control of the cabin.
The pilot is landing the plane.

618
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,634
What about
that recording?

619
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,300
He's still looking
for it,

620
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,701
but there's no guarantee he'll
find it before the plane lands.

621
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:39,967
And after that,
it's all over.

622
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,567
The president will have
his people

623
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,634
arrest Jack at the airport
and isolate him.

624
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,000
What are we
supposed to do?

625
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,768
Just keep helping Jack.

626
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:50,100
Chloe, I need to see
that evidence.

627
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,367
Call me if you need

628
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:53,501
anything from here.
Fine.

629
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:01,501
Give me a second.

630
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,701
What's Bauer doing
on Flight 520?

631
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,267
You have no idea
what you're dealing with,

632
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:08,501
you little ass-kisser.

633
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,100
You don't talk to my people
like that, Bill.

634
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:13,300
Take him to Holding.

635
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:15,834
It's no wonder CTU fell apart
under that guy.

636
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,634
Miles, I know you're
trying to help,

637
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:18,834
but I'll take it

638
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,768
from here, okay?

639
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,534
WOMAN:
Western Operations.

640
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:32,933
This is Miles Papazian,
Homeland Security, Los Angeles.

641
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,434
Pass code 21 double six.

642
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:36,000
Put me through to Mike Novick.

643
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:38,734
One moment, please.

644
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:41,367
Yes, Miles. What is it?

645
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:44,300
I need your input, sir, because

646
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:46,868
I'm having a problem
with Karen Hayes.

647
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:48,667
I'd like to preface what I'm
about to tell you

648
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:50,167
by saying that I
don't wish to be

649
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,467
second-guessing...
I don't have time
for prefaces.

650
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:54,868
Karen Hayes was called in
to replace Bill Buchanan.

651
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,868
She was hand-chosen
by the vice president

652
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,000
to take that post.

653
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,634
I understand that, sir.

654
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:02,534
Are you saying you feel
she's unfit to do the job?

655
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,234
Four hours ago,

656
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,667
she relieved Bill Buchanan
for ineffectual leadership.

657
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,801
He's been working covertly
with Chloe O'Brian

658
00:33:09,868 --> 00:33:12,601
to aid Jack Bauer,
a federal fugitive.

659
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,967
Which means Buchanan needs
to be dealt with appropriately.

660
00:33:16,033 --> 00:33:17,200
What has Karen done?

661
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:19,534
She sent in a tac team
to pick them both up,

662
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,801
but by the time they got
there, O'Brian was gone.

663
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,634
But instead
of having the team

664
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,234
do the interrogation
of Buchanan onsite,

665
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,100
Karen wasted 20 minutes

666
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:30,100
by bringing him in to CTU.

667
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,401
Maybe she felt
the interrogation

668
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:36,067
would be more effective
with CTU resources.

669
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:39,267
But, sir, she isn't even using
rudimentary CTU resources.

670
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:42,300
She wants to do a soft
Q and A by herself.

671
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,967
Any leads we may have had
on O'Brian have dried up.

672
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:47,567
Wait a second, Miles.

673
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:51,134
I'm not going to pass judgment
on Karen Hayes at this point.

674
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,434
She's not
interrogating a terrorist.

675
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:56,200
She's dealing with a high-
ranking federal employee.

676
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,434
Sometimes finesse
and diplomacy

677
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,300
are better than coercion.

678
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,300
Your concern
is duly noted, Miles.

679
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:06,701
If you'll excuse me,
I need to see the president.

680
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,900
Karen.

681
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:20,501
Shut up, Bill.

682
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,801
We're offline. Now we can talk.

683
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:33,134
Look, you can continue

684
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,801
this charade of me being
under arrest if you want to,

685
00:34:35,868 --> 00:34:37,033
but Jack
needs our help.

686
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,967
And he's getting it,
but make no mistake, I am

687
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:41,200
still in charge of this
facility, and until I see

688
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:42,701
that evidence,
I must remain skeptical.

689
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:45,834
Have you talked to Chloe?

690
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,834
Yes.

691
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
What's Jack's status?

692
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:49,667
He's searching the cabin
for the evidence,

693
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:51,534
but the pilot is going
to land that plane.

694
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:53,100
How much time does Jack have?

695
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,033
15 minutes.

696
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,868
To search over 50 passengers?

697
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:58,100
That's impossible.

698
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,667
STAFFER ( over intercom ):
Ms. Hayes.

699
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:01,900
Yes.

700
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:03,601
The president
and Mike Novick want an update

701
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:07,000
on the hijacking
of the diplomatic flight.

702
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,967
Put them through.

703
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,367
Go ahead, sir.

704
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:12,900
Ms. Hayes,
this is the president.

705
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,567
Talk to me about 520.

706
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:16,868
We know that Bauer's
involved, but we don't know why.

707
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,033
Isn't it obvious?

708
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,234
Bauer is a fugitive

709
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,334
and he's looking for safe
passage out of the country.

710
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:25,467
Well, that's certainly
a possibility, sir.

711
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:27,534
Listen to me. This
man is desperate.

712
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:29,300
He will say
or do anything.

713
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,634
He's not to be trusted.

714
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:32,967
We need to take him down now,

715
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,267
dead or alive.

716
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,401
Yes, sir.

717
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,100
Mr. President.

718
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,967
Look. You call the pilot

719
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,634
and you tell him
that I don't care

720
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,067
if Bauer is making
threats or not,

721
00:35:43,134 --> 00:35:44,933
that plane has
to land immediately.

722
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,167
And when it lands, I want
my Secret Service detail

723
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:50,067
to take him into custody,
is that clear?

724
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,501
Ms. Hayes?

725
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,067
Yes, Mr. President.

726
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
The president has had knowledge

727
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:02,667
of everything
that's happened today.

728
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:05,868
He wants that plane down
before Jack finds the evidence.

729
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:07,667
We have to buy him more time.

730
00:36:07,734 --> 00:36:11,534
I don't have the authority
to keep that plane from landing.

731
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:15,401
Sir.

732
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:18,033
It still doesn't
make sense to me.

733
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,701
What?
Jack Bauer

734
00:36:19,768 --> 00:36:21,134
has been on the right side

735
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,567
of everything that's
happened today, up until now.

736
00:36:23,634 --> 00:36:26,234
Well, right now,
he is hijacking a plane.

737
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,801
This man is not stupid.

738
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:28,801
He's appeared

739
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:31,100
to do the right thing,
but right now,

740
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:33,401
he's backed into a corner,
and he's desperate.

741
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,401
Do you really believe that, sir?

742
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:36,768
I absolutely do.

743
00:36:36,834 --> 00:36:39,300
Bauer's lied to us all day.

744
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,301
MAN:
Flight Operations.

745
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:10,667
This is Chloe O'Brian again.

746
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,301
Yes, Ms. O'Brian.

747
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,700
The copilot, Don Faganson,

748
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,667
didn't check in
when he boarded Flight 520.

749
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,301
Mr. Faganson didn't board.

750
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,433
Why not?

751
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,268
He was replaced
at the last minute.

752
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:21,301
By whom?

753
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:24,167
Scott Evans, the new copilot.

754
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,667
Here are your things,
Go back to your seat.

755
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:40,134
( phone rings )

756
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,268
Yeah.

757
00:37:41,334 --> 00:37:43,301
Jack, it's the copilot,
Scott Evans.

758
00:37:43,368 --> 00:37:44,433
How do you know?

759
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,901
He used to fly for Hatton Air.

760
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,134
It's a private charter company

761
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,134
that worked exclusively
for Omicron.

762
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:50,667
Evans was assigned
to Henderson's group.

763
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:52,134
He flew him around
for over a year.

764
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:54,201
Okay, I need you to
patch me through
to the captain

765
00:37:54,268 --> 00:37:56,134
on a discreet channel
so Evans can't hear me.

766
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:57,101
Okay.

767
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:01,667
Sit down!

768
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:02,667
Now!

769
00:38:02,734 --> 00:38:04,301
Everybody stay in your seats

770
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,567
and no one  will get hurt!

771
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:16,934
CHLOE:
Go ahead.

772
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,334
Captain, this
is Jack Bauer.

773
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,201
I'm speaking to you
on a discreet channel.

774
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,433
The person that
I'm looking for,

775
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,067
the man with the
evidence that I need,

776
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:27,101
is sitting next to you.

777
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:28,967
He's your copilot,
Scott Evans.

778
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,134
That's ridiculous.

779
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:31,634
Sir, my sources
have informed me

780
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,400
that Evans was a
last-second replacement.

781
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:35,268
Can you explain to me
why you're not flying

782
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:38,234
with your regular copilot,
Don Faganson?

783
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:41,734
Captain, Scott Evans
has been connected

784
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,634
to a known terrorist.

785
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,034
You need to open the door.

786
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,600
This conversation is over.

787
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:54,134
Damn it.

788
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:00,734
What did he want?

789
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,734
He's desperate.

790
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,400
Wants us to land.

791
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,001
This is messed up.

792
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,268
Yeah.

793
00:39:08,268 --> 00:39:09,400
Bad luck for you, huh?

794
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:11,467
Why?

795
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,533
Well, wasn't Don supposed
to have your seat tonight?

796
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,268
Yeah.

797
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:18,700
What happened to him?

798
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,001
I don't know.

799
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,067
I got the call, so I'm here.

800
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:24,700
Yeah.

801
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,901
Oh, God.

802
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:34,667
What's wrong?

803
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:35,667
( groans )

804
00:39:35,734 --> 00:39:36,767
Could you, uh...

805
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,800
Could you take the
stick for a second?

806
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:41,667
You okay?

807
00:39:41,734 --> 00:39:45,001
Yeah. I just...
got a cramp in my leg.

808
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:51,101
Yeah. Those are a bitch.

809
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,634
Yeah.

810
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,034
( groans )

811
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:06,767
I'm the only one
who can fly this plane.

812
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:11,767
Now, you don't strike me

813
00:40:11,834 --> 00:40:13,600
as a man who's willing to die

814
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,034
for Christopher
Henderson.

815
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:17,201
Give me the recording.

816
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:19,268
( cocking gun )

817
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,734
Do it.

818
00:40:31,234 --> 00:40:32,167
Slowly.

819
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:33,734
Get up.

820
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,067
Get back in your seat.

821
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:43,067
You're going
to land this plane

822
00:40:43,134 --> 00:40:45,234
or I'm going to put
a bullet in your head.

823
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:50,901
( phone ringing )

824
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,034
Yeah, Jack.

825
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,034
Advise CTU I have the recording.

826
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,967
I'll be on the ground
in less than 15 minutes.

827
00:40:56,034 --> 00:40:58,767
Got it.

828
00:41:04,767 --> 00:41:07,301
NEWSCASTER:
At this hour, there are still
many unanswered questions

829
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:09,368
surrounding
David Palmer's death.

830
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,734
During the emergency press
conference, the president

831
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,134
announced that the terrorist
threat was over...

832
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:17,268
( phone ringing )

833
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:21,734
Yes.

834
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,034
MARTHA ( weakly ):
Charles.

835
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:26,201
If I'm going to live with this,

836
00:41:26,268 --> 00:41:28,234
then you're
going to have to help me.

837
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:31,034
Help you do what, Martha?

838
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:33,301
Understand.

839
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:35,101
I...

840
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:39,334
I know you're a good man,

841
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,034
and that deep down,

842
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:45,567
you do what's best
for this country.

843
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:46,667
Of course I do.

844
00:41:46,734 --> 00:41:50,234
Then why...

845
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,368
why didn't you come to me?

846
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:55,433
I'd have been there for you.

847
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,700
I could have
talked you through it.

848
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,767
For God's sake, Martha,
for the last three years,

849
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:01,934
you've been one click away

850
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:03,700
from a nervous breakdown
every single day,

851
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:06,268
and I'm gonna come to you
for advice?

852
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:10,433
( phone rings )
I'm gonna have to take
another call.

853
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,767
No. Charles, no, no.

854
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:14,700
We'll talk later.

855
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:17,400
( sobbing )

856
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:21,334
( cell phone ringing )

857
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:22,467
Yes.

858
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:23,967
Bauer's got the evidence.

859
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:25,433
He is in control of the plane.

860
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,934
How do you know that?

861
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,834
We just picked up a call from
Chloe O'Brian to Karen Hayes.

862
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:33,600
What do we do?

863
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:39,067
You are going to have
to shoot down that
plane, Mr. President.

864
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,368
What?

865
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,101
It's the only option
we've got.

866
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:44,967
Otherwise, you go to prison

867
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:46,967
for treason and murder.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
