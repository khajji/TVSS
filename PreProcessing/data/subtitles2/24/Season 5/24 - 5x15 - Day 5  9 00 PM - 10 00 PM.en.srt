1
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:16,267
I'm issuing an executive order,
imposing a curfew

2
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:18,234
on all civilians

3
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,634
in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.

4
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,434
This curfew will be effective

5
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,534
immediately and will be enforced
by the military.

6
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:26,867
They're talking about this

7
00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:28,200
like it's
an illegal action.

8
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,367
Don't worry, Mr. President.

9
00:00:30,434 --> 00:00:32,534
I'm in control of the situation.

10
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,067
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

11
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,833
that he proposed this whole
thing to set you up for a fall?

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,267
Hal's only motivation
is what's best for the country.

13
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,668
There's going to be a fallout.

14
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,034
And you know it.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,167
You're here to shut
this place down, aren't you?

16
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:44,334
I told you before,
the White House...

17
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,534
I know what you
told me before.

18
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,000
Now tell me the truth.

19
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,668
CTU is being absorbed
by Homeland,

20
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,067
which means
from now on,

21
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,234
every operational decision
needs to go through me.

22
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:54,734
There's something
from my brother

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,067
I need to give you personally.

24
00:00:56,134 --> 00:00:57,668
I should be there
within the hour.

25
00:00:57,734 --> 00:00:59,668
You coming here?
I know
it sounds impulsive, Aaron,

26
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:01,534
but I'd rather see you
sooner than later.

27
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,734
I'm hoping there's somewhere
we can meet discreetly.

28
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,434
( tires squealing )

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,933
( tires squealing )

30
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,467
Does she have the schematics
and the access codes?

31
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:25,100
Yes. Everything
we need.

32
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,800
Release the Sentox here...

33
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,701
and 200,000 people die.

34
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,534
The decryption key
is Charlie-Alpha

35
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,100
3-9-Alpha.

36
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:35,401
It worked.

37
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:36,734
This is what
you wanted.

38
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,234
JACK:
Drop the gun!

39
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:40,234
I'm with the German Federal
Intelligence Service.

40
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,734
I've been undercover
for the last six months,

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,534
gathering intel
on Collette's clientele.

42
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,867
If we don't find Bierko,

43
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,501
hundreds of thousands
of innocent people

44
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:48,701
will die here today.

45
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:50,100
JACK:
Let him go!

46
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,000
He's given us what we want!

47
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,434
Put your hands up!

48
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:55,200
As for the data
I sold to Bierko,

49
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:57,467
it's something that I received
from a contact

50
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,634
from the Department
of Defense.

51
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,800
What's his name?
Her name?

52
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,434
Audrey Raines.

53
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,900
You were lying to me.

54
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:07,200
She sold me the
information, Mr. Bauer.

55
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,601
Apparently, she
had a price.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,367
Chloe, I need you to do
something for me right away.

57
00:02:27,434 --> 00:02:28,534
Check out Audrey Raines's

58
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:30,367
activities in the
last 18 months.

59
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:31,601
Audrey? Why?

60
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:32,967
I'll explain later.

61
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:35,768
I'm particularly interested
in any unusual connection

62
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,800
between her and Christopher
Henderson or Walt Cummings.

63
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,334
You think she has something
to do with their conspiracy?

64
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:42,501
I don't know what to think.
Please do it quickly.

65
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,434
Audrey.

66
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,734
Yes, sir?

67
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,434
I'm afraid I have to
take you into custody.

68
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,167
What? I don't understand.

69
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:52,367
Am I being arrested?
Detained.

70
00:02:52,434 --> 00:02:53,701
On what grounds?

71
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:56,100
Collette Stenger's been passing
information to Bierko,

72
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:58,501
information he apparently
intends to use

73
00:02:58,567 --> 00:02:59,768
in his next attack.

74
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,401
She claims
she got the information

75
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,401
from someone at DoD,

76
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:03,833
and she named you
as the source.

77
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,267
She's lying.
That's impossible.

78
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:06,434
We already uncovered one mole

79
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:07,601
in the White House today,
Audrey.

80
00:03:07,668 --> 00:03:09,067
I have no choice.

81
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,267
What kind of information
did Stenger say I gave her?

82
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:13,434
I've told you as much
as I can at this point.

83
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,401
Prep Ms. Raines
for interrogation.

84
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,734
Does Jack know that
I'm being detained?
Yes.

85
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,034
He sanctioned it.

86
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,367
COLLETTE:
It's the truth.

87
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:28,301
Audrey Raines was my contact
at the Department of Defense.

88
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:30,701
You met with her
face-to-face?
Yes.

89
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:32,534
Good, then you'll be able to
recognize her when you see her.

90
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,434
Of course.
CTU AGENT:
She identified Ms. Raines

91
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,334
from photographs
on the way here.

92
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:39,234
If you were lying to me,

93
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,768
I'm gonna make this
the worst day of your life.

94
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,501
You understand?

95
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,200
Put her in Holding.

96
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,534
Burke's interrogation methods

97
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,167
should only be used
as a last resort.

98
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,367
The situation warrants
a more aggressive approach.

99
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,200
Then do the same thing
to Collette Stenger.

100
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,067
Stenger is protected
by an immunity agreement.

101
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,534
We can't touch her
unless the information

102
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,833
she's provided turns
out to be false;

103
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,167
then we can nullify
the agreement.

104
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,000
So we can torture
our own people,

105
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,334
but we can't
touch a criminal?

106
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,467
I've known Audrey Raines
for years.

107
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,833
I trust her implicitly.

108
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,100
So does everyone else.

109
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,401
Maybe that's the problem.

110
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,867
Bill, we don't have
the luxury of time.

111
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,200
Intel indicates that
an attack is imminent--

112
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,567
within an hour.

113
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,401
Tens, maybe hundreds
of thousands of Americans

114
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,701
are at risk,
and we just got information

115
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:48,967
that Audrey Raines
knows about it.

116
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:51,668
Karen, the decision
is yours.

117
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:53,701
But any adverse consequences

118
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:56,967
that result from insufficiently
aggressive action taken now

119
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:59,000
will come down hard on you.

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,301
What is Agent Burke doing here?

121
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,034
KAREN:
We're talking about authorizing
the medical interrogation.

122
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,267
On Audrey?
Yes.

123
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,267
That's ridiculous.

124
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:09,900
I'll handle
the interrogation.

125
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,134
I can't allow that.

126
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,534
Karen, I brought this to you.
I called it in.

127
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,900
You can't pull me off
of this now.

128
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:15,467
Your emotional involvement
with Ms. Raines

129
00:05:15,534 --> 00:05:16,668
is not exactly a secret, Jack.

130
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,434
That has nothing
to do with this.

131
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,501
That's right.

132
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,833
You always put the work first.

133
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,167
You never let your feelings
get involved.

134
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:27,701
Is that what happened
with Nina Myers?

135
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:34,301
Nina Myers was a mistake--
I've never denied that--

136
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,634
but she was deep cover

137
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,900
for years before
I even met her.

138
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,668
She fooled a lot of people
for a long time, not just me.

139
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:43,167
Well, maybe Audrey
is fooling people, too.

140
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,833
You might be right, Karen,
but if I were you,

141
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,200
I would think twice about

142
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,534
who you're willing to
invasively interrogate.

143
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,301
Audrey Raines is
the senior advisor

144
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,467
to the Secretary of
Defense, James Heller,

145
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,467
who happens to be her father!

146
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:58,701
And if you were wrong,

147
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:01,867
he's gonna eat you alive.

148
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,668
At least let Jack talk to her
for ten minutes first.

149
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:12,701
She deserves that much.

150
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:15,167
If she's guilty...

151
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,000
she doesn't deserve anything.

152
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,000
That's the point.

153
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,634
She hasn't
been proven guilty.

154
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:25,167
After she's been prepped, you
can see her for ten minutes.

155
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,467
But at the first sign
you're less than objective,

156
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:29,100
you're out.

157
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:33,034
Understood.

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,067
Thanks, Bill.

159
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:48,401
I don't believe
Audrey is guilty

160
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:49,401
of anything, Jack.

161
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,634
Neither do I.

162
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,933
The one thing we do know is,

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,768
Bierko is going
to release the Sentox

164
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,567
in the city sometime
in the next hour.

165
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:57,967
If Audrey knows anything
that can help us find him,

166
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:59,734
she needs to tell us now.

167
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,867
Keep an eye on the
traffic patrol.

168
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,900
Bierko's gonna need to
move those canisters.

169
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,100
He's gonna need
transportation.

170
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,734
With the curfew in place,
I might get lucky

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,734
and pick up a trail.

172
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,100
Yeah.

173
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,134
( man groans )
( siren whoops )

174
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,734
( grunts and groans )

175
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,267
( scuffling )

176
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,601
Hey, break it up!

177
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:22,601
( man groans )

178
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:23,567
OFFICER:
Break it up now!

179
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:26,701
Gentlemen, I said, break it up!

180
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,301
( gunshot )

181
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:40,100
Take their uniforms and weapons.

182
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:44,668
Now we have a police
escort to the target,

183
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:46,768
the curfew won't
be a problem.

184
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,534
( whispering ):
Chloe, walk with me.

185
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,800
You were doing background
on Audrey?

186
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:18,967
Yeah.

187
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,634
What have you got?

188
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,501
You're not going to like it.

189
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,467
I found the connection between
Walt Cummings and Audrey.

190
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:27,634
What kind of a connection?

191
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:29,034
They dealt with each other
a few times--

192
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,900
the usual stuff between DoD
and the White House.

193
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,467
But there is something else.

194
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:34,933
What?

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
Chloe, what?

196
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,800
They both stayed at a place
called the River Hotel

197
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,434
in Pikesville,
Maryland,
last April.

198
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,800
So?

199
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,234
So, Pikesville isn't
exactly a hot spot

200
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:47,267
with top-ranking
federal officials.

201
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,301
It wasn't a coincidence
that they were there
the same night.

202
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,634
Chloe, what are you
trying to say?

203
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,768
They didn't just stay
in the same hotel,

204
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,467
but they stayed
in the same room.

205
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:59,334
How could you
possibly know that?

206
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:03,768
Because I e-mailed photos
of them to the manager.

207
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,167
He recognized them both.

208
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,768
He showed me phone bills,
room service receipts.

209
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,833
I can show you a few
if you want.

210
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,933
No. I'm sorry.

211
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:20,301
I believe you.

212
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,634
It doesn't mean she was part
of their conspiracy,

213
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,334
but it doesn't exactly
look that good either.

214
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,367
Make copies of everything
you've got

215
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:34,701
and put them in a folder for me.

216
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,267
Thanks.

217
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:19,334
Excuse me.

218
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:21,468
My name is Shari Rothenberg.

219
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:22,867
I work in Section Five
downstairs.

220
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:24,800
I know where Section Five is.

221
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:28,434
Right. Uh, Mr. Buchanan told me
to report to Chloe O'Brian.

222
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,767
Is that you?

223
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:32,001
You're gonna have
to wait a second.

224
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,134
Um, I'm here to replace Edgar.

225
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:37,001
I understand he died
in the attack.

226
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:38,834
Yes, he did.

227
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,201
Well, if he was
a friend of yours,

228
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,967
I'm sorry.

229
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:45,301
( sighs )

230
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,900
Thanks.

231
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:50,600
He worked at Station Six.

232
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,167
It's right there.

233
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,667
Are you familiar

234
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:54,934
with the Gavilan
matrix analyzer?

235
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,500
Yes, I am.

236
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,800
Use it to make sure
our databases are current.

237
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,134
Some of them may have
fallen behind in the
past couple of hours.

238
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,134
No problem.

239
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:04,600
( sighs )

240
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,533
( phone ringing musical tones )

241
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,700
Jack.

242
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,967
Sit down.

243
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,600
Sit down.

244
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,834
That's the dossier you gave me
on Collette Stenger.

245
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,700
She says that you provided her
with information

246
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:37,967
from the DoD.

247
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,500
I know. Bill told me.
That's ridiculous.

248
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,368
You know it.

249
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,500
Jack, you're wasting time
that we don't have.

250
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,001
I had to ask CTU

251
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:47,067
so that I could
interrogate you.

252
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:49,067
I have a job to do.
If I don't do it,

253
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:50,434
Burke will, and I promise you,

254
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,700
you do not want to see him
walk through that door.

255
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,967
Fine.

256
00:11:55,034 --> 00:11:56,468
What kind of information
did she say I gave her?

257
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:59,001
She said you provided her
with a structural schematic

258
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,034
of Bierko's next target.

259
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:01,301
What kind of structure?

260
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:02,834
She didn't know.
She just delivered the package.

261
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,401
She claims
that I gave her information,

262
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:06,900
yet she can't tell you

263
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:09,001
what that information is,
and that's enough

264
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,468
to make me a suspect?!

265
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,834
Damn it, Audrey! You know
what this nerve gas does?

266
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,301
They are planning
another attack.

267
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,134
We will not ignore any leads.

268
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:20,234
I have nothing to do
with these terrorists.

269
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:21,368
How did Collette Stenger

270
00:12:21,434 --> 00:12:22,334
get your name?

271
00:12:22,401 --> 00:12:23,600
I don't know.

272
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,001
My father is
the Secretary of Defense.

273
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,567
I'm an easy target.
Maybe she's trying

274
00:12:26,633 --> 00:12:28,934
to use him or embarrass him.

275
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:31,134
Is he involved?

276
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:38,900
Oh, Jack, you know him
better than that.

277
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,600
You worked with him.

278
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,867
He would never do anything
outside the law,

279
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:45,034
and neither would I.

280
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:51,600
The two men that we know
are part of the conspiracy

281
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,134
are Walt Cummings and
Christopher Henderson.

282
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,867
Have you had any
contact with these men?

283
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,234
Christopher Henderson.

284
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:01,967
I have never heard...
I'd never heard of him

285
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:03,067
before today

286
00:13:03,134 --> 00:13:05,167
and, um...

287
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:08,567
Walt Cummings I-I have met
a couple of times, yes.

288
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:11,633
Where?

289
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,967
Um, DoD briefings.

290
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,167
That's it?

291
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:15,667
Yes.

292
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,967
Are you sure?

293
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:21,368
Yes, I'm sure.

294
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:28,267
Open it.

295
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,301
The River Hotel,
Pikesville, last April.

296
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:41,267
Yeah, I'm sorry.

297
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,700
Um... We happened

298
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,134
to be there at the same time.

299
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,967
We may have had
a drink or two together.

300
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,401
You weren't having
drinks with him.

301
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:50,101
You shared a room with him.
You slept with him.

302
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,867
Yes.

303
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:01,167
I was still recovering
from losing you, Jack.

304
00:14:01,234 --> 00:14:04,800
He, uh...

305
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,834
He had just separated
from his wife,

306
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,767
and I slept with him once
and then I broke it off.

307
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,167
Why'd you break it off?

308
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,633
Jack, please, it's complicated.

309
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,234
Why did you break it off?!

310
00:14:21,034 --> 00:14:23,600
Because he wasn't you.

311
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:32,334
Why did you lie to me

312
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,001
when I asked you
the first time?

313
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,900
'Cause I, I was...

314
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:42,201
I was afraid
that you'd think less of me,

315
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:44,468
that you wouldn't
be able to forgive me.

316
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,734
Because you slept with someone
after you thought I was dead?

317
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,967
Because I slept with someone

318
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:49,700
who turned out
to be a traitor, Jack.

319
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:01,468
Is that the only time
you spent with Cummings?

320
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,334
Yes.
Did he ever
talk to you

321
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:05,368
about a terrorist attack,
nerve gas?
No.

322
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:07,533
He ever mention
Christopher Henderson?
No.

323
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,934
Damn it, Audrey!

324
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,034
Jack, I... Jack!

325
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,067
Tell me the truth!

326
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:13,067
I am telling
you the t...

327
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:14,967
You've already
lied to me once.

328
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:17,034
You tell me what you
know, or I promise you

329
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:18,533
this will become
very unpleasant.

330
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:21,001
I'm telling you
everything.

331
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,368
All right.

332
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,633
Do what you have to do.

333
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,900
Damn it, Audrey.
Tell me the truth!

334
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:34,034
Jack. I am telling you
the truth, I swear.

335
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:40,567
This is over!

336
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:42,533
You understand? This is over!

337
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,533
If you ask me,
she broke him

338
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,767
and not the
other way around.

339
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:47,767
Karen.

340
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,468
He didn't push her hard enough,

341
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,633
and you know it.
He's protecting her.

342
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,734
She's innocent.

343
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,734
We have to be certain.

344
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I am certain.

345
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,301
Jack is certain.

346
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,234
Well, I'm not.

347
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,267
Karen.

348
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:02,567
Send Burke in.

349
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:04,600
I have to do this, Bill.
I can't waste

350
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,201
any more time, and
make sure that Jack

351
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:07,434
doesn't interfere.

352
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,500
Okay, I'll pass that on.

353
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,734
Shari. That was

354
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,134
the agent
at Bierko's safe house.

355
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:19,700
The place is empty.

356
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:23,134
Forensics is still looking, but
they don't expect to find much.

357
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,434
Upload that information
onto the subnets.

358
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,234
Oh. Right.

359
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,834
I checked your file.

360
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,234
You're not qualified
for Level Three work,

361
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,167
and that is not a Three.

362
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,434
I'm provisionally qualified.

363
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,167
It's all in my
supplemental file. Go ahead

364
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,633
and check it
if you want.

365
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,267
All right, Shari.

366
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:56,101
First mistake, I yank
the provisional

367
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,267
and you're out of here.

368
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:05,734
What's with him?

369
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,434
Two years ago
we both worked

370
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,067
in the San Francisco office.

371
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,600
There was a sexual
harassment thing.

372
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:12,834
Miles?

373
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,234
It was subtle at first,

374
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,900
and then it
got really bad.

375
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,468
Finally filed
a grievance.

376
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,434
What happened?

377
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,167
He got off
with a warning.

378
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,600
These things are
really hard to prove.

379
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,834
They said we
didn't have

380
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,967
enough evidence
to go to trial.

381
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,500
I can't get
into any details.

382
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:29,633
The file is sealed.

383
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Don't worry.
I don't need details.

384
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,167
But I guess I'd better
not make any mistakes.

385
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,034
Yeah.

386
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,533
What's going on?

387
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,533
I'm sorry. This is
out of my control.

388
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,900
Karen wants
to push Audrey

389
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,101
a little harder.

390
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,834
No, her interrogation
is over.

391
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,167
Jack, I'll try to stall her
as long as I can.

392
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,734
Jack, I have orders

393
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,267
to take Miss Raines to Holding
for further interrogation.

394
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,767
I don't care about your orders.
That's not gonna happen.

395
00:17:58,301 --> 00:17:59,633
Get out of my way.

396
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:02,734
Get out of my way.

397
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:06,034
Jack, stop it!
Jack, don't make this
any harder than it is.

398
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:07,201
( taser buzzing )

399
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,867
AUDREY:
Stop it, Jack! Stop it! Jack!

400
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:11,101
Bill, do something!

401
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,134
Bill!

402
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,001
Bill!

403
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:35,000
Hello.

404
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,100
Mr. Henderson, it's Brennan.

405
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,601
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

406
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,501
No.
Explain.

407
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,467
We rolled his car, but
he survived and got away.

408
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:44,467
It was sloppy work.

409
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:45,434
We'll make it right.

410
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,701
Well, you damn well better.

411
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:47,734
You know what's at stake.

412
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:50,133
Yes, sir.

413
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,367
PALMER:
This is Wayne Palmer.

414
00:18:52,434 --> 00:18:54,434
At the tone, leave a message.

415
00:19:03,634 --> 00:19:05,434
Steve, has Wayne Palmer
come through a checkpoint

416
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,901
within the last half hour?

417
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,067
Yeah, he was cleared through
Checkpoint 6 30 minutes ago.

418
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,400
What, he's not here yet?

419
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,067
No, he's not, and I can't
reach him on his cell.

420
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,934
If you're worried, I
can send out an alert.

421
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,434
No.

422
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:19,534
Actually, he kind of wanted to
keep his visit under the radar.

423
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,234
I think I'm going to go out
there and take a look myself,

424
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,133
in case he had car trouble
or something.

425
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,100
Do me a favor.

426
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:26,901
Keep this between us,
would you?

427
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:27,901
Yes, sir.

428
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:28,968
Thanks.

429
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:36,868
Thanks.

430
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:38,601
KAREN:
You need to
calm down, Jack,

431
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,968
and remember
who's in charge.

432
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:41,434
Audrey Raines is innocent.

433
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:43,267
She slept with a known
conspirator and lied about it.

434
00:19:43,334 --> 00:19:44,300
That doesn't concern you?

435
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:45,667
She slept with him once

436
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,133
and lied about it
because she was embarrassed.

437
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,167
That hardly makes her

438
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:49,534
part of this conspiracy.

439
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,467
Why did Collette Stenger
name her as the source?

440
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:53,067
She must have gotten
Audrey's name from Henderson.

441
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:56,133
Why would Henderson want
to implicate Audrey?

442
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,667
Henderson doesn't want
to implicate Audrey.

443
00:19:58,734 --> 00:19:59,968
He's coming after me.

444
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,367
He's trying to make me
lose focus.

445
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,133
And he's trying
to pull you off target.

446
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
And he's done it.
These plans must
have been made

447
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:06,968
some time ago, when Henderson
had every reason to believe

448
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:07,968
you were gonna be killed.

449
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:09,467
Karen, listen to me.

450
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,133
This is what I do for a living.

451
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,901
And the first rule
of engagement

452
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:14,501
is that you have
a contingency plan.

453
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:17,200
And this is his,
and it's working.

454
00:20:17,267 --> 00:20:18,634
You're getting ready
to interrogate Audrey Raines

455
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,567
when you should be
interrogating Collette Stenger,

456
00:20:20,634 --> 00:20:22,834
because she still has
information that we don't have!

457
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,100
Stenger has immunity.

458
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,367
She's being protected

459
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:27,100
by a federal marshal.
That's your doing, Jack.

460
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,467
You made that deal!

461
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:30,000
I know.

462
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:31,634
But if I can prove
that Collette Stenger

463
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,100
is withholding information
from us,

464
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,400
that act alone

465
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,067
negates her deal.

466
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:37,801
I'll be able to start
questioning her again.

467
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:38,968
She will give me Henderson.

468
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,601
And once I have Henderson,
he will lead us

469
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,033
to the nerve gas,
and that's what

470
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,234
we're supposed to be
focused on!

471
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,734
What are you suggesting
we do, Jack?

472
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:50,334
Let me and Chloe find proof that
Collette Stenger is lying to us.

473
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,267
If we don't,
you lose nothing.

474
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,701
But if we do, we can
stop this thing from happening,

475
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:56,767
I promise you.

476
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,634
Karen, please.

477
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,734
Excuse me.

478
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,367
These matrix sweeps

479
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:17,133
are partials only.

480
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
Where's the rest of the data?

481
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:21,133
I thought matrix data
could be sent unfiltered.

482
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,234
That's not protocol.

483
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,767
I thought it was
all right in house.

484
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:27,501
Only if it's authorized.

485
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,501
Who authorized it?

486
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,200
I did.

487
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:31,667
She did it under
my authority.

488
00:21:31,734 --> 00:21:34,801
I take full responsibility.

489
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,534
I don't believe you.

490
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:39,033
Believe what you want.

491
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,334
That would be sloppy, O'Brian.

492
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,667
You don't work
like that.

493
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:48,434
She told you about my alleged
sexual harassment, right?

494
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,234
Well, she's lying.
Listen...
No, you listen.

495
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,767
There are 17 canisters of
nerve gas about to be deployed

496
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:56,634
somewhere in Los Angeles, and
we're trying to find them.

497
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,067
If you interrupt our work

498
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,200
one more time, I'll file
a complaint with Division.

499
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:03,367
Then you'll see what
protocol's all about.

500
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,300
Thank you.

501
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:29,968
Chloe, we need to help Audrey.
We don't have much time.

502
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:32,000
How?
We need to find
the connection

503
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:33,501
between Collette Stenger
and Henderson.

504
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,100
We found Collette's name
on Henderson's computer.

505
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,601
It's not enough.
We need proof that they had

506
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,133
direct contact,
preferably more than once.

507
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,300
You think Henderson gave
Collette Audrey's name?

508
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:44,534
I'm sure of it. I want you
to use outside agencies,

509
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:46,534
including foreign.
Put it on a priority channel.

510
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,634
I'm on it.

511
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,133
We have an
important delivery.

512
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,000
There's no delivery scheduled.

513
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:04,634
I'm gonna need to call this in.

514
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:05,701
( gunshots )

515
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,234
Stay out here
and watch the perimeter.

516
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:04,734
( indistinct conversation )

517
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,534
Who's in charge?

518
00:24:07,601 --> 00:24:08,767
I am.

519
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,200
We need access

520
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,267
to the control room.
Can you take us there?

521
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:14,067
What are you guys doing here?

522
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,200
Can you take us
to the control room?

523
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,767
Yeah. It's that way.

524
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,267
Good.

525
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:25,701
Keep cooperating and no more
of your friends will die.

526
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,300
Do you understand?
Yes.

527
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:30,033
Mikhail, take the canisters
to the main distribution tank.

528
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,734
Quickly!

529
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:38,234
( steam hissing )

530
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,767
This is it.

531
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:56,000
Don't move.
Hands away from the console.

532
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:59,400
Sam, what's going on?

533
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:02,167
Ah, Sam... I'm not an engineer,
but I know enough,

534
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,801
so you'd be wise not to try
to deceive me.

535
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:08,234
What we're doing here
is very simple.

536
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,601
We're going to release
a certain substance

537
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,901
so that it flows
into your pipelines.

538
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,300
What kind of substance?

539
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:18,033
That's not your concern.
But at the pressure

540
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,834
which currently prevails
in these pipes, the substance

541
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:22,634
will react chemically
with the gas

542
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:24,033
and become inert.

543
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,267
So I need the pressure reduced

544
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,868
by about 50%.
Sam, don't do it.

545
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,968
Do you understand what I want?

546
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,934
You want PSI cut by half.

547
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,834
Exactly.

548
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:43,801
And how long will it take?

549
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,701
Could take an hour.

550
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:49,467
You don't seem to care very much
for your friends, do you, Sam?

551
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:50,634
No, no, don't!

552
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:54,334
I might be able to do it
in 30 minutes.

553
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,334
You have 15.

554
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,667
Better get started.

555
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:28,868
PALMER:
Don't move!

556
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:33,033
Drop the gun.
Now!

557
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:39,501
Move away from it.

558
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:51,067
Now get on your knees.

559
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:55,534
Mr. Palmer.

560
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:57,967
It's Aaron.

561
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,900
Oh, God.

562
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,033
Aaron, what are you
doing out here?

563
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,434
I was looking for you, sir.

564
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,534
So are some other people.
Let's go.

565
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:12,100
( gasps )

566
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:14,067
BURKE:
Ms. Raines, we know you
conspired with Mr. Cummings.

567
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,367
I didn't.

568
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,667
Who else in the White House
was involved?

569
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:19,868
I don't know.

570
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,367
You know, Ms. Raines.

571
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:22,900
I don't have... have any names.

572
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:25,501
You're gonna
give me a name...
I swear I don't know, I...

573
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:27,501
We don't have the time,
Ms. Raines.

574
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,267
Give me a name!

575
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:31,967
I don't... I swear.
I don't know.

576
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,834
Chloe, what have you got?

577
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,567
I found some masked entries in
Collette Stenger's cell phone.

578
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:40,667
The decryption program...
Come on, Chloe.

579
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:42,868
Bottom line: Henderson placed
eight cell phone calls

580
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:45,634
to Collette Stenger
within the past three months.
Where's Collette Stenger now?

581
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,100
Holding Room 3.

582
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,768
Bill, we have a connection

583
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,000
between Henderson
and Collette Stinger.
She received eight calls

584
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:53,534
from him that she
didn't tell us about.
That voids her agreement.

585
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:55,801
It's off.
That's for
the president to decide.

586
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:58,567
Call the president!
You need a rescinding order
to question her, Jack.

587
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:00,667
Get him to back off of Audrey!

588
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,067
Get me the president.

589
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,567
What's your connection
with Christopher Henderson?

590
00:28:17,634 --> 00:28:20,267
I have an immunity agreement
signed by your president.

591
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,434
She's right.
She can't be
questioned.
We have proof

592
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,868
that she withheld information.
Her deal's been rescinded.
The order's on its way.

593
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,534
When it gets here,
she's all yours.
An innocent woman is being

594
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:30,601
interrogated because of her.
Look, I'm sorry, sir,
but  you have to go.

595
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:34,967
We know you lied to us.

596
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:37,933
We know that you did not get the
schematics from Audrey Raines.

597
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,734
Henderson told you to
use her name in case you
got in trouble, right?

598
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:47,900
You do not want to try me.

599
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,634
Yes.

600
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,033
He tell you why?

601
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:00,801
No.

602
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:02,634
He's using you.

603
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,634
He wanted you to get
inside my head.

604
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,167
It worked.

605
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:10,967
Now I'm... upset.

606
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,167
You have three seconds to
tell me where the target is,

607
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:16,801
or I will kill you.

608
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,868
Where's the target?!

609
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,100
A natural gas
distribution center.

610
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,900
There are dozens of those
in the city. Which one?

611
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:27,267
I don't know.
I swear.

612
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,534
( hammer cocking )

613
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,734
I don't know.
I don't.

614
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,967
Jack, what's going on?
Bierko's targeting

615
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:52,801
a natural gas
distribution center,
but we don't know which one.

616
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:55,401
Natural gas?
He can use it as a delivery
system for the Sentox.

617
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,768
He can get it
into people's homes.

618
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,734
I need you to get Chloe on it.
We need to find out which one.

619
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,100
Right. The rescinding
order will be here
in 15 minutes.

620
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,768
Good. Give it to the marshal.
He'll be looking for this, too.

621
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,367
Please, no more.
I'm begging you.

622
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:11,334
Please. Don't do
that. Please...

623
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:13,067
( sobbing )

624
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:15,834
Please. I'm telling
you the truth.

625
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,701
You're bringing this
on yourself.
( screams )No!

626
00:30:18,768 --> 00:30:21,134
Stop it! Make him...
This can end whenever
you want it to...

627
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,367
Let her go!

628
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:24,534
Shut it down now!
Jack!

629
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:27,634
You are finished in here.
She is innocent.

630
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,933
You can confirm it
with Buchanan.

631
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I said you're finished.

632
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:32,667
Get out!

633
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,434
Audrey, are you all right?
I don't know.

634
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:40,067
It's over.

635
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:41,933
I promise you,
it's over for good.

636
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,200
My God, what's happening to me?
What's happening?

637
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:48,033
( moans )
Henderson set you up...

638
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,868
to get at me, to throw me
off his trail.

639
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,100
Come here.

640
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,868
I'm so sorry.

641
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,734
Jack, the only thing
that got me through this...

642
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:07,334
was knowing that you would come.

643
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,534
I knew you would come.

644
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,601
I'm so sorry.

645
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,667
( sniffles )

646
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:30,200
( cell phone rings )

647
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:34,334
Bauer.

648
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:36,067
Jack, it's Bill. We need you.

649
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:38,434
Go.

650
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:40,267
Jack?

651
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:41,434
I'll be right there.

652
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,200
Yep.
Bill, I want you to send someone

653
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:46,267
over from medical
to Interrogation 1 to
tend to Audrey Raines.

654
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,300
Okay.

655
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,434
Thanks.

656
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,000
Gonna be all right?

657
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:04,834
Go. It's okay.

658
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:12,933
Our satellite covers only 60%
of the distribution centers.

659
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,601
If our target's not in that
grouping, we're out of luck.

660
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,200
Can we redirect
any other satellite?
I'm trying.

661
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:21,701
BUCHANAN:
Jack, the medic's
on the way.

662
00:32:21,768 --> 00:32:23,634
JACK:
Did you identify
the distribution center

663
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:24,933
that they're gonna hit?

664
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,967
We're pulling in
more satellites.

665
00:32:26,033 --> 00:32:27,734
Our analysts tell us

666
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:30,467
once the Sentox hits
the main tank, it goes
right into the pipes,

667
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:31,868
where it becomes impossible
to stop.

668
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,367
From there, it goes straight
into people's homes.

669
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:34,734
How many casualties
are we talking about?

670
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:36,701
The largest centers serve
90,000 people.

671
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,300
We could have twice
that many casualties.

672
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,167
If our intel is correct,
we have 15 minutes.

673
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:42,200
Okay, I'll prep a team
with Curtis. We'll go airborne.

674
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:46,234
We'll be ready as soon
as you ID a target.

675
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,334
Mr. Buchanan?

676
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,734
There may be a faster way.

677
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,567
I was a chem major
at Cal Tech.

678
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:52,701
Most toxins become inert

679
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:54,534
under high pressure.

680
00:32:54,601 --> 00:32:55,868
The PSI would have
to be lowered

681
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,167
before the nerve gas
was introduced.

682
00:32:57,234 --> 00:32:58,601
Chloe, can you monitor
the pressure levels

683
00:32:58,667 --> 00:32:59,768
at the distribution centers?

684
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:00,768
Yeah. I have citywide

685
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:01,834
readings of them all.

686
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,300
Hold on.

687
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,834
Wilshire Gas Company.

688
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,534
The PSI has dropped to 75%
in the past ten minutes.

689
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:19,434
We have to assume that's it.
I'll tell Jack.

690
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:20,567
Great work, Sherry.

691
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:22,534
Congratulations.

692
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,067
Thanks.

693
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:27,367
Did you see the way his hand
brushed across my shoulder

694
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:28,900
as he walked by?

695
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,367
What?

696
00:33:31,434 --> 00:33:33,967
That was wrong.

697
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,100
He shouldn't have done that.

698
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:00,100
( rustling )

699
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,067
What is it?

700
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:02,033
Get down!

701
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,434
Get in the car!

702
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,634
JACK:
Chloe, what's the PSI level?

703
00:35:06,701 --> 00:35:08,734
PSI level is down to 57%.

704
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,300
Another seven is all they need
to deploy the Sentox.

705
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:12,901
How long will that take?

706
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,333
Four, maybe five minutes.

707
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,767
Jack, the PSI level
can only be adjusted

708
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,500
from the main control room.

709
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:20,801
It's the large building
in the center of the complex

710
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:21,934
two floors down from the roof.

711
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:23,001
Copy that.

712
00:35:23,068 --> 00:35:25,300
Okay, we'll insert here.

713
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:26,500
We'll advance
to the control room,

714
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,101
locate and secure the canisters.

715
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,867
We're almost there.

716
00:35:29,934 --> 00:35:33,068
The noise from the plant
should cover our descent.

717
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,034
We're ready.

718
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:56,134
Good.

719
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,567
Get back here.

720
00:36:03,168 --> 00:36:05,233
How much longer?

721
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,967
A few more minutes.

722
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,534
I can't lower the pressure
any faster

723
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,967
without risking a shutdown.

724
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,001
Chloe, it's Jack.

725
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:21,400
Do you have any
heat signatures?

726
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:25,168
Yes, but I can only scan
from the exterior of the site.

727
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:26,934
There are two guards
patrolling the perimeter.

728
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,001
I've given the pilot
an approach vector

729
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:31,934
to keep you from
their line of sight.

730
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:57,500
Maintain this position!

731
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:01,934
Go!

732
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:14,867
CTU,

733
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:16,467
the team's away.

734
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,734
They're on the roof.

735
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,300
The PSI level is down

736
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,867
to 54%.

737
00:37:40,734 --> 00:37:43,267
CTU, we're inside.

738
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,267
Jack, Bierko will be ready
to deploy any minute.

739
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,333
Copy that.

740
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:18,367
( silenced gunshots )

741
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:41,667
Silencers off.

742
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:57,267
Door.

743
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:09,434
Bierko!

744
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,134
( gunshots continue )

745
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:37,600
( beep )

746
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,101
Keep moving! Cover me!

747
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,701
Curtis, the Sentox is already
in the system.

748
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:06,267
Who's in charge here?!

749
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,801
Listen to me.

750
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:09,200
You have Sentox nerve gas
running through your pipeline.

751
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:10,467
Can you shut down
the pumps?

752
00:40:10,534 --> 00:40:12,034
By the time we power down,
gas will be

753
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:13,634
in the main tanks,
then it's out into the city.

754
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:14,734
Where's the closest pipeline

755
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:16,600
that feeds those tanks?

756
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:17,934
Just out the door
to your left.

757
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,701
It'll have a red arrow
on it.

758
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:21,034
Give me the C4 and a timer,
then get these people
out of here.

759
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,600
BUCHANAN:
Jack, what are you doing?

760
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:26,300
In order to deliver the Sentox,
it had to mix with natural gas.

761
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:30,101
If we could ignite that gas
before it leaves the plant,

762
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:31,767
the Sentox will
be incinerated.

763
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:35,400
Bill, this is the last chance
we've got to stop this threat.

764
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,867
The Sentox has been in
the system for one minute.

765
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:04,867
You have 50 seconds

766
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:06,233
before it gets out.

767
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,134
Charge has been set.

768
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:27,867
Curtis, are you clear?

769
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:29,967
Just about.

770
00:41:30,034 --> 00:41:32,001
Keep going.

771
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
BUCHANAN:
Jack, are you clear?

772
00:41:36,267 --> 00:41:37,734
Jack?

773
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,500
Jack, respond.

774
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:49,434
Come on, Jack.

775
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:53,634
( loud explosions )

776
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,701
Jack, you okay?

777
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,200
Curtis, I got a visual
on Bierko.

778
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,267
Jack, you won't have time

779
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,567
before the main
tank explodes.

780
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:20,333
Right now he's our only
connection to Henderson.

781
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,068
Jack!

782
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,567
Bill, he's going in.

783
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:32,701
JACK:
Bierko!

784
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:34,901
( rumbling explosion )

785
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:36,434
( loud thud )

786
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:47,367
Jack, that's it.
The main tanks are going.

787
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,934
Get out!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
