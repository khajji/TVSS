1
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,567
Jack, this is hard for me.

2
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:23,868
The Chinese have proof

3
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:26,100
that you led the assault
on their consulate.

4
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:28,067
And now the Chinese want me.

5
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:29,300
That's right.

6
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,033
Listen to me very carefully.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,067
The man they sent to take you
into custody

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,133
has orders to kill you.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,934
Orders from who?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,801
Someone in Logan's camp.

11
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:40,100
Bill Spaulding,
Secret Service.

12
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:42,267
<i>I have orders to take</i>
<i>Jack Bauer into custody.</i>

13
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,133
<i>I intend to execute</i>
<i>those orders.</i>

14
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:48,501
Jack!

15
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,868
He's dead.

16
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,968
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:57,100
Oh, Jack!

18
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,634
Give me the epinephrine.

19
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:05,767
CHLOE:
I hope it's not too late.
He really looks dead.

20
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:07,334
Come on, Jack!

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,901
Come on, Jack, damn it!

22
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:15,567
Hey.

23
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,000
All right, Chloe, I need you

24
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:19,100
to run interference
with the local coroner.

25
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,801
Make sure
their database

26
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:22,434
synchs up with Jack's
information.

27
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,501
That won't cover the autopsy.

28
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,267
There's not going
to be an autopsy.

29
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:27,934
They wanted Jack dead,
now he's dead.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,067
Mr. President,
you saved my life.

31
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,667
PALMER:
I'm only sorry it came to this.

32
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:33,801
I just wanted to let you know
that I was out.

33
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,267
I'm glad.

34
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,667
Jack, you do understand
that when you hang up,

35
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:40,868
for all intents and purposes,

36
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,267
<i>Jack Bauer is dead.</i>

37
00:01:42,334 --> 00:01:43,934
JACK:
<i>I understand that, sir.</i>

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,367
<i>Mr. President,</i>
<i>it's been an honor.</i>

39
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:14,801
Jim Nichols!
You're on pump number one.

40
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,467
Sterling Rush, Patrick Priest.

41
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:19,868
You're on pump
number four.

42
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,868
Phil Stone,
Greg Nelson,

43
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,000
you're on pump five.

44
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:29,334
Sorry, guys, that's
all I got today.

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
Hey, Frank?

46
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:37,267
Look, I-I know
I promised

47
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:38,300
you work today,
but...

48
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,067
pump seven went
off-line last night.

49
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,601
That's all right.
I'll try again tomorrow.

50
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:43,801
Yeah, tomorrow'll
be much better.

51
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,133
See you tomorrow.

52
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,234
ANCHORMAN:
<i>The sun is shining,</i>

53
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,968
but the air is cool
at President Logan's retreat,

54
00:02:58,033 --> 00:03:00,200
where Russian President
Yuri Suvarov

55
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,300
is expected to arrive
later this morning.

56
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:05,200
Everything worked for me,
up until the chapter

57
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,601
on your first campaign.

58
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,601
I'm sorry, but I think
it's a little long-winded,

59
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,200
and I think that we can
cut that down by half.

60
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,434
You didn't hear a word
I just said, did you?

61
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,601
Yes, I was listening.

62
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,100
No, you weren't.

63
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:27,667
You're right.

64
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:29,467
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:29,534 --> 00:03:30,901
Are you okay?

66
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:33,300
I can use a break.

67
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,634
What's going on?

68
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:39,901
What do you mean?

69
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:41,400
I mean you've
been distracted

70
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:43,434
ever since you
got to Los Angeles.

71
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:45,267
I don't know, it's...

72
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:46,934
It's like you're
somewhere else.

73
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:52,834
Writing my memoirs...

74
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,801
maybe it's put me in
a melancholy mood.

75
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,467
Is that all it is?

76
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,968
Yeah.

77
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:06,767
David... I'm
your brother.

78
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:09,667
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

79
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,100
It's all right, really.

80
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,434
Okay.

81
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:20,133
Well, then let's

82
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,167
get back to work.

83
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,400
One more chapter,
and we'll take a break.

84
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:28,000
Why don't we jump down
to, um, Chapter Six?

85
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,367
There's going to be
a lot of questions

86
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,801
about your relationship
with Sherry.

87
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:37,701
David!

88
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:41,234
No, no, no, no, no...

89
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,067
Get help!

90
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,300
Stay with me.

91
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,267
Stay with me!
<i>Get help!</i>

92
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,033
Walt.

93
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,067
My chair?

94
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,167
Don't worry,
Mr. President.

95
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,567
I had it adjusted.

96
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,033
Good.
Adjusted?
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,367
What are we talking
about here?

98
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:05,934
Yuri Suvarov is
over six feet.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,601
Russian President can't be
looking down on the President

100
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,434
of the United States
when the cameras roll.

101
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:11,000
That's a risky
proposition, Walt.

102
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,200
The press finds out
about it, and...

103
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,033
They won't.

104
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,434
Don't underestimate the power
of the image, Mike.

105
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:19,133
Stalin and Churchill,
they both sat

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,601
for FDR at Yalta.

107
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,834
This is the defining moment
of my administration.

108
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:24,501
We have to make sure
that the media

109
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:25,968
presents it the right way.

110
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:28,801
( <i>phone rings</i> )
I'll get it.

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,534
Yeah, put
him through.

112
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,400
Have you checked on my wife?

113
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,133
Ah, she's still
getting ready.

114
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:38,767
She'll be fine, sir.

115
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:39,767
Hmm.

116
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:42,267
I'm in contact with Dr. Hill.

117
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:46,334
I'd feel better if you would
check on her yourself.

118
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,567
She cannot have
one of her meltdowns today.

119
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:52,467
Look...

120
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,234
you're the only one
she listens to, Walt.

121
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Yes, sir.

122
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,400
Thank you.

123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,567
Mike?

124
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,901
Mike, what is it?

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,334
David Palmer's
been assassinated.

126
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,133
What?!

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,901
It just happened.

128
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:19,868
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,267
Where?

130
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,467
In L.A.

131
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:26,868
I don't believe this.

132
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,667
Mr. President, uh, CTU is
standing by

133
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:33,934
to brief you directly.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,868
Whenever you're ready.

135
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:57,701
Make sure LAPD sets up
a hard perimeter.

136
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,100
They're sending everyone
they've got.

137
00:06:59,167 --> 00:07:00,634
Where are they
on witnesses?
Nowhere yet.

138
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:01,801
Who's running search
and sweep?

139
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,634
Secret Service, but
they're shorthanded.

140
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:04,701
Narrow the search area.

141
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:05,868
Make sure ballistics runs

142
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,200
a line-of-fire
trajectory.

143
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,300
Sir, President Logan's ready.

144
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,501
I'll call ballistics.

145
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,200
Put the President through.

146
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,133
Mr. President.

147
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,467
Bill... not to diminish

148
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:25,968
the loss that we're all
feeling right now,

149
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,934
but I'm expecting the Russian
President very soon, so...

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,100
let's say what needs to be said.

151
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,133
Of course, sir.

152
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,868
Have you arrested
the person who did this?

153
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:36,200
Not yet, sir.

154
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,868
Then what do you have?

155
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,434
Sir, the damage inflicted

156
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,300
by the single shot indicates
that President Palmer was hit

157
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:45,467
by a 308-caliber bullet
fired from an adjacent building.

158
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:48,033
We've initiated an interagency
protocol, level five...

159
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,200
Don't... don't give me
protocols, Bill.

160
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:52,601
Give me results.

161
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,634
Whoever did this, I want them
dead or in custody

162
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:55,901
by the time
the Russians get here.

163
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,367
Yes, Mr. President.

164
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:57,601
But until we know more,
I would ask that you consider

165
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,601
postponing the signing
of the treaty, sir.

166
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:05,033
No. Absolutely not.

167
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,834
Mr. President, we can't
discount the possibility

168
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,067
that this attack
is somehow connected

169
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,133
to the arms agreement.

170
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,501
A former president

171
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,434
was assassinated 15 miles
from where you are.

172
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,267
And I'm sure
I don't need to explain

173
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,834
the significance of this day.

174
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:20,367
Do you realize what kind of
political and economic capital

175
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,400
I've spent just to get
the Russians to the table?

176
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:27,100
If we call this off,
they won't come back.

177
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:38,634
Spencer?

178
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:41,701
Spencer!

179
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,300
What?

180
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,100
Get out of my bed.

181
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,133
Yeah.

182
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,701
I had a good time
last night, too.

183
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm serious.
This was a mistake.

184
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,534
Get out of here.

185
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,067
What do you mean, a mistake?

186
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,334
We had a great time.

187
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,400
I don't get involved with people
who work for me.

188
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:00,901
It's too late for that.

189
00:09:00,968 --> 00:09:02,968
I would appreciate it
if you didn't tell

190
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:04,467
everybody at work about this.

191
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,634
I don't want everyone thinking
I'm some kind of slut.

192
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:10,300
Believe me, no one's ever going
to think that.

193
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,167
What's that supposed to mean?

194
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,434
You should lighten up, you know?

195
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,501
You'll live longer.

196
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:27,467
What are you doing?

197
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,667
When you quit overanalyzing
the situation,

198
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,334
I think you're
gonna find out

199
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,367
that you and I are
pretty good together.

200
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:36,334
So I'm telling you
advce, yes.

201
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,501
Yes, what?

202
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:41,033
I'll let you buy me dinner.

203
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,767
Get me drunk.
Have your way with me.

204
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,300
Anytime you want.

205
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,033
You know, um, arrogance
doesn't turn me on.

206
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,234
I've read that some
women respond to it,

207
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,934
but I'm just letting
you know, I don't.

208
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,133
What is it?

209
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,300
President Palmer's been shot.

210
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:24,467
He's dead.

211
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,934
REPORTER:
While it remains unclear
how the assassination

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,767
will impact today's
scheduled signing

213
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,300
of the arms treaty with Russia,

214
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,567
President Logan is expected
to make a statement shortly.

215
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:40,534
Again, if you are
just joining us,

216
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:44,100
former President David Palmer
has been assassinated.

217
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,501
We're going to take
a few moments now to look

218
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:49,000
at the former president's
great achievements.

219
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,400
Who is it?

220
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,701
WOMAN:
It's me, Frank.

221
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,534
Hey.
Hey.

222
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,801
I saw your truck outside.

223
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,033
I thought you
were on today.

224
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,634
Oh, Ned didn't
need me this morning.

225
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,801
Hmm.

226
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:19,167
It's so terrible,
what happened.

227
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:25,200
Are you okay?

228
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,667
Yeah, I'm fine.

229
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,801
Come on, I'm
making breakfast.

230
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,234
Okay.

231
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:40,834
Frank's gonna
join us.

232
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,868
Great.

233
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,367
Derek, stop it.

234
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,934
Morning.

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
Morning.

236
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,367
Use a glass, please.

237
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:58,567
Here.

238
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:09,934
Excuse me.

239
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:13,167
Can I ask you something, Frank?

240
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,434
Yeah, sure.

241
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,567
That rig in Alaska you worked
on, what was that called again?

242
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:21,167
The Albatross.

243
00:12:21,234 --> 00:12:23,767
And you were thereast year?

244
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,334
Yeah, why?

245
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,334
It's funny.

246
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,667
My friend's got a brother

247
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,501
who's been working
on that rig for five years

248
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:32,234
and he's never heard
of any Frank Flynn.

249
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:36,234
It's a big platform.

250
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,133
Yeah, well, my friend's brother
says everyone knows everyone.

251
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:40,834
What is this, an interrogation?

252
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:43,501
I just don't like being lied to.

253
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,467
Derek.

254
00:12:44,534 --> 00:12:46,501
No, it's all right.

255
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,267
No one's lying to you, Derek.

256
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:54,467
When you're out there, a lot
of the guys just use nicknames.

257
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,367
DIANE:
Yeah.

258
00:12:56,434 --> 00:13:00,000
What's your friend's
brother's name?

259
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,467
Eat your breakfast.

260
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,033
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

261
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:15,200
Sorry.

262
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:17,200
He's just kind of
protective of me.

263
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:18,567
But it's the best thing

264
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:20,734
in the world for him
to have a man around here.

265
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,901
Look, what he said about me
and Alaska...

266
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:27,267
You don't owe me an explanation.

267
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:30,133
I figure if you had wanted
l me about your past

268
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,934
you would have
told me already.

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,968
I trust my instincts.

270
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,400
And I trust you.

271
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,434
Former President David Palmer

272
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:42,601
was killed
just a short while ago.

273
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,868
Now, no information

274
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,968
has been released to the public
athis time,

275
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,567
but an independent source
has verified

276
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,667
that Palmer was in Los Angeles

277
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:51,501
visiting his brother
and former White...

278
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,834
Bill will call if he
needs us, you know that.

279
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,434
No, he won't.

280
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,000
Authorities are remaining
very tightlipped

281
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,868
as the LAPD and Secret Service
seal off the area,

282
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:03,033
and there has been no word on
whether this was an accident...

283
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,300
It's not our job.

284
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:05,934
Not anymore.

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,467
This is different.

286
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,367
Come on, Michelle.

287
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:10,734
I'm just as upset
as you are.

288
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:12,300
David Palmer meant
a lot to me, too.

289
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,567
But there are other people
at CTU who can handle this.

290
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:15,667
No one who was active

291
00:14:15,734 --> 00:14:17,934
during the other attempts
onis life.

292
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,767
Tony, you and I worked up
suspect profiles.

293
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:21,901
We ran scenarios.

294
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:23,667
And theyAneth
our records on file.

295
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:25,434
They don't have
our experience.

296
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:31,534
I never once regretted
our decision to leave CTU.

297
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,334
But I don't want
to look back

298
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,868
on today and realize
I could have helped.

299
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,601
We're running a business here,
Michelle.

300
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,701
Rick Rosen is expecting us
to make a presentation

301
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:47,934
in less than an hour.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,767
You can handle the meeting
on your own.

303
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Michelle, don't do this.

304
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:18,434
It's Rick.
Leave me a message.

305
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,934
Yeah, Rick, it's Tony Almeida.

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,701
Look, I just wanted to call you
and let you know

307
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,934
that Michelle's not gonna be
able to make our meeting today.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,367
She had to go someplace.

309
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:30,067
On second thought...

310
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,501
I'm going with her.

311
00:16:12,034 --> 00:16:14,401
Did Jepson brief you
on what's happening?

312
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:16,234
Said there was
a car bombing.

313
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:17,800
Two former CTU agents were hit.

314
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,401
Yeah, their names are Michelle
Dessler and Tony Almeida.

315
00:16:20,468 --> 00:16:22,533
You knew them?

316
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,967
Yeah.

317
00:16:24,034 --> 00:16:26,167
We're data-mining
for a connection

318
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,101
between them
and President Palmer.

319
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,533
I sent the parameters
to your screen.

320
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,434
I'll get on it.

321
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:40,267
Yeah?

322
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,800
It's Edgar. Are you coming in?

323
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,001
, I just, I  paged
on a level five protocol,

324
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,401
X
of crse I'm coming in.

325
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:47,700
I wanted to give you aveeads up
before you got here.

326
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:48,700
Heads up?

327
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,567
It's bad, Chloe.

328
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,267
Yeah, President Palmer
was gunned down.

329
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,468
I'd say that's pretty bad.

330
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,134
It's not just him.

331
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:56,600
What are you talking about?

332
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:00,633
Someone planted a bomb in
Michelle Dessler's car.

333
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,034
What?

334
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:04,834
Michelle's dead.

335
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,633
He
Tony's not doing too good.

336
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,834
Doesn't make any sense.

337
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,434
They were retired.

338
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,101
Buchanan thinks it's lind
to Palmer somehow.

339
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,067
We're cross-referencing
everything we have on Palmer

340
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,700
with Tony and Michelle, to see
if we can find a connection,

341
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:20,934
anything they may
have had in common.

342
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:23,800
Chloe?

343
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,267
Go.

344
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:28,800
Chloe?
I'll call you back.

345
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:30,700
I'll call you back!
Why? Chloe?

346
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,533
Since I don't have
to go to work today,

347
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,101
I can take care of the fence
out back if you want.wa

348
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:30,301
Oh, that'd be great.

349
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,267
I can't thank you enough

350
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:34,001
for all the work
you've down around here.

351
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,368
It's t least
I could do.

352
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,001
Excuse me.

353
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:39,134
Yeah?

354
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,867
Jack, I know
this isn't protocol.

355
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,101
Please don't hang up on me.
I need your help.

356
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,334
Uh, hold on,
I can barely hear you.

357
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,368
I don't have a very
good signal.

358
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,800
Excuse me.

359
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,934
What is it?

360
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,700
They got Tony and Michelle.
Michelle is dead.

361
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:00,834
Tony is in critical
condition.

362
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,967
Now they're gonna
kill me.

363
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:03,234
What are you
talking about?

364
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:04,867
There's four people
that know you're alive.

365
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,900
Three of them are down.
Jack, I'm the only one left.

366
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,334
This has to be about you.

367
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,201
It's the only thing the four
of us have in common.

368
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,101
What happened
to Tony tod Michelle.

369
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,633
There was a car bomb.

370
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,434
X
There was a guy outside my
apartment and he was chasing me.

371
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,234
Oh, my God.

372
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:19,401
Where is he now?

373
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:20,633
I think I lost him.

374
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,767
I'm at a pay phone.
I dumped my cell phone.

375
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,267
I don't know
what to do now.

376
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:26,101
Chloe, you need to go dark.

377
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:28,900
That means zero contact
with anyone.

378
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,001
Even CTU?

379
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,334
Especially CTU.

380
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:34,234
Whoever's behind this
is probably monitori them.

381
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:37,201
Someone out ther
knows I'm still alive.
Who?

382
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:40,001
I don't know, but that's
what we need to find out.

383
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:43,001
Right now, I want you to head
north out of Los Angeles.

384
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:45,334
There's  abandoned oil
refinery at Variel and Topanga.

385
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,533
I want you to wait
for me there

386
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,934
You can take cover

387
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:50,267
by the large storage tanks
at the north end of the field.

388
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,334
You're coming to L.A.?

389
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:53,134
Give me about
a half an ho.

390
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:55,301
Okay. Thanks.

391
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,567
Tony Almeida
is being medevaced in.

392
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,401
We have a trauma team standing
by to receive him in medical.

393
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,700
You're bringing him
to CTU?

394
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,600
If there's a second
attempt on his life,

395
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,368
we can't protect him
in a hospital.

396
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:24,900
This doesn't track.

397
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,900
Michelle and Tony have been
inactive for over a year.

398
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:27,900
Who'd want them dead?

399
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:29,500
Whoever wanted Palmer dead.

400
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,500
So we're assuming
they're connected.

401
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:32,967
The timing
was too close

402
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,633
to write it off
as a coincidence.

403
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,234
There is a connection.

404
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,468
Let's find it.

405
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,567
Sir, the DOD liaison is here.

406
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:41,934
I need to set her up

407
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,734
with the security
protocols for the summit.

408
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,967
I'll take care of it.

409
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,134
You have your assignments.

410
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,934
Send updates
directly to my screen.

411
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,234
Where is she?

412
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:50,767
She just cleared security.

413
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,934
Thank you.

414
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:10,368
Audrey.
Bill.

415
00:21:10,434 --> 00:21:12,533
Must be hard for you
to be back here.

416
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Thank you, Bill. I'm fine.

417
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:18,667
I'm sorry
about Michelle.

418
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:22,134
Walt Cummings briefed me
on the way over here.

419
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,667
He said that you
wanted to postpone

420
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:24,867
the signing of
the treaty.

421
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,201
President Logan
is making a mistake.

422
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:28,834
I don't disagree.

423
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,234
Have you let him
know that?

424
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:32,633
He's the President, Bill.
It's his call.

425
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,001
That's what
I'm afraid of.

426
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,600
He wants me to make sure

427
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:39,101
that your top priority is still
security for the summit.

428
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,867
Station Five is set up for you.

429
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,334
When you're situated,
we'll go over the revised

430
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,334
security protocol.

431
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:47,600
Great.
Thank you, Bill.

432
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:56,067
David Palmer was a man
of truth and of honor.

433
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:59,301
And his influence will be felt
for generations to come.

434
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:02,567
Our nation grieves
for its loss.

435
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:06,001
Martha and I offer
our deepest sympathy.

436
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,867
You look beautiful,
Mrs. Logan.

437
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:19,434
I look like a wedding cake.

438
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,368
Les start over.

439
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,134
Oh, you can get that.

440
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:48,533
Is Mrs. Logan ready?

441
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,134
Not quite.

442
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,500
You didn't tell her
about David Palmer?

443
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:55,067
No.
Thank you.

444
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:56,967
She'll take it hard
when she finds out.

445
00:22:57,034 --> 00:22:58,600
They've been friends
for a long time.

446
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:02,201
You don't have to talk
about me like I'm not here.

447
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:03,934
Excuse us, Evelyn.

448
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:16,067
Martha...

449
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:17,500
I... I'm sorry.

450
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,468
Look, I know... I know I'm late.
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,401
I just... I'm having
a bad hair day.

452
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,134
Martha...

453
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,034
I've got som
very bad news.

454
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:29,700
But... it's not Charles,
is it?

455
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,368
No. No, he's fine.

456
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:35,134
He wanted to tell
you himself...

457
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,500
Well... what?

458
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:40,401
Walt, Walt...

459
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:43,734
well, what... what is it?

460
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:49,301
David Palmer
was assassinated.

461
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:54,334
No...

462
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:04,034
I'm sorry.

463
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:10,101
I know how close
you were.

464
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,734
When did this happen?

465
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,900
Less than an hour ago.

466
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:15,767
This morning?!

467
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:19,001
I...

468
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:30,834
I... I have to talk to Charles.

469
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:32,767
He's doing damage control,
trying to keep this

470
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,268
om pushing the treaty
off the front page.

471
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:35,734
No, no, oh, no, I have
to talk to him now.

472
00:24:35,801 --> 00:24:37,134
No. He's doing a
press conference...
No!

473
00:24:37,201 --> 00:24:38,134
Martha!

474
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:40,067
Martha!

475
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:43,168
Agent North!

476
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,134
Call John, tell him
not to let Mrs. Logan

477
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:47,534
anywhere near the stage.

478
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,201
Yeah, give me Dr. Hill.

479
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:51,734
As I look back upon the deeds
of David Palmer--

480
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:54,467
not only one of this country's
greatest leaders,

481
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,801
but one of this world's
greatest men...

482
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:03,034
Our nation grieves
for its loss...

483
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:05,234
Mrs. Logan...
Let go of me.

484
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,101
Let go of me! Let go!
I can't let you...

485
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:08,867
...to President Palmer's
entire family.

486
00:25:08,934 --> 00:25:10,234
MARTHA:
Would you get
away from me?

487
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,967
LOGAN:
And to them, I also pledge
the full resources

488
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:17,400
of this great nation
to find and to punish

489
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:20,400
those responsible.

490
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:21,867
AGENT:
No, no, no.
Get aw from me.

491
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,700
I can't let you go out there.
Don't-don't touch me.

492
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:24,700
Don't touch me.

493
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,333
Get away from me
now, or I swear

494
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,567
I will have your family
eating dog food out of a can.

495
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:29,700
Martha, stop it!

496
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:31,367
Mike, damn it, I
am the First Lady!

497
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,934
Tell your storm trooper
to stay away from me!

498
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:34,934
CUMMINGS:
Certainly.

499
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,567
I need to talk
to my husband.

500
00:25:37,634 --> 00:25:40,201
Martha, look... he's in the
middle of a press conference

501
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:42,034
right now.

502
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,367
Hundreds of
millions of people

503
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:44,467
are watching him live.

504
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:46,901
LOGAN:
...interfere with my job

505
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,333
of making this country
more secure.

506
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,367
What is it, Martha?

507
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,567
What is so urgent?

508
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,867
LOGAN:
...I have decided to keep
my scheduled meeting

509
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:55,534
with the Russian president

510
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,034
Maybe I can help.

511
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:58,300
LOGAN:
Yuri Suvarov and I will sign

512
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,834
a comprehensive treaty
that promises

513
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:02,333
a new level of cooperation

514
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,201
between us and our Russian
friends in the war on terror.

515
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:10,801
Tell Charles I want to
see him when he's done.

516
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:10,868
Don't shoot me.

517
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:12,434
What the hell
are you doing here?

518
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:13,734
I'm sorry I followed you.

519
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:16,200
I'm just... I'm just worried
about my mother.

520
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,467
Get up.

521
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:21,767
Get up. Get up!

522
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,267
Damn it!

523
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:24,934
Come here.
You're going with me.

524
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is none
of my business.

525
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:26,901
This is none of
my business.

526
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:28,434
I won't tell anyone.

527
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,167
Just let me go, okay?

528
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:32,934
I really wish
I could, kid,

529
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,067
but I can't.

530
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,267
You're going with me.

531
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:36,234
Now get in the helicopter.

532
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,467
Frank, Frank,
come on, please.

533
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,167
Get into the helicopter.
Move!

534
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,067
BESSON:
Prep a sterile
cranial field.

535
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,133
I need access to the
right hemisphere.

536
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,801
I need to talk to Tony

537
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:07,167
before he goes
into surgery.

538
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:08,567
He's non-responsive.

539
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:09,834
According to the paramedic

540
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:11,501
on the chopper, he suffered
a closed head trauma

541
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:12,868
that's affected
his speech.

542
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,367
They're going to try
to insert a stint

543
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:15,734
to relieve the pressure.

544
00:28:15,801 --> 00:28:17,000
Will he be able
to talk then?

545
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:19,067
The doctor doesn't know.

546
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,467
I want real time updates
on his progress.

547
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,834
We need Tony to
explain this.

548
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:25,834
What is it?

549
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:26,834
I may have found
a connection

550
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:28,300
between Tony and
David Palmer.

551
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:29,300
Tony's phone records?

552
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:30,534
One call in particular.

553
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:32,200
The last time Tony spoke
to President Palmer

554
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,667
was the day
that Jack Bauer was killed.

555
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:37,267
Pull the transcripts?

556
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:39,334
I tried, but the files
were corrupted.

557
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,834
What's he hiding?

558
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,000
Something about Jack's death.

559
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,167
DEREK:
<i>Are you kidnapping me?</i>

560
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:51,734
No!

561
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,133
Then where are you taking me?

562
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,667
Los Angeles.

563
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,868
Why?

564
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,834
Because I couldn't
leave you back there.

565
00:28:57,901 --> 00:29:00,067
You'd have gone to the police,
and I couldn't let that happen.

566
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,601
But what is this about?

567
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,934
Who are you?

568
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,367
Someone who's not supposed
to still be alive.

569
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:08,834
Like some kind
of witness relocation thg?

570
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:10,567
Yeah, mething lith that.

571
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,467
So you were a criminal.

572
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:15,934
No. Listen, Dere the less
you know about me, the better.

573
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,033
So what are you going
to do with me?

574
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:23,167
DIANE:
Hello?

575
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:24,867
Diane, it's me.

576
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:26,367
Frank, I can
just barely hear you.

577
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:27,367
What's that noise?

578
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,167
I'm in a helicopter with Derek.

579
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,201
Derek?

580
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:31,334
Yeah. He's fine.

581
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:32,600
Listen, Diane, I need you

582
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,067
to pick him up
hiin Los Angeles for me.

583
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:35,301
Why is he with you?

584
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:37,201
I'll explain everything
as soon as I see you.

585
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:39,700
Frank, Frank,
what are you doing with Derek?

586
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,000
Diane, please
just do this for me.

587
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:42,234
I need you to get in a car a

588
00:29:42,301 --> 00:29:43,501
and start driving now.

589
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:44,934
You're scaring me.

590
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,234
Heane, do you remember
this morning,

591
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,867
when you said
that you trusted me?

592
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:50,401
Right now, I need you
to trust me.

593
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:52,733
Derek's going to be fine.
Just do what I say.

594
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,034
I need you to get in a car

595
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,568
and start driving
towards Los Angeles.

596
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,101
Don't talk to anybody
about this.

597
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,568
And I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

598
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,334
Frank?

599
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,967
I don't understand.

600
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:08,134
You're just going to
hand me back to my mom?

601
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:10,401
I thought you were worried
about me going to the police.

602
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:12,167
I have something to do
in Los Angeles.

603
00:30:12,234 --> 00:30:14,367
Once it's done,
it doesn't matter.

604
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,600
FO
How are you doing?

605
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,733
I'm sorry, Charles.

606
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,767
I didn't mean
to make a scene.

607
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:39,067
I know that.

608
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:42,934
Dr. Hill says you haven't
been taking your medication.

609
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:46,568
I don't like the way
the pills make me feel.

610
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:49,434
Martie...

611
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:51,401
we just need to
get through today.

612
00:30:51,468 --> 00:30:53,401
Charles...

613
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:55,867
the reason that I needed to...

614
00:30:55,934 --> 00:30:57,134
eded to talk to you...

615
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:58,134
What is it, honey?

616
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:00,167
Go ahead.

617
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,367
I think...
that David was killed

618
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:05,834
because of something
he was about to tell me.

619
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,700
What are you talkiou aal?

620
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,367
He called me
yesterday.

621
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:17,633
He said he wanted
to meet with me.

622
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,367
Meet with you about what?

623
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:21,201
He said it concerned
national security,

624
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,234
and that it involved you.

625
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:25,367
Me?
Yes.

626
00:31:25,434 --> 00:31:26,900
What else did he say?

627
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:29,534
Just that he would explain
when he saw me.

628
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:32,700
If this was so important,

629
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,733
why wouldn't he have
called me himself?

630
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,534
Well, Charles, you shut him
out of this White House

631
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,568
about 18 months ago.

632
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:41,934
You know that.

633
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,501
He had no real access.

634
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:45,934
Except through you.

635
00:31:46,967 --> 00:31:48,000
You don't believe me.

636
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:49,501
I didn't s that.

637
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:51,667
You didn't need to.

638
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,501
Martha...

639
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:56,800
I am not
making this up.

640
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:58,700
I am not crazy;
I am not a fool,

641
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,167
Charles!
Martha...

642
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:01,667
it's going to
be all right.

643
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:05,867
I'm not making this up.

644
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:10,267
All right.

645
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:12,000
I'll have Walt look into it.

646
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:13,600
You will?

647
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,434
Yes.

648
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:16,434
Thank you.

649
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,267
But right now...

650
00:32:19,334 --> 00:32:22,401
President Suvarov and his wife
are arriving in one hour.

651
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:26,201
I need you to be there.

652
00:32:26,267 --> 00:32:28,967
I need you by my side.

653
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,834
I'm sorry.

654
00:32:42,067 --> 00:32:43,667
Thank you.

655
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:53,700
Was she all right?

656
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,167
No, Walt, she's
not all right.

657
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,934
She's having another one
of her delusions.

658
00:32:58,201 --> 00:32:59,501
She thinks that David
Palmer was killed

659
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:01,301
because of something he
was about to tell her.

660
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,834
She's imagining

661
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,401
she's in the middle of one
of her own conspiracy theories.

662
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,733
Well, what should we do?

663
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,234
Nothing.

664
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:29,334
Spenser, have you talked
to Chloe this morning?

665
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,800
No. Why?

666
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:33,268
She left her apartment
about a half hour ago.

667
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:35,034
She should've been here by now.

668
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,567
It's probably traffic.

669
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:37,934
She commutes
against traffic.

670
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,600
And she's not answering
her cell phone.

671
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,767
I wouldn't worry about it.

672
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:43,634
She sounded strange
when I talked to her.

673
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,234
She always sounds strange.

674
00:33:46,301 --> 00:33:49,301
I'm gonna call Adamson, have him
run a locate on her cell.

675
00:33:49,368 --> 00:33:51,600
Don't waste his time, Edgar.
She's fine.

676
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:53,734
I'm sure of it.
What makes you so sure?

677
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,600
It doesn't matter.
It does to me.

678
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,901
I saw her, okay?

679
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,001
Uh, about half an hour ago.

680
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,001
But I thought you said...

681
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,134
Forget what I said.

682
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:05,700
Where did you see her?
Man...

683
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:08,067
do you really need me
to spell it out for you?

684
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:12,867
Don't worry about Chloe.

685
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:14,533
She's fine, all right?

686
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:24,334
You can just let me out here.

687
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,667
There's nothing here.

688
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,301
Just pull over, please.

689
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:40,734
FO
I still don't
understand what this
is all about, Frank.

690
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,600
Will you please tell me
what's going on?

691
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,134
Please?

692
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:51,867
A friend of mine's
in trouble.

693
00:34:51,934 --> 00:34:53,934
I needed to pick her up
in a hurry.

694
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:56,901
This is the only way
I could get to her quick enough.

695
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,301
X FO

696
00:35:43,734 --> 00:35:44,834
HeFO
Chloe.

697
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:46,268
Jack!

698
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:49,667
Are you okay?
I'm fine!

699
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,301
What's happening?
Why would anyone

700
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:53,533
want to kill the people
who know you're alive?

701
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,667
I don't know yet,
but we're gonna find out.

702
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:58,533
Right now, I need to get access
to CTU's archives

703
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,467
from a secure location--
can you help me do that?

704
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,001
I can't do it
from my laptop.

705
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:04,268
But there's a research
loft at Cal Tech.

706
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:05,834
I can get us in.

707
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:07,368
Who's that?

708
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,600
I'll explain as soon
as we're in the car.

709
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:12,533
I don't have a car.
I took a cab.

710
00:36:14,368 --> 00:36:17,034
Come on, get in
the helicopter.
We got to go.

711
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,533
Derek, get back in.

712
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:35,700
X
( <i>tires screech</i> )

713
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,067
Jack?
What?

714
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:38,467
CHLOE:
It's them.

715
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:39,734
How did theydiind me?

716
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
I don't think
they ever lost you.

717
00:36:48,433 --> 00:36:49,533
Come on.

718
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,500
What's going on, Frank?
Who are they?

719
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:53,533
What are we waiting
for? Take off!

720
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,934
We're not at speed!pe

721
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,201
We're not gonna make it.
Get out! Get out now,

722
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:00,967
and stay by the side
of the helicopter!

723
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:23,867
Here! Take him and go
into the refinery!

724
00:37:23,934 --> 00:37:26,134
24
Find somewhere
to hide! Move!

725
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:46,534
Double back, cut him off.

726
00:37:48,034 --> 00:37:49,334
Go through the
smoke screen;
I'm going around.

727
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:27,367
Hold your fire, Chloe!

728
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,200
Jack, what are you doing?
Let's get out of here.

729
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:44,034
Chloe, take Derek
and walk away.

730
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,034
Walk away now!

731
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:01,100
At the rate you're bleeding out,
you're not gonna make it

732
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,534
unless you get
medical attention.

733
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,001
You tell me
what I want to know,

734
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,701
and I will get you
to a hospital,
you understand me?

735
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,334
Do you understand me?

736
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,834
Yeah.

737
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:11,167
Four people knew I was alive.

738
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,001
This morning,
you tried to take them out.

739
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:14,734
Why are you
coming after me?

740
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:17,534
Palmer was my...
primary target.

741
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,434
They only cared
about Palmer.

742
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,567
The others were just
a diversion...

743
00:40:21,634 --> 00:40:24,001
...to set you up,

744
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:25,867
maket look
like you did it.

745
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:28,001
Why'd they want
to kill Palmer?

746
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:30,400
To keep him from talking.

747
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:31,767
They had to
shut him up.

748
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:32,968
What'd he know?

749
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,334
HeI wasn't given
that information.

750
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,834
Only hired...
to take out the principle.

751
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,801
You're the one
that killed Palmer.

752
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:48,034
Yeah.

753
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:08,334
Who's behind this?

754
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,100
Oh...

755
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:13,367
I got my orders
through a code of silence.

756
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:15,367
We never use names,
you know that.

757
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:17,400
That's all I know.

758
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,100
Take me to a hospital.

759
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:22,367
Yeah.
