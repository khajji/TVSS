1
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:15,534
BIERKO:
<i>We release the Sentox here</i>

2
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,667
<i>and 200,000 people die.</i>

3
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:20,234
We need access to
the control room.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,434
CHLOE:
<i>Jack, Bierko will be ready</i>
<i>to deploy any minute.</i>

5
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,401
JACK:
<i>If we could ignite that gas</i>
<i>before it leaves the plant,</i>

6
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:32,734
<i>the Sentox will be incinerated.</i>

7
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:35,334
JACK:
Bierko!

8
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:43,967
Give me a hand.

9
00:00:44,033 --> 00:00:46,134
Organize an escort team.

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,667
You get him back
to CTU alive.
You got it.

11
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:50,567
I just word from the FAA

12
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,667
about a hijacking
aboard a diplomatic flight.

13
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:54,534
So, what?

14
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,367
Jack Bauer is the hijacker.

15
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:58,467
GRAHAM:
<i>What was he doing</i>
<i>on that flight?</i>

16
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,200
Looking for the recording
that implicates me

17
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,167
in David Palmer's death.

18
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:06,601
Order the plane down and grab
Bauer before he can hurt us.

19
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:09,834
We need to take him down now,
dead or alive.

20
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,334
Mr. President?

21
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:13,134
I don't care if Bauer's
making threats or not,

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,100
that plane has
to land immediately.

23
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,300
And when it lands,
I want my secret service detail

24
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,734
to take him into custody.

25
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:21,067
Sit down!
He has a gun!

26
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:23,234
Everybody just
stay in your seats!

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,200
Do what I tell you
and no one will get hurt!

28
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,367
Captain, this I Jack Bauer.

29
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,467
I'm speaking to you
on a discreet channel.

30
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,534
The person that I'm
looking for, the man
with the evidence

31
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:33,033
that I need, is
sitting next to you.

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,667
He's your copilot,
Scott Evans.

33
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:36,534
JACK ( <i>over headset</i> ):
You need to open the door.

34
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:43,367
Could you, uh, take the stick
for a second?

35
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,667
( <i>captain grunts</i> )

36
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:47,000
( <i>struggling</i> )

37
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,701
I'm the only one
who can fly this plane now!

38
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:54,300
Give me the recording.

39
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,401
Advise CTU I have the recording.

40
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,367
I'll be on the ground
in less than 15 minutes.

41
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:02,900
Bauer's got the evidence.

42
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:04,334
He is in control of the plane.

43
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,768
What do we do?

44
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,234
You are going to have to shoot
down that plane, Mr. President.

45
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,200
Otherwise, you'll go to prison

46
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:14,467
for treason and murder.

47
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:29,634
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
Sierra Tango, cleared to flight
level 2-2-0, report reaching.

48
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:33,634
5-2-0, Sierra Tango descend
to flight level 2-2-0.

49
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,834
We can expect the
approach to Van Nuys.

50
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,167
Good.

51
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,401
This is Jack Bauer.

52
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,868
Can you patch me through
to Karen Hayes?

53
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:41,167
( <i>over phone</i> ):
Hold please.

54
00:02:41,234 --> 00:02:42,267
I'm bleeding.

55
00:02:42,334 --> 00:02:43,801
I think you broke my nose.

56
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,367
You'll get medical attention
as soon as we're on the ground.

57
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:48,834
Right now, your only concern
should be flying this plane.

58
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,200
( <i>over intercom</i> ):
Miss Hayes, I've got Jack Bauer
on line one.

59
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,667
Put him through.

60
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:55,234
Yes, Jack?

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,100
I've got the recording.
It was on the copilot.

62
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,167
The copilot?
Yeah, he was
working for Henderson.

63
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,467
The captain's unconscious,
but I've secured the copilot.

64
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:03,300
We're en route
back to Van Nuys airfield.

65
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,501
What's our ETA?

66
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,167
21 minutes.

67
00:03:06,234 --> 00:03:08,267
We're going to be
on the ground in 21 minutes.

68
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:09,467
Karen, listen to me.

69
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:10,768
This recording proves
that President Logan

70
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,134
was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,334
It's imperative that we do not
let it fall into the hands

72
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,100
of anyone that is loyal
to the president.

73
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,634
As soon as we're on the ground,
I'm going to need you

74
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:21,868
to provide me with a safe
corridor back to CTU.

75
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,567
Jack, it's Bill.

76
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:25,167
I'm back here with Karen.
I'll explain everything later.

77
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:26,434
We can dispatch a team

78
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:27,667
to meet you at the airfield.

79
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:28,967
They can head off
any law enforcement,

80
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,367
take you
into protective custody.

81
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:31,434
Okay, good.

82
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,567
Bill, how is Audrey?

83
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:35,701
Curtis just brought her in.
She's in Medical

84
00:03:35,768 --> 00:03:38,000
getting treated, but it looks
like she's going to be okay.

85
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,534
Thank God.

86
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:41,701
Okay, I'll get back to you
as soon as we're

87
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,434
on final approach.
All right.

88
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:53,000
Audrey.

89
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,768
I just got off the phone
with County General.

90
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,868
I have some great news.

91
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,501
Your father
survived the crash.

92
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,167
He's alive?

93
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,734
Yeah, one of our teams
picked him up

94
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,634
about 30 minutes ago
at the accident site.

95
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,601
He's still in ICU, but they
expect him to pull through.

96
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,667
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,967
We have a team
stationed at the hospital.

98
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,667
He'll be well-protected.

99
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,334
Thank you.
( <i>phone rings</i> )

100
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,567
I have to take this.

101
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:23,067
Curtis?

102
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,033
Thank you so much.

103
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,334
You're welcome.

104
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:27,534
This is Manning.

105
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,801
Is Henderson secured?

106
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,167
He's in Holding
Room Three.
Good.

107
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,967
I need you to take a team
to pick up Jack.
Where is he?

108
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,300
He's on a plane heading towards
the Van Nuys airport.

109
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,000
ETA is 20 minutes.
Why is he on a plane?

110
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,200
He had to commandeer the plane
in order to secure the evidence

111
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,634
against President Logan.

112
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,900
I'll brief you
with the details en route.

113
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,234
Curtis, I cannot emphasize
strongly enough

114
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,667
the explosive nature of the
evidence that Jack is carrying.

115
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,900
I need you to put him
into protective custody

116
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,567
and bring him back here to CTU.

117
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,033
Understood.

118
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,267
President Logan will probably
send his men to retrieve it.

119
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,900
You've got to get
to Jack first.

120
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:01,234
We will. I'm heading out.

121
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:04,033
( <i>phone rings</i> )

122
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,734
Yes?

123
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,234
We have a solution
that will allow you

124
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,267
to order the plane shot down.

125
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:10,868
I sure as hell hope so.

126
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:13,300
I may be the president, but
there are protocols in place

127
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:14,634
that I can't
just ignore.

128
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,967
What we're proposing will
circumvent your protocols.

129
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,401
What is it?

130
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,701
We're going to simulate
a VCI distress signal.

131
00:05:20,768 --> 00:05:24,033
It'll be broadcast on the
airplane's transponder code,

132
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,534
and it will appear to come
from Bauer's flight.

133
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,401
Hold on. What is
a VCI distress signal?

134
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,234
It's an emergency signal
indicating that there's a
hijacking in progress,

135
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,033
and that the perpetrators
intend to use the
aircraft as a weapon.

136
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,734
It'll give you the
pretext to shoot it down.

137
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,834
There really is no other
legitimate response

138
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,868
to this scenario, Mr. President.

139
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:43,467
All you need to do is appear
to struggle with the ethics

140
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:46,134
and then give the order.

141
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,434
Mr. President?

142
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,267
Fine.

143
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,267
All right.

144
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:55,933
You sound reluctant.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,834
I can't believe
it's come to this.

146
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,534
I'm going to shoot
down a plane

147
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:05,933
full of innocent people.

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,467
None of us is happy
about this, Mr. President,

149
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,768
but you don't really
have a choice.

150
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:13,134
Bauer has evidence implicating
you in this conspiracy,

151
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,067
and I don't have to tell you
what the consequences will be

152
00:06:16,134 --> 00:06:19,701
for all of us
if it's released.

153
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,534
We should contact Chloe
and bring her in.

154
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,134
We're going to
want her help

155
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,334
bringing Jack
back to CTU.

156
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,167
HAYES:
Fine.

157
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:33,467
Send an escort.

158
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,367
Karen, I appreciate this.

159
00:06:35,434 --> 00:06:36,834
I know you're putting

160
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,467
everything on the line
to help us.

161
00:06:38,534 --> 00:06:40,667
All I can say is
this recording better be

162
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,834
everything Jack
claims it is.
I know Jack.

163
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,033
I don't always agree
with his methods,

164
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,834
but I trust his judgment.

165
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,367
I'll go make that call.

166
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:52,567
What's going on?

167
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:53,834
What's Buchanan doing
out of Holding?

168
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,000
The situation
has changed, Miles.

169
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,801
There's some new intel.

170
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:58,200
I haven't seen anything.
What new intel?

171
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,868
I don't have time
to explain it right now.

172
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:01,300
What does that mean?

173
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,200
It means that I'll brief you
when I've got the chance.

174
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:04,401
Have you compiled the orders
for Bierko's transfer?

175
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,167
I'm still working on them.

176
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:08,734
Let me know
when you've got them.

177
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,033
What is it, Mike?

178
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,234
A situation has come up
regarding the hijacked plane.

179
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,667
Tell me what's happening.

180
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:26,167
The FAA just picked up
a VCI distress code.

181
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:29,033
It originated
from flight ST-520.

182
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,868
What's a VCI distress code?

183
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,868
The VCI is a coding system
that was recently installed

184
00:07:33,933 --> 00:07:35,734
on all commercial airliners.

185
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:38,167
This particular code indicates
that a hijacking is underway,

186
00:07:38,234 --> 00:07:40,267
and that the plane
is going to be used

187
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,567
to target installations
on the ground.

188
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,334
Oh, my God.

189
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:45,768
Admiral Kirkland
is standing by

190
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:48,200
on video-conference
from Point Mugu.

191
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,000
He's ready to brief
you with the details.

192
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,033
Admiral Kirkland,
I'm Mike Novick.

193
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,434
I have the
President here.

194
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:01,933
Mr. President.

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,834
Admiral. Mike's told me
about this VCI signal.

196
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,401
How could it have been sent

197
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,868
without Bauer's knowledge?

198
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:10,033
Most likely, one of the pilots
under duress secretly activated

199
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,534
the transponder code.

200
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:13,033
Let me get this straight.

201
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,134
At last report, Bauer was in
the passenger cabin.

202
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,967
Does this mean that
he's now in the cockpit

203
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,534
and that he's in control
of the plane?

204
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:21,467
It appears that way, sir.

205
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,967
( <i>sighs</i> )

206
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,467
What do we do, Admiral?

207
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:27,534
Sir, the protocols for this
scenario are clearly specified.

208
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:29,701
We're compelled
to take preemptive action.

209
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:31,501
What action?

210
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,300
The aircraft must be shot down.

211
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,667
We've already scrambled an F-18
out of Point Mugu.

212
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:38,434
We just need your approval
to engage.

213
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:45,067
There are over 50 people
on that plane, Admiral.

214
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,501
We have to think of the people
on the ground, Mr. President.

215
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,933
Over 20 million citizens live
in Los Angeles County,

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,267
each one of them
is now a potential target.

217
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,334
I don't believe this.

218
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,334
Mr. President, if
I can interject.

219
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,534
Admiral, it's hard for me
to accept

220
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:01,933
that Bauer intends to use
the aircraft as a weapon

221
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,300
against civilians.

222
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,768
From my briefing document,

223
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:06,367
Jack Bauer
is a distraught individual

224
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:07,667
with a history
of erratic behavior.

225
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:10,768
Jack Bauer has spent
his entire career

226
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,234
protecting American lives.

227
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,000
I think there's a reason
he's doing what he's doing.

228
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,467
What would that be?

229
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:18,033
I don't have the answer,

230
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,033
but we should at
least try to find out.

231
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,601
We don't have the time.

232
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,601
Mr. President, we
could have the F-18

233
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,933
shadow the aircraft.

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,933
We could issue
a standing order

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,768
to fire
only if the target deviates

236
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,067
from its present course.

237
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:32,701
That's not a viable option,
Mr. President.

238
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:33,967
Why not?

239
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:35,534
Right now, that plane
is over the desert.

240
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,567
In another 15 minutes,
it'll be above Los Angeles.

241
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:39,167
If we're forced
to shoot it down then,

242
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:41,501
there'll be facing massive
casualties on the ground.

243
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,033
And, Mr. President,
we must also consider

244
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,367
the possibility
that Bauer intends to attack

245
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:46,933
the Presidential Retreat.

246
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,334
The Retreat?

247
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:49,801
You're inside the target zone,

248
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:53,200
and Bauer's already been accused
of killing one president today.

249
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:54,501
The simple fact is, sir,

250
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,000
we don't know
what his intentions are.

251
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,200
Mr. President...

252
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:58,701
Mike. Stop.

253
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:01,834
I've made my decision.

254
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,734
Admiral, I'm authorizing you
to shoot down that plane.

255
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:06,933
Yes, sir.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,033
Mr. President...

257
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,267
Mike, please.

258
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,801
Don't make this
any more difficult for me

259
00:10:12,868 --> 00:10:14,601
than it already is.

260
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,401
Miss Hayes.

261
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:26,334
This just came in
over the interagency sub-net.

262
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,300
BUCHANAN:
What is it?

263
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,567
We have to alert Jack.

264
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,234
This is Bauer.

265
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,067
Jack, air traffic control just
received a VCI distress signal

266
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,501
from your aircraft.

267
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,667
That effectively authorizes
President Logan

268
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,734
to shoot you down.

269
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,868
Shoot us down?

270
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,200
BUCHANAN:
And F-18's been scrambled

271
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:56,501
out of Point Mugu, Jack.

272
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,701
You have eight to ten minutes
at best.

273
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,501
Can you patch me through
to the pilot

274
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:00,534
of the F-18?

275
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,534
No chance.

276
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,801
They're on a coded frequency.

277
00:11:02,868 --> 00:11:04,834
We can try to get in touch
with the White House.

278
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,467
And tell them what?

279
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,367
They don't want to hear
anything I have to say.

280
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,367
Hold on.

281
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,701
We need to land this plane now.

282
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:12,134
We're 100 miles from
the nearest airport.

283
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,167
They just scrambled an F-18
to shoot us out of the sky.

284
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:15,567
We need to get
on the ground now!

285
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,933
You didn't hear me.

286
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,067
There's nowhere to land.

287
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:20,467
How much runway do you need?

288
00:11:20,534 --> 00:11:22,234
At least 5,000 feet.

289
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,401
Bill, do you hear me?

290
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,567
Yeah, Jack.

291
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,267
I need you to look
for a stretch of freeway

292
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:28,834
5,000 feet long, straight enough
for us to land on.

293
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,033
I'll pull up maps

294
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,768
in the area, Jack.
It'll take a few seconds.

295
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,300
Get back to me as soon as

296
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:34,467
you've got something.

297
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:35,801
We can't land
on the freeway.

298
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:37,100
Yes, we can.

299
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,300
It's late, there's a curfew.

300
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,501
There won't be any cars
on the freeway.

301
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,967
Cuff your right hand

302
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,834
to the flight control, now.

303
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,768
All the way.

304
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,834
Start taking us down.

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,900
Do it now.

306
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,201
What's Chloe
O'Brian doing here?

307
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,967
I don't know.

308
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,934
You can go.

309
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,167
What's going on?

310
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:33,634
An F-18's been scrambled

311
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,634
to shoot down Jack's plane.

312
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Can you open
up a socket

313
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,634
with the ATC radar
tracking plot?

314
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,967
Yeah, I think so.

315
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:41,367
Do it, Chloe.
We need to know
the exact amount of time

316
00:12:41,434 --> 00:12:43,034
Jack has before the
fighter plane reaches him.

317
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,034
Okay.

318
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,034
Karen, look at this.

319
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,634
Two possible
landing sites.

320
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,034
I think this one's
the best shot.

321
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,067
I agree.
Let's get Jack on the phone.

322
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:55,601
I need to speak with you.

323
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,234
We need to make an
emergency landing.

324
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,668
Talk to your passengers
and get them ready.

325
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,934
What's happening?
Don't worry.

326
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,434
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just get them ready.

327
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,733
Okay.

328
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,900
Listen up, everybody.

329
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,401
We're going to prepare

330
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,800
for an emergency landing.

331
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:14,934
The proper procedure...
It's Bauer.

332
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,767
Jack, it's Bill, I think
we found something.

333
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,934
Bill, hold
on one sec.

334
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,501
I want to put you
on speakerphone.

335
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:21,900
Go ahead.

336
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,334
It's a stretch
of the 118 freeway

337
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,568
between mile
marker 91 and 92.

338
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,434
There's about 4,000 feet,
then there's an overpass.

339
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,434
That's not long enough.

340
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,668
It's the best
we can do.

341
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:31,634
Copy that, Bill.

342
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,301
Hold on, give
me a second.

343
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,568
You can either try and land this
plane on the freeway or I will.

344
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:41,534
Give me the coordinates.

345
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,601
3-4-5-0.2 north

346
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:49,668
by 1-1-0-3-0.4 west.

347
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,568
We need to know
where that F-18 is.

348
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:54,467
Jack, it's Chloe.
I'm working on it.

349
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,967
CURTIS:
Manning.

350
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:57,134
We have the exact location

351
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,401
where Jack's putting down.
Go ahead.

352
00:13:58,467 --> 00:13:59,534
It's the 118 freeway

353
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:02,301
between mile markers 91 and 92.
He should be

354
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,568
on the ground
within minutes.

355
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,568
Copy. We're redirecting.

356
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:06,568
118 freeway.
Copy.

357
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:11,134
Mr. President,
we're five minutes away.

358
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,301
I'm patching us in directly
with the pilot of the F-18.

359
00:14:13,367 --> 00:14:14,833
Go ahead.

360
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,700
KIRKLAND:
<i>Bravo One, this is</i>
<i>Admiral Kirkland.</i>

361
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,134
You're on with the president
and myself.

362
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:20,534
Report status.

363
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,833
My radar is locked
onto the target.

364
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,401
Target is in a steep descent.

365
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:27,967
Maintaining radar lock-on.

366
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,234
Okay, I've got
the ATC radar plot.

367
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:33,700
Put it on the
main screen.

368
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:37,733
BUCHANAN:
Jack, the F-18
is within 15 miles.

369
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,134
They're not
gonna make it.

370
00:14:39,201 --> 00:14:40,833
He's gonna be within the
missile range in two minutes.

371
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,234
You're not
descending fast enough.

372
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:43,867
If we increase the descent
rate, we won't be able

373
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:45,334
to pull out of the dive.

374
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,767
If we don't get on the ground
before that F-18 reaches us,

375
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,934
it's not gonna
matter. Descend now!

376
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,934
( <i>people screaming</i> )

377
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,401
SUE:
Put the oxygen masks on!

378
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,800
PILOT:
Target has increased angle
and rate of descent.

379
00:15:06,867 --> 00:15:08,967
One minute from missile lock.

380
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,668
Jack, they're almost
within weapons range.

381
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,100
The aircraft
can't take this.

382
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,134
I have to pull up.

383
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,267
Not yet!

384
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,434
I can see the freeway!

385
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,434
Come on.

386
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,434
Okay, level up now! Now!

387
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,100
We can't pull out of the dive!

388
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:49,767
I need your help! Pull!

389
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:53,334
( <i>alarm sounding</i> )

390
00:15:53,401 --> 00:15:55,367
Ground proximity alert.

391
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:59,334
20 seconds to missile lock.

392
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:02,601
Target's at 1,000 feet
and leveling.

393
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:03,634
Leveling?

394
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,034
PILOT:
Affirmative, sir.

395
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,067
What does that mean?

396
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:08,434
Target may be preparing to land.

397
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,634
The objective seems to be
the 118 freeway.

398
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,434
Lower the landing gear!

399
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:18,767
We're going too fast!

400
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,800
Lower it!

401
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:25,900
He's lowering his landing gear.

402
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:29,134
The F-18's in range.

403
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,668
I have missile lock.

404
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,568
KIRKLAND:
The aircraft is in
a landing profile, sir.

405
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:37,568
I recommend we abort.

406
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

407
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,034
The parameters
have changed, sir.

408
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,501
I want that plane shot down!

409
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,900
Sir...
Order your man to fire, now!

410
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,234
Mr. President!

411
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,167
Admiral Kirkland is right.

412
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:48,668
The aircraft's not a threat.

413
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,201
There's no reason to do this.

414
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,733
I implore you to reconsider.

415
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,867
Abort.

416
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:03,900
Yes, sir.

417
00:17:03,967 --> 00:17:05,167
But if they
don't land,

418
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,501
I want you to shoot that
plane down immediately!

419
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,534
Yes, Mr. President.

420
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,700
Bravo One, hold fire.

421
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:11,733
I repeat, hold fire.

422
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,000
Copy, base.
Bravo One holding fire.

423
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,634
We have Marine units
deployed in the area.

424
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,501
I want them to cordon off
the landing site

425
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:18,568
and apprehend Jack Bauer.

426
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:20,467
Yes, sir.

427
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:26,000
500 feet!

428
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:28,534
We're not gonna make it.

429
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,601
Come on.

430
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,568
CTU.

431
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:39,568
We've spotted the plane.

432
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:40,934
They're coming in for a landing.

433
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,434
We're heading towards them now.

434
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,201
I'm handing the controls
back to you!

435
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,867
Touch it down!

436
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:48,334
We're still going too fast!

437
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,401
Touch it down!

438
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,934
( <i>people screaming</i> )

439
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,401
Target has touched down.

440
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:02,800
I'm clear.
Returning to base.

441
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:29,134
Bill, we made it.

442
00:18:29,201 --> 00:18:31,167
We're down on the ground.

443
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:32,800
Jack, we've redirected Curtis
to your location.

444
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:34,434
He should be there
in a few minutes.

445
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,867
I'm just east
of the Balboa overpass.

446
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:37,100
Have him meet me there.

447
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,700
Send a secondary team
to pick up the copilot

448
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,167
and EMTs for the pilot.

449
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:43,000
Got it.
Get out of there, Jack!

450
00:18:49,634 --> 00:18:51,401
Everyone, keep moving

451
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:52,733
to the rear
of the plane!

452
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,833
Exit from the rear, now!

453
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,134
You should have followed
through, Mr. President.

454
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,767
You should have ordered
that pilot to fire.

455
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,000
They were landing on a freeway.

456
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,000
I had no pretext
to shoot them down.

457
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,401
I had to abort.

458
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:33,700
It's going to be much harder

459
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:34,934
to contain now,
if not impossible.

460
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,934
Bauer's on the ground.

461
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,034
He won't get far.

462
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,634
Even before
the plane touched down,

463
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,267
I ordered two battalions
of Marines into the area.

464
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,934
They're cordoning off the
landing site, even as we speak.

465
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,367
Bauer...

466
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:48,634
has nowhere to run.

467
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
I hope you're right,
Mr. President.

468
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:51,733
This is our last chance.

469
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,733
If Bauer gets through...

470
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,401
I know.

471
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,467
I know what's at stake, Graham.

472
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,867
I'll get back to you
as soon as I have any news.

473
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:12,367

Yeah.

477

Curtis, it's Jack!

478
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,367
Go ahead.
The Marines are moving in.

479
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,800
They're setting up a perimeter.
Where are you?

480
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,201
We're approaching your position
from the north.

481
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:34,534
Okay, I got you.

482
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,367
I'll meet you on the north side
of the freeway.

483
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,601
( <i>garbled radio transmission</i> )

484
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,501
They know I'm
still in the area.

485
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,534
We got to get
out of here.
Head south on Variel. Move.

486
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,234
Damn it.

487
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,167
You're gonna have to try
and talk your way

488
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,601
through the roadblock.

489
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:18,733
Get your hands up!

490
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:25,234
Hands where
we can see them.

491
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:26,700
We're federal agents.

492
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,900
Los Angeles

493
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:30,034
Counter Terrorist Unit.

494
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
We've been given orders
to detain everybody inside

495
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,568
this perimeter.
We're all on

496
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:34,833
the same team here, Commander.

497
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,501
We're trying to
apprehend the suspect

498
00:21:36,568 --> 00:21:37,934
who hijacked that plane.

499
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,167
Jack Bauer?
That's right.

500
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,467
Now, let us
do our job.

501
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:41,668
I need to see individual ID's.

502
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:42,867
I'm gonna call this in.

503
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,100
We don't have time
for this, Commander.

504
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,568
The longer we sit here,
the better chance

505
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:46,833
Bauer has of slipping
through the net.

506
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,100
This will only take
a few minutes.

507
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,634
A few minutes is all Bauer needs
to escape.

508
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,501
We're not prepared
to let that happen.

509
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:53,733
Now we're moving out.

510
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
If you really want to fire
on federal agents,

511
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:58,134
that's your call.

512
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:01,700
Stand down.

513
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:05,301
Move out.

514
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,501
Stand down!

515
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:18,934
Head east for a while,
then turn south.

516
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,100
Yes, sir.

517
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,301
Buchanan.

518
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:23,534
It's Curtis.
We've got Jack,

519
00:22:23,601 --> 00:22:25,401
and we're headed back in.
Okay, Curtis.

520
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:26,601
Marines are all over the place.

521
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:28,234
Barely got past one
of the patrols.

522
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:30,267
They must be taking
direct orders from Logan.

523
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:31,434
There's no other explanation.

524
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,601
We can't take the
chance of running

525
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:33,833
into any more
of these patrols.

526
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,067
We'll stick to
the back streets.

527
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:35,900
Understood.

528
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:38,767
( <i>phone rings</i> )

529
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,067
Hayes.

530
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:41,967
MILES:
I want to know what's going on.

531
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,934
Miles, I told you
I would tell you

532
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,434
when I felt the
time was right.

533
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,067
I'm sitting here
watching you work

534
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,534
with two people under arrest

535
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,668
for aiding and abetting
a federal fugitive.

536
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,534
If you don't talk to me,

537
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:54,767
I'll have to get my answers
somewhere else.

538
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,934
I'll be right there.

539
00:22:58,334 --> 00:23:00,833
You can't tell him.

540
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,634
I can't hold him
off any longer.

541
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,833
You really think
that's a good idea?

542
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:06,934
I have to trust him.

543
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,867
He's been nothing but loyal.

544
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,434
I probably shouldn't have

545
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:12,800
kept him in the
dark this long.

546
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,867
I'll be right back.

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,733
I don't appreciate
being threatened, Miles.

548
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,900
And I don't appreciate
being shut out.

549
00:23:34,568 --> 00:23:37,134
We've worked a lot
of years together, Karen,

550
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:38,467
and I have never wavered

551
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:41,568
in my allegiance.

552
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:43,833
I don't deserve this.

553
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,900
No, you don't.

554
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:52,767
Come with me.

555
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,767
Jack Bauer's
acquired evidence

556
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,234
implicating President Logan
in David Palmer's death.

557
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:16,334
Have you seen this evidence?

558
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,034
No, but Bauer's bringing it
here now.

559
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,401
What is it?

560
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,334
It's a recording
of a conversation

561
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:22,900
between the president
and an accomplice.

562
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:24,234
But you haven't heard it?
No.

563
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:25,301
And that's what you're doing

564
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,967
with Buchanan and O'Brian?

565
00:24:27,034 --> 00:24:28,767
Covertly helping Bauer?

566
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,367
Yes.

567
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:32,301
For the past
three hours,

568
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,534
President Logan has done
everything in his power

569
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:36,601
to keep Jack from
getting back here alive.

570
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:39,234
You're working against the most
powerful man in the world,

571
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:40,867
and you haven't actually heard
the evidence.

572
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:43,034
This is why I didn't
talk to you, Miles.

573
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,534
Because you knew
I'd talk you out of it.
Yes, I know

574
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:46,700
what I'm doing is risky.

575
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,568
If I am wrong,
my career is over.

576
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,900
I could be brought
up on charges.
Not just your career, Karen.

577
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,234
I am doing this because
I believe

578
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:53,401
that Bauer is telling the truth.

579
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:54,568
But you don't know.

580
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:56,800
Okay, okay.

581
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:59,767
Let's say he is.

582
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,634
Let's say that recording
implicates Logan.

583
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,634
Then what are you going to do?

584
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,668
Are you going to arrest

585
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:09,000
the President
of the United States?

586
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:11,134
That will be up
to the attorney general.

587
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,134
You're depending on...

588
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,967
I'm sorry
to interrupt.
Yes.

589
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,134
They're ready
to move Bierko.

590
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,867
Thank you.
I'll be right out.

591
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:24,267
Look, I have to go over
the transfer protocols.

592
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,568
I know that what I'm asking
from you is difficult.

593
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Everything rests with
what's on that recording.

594
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,934
Tell me what you need.

595
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,267
Bauer will be here any minute.

596
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:40,100
The best way for you to help
me is to go back out there

597
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,601
and keep things
running smoothly.

598
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:43,134
All right.
Miles?

599
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:46,334
It's imperative
this stay between us.

600
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:47,568
Of course.

601
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:49,700
Thank you.

602
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,334
Thank you.

603
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:14,668
We have a full

604
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:16,434
tactical complement,
enhanced ordinance package,

605
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:18,733
two vehicle escort.

606
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:23,401
Vladimir Bierko,
you're being transferred

607
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:28,367
to a primary holding facility
at our district headquarters.

608
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:31,100
Let me know the second
he arrives.

609
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:33,034
Understood. Let's move out.

610
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,666
Where the hell is Mike Novick?

611
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:44,300
SECRETARY:
He's moments away, sir.

612
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:46,533
You told me that
three minutes ago.

613
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,533
Yes, sir.

614
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,466
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

615
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:54,600
I was on the phone
with Colonel Owens.

616
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:56,566
He's the Marine
field commander on the site.

617
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,733
Is Bauer in custody?

618
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,867
No, sir.

619
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,133
What happened?

620
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,167
As ordered, the Marines
sealed off a one-mile radius

621
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:04,334
around the landing site.

622
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,033
They've completed a sweep
of the area.

623
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,200
And?

624
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:11,234
And it's Colonel Owens'
estimation

625
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,600
that Bauer is no longer inside

626
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,466
the perimeter.

627
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:18,033
He got away.

628
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,200
It appears so, sir.

629
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,833
I can't believe this.

630
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,733
Uh, Mr. President,
it's only a matter of time

631
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,433
before Bauer's apprehended.

632
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:46,499
Sir, are you all right?

633
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,900
Thank you, Mike.

634
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:05,167
I need some
time alone now.

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,366
to his office
right now.

641
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,000
He'll be ready for
a video conference

642
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,033
in ten minutes.

643

Okay, good.

00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:08,399
Chloe, I want you to prepare
the recording for playback.

645
00:30:08,466 --> 00:30:11,133
I want you to clean
it up and apply a
digital signature so

646
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,867
that we can establish
a chain of evidence.

647
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:15,366
Okay.
You need to work alone.

648
00:30:15,433 --> 00:30:17,234
I don't want anyone else
near that recording.

649
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,867
You don't ever let
it out of your sight.
I won't.

650
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,366
You said I had ten minutes.

651
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:22,666
I'd like to see Audrey.

652
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:24,334
Of course.
She's in Medical.

653
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:27,200
Thank you.

654
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,433
Well, when will I be able
to speak with him?

655
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,366
All right, I understand.

656
00:30:37,433 --> 00:30:39,633
Well, just let him know...

657
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,200
Can you please tell him
that his daughter called

658
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:46,933
and that...

659
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
she loves him very much.

660
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,466
Thank you.

661
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,399
It looks like
my dad's gonna be all right.

662
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,533
Yeah, I know, I heard.

663
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:01,766
Oh, God, I'm so glad to see you.

664
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,867
Me, too.

665
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:14,300
We did it.

666
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,499
We got the evidence.

667
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,766
Oh.

668
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,566
The attorney general's
going to hear it.

669
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:19,900
So it's over?

670
00:31:19,967 --> 00:31:22,466
Yeah.

671
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,433
President Logan's going to pay

672
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,833
for David Palmer's
assassination.

673
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:30,833
Thank you.

674
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,433
Close your eyes.

675
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,833
I'm going to sit with
you for a minute.

676
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:34,933
( <i>phone rings</i> )

677
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,234
Yes.

678
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,867
LOGAN:
Graham.

679
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:39,466
I've been trying to reach you.

680
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:40,867
I know.

681
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,334
Bauer slipped
through the cordon,

682
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,366
didn't he?
Yes.

683
00:32:44,433 --> 00:32:47,800
I've just been told that
the attorney general's office

684
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:51,399
received a phone call
from the director of CTU.

685
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:53,700
I think it's
fairly obvious

686
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:55,867
they're in possession
of the recording.

687
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:59,533
I think that phone
call was about you.

688
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,933
I didn't expect
it would to happen so soon.

689
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,733
I am sorry, Charles.

690
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,234
You don't
deserve this.

691
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,167
Listen, Graham, despite
how things turned out...

692
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,334
...I still believe that
we were in the right.

693
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,733
I still believe
that we acted

694
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,200
in the best interest
of the country.

695
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:20,466
And we have to keep
putting the country's well-being

696
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:21,900
ahead of our own.

697
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:25,900
The spectacle of a sitting
president on trial for murder

698
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,433
would be devastating.

699
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:31,000
Yes. Yes, it would.

700
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,833
Aside from the psychological
damage to the country,

701
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,533
a trial would expose
certain realities

702
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,366
that should never
see the light of day.

703
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,600
If only we could keep
such a trial from taking place.

704
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,733
That thought occurred to me,
as well.

705
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,466
I'm glad we agree.

706
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,733
I want you to know
I've taken steps to ensure

707
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,666
that you and your associates

708
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,334
won't be implicated
in any of this.

709
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,967
I appreciate that, Charles.

710
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:02,466
We all do.

711
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,867
There's nothing more to say.

712
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,766
I'm going to hang up now.

713
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:17,466
There are, uh, a few things I'd
like to take care of before...

714
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,533
Good-bye, Charles.

715
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:25,334
Good-bye, Graham.

716
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:07,599
Martha, may I come in?

717
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:11,866
Now you want to talk?

718
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:13,332
Marti, please?

719
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,532
What do you want?

720
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:31,465
Is there something else
you want to confess?

721
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,899
No.

722
00:35:46,899 --> 00:35:49,699
I want to tell you
how sorry I am...

723
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:52,699
for everything.

724
00:35:58,799 --> 00:36:03,365
When you forget to give me
something for my birthday,

725
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:05,899
that's when you
say you're sorry.

726
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,266
I know what I did was wrong.

727
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:11,266
It was horribly wrong
and unforgivable.

728
00:36:11,332 --> 00:36:14,999
I know that.

729
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:20,732
But what I can't live with
is the fact that I hurt you.

730
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:23,300
That's the last thing
I wanted to do.

731
00:36:27,866 --> 00:36:30,200
Marti?

732
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:35,465
Marti, please.

733
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:37,732
That's the truth.

734
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,766
The truth.

735
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,833
( <i>sniffles</i> )

736
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,465
You know what really
gets me, Charles?

737
00:36:53,532 --> 00:36:55,566
What?

738
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:58,566
That you had me
going for so long.

739
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:05,066
I had no idea you
were such a good liar.

740
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:08,432
If I wasn't so horrified by the
fact that I'm married to you,

741
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:12,432
I might actually be impressed.

Yes.

SECRETARY:
I have an urgent call
for you, sir.

748
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:34,866
He says his name
is Miles Papazian from CTU.

749
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:37,099
I don't want to talk
to anyone from CTU.

750
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,233
He insists that you'll want
to speak to him.

751
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,566
He says it's about Jack Bauer.

752
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,365
Put him through.

753
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,365
You're on with the President.

754
00:39:54,432 --> 00:39:56,732
MILES:
Mr. President?

755
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,266
Yes, go ahead.

756
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:00,599
You don't know me;
my name is Miles Papazian.

757
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,233
I work under Karen Hayes.

758
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,933
What is this about?

759
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:06,233
It's about a recording, sir,

760
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,899
that Jack Bauer
has just delivered here to CTU.

761
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:14,666
Sir, my understanding is
it's a recording

762
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:17,465
of a conversation of yours
that, if leaked,

763
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:22,133
could significantly compromise
national security.

764
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,933
Go on.

765
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,966
My superior, Ms. Hayes,

766
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:29,233
is working with Bauer
and Bill Buchanan.

767
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,966
Their intention
is to play the recording

768
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,732
for the attorney general.

769
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,599
Why are you telling me this?

770
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:42,632
Because, sir...
I feel compelled to intervene.

771
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:48,332
And I just I wanted to make sure
that you would approve.

772
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:57,066
I do, Mr. Papazian,
I do approve.

773
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,666
Listen, I'm going to text you...
my private number.

774
00:41:04,732 --> 00:41:07,666
Let me know how it goes.

775
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,933
And, Miles...

776
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:13,732
...I promise you,
I won't forget this.

777
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:16,099
Thank you, sir.

778
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:18,066
That's all I wanted to hear.

779
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:23,699
Mr. President, I look forward
to speaking with you again soon.

Karen wants to
know how long

782
00:42:04,432 --> 00:42:06,200
before the
teleconference starts?

783
00:42:06,266 --> 00:42:08,532
Five minutes--
get out of here, Miles.

784
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,532
We'll be ready?

785
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,300
Not if you keep
interrupting me.

786
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:13,666
I'm just doing my job, Chloe.

787
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:15,200
Well, if your job

788
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,933
is to slow things down, then
you're doing really good work.

789
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:19,866
I'll tell Karen
you'll be ready.

790
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:22,033
Thanks.
