1
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:14,767
As soon as I get the recording,

2
00:00:14,834 --> 00:00:16,133
we're going to have
to involve your father.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,701
You know I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

4
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,567
Tell me what this is all about.

5
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,601
I will. I just
need a minute.

6
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,334
I decide what needs
to be done, Mr. Anderson.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,901
I never authorized you
to kill David Palmer.

8
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:29,034
President Logan?

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,001
And a man named
Christopher Henderson.

10
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:33,500
I know what you did.
I know what you're doing.

11
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,334
And I'm going
to put an end to it.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,801
You asked to see me,
Mr. President?

13
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,801
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller

14
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:40,133
to tender his resignation

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,667
and I wanted you
here as a witness.
What?!

16
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:44,334
He came here to accuse me
of being complicit

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,467
in today's
terrorist attacks.

18
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:47,701
Miles set me up.

19
00:00:47,767 --> 00:00:49,701
Please come with us,
Ms. O'Brian.

20
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,001
We traced your call

21
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,233
to a public phone
at Van Nuys Airport.

22
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,001
If Audrey Raines is
at that location,

23
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,167
you're in a lot of trouble.

24
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:01,200
You're supposed
to be in custody.

25
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:04,233
You helped Audrey Raines
break surveillance.

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,034
You're sick and you need help
and if you try to stop me,

27
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,167
I will recommend you for
psychiatric evaluation.

28
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:12,734
I haven't been able
to contact Jack or Audrey.

29
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:14,601
I haven't talked
to them either.

30
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,367
Whatever you tell me will remain
between the two of us.

31
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:19,200
I promise you.

32
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:20,934
Not here.

33
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,934
Outside the south stable.

34
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,901
Is Bauer dead?

35
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:26,467
Not yet, Mr. President.

36
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:28,601
He has the recording.
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:30,567
That evidence directly
implicates me

38
00:01:30,634 --> 00:01:32,567
in David Palmer's death.

39
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,001
Son of a bitch.

40
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:35,334
What the hell's going on?!

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,601
They've come
for the recording.

42
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:48,133
Audrey!

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,267
I have her, Jack!

44
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:52,200
JACK:
What have you done to her?

45
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,934
The left
brachial artery.

46
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,300
She has about three minutes
before she bleeds to death.

47
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,701
Now throw me
that recording.

48
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,734
Jack, don't do it.

49
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:02,567
She's running out of time.

50
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,901
AUDREY:
Don't give it up.
Here it is.

51
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,068
Stay with me.

52
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,100
Stay with me.

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,434
( <i>panting</i> )

54
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:32,133
I need to loosen
the tourniquet.

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,233
Oh! Ooh!

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,601
Good. The bleeding's stopped,
which means he didn't sever

57
00:02:36,667 --> 00:02:37,867
the brachial artery.

58
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:39,801
I need to get you
to a doctor.
Jack,

59
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,601
I can wait.
Do what you have to do.

60
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,734
Are you sure?
Yes.

61
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:45,367
Keep your arm
elevated.

62
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:46,734

( <i>touch tone beeping</i> )

64
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,801
FEMALE VOICE:
Chloe O'Brian is not available.

65
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,801
Chloe's not picking
up her phone.

66
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:56,601
Is there someone else who can
help you track Henderson?

67
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:59,801
No one who has the same access
to the CTU satellite network.

68
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,601
Jack, I'm so sorry.
This is my fault.

69
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,734
Audrey, stop it.

70
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,034
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

71
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,367
I'll be right back.

72
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:10,701
( <i>ringing continues</i> )

73
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,467
This is Jack Bauer.

74
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,601
Jack?

75
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,834
Why are you answering
Wexler's phone?

76
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:26,400
Wexler's dead.

77
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,801
Henderson and a commando unit
attacked us 15 minutes ago.

78
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,801
They killed all your men and
took the recording back.

79
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,001
Is Audrey all right?

80
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:34,167
She's fine.

81
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,801
Did you cut your
deal with Logan?

82
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:38,133
Logan accepted my terms.

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,367
Then he took a call,
and suddenly changed his mind.

84
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:42,767
That call must have come
from Henderson.

85
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,367
Jack, we have to get
the recording back.

86
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:47,701
If there's anything I can do
to help, let me know.

87
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,133
With all due respect,
Mr. Secretary,

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,500
I asked you for your help,
and you betrayed me.

89
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:55,334
Jack, I did what I thought
was best for this country.

90
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,867
I made a mistake.

91
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:58,701
Please forgive me.

92
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,534
I need to go, sir.

93
00:04:04,434 --> 00:04:06,567

( <i>phone ringing</i> )

96
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:12,934
Hello?

97
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:14,133
Bill, it's Jack.

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,934
Jack, we've been waiting
to hear from you.

99
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,767
Did you get the recording
to Secretary Heller?

100
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,200
I don't have
time to explain.

101
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:20,734
Henderson's got
the recording.
I need Chloe

102
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,901
to help me find him,
but I can't reach her.

103
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,100
Chloe's here
with me, Jack.

104
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,534
She was arrested
by Homeland Security

105
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,367
for helping you, but
she managed to get away.

106
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,367
Put her on speaker.

107
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,567
Jack, where are you?

108
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:32,133
I'm at Van Nuys Airfield.

109
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,867
Chloe, listen to me.
Henderson left here

110
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:36,400
ten minutes ago with a recording
that implicates President Logan.

111
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,734
I need you to access CTU's
satellite data streams

112
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:39,968
so that we can find him.

113
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,334
If I log onto their system,

114
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,200
they're gonna find me
eventually, no matter what I do.

115
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:44,667
I don't need you
to track him for long.

116
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:46,068
Do you think you can do it?

117
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,068
I guess I can try
to slip in through the subnets.

118
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,634
Get back to me when you're in.

119
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:52,734
I'll set up a VPN pathway, so
that they can't trace our call,

120
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,133
but it will only work
with the phone you're using.

121
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,701
Okay. I got a hold
of Chloe. We need to go.

122
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:58,901
Okay.
Can you get up?

123
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:00,133
Yeah.
Slowly.

124
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,267
( <i>groans</i> )

125
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,400
Come on.

126
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,068
If we're going to do
extensive satellite tracking,

127
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,601
I need more
than my laptop.

128
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm gonna have to network
onto your computer, even though

129
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,001
it's kind of pathetic, and

130
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:14,667
I need you to get that screen
to work for me.
All right.

131
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:16,867
I hope you don't mind me
bossing you around,

132
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:18,834
but technically,
I don't work for you anymore.

133
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,734
That's all right, Chloe.
Good.

Bauer.

138
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,534
Jack, I'm pulling up
satellite footage

139
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:34,734
of the airfield
from 15 minutes ago.

140
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,667
Look for an explosion
in the northwest corner.

141
00:05:36,734 --> 00:05:37,667
Okay, I see it.

142
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:38,701
About five minutes after that,

143
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:39,701
a vehicle leaves the airfield.

144
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,034
That'll be Henderson.

145
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,100
He went south
on the service drive, and east

146
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,233
on Menders, then I lose him
on the grid.

147
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,467
Use another satellite,
traffic cams,

148
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:48,167
whatever you have to,
just find him.

149
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,534
It's gonna take us
a few minutes.

150
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:51,367
We're just setting up,
but we're on it.
Copy that.

151
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,801
Get back to me as soon
as you got him on a live feed.

What makes you think that

156
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,068
Henderson hasn't already

157
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15,467
destroyed the recording?

158
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:17,601
He would have done it
immediately, in front of me.

159
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,734
Given me less of a reason
to come after him.

160
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,334
Why would he keep it?

161
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,100
It's his insurance.

163
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,867
Yes.

164
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:31,001
Is Bauer dead?

165
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,200
No.

166
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,233
What happened?

167
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,334
All that matters is

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,100
that I have the recording.

169
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,667
Have you destroyed it?

170
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:40,001
No, sir, I have not.

171
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:41,734
Why, what's the problem?

172
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,367
Actually, I'm making sure
they're won't <i>be</i> any problems.

173
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:45,567
I don't understand.

174
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:47,068
I may need protection.

175
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,534
That recording
gives it to me.

176
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:49,901
Protection?

177
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,734
Yes, sir.

178
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,267
Do you mean from me?

179
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,567
That's absurd.

180
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:57,701
With all due respect,
Mr. President,

181
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:01,534
it isn't absurd, as evidenced
by Walt Cummings suicide.

182
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:03,734
That was different.

183
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:07,867
You told me yourself
that was necessary.

184
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,334
And I'm assuming
that one day,

185
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,867
others will tell you
the very same thing about me.

186
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,867
Chris,

187
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,334
you and I have been in
this from the beginning.

188
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
Destroying
that recording

189
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:19,734
protects both of us.

190
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:22,034
I'm sorry,
Mr. President.

191
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,801
I give you my word it will be
kept in a very place safe,

192
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:26,968
and will only be made public
should I meet

193
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:29,300
with some... accident.

194
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,400
Chris, this is completely
unnecessary.

195
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:33,167
I'm sure it is, sir.

196
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:37,801
Then again,
I am a very cautious man.

197
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:46,734
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

198
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,167
Chloe, have you
got Henderson yet?

199
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,567
Yes, his car is
three quarters

200
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,867
of a mile in
front of you.
He had a head start.

201
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:53,434
He should be farther
along than that.

202
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,968
I don't know
what to tell you.

203
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:56,601
It's definitely the car
he left the airport in.

204
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:57,901
How long until
I've got a visual?

205
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,367
The road curves up
ahead, Jack.

206
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:01,267
You should be able to see him
once it straightens out.

207
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:03,367
Hold on.

208
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:12,801
( <i>tires squealing</i> )

209
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,634
Got him.

( <i>tires squealing</i> )

215
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,001
Get down.

216
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:00,300
( <i>chamber clicks empty</i> )

217
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,334
Damn!

218
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,267
It's over, Christopher.

219
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:16,834
Turn around!

220
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:22,634
Put the gun down and keep
your hands where I can them.

221
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,934
Do it or I will kill you!

222
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,968
You kill me, Jack,
Secretary Heller dies, too.

223
00:09:31,034 --> 00:09:32,367
What are you talking about?

224
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:35,434
There's always a contingency
plan, Jack. You know that.

225
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,934
My men have been tracking Heller
from a chopper ever since

226
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,567
he left Logan's Retreat.

227
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:43,034
Now, if I can't
contact them

228
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,667
every 15 minutes on the dot,

229
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,834
they have orders
to kill Secretary Heller.

230
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:48,034
Which means,
you got about

231
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,200
three minutes to save his life.

232
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:51,334
Jack?

233
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,167
Audrey, please get back
in the car.

234
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,901
Is he lying about my father?

235
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,068
Slowly walk towards me.

236
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,200
Put your hands
behind your head.

237
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:08,601
Get on your knees.

238
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:09,734
Cuff yourself.

239
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,467
( <i>touch tones beeping</i> )

240
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah, Jack.

241
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,901
Chloe, patch me through to
Secretary Heller's cell phone.

242
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:24,467
See if you can get a satellite
to lock on his signal.

243
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:27,400
I need you to download a visual
of his vehicle on my PDA.

244
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:30,367
He was leaving Logan's retreat
just before 1:00.

245
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:32,767
On it. Open up the parallel
channel on the NSA's landsats,

can radial slices
in three mile increments,

247

emanating from the
Retreat... sir.

248
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,634
Okay, Jack, I'm pulling up
the DOD database.

249
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:42,167
Here it is,
I'm patching you through.

250
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,334
Copy that.

251

Heller.

254
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,167
Mr. Secretary, it's Jack.

255
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,233
I need you to confirm for me
if a helicopter's been

256
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,267
tracking your vehicle?

257
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,400
What's going on, Jack?

258
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:56,867
Sir, time is critical.

259
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,500
Is there a helicopter
above you or not?

260
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,901
Yeah, there's a chopper
above me.

261
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:05,068
Who are they?

262
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,233
Henderson's men.

263
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,834
He claims he's given them orders
to kill you

264
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:08,968
if I don't let him go.

265
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,434
Is he bluffing?

266
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,901
He doesn't do that, sir.

267
00:11:14,334 --> 00:11:15,734
CHLOE:
Jack, I've got Heller's car.

268
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,467
I'm patching it
through to your PDA.

269
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:18,634
Copy that.

270

( <i>helicopter propeller</i>
<i>whirring</i> )

271
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:29,801
Jack... they have a laser sight

272
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,001
trained on me.

273
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:33,500
Get up.

274
00:11:37,534 --> 00:11:39,968
You give me the recording,
I let you go: that's the deal.

275
00:11:40,034 --> 00:11:41,034
No.

276
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,801
Come on, Jack,
you're wasting time.

277
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:45,034
We both know you're not going
to let Heller die.

278
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,834
I can hear him, Jack;
don't let him do this.
I'm going to walk

279
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:49,400
out of here, Jack,
and you're not gonna stop me,

280
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,200
so uncuff me.

281
00:11:51,267 --> 00:11:53,068
Jack, don't let him go.

282
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:54,133
I don't have
a choice, sir.

283
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,167
Yes, you do.

284
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,901
If I had listened to you
in the first place,

285
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,001
none of this would be happening.

286
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:01,133
This is my responsibility,

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,467
I will not allow Logan and
Henderson to use me as a pawn.

288
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:06,601
Sir?

289
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,367
Do not let them
get away with this.

290
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:12,767
Make sure that the recording
gets to the right people.

Mr. Secretary,

293
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,100

JACK:
Chloe, are you still
on the line?!

297
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,267
Can you confirm that Heller

298
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,934
just drove his car
into the lake?

299
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,801
Yes.

300
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,300
Damn you!

301
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,300
Oh, my God, no.

302
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,534
How could you do this?

303
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:10,267
This isn't about what you think
is best for the country.

304
00:13:10,334 --> 00:13:12,867
This is about your greed
for power.

305
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:14,701
Today, you have been
responsible

306
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:17,034
for killing an ex-president,
David Palmer,

307
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,467
and the secretary of defense,

308
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,801
two real patriots.

309
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,467
Damn you!

310
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:25,434
What happened to you?

311
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,334
Give me the recording.

312
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,467
I don't have it.

313
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:32,233
Where is it?!

314
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,767
I'm not going to
tell you, Jack.

315
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,334
and you know that-- no
matter what you do to me.

316
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,467
AUDREY:
Do it.

317
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:40,434
Kill him, Jack. Do it!

318
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,800
MAN:
Yeah.
Graham?

319
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,667
Yes.

320
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,633
You need to cancel the action
against Henderson immediately.

321
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,066
Why?

322
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,099
He has the recording,
but he's made arrangements

323
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,166
to have it released
if anything happens to him.

324
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,733
You should have exercised
more control over him.

325
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,500
There's a limit
to how much I can do.

326
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,066
Apparently.
Don't.

327
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:22,600
Don't you use that tone with me.

328
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,000
We've both made mistakes today.

329
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:26,900
You're right, Mr. President,
my apologies,

330
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:31,366
but the fact is, I think we have
a bigger problem than Henderson.

331
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,333
What? What are you
talking about?

332
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,333
At least he can be trusted
to act rationally,

333
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,667
in his own interest.

334
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,900
Unfortunately, the same
is not true of your wife.

335
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,466
My wife.

336
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,867
Apparently,

337
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:46,567
there's a secret service agent
named Aaron Pierce

338
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,300
who knows a little more
than he should.

339
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:49,800
He intends to share that
with Martha.

340
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,233
I'm well aware of that,

341
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,066
and I've taken steps
to deal with Agent Pierce.

342
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,166
But the real problem

343
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,600
is Mrs. Logan.

344
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,633
She continues to talk,
to ask questions,

345
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,066
talk about her suspicions.

346
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,600
People don't take her seriously.

347
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:01,900
They think she's unstable.

348
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,233
There are too many loose ends
lying around.

349
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,066
We cannot afford to have her
pull on one

350
00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:06,099
and unravel everything.

351
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,500
You think
I don't realize that?

352
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:11,066
I think you're in a very
difficult position

353
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:13,567
and that you have been hoping
the situation with Martha

354
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,333
would resolve itself,
but it hasn't.

355
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,433
You must silence her.

356
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,266
I know.

357
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,867
But I'll handle this myself.

358
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,433
( <i>flips phone shut</i> )

359
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,733
MAN:
Mrs. Logan,

360
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,833
Agent Pierce
was transferred.

361
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,333
That's what you keep saying,
but it doesn't make any sense,

362
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,833
not at 1:00 in the morning.

363
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,900
We work around the clock, ma'am.

364
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,300
It's quite common
for agents

365
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,967
to get pulled off
details at odd hours.

366
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:41,199
Right when they're supposed
to have a meeting

367
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:43,233
with the First Lady
of the United States?

368
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,266
I don't know anything
about a meeting.

369
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,300
Well, I do!

370
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,099
I found Aaron's phone
laying on the ground,

371
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,667
right where we were
supposed to meet.

372
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,600
Now, I want you
to find Agent Pierce,

373
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,199
and I want you to get him
back here, right now!

374
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,767
There's a glitch in
the scheduling software,

375
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,000
I can not pull that
record up right now.

376
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,800
And are these glitches
quite common, as well?

377
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:02,934
Actually, no, but...

378
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,533
Mrs. Logan.

379
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,733
I'm Agent Adams.

380
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,934
I think I can
explain everything.

381
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,967
Well?

382
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,600
This is a sensitive
issue, ma'am.

383
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,533
President Logan would like you
to come with me.

384
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,733
Ma'am.
What is this
"sensitive" information?

385
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,199
Is it about
Agent Pierce?

386
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,700
I'm sorry-- you need to talk
to the president about that.

387
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm asking you.

388
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,466
Do you know
where Aaron Pierce is?

389
00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:36,166
No, ma'am, I don't.

390
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:38,466
Is this where my husband is?

391
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:41,199
I want to talk to him.

392
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,099
Charles?

393
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:58,333
Hello?

394
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,433
( <i>dialing</i> )

395
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,099
( <i>phone ringing</i> )
Yeah.

396
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,266
Henderson wasn't lying.

397
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,233
He doesn't have the recording
on him.

398
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,333
Could it be in his car?

399
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,900
No, he wouldn't
have left it behind.

400
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,967
There must have been
some kind of a hand-off.
What do you mean?

401
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:21,833
Well, that would
explain why he wasn't
any farther ahead of me.

402
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,600
when I left Van Nuys Airfield.

403
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,567
He must have stopped
and given it to someone.

404
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:28,266
Okay, I'll back trace the route
with the satellite,

405
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,900
see if I can spot anything.

406
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,466
Yeah.

407
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:34,300
Jack, we're getting that
recording and exposing Logan.

408
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,767
I don't care
how far I have to go

409
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,934
or what I have to do,

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,266
Do you understand, Jack?

411
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,099
Yes.
( <i>phone rings</i> )

412
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,767
Go ahead.

413
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,533
Jack, you were right,
I found the hand-off.

414
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,400
Henderson stopped and
rendezvoused with another car.

415
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,934
I'm sorry
I didn't see it before.

416
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,300
Can you track the other car?

417
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:52,767
BUCHANAN:
We're tracking
it now, Jack.

418
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,133
It headed back to Van Nuys.

419
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,366
Looks like the civilian
side of the airfield.

420
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:58,700
Pulled onto the tarmac.

421
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,867
Whoever was in it got out
and got directly onto the plane.

422
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:02,400
Isn't air traffic
still grounded?

423
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:03,500
Yeah, this is not
a commercial flight.

424
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,333
I'll find out what I can
about it.

425
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,567
CHLOE:
Jack, the plane is servicing.

426
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:07,700
It's about to take off.

427
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:08,800
Has Curtis been relieved
of his duty,

428
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,266
or is he still attached to CTU?

429
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,400
He's at CTU, taking orders
from Homeland Security,

430
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,900
but I think we can
trust him, Jack.

431
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,266
Where is he?

432
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,700
According to the
deployment grid,

433
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,733
he's 25 miles northwest
of you, with a tac team.

434
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,133
Bill, I want you to call him.

435
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,967
Get him to this location as soon
as possible.

436
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:25,733
I want him to transfer Henderson
and Audrey back to CTU.

437
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,066
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

438
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:28,333
Logan's in control at CTU.

439
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,833
Curtis will be able
to protect them.

440
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,433
Right now, it's our best
chance to secure Henderson

441
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,166
and get Audrey the medical
attention she needs.

442
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,400
Calling Curtis now, Jack.

443
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,000
Thanks.

444
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:37,833
What's happening?

445
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
The person Henderson
gave the recording to

446
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:41,199
just boarded a plane
at Van Nuys Airfield.

447
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,767
Why aren't you going now?

448
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,700
I'll go as soon as Curtis
gets here-- he's not far.

449
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:46,700
Jack, I'll be fine until then.

450
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm not leaving you here alone.

451
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,233
Jack, if you don't get
that recording,

452
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,733
my father will have died
for nothing.

453
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,433
Jack...

454
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,533
for me.

455
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:09,600
Henderson is secure.

456
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,166
When he regains
consciousness,

457
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,667
I don't want you going
anywhere near him.

458
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:13,967
You don't even talk to him.

459
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,400
You understand me?
I understand.

460
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:20,233
We have to assume his people
are still looking for him.

461
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,733
They're gonna be monitoring
all non-VPN cell traffic,

462
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,867
which means, you can't make
or receive any calls

463
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,433
unless they come from me.

464
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,066
Here's Wexler's cell.

465
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,466
I've got the number.

466
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:32,300
All right.

467
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:33,633
Audrey, I don't feel right
about this.

468
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm going to be all right.

469
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,934
I'm so sorry.

470
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,466
Jack, you have to go now.

471
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,199
Jack?

472
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,099
Make sure you get

473
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,066
that recording.

474
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,066
I will.

475
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,568
Let me know as soon
as you're done.

476
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,034
Vladimir Bierko has
regained consciousness.

477
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,934
But we're still waiting
for the medical assessment

478
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,867
to be finished before we can
begin the interrogation.

479
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,833
Let me know when they
give us the go ahead.

480
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,201
Final protocol shifts.

481
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,534
You can tell Washington
the transfer of authority

482
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,334
from CTU to Homeland
is officially complete.

483
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:39,967
Okay.

484
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,833
Two hours
ahead of schedule, Karen.

485
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,434
That is remarkable.

486
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,568
I'm sorry,

487
00:20:47,634 --> 00:20:48,601
my head is
somewhere else.

488
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:49,601
Where?

489
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:50,767
We gave the President

490
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,668
Bauer's location
over an hour ago.

491
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,334
We should have
heard something by now.

492
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:56,833
The military authority
is handling Bauer.

493
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,267
Yes, I know, but this
doesn't make any sense.

494
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,167
The President insisted
we redirect our focus

495
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:02,434
from Henderson to Bauer.

496
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,167
We find Bauer, and then
he hands the mission

497
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,167
over to the military.

498
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,201
Karen, we're out of that loop.

499
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,833
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

500
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,234
( <i>beep</i> )

501
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:11,334
Karen Hayes.

502
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:12,568
Ma'am, we have a problem.

503
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:14,434
Chloe O'Brian got
out of holding,

504
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,900
and as far as I can tell,
she's not in the building.

505
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,601
MILES:
Not in the building?
How's that possible?

506
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:20,167
I'm still gathering
the details.

507
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:22,100
But I reviewed the surveillance
tape, and it looks like

508
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,601
Shari had a conversation with
her, and Shari let her go.

509
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,634
Shari didn't try
to stop her? Why?

510
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,067
I don't know. She
won't tell me.

511
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:29,501
I had security take
her into custody.

512
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:31,301
Good. Bring her up
here right now.

513
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:38,100
We need to focus on
how we find Chloe now.

514
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:41,501
My guess is
she'll try to contact Bauer.

515
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,833
I agree, but how?

516
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,700
She was using CTU resources
before to help Bauer.

517
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,367
Maybe she'll try that again.
Which means

518
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:49,100
she could try to access
our system remotely.

519
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,568
All she needs is a laptop.

520
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,833
That's right.

521
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,267
She'll disguise
her traffic.

522
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:54,634
Can you get through that?

523
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,867
I can trace
her physical location

524
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,700
by looking at the binaries.
Do it.

525
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,900
HAYES:
Wait outside.

526
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,767
Why did you let Chloe escape?

527
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,434
She intimidated me.

528
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:13,900
<i>She</i> intimidated you?

529
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:14,967
Sit down.

530
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,601
You are in a great deal trouble,
Miss Rothenberg.

531
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,867
You had better
start talking

532
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:22,401
to me now.

533
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:27,067
She said she'd recommend me
for psychiatric evaluation.

534
00:22:27,134 --> 00:22:29,367
I'd lose my job.

535
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:31,601
I'm sorry, Miss Hayes.

536
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:32,767
There's something wrong with me,

537
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,367
I know that.
Shari...

538
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,434
And I should probably
see someone...
Shari!

539
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:38,900
Did Chloe tell you why she was
helping Audrey Raines and Bauer?

540
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,601
She thinks Jack is innocent.

541
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,301
Based on what?

542
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:44,568
Based on some
absurd idea

543
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:49,167
that President Logan
framed Bauer.

544
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,234
She even said something about
President Logan being involved

545
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:53,833
in the assassination
of David Palmer.

546
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,700
I mean, can you believe her?

547
00:22:57,534 --> 00:22:59,334
And people think
I'm crazy.

548
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:03,501
MARTHA:
Damn it, open
this door!

549
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:05,367
MARTHA:
I don't know
what you think you're doing,

550
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:06,601
but you'd better
think again!

551
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:07,601
Unlock it.

552
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:08,601
MARTHA:
Open it!

553
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,900
( <i>pounding</i> )

554
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:12,267
Charles.

555
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,700
I want that man arrested!

556
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:18,800
And I want know
where Aaron Pierce is.

557
00:23:18,867 --> 00:23:20,000
Shh.

558
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,000
Martha, calm down.

559
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,967
All right?
Aaron's fine.

560
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:28,034
I just transferred him
back to Washington, that's all.

561
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,167
In the middle of the night?

562
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:31,334
Doesn't make any sense.

563
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:33,000
And why am I
locked in this room?

564
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,367
'Cause we need to talk.

565
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:36,367
About what?

566
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:49,067
Martha, I've been
wanting to tell you this,

567
00:23:49,134 --> 00:23:50,334
but I told myself

568
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,934
that you were
too fragile to handle it.

569
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,201
But that's not the truth.

570
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:58,967
The truth is,
I've kept this from you

571
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:02,501
because it's horrible
and because it's ugly.

572
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:03,934
What are you talking about?

573
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:10,501
What happened to David Palmer
wasn't supposed to happen.

574
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:12,867
He put himself in harm's way,
and he got involved

575
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:14,267
with something
that he shouldn't have.

576
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:16,100
What are you saying?

577
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:21,634
That I never authorized
his death.

578
00:24:23,668 --> 00:24:27,167
You... mean...

579
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,334
you know who killed David?

580
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,733
Yes.

581
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,767
How do you know that?

582
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,534
He works for me.

583
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,733
What?

584
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,234
Martha,
it's very complicated.
What?!

585
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:40,467
There's an explanation.

586
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:42,867
What?! An explanation?!
Oh, my God!

587
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,000
Stop!
Go to hell!

588
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,601
Stop! You don't understand!

589
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:47,067
Oh, my God!

590
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:49,733
You're involved
in David's murder.

591
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,833
Martha...

592
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,167
Oh, my God,
oh, my God.

593
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:54,234
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
Why are you
telling me this?

594
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:56,234
Why are you
telling me this?

595
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:57,467
Because you're on your way

596
00:24:57,534 --> 00:24:59,034
to finding out
the truth on your own.

597
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,334
( <i>sobbing</i> )

598
00:25:00,401 --> 00:25:02,234
And because you need to stop.

599
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:06,967
Stop what?
You have to stop

600
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,234
asking questions,
you have to stop

601
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:09,900
talking about this to everyone.

602
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:10,900
Never again.

603
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,534
Martha, do you realize

604
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,201
how traumatic this would be
for the country

605
00:25:14,267 --> 00:25:15,934
if people were to find out?

606
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,234
Oh, yes, we're worried
about the country.

607
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:19,501
Damn it, Martha!

608
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,034
That's the most important
part of this!

609
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,034
This scandal would destroy

610
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,301
the American people's faith
in their government.

611
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,733
It would destroy our credibility

612
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,601
all over the world.

613
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:32,634
You lied to me.

614
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,967
Everything.

615
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:38,467
This whole day has
been one giant lie.

616
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:40,367
What you've done
makes me sick!

617
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:42,767
Martha, enough!

618
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,267
I know

619
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,634
that what I did, what I allowed
to happen, was a mistake.

620
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,434
It was a terrible mistake.

621
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:51,334
But it's done.

622
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:57,501
Right now, I need
you to swear to me

623
00:25:57,568 --> 00:26:00,367
that you will do as I ask...

624
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:05,534
for the country, Martha.

625
00:26:13,767 --> 00:26:16,767
I've forgiven you
many things, Charles,

626
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,668
but not this.

627
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:21,334
You've broken my heart.

628
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,167
I'm looking at you...

629
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,401
I hate you.

630
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,700
But I will keep my mouth shut.

631
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,800
Because the people
of this country

632
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:48,867
don't deserve to suffer.

633
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,501
You do, Charles.

634
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:22,332
RON:
Are you sure we're going to get
through this the way we planned?

635
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,699
What does that mean?

636
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,733
There's too many loose ends.

637
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:30,332
What operation
doesn't have loose ends?

638
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,200
Of course we're not
going to get through this

639
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:33,866
the way we planned.
No one ever does.

640
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,599
I have never made a deal
in my life that didn't feel like

641
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:38,699
it was going to fall apart
in the 11th hour.

642
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:40,133
Now, if you don't
have the stomach

643
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,033
to deal with
a few bumps,

644
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,267
then this is not the room
where you belong.

645
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,599
And that goes for all of you.

You're starting
to have doubts.

647
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,299
I can smell it,

648
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,033
and I don't like it.

649
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,033
You need to remember
the strength we had

650
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,399
18 months ago
when we started this thing.

651
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:01,233
We okay, Ron?

652
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:03,167
Yeah.

653
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,366
Think about your kids.

654
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:09,466
That's what I do
when I need to get focused.

655
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:10,800
Yeah?

656
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:14,566
The situation with Martha
is taken care of.

657
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,499
I spoke to her.

658
00:28:16,566 --> 00:28:17,499
And?

659
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:19,299
And I made it very clear

660
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:21,066
that if she continues
with this behavior,

661
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,966
I will send her back
to the hospital in Vermont.

662
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,267
Well, you were going to have
her committed earlier today.

663
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:28,533
But you changed
your mind?

664
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,133
It's because
she found out the truth.

665
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,167
And I decided
I should keep her close.

666
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:36,432
What if she finds out
the truth again?

667
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:38,633
She won't.

668
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:41,200
And if she does,
I will handle it,

669
00:28:41,267 --> 00:28:43,366
just like I
have all day.

670
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:44,766
Okay.

671
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,233
Fair enough.

672
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,432
You have done a remarkable job
today, Mr. President.

673
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:49,833
I will admit that.

674
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,699
Thank you.

675
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:54,499
It's about time I heard
some words of appreciation.

676
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,499
Oh, listen to me,
we were just talking about

677
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:58,766
how you've had to be
on the front line through this,

678
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,800
how you've had to get
your hands dirty,

679
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:05,566
while we could just sit back
and watch from a safe distance.

680
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,933
You've earned our trust.

681
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,432
And I am sure...

682
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,900
that you will do whatever it
takes to keep your wife in line.

683
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:31,233
Audrey.

684
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,599
Where's Jack?

685
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:38,633
Audrey.

686
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:39,800
I'm sorry about your father.

687
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:42,666
I never intended

688
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:44,533
your father to get
in the middle of this.

689
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:47,599
I've known Secretary Heller
a very long time.

690
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:48,866
He's an honorable man.

691
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,233
What time is it?

692
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,900
It's ten to 12 minutes since...

693
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:58,900
If those windows didn't collapse

694
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,167
when that car
hit the water,

695
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:02,000
it could have created an
air pocket or something.

696
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,499
20, 30 minutes in a submerged
car, even at 100 feet,

697
00:30:04,566 --> 00:30:06,800
if there was
an air pocket.
Stop it.

698
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:08,599
Your father could be alive.
( <i>straining</i> )

699
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:11,167
Secretary...

700
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,233
Secretary Heller could be
alive inside that car.

701
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,267
If he's alive, you got to do
something about it.

702
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:16,432
I mean, if there's
a possibility

703
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:18,100
that he's living,
you got to call

704
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,432
military authority

705
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:20,933
or the emergency
services or something.

706
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,299
I mean, for God's sake,

707
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:23,733
he's your father.
Stop it! Stop it!

708
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,399
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop talking!

709
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:40,566
What, do you think I'm stupid?

710
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,200
You want me
to make that phone call

711
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,866
so that your people can find me.

712
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,666
Audrey, my people
are going to find us anyway.

713
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,299
And Jack's not
going to stop all this.

714
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,399
I'm trying to help your father.

715
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:52,900
Your father's drowning

716
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:54,200
in a car, and you're not

717
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,432
doing anything
about it.

718
00:30:55,499 --> 00:30:56,599
You're gonna live with that

719
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:57,833
the rest of
your life.
Shut up.

720
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,966
He is dying,

721
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,766
and you are doing
nothing, Audrey.

722
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,299
You are doing nothing.

723
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:04,666
I swear to God,

724
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:07,499
not another word.

Jack.

728
00:31:29,167 --> 00:31:30,466
I've got a visual on the plane.

729
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:31,933
It must be some kind
of diplomatic flight.

730
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,766
There's a lot of security
on the ground.

731
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:34,966
We have a problem.

732
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:35,966
What?

733
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:37,233
I've been tracking
the helicopter

734
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,332
that Henderson's men used

735
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,033
to shadow
Secretary Heller.
And?

736
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,466
It changed course,

737
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,299
it's heading towards where
Audrey's holding Henderson.

738
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:44,466
How could they find them?

739
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:45,733
CHLOE:
I don't know--

740
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,100
maybe they're using
satellite imagery, too.

741
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:48,933
The point is, they're going
to be there any second.

742
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,432
Where's Curtis?
Based on the speed
of the chopper,

743
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:53,933
he might not make it there
before Henderson's men, Jack.

744
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,066
Upload your visual to my PDA.

Audrey,

Henderson's men have
zeroed in on your location,

they're heading
back towards you.

You've got to get
out of there now.

And just leave him?

We don't have a choice.

755
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,133
Yes, we do, Jack.

756
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,466
I have the gun
and I can kill him.

757

Audrey, we need him alive.

758
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,533
Curtis's team is almost there,
they'll track him down

for the death of
my father's death.

763

811
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:09,366
Jack, is Audrey
all right?

812
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:10,599
JACK:
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

813
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,133
Curtis is in control
of the situation.

814
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,233
Chloe, what have you got
on the plane?

815
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:15,766
The details
just came in.

816
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,066
You were right, it is
a chartered diplomatic flight,

817
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,233
security-level eight,

818
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:21,000
scheduled to leave
at 2:00 A.M. or sooner.

819
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,699
Okay, we need
to find out
who's onboard

820
00:35:22,766 --> 00:35:24,200
so we can try
and figure out

821
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:25,733
who Henderson passed off
the recording to.

822
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,200
I'll try-- it's not
going to be easy

823
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:28,933
getting past the
State Department's
firewall.

824
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,399
I understand.

825
00:35:30,466 --> 00:35:31,666
Bill, see if you could slow down
the departure of this flight

826
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:33,267
so I can figure out
a way to get on it.

827
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,299
All right, Jack.

828
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:37,399
There's a maintenance gate

829
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:38,900
on the northwest side
of the airfield.

830
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:40,866
You should be able to get
close to the plane there.

831
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:41,866
I know, I'm there.

832
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:43,167
Just get back to me

833
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:45,066
as soon as you've got
the passenger list.

834
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,800
GUARD:
All clear.

835
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:43,900
Go ahead.

( <i>grunts softly</i> )

00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:14,367
Yeah?

838
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,467
Jack, we've tried
everything we can

839
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,200
there's no way
to delay the plane.

840
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:20,400
It's taking off in
less than ten minutes.
Okay.

841
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:22,367
Has Chloe got the
passenger list yet?

842
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:24,000
I still can't get past
the firewall.

843
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,567
Chloe, I need
that list.

844
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:26,667
Jack, I'm trying.

I got O'Brian.

851
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,100
HAYES:
Did you find her on our system?

852
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,933
Yes, she's using one of
our nodes to try to log-in

853
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,933
to the State Department
network.

854
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,367
Do we know why?

855
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:57,667
No, but she was using a work
around I'd never seen before.

856
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,434
so I machine-coded a matrix
to get through...

857
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,967
Miles, we just
need to find her.

858
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:01,900
Where she is?

859
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,200
I'm running a physical trace.

860
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:11,200
It's a private house.

861

she's working out of
Bill Buchanan's house.

865
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,367
Are you sure?
Positive.

866
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:25,267
We have a Tac Team
not far away.

867
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,866
I'll dispatch them now.

868
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,534
What's their ETA?

869
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:30,900

seven minutes.

How are things going over there?

876
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,667
HAYES:
It's a rough transition

877
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:55,200
from CTU to Homeland,
but we're getting through it.

878
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:57,033
NOVICK:
That's good to hear.
What do you need?

879
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,234
I need some
clarification.

880
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,567
We were sent over here

881
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:01,833
on a directive
from the White House,

882
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,200
but we've been
dealing exclusively

883
00:39:03,267 --> 00:39:06,133
with Vice President Gardner
until about two hours ago.

884
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,866
What happened
two hours ago?

885
00:39:07,933 --> 00:39:09,367
The president called me himself

886
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,067
and ordered me
to arrest Jack Bauer

887
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:13,400
on evidence he was
unwilling to share with me.

888
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:16,434
Yes. I know about that.

889
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,701
Have you seen the evidence?

890
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:20,367
No, actually, I-I haven't.

891
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:21,200
HAYES:
Mike...

892
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,167
Who has seen it?

893
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:26,400
I don't have
a good answer for that.

894
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:28,967
Are you telling me
you're not in the loop?

895
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,167
Actually...

896
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:33,833
I don't even think
there is a loop.

897
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,167
The president is keeping his
own counsel at the moment.

898
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:39,133
That's a first.

899
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,733
Yes. It is.

900
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,434
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

901
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,434
Uh, nothing that I can say
with any authority.

902

All I know is that...

903
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,500
it's been a strange night.

904
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:55,667
I see.

No, Mike, actually,
you've been very helpful.

HAYES:
This is Karen Hayes.

912
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,601
You have less than seven minutes
to get Chloe out of there.

913
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,100
Karen, I don't
know what

914
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,967
you're talking about,
Chloe's not here.
Bill, stop.

915
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,300
Miles traced Chloe
through

916
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,334
a remote node
she's accessing.

917
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,733
And if you don't
believe me,

918
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,334
tell her he used a machine-coded
matrix to find her.

919
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:51,500
Karen, why are you warning us?

920
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:55,133
Because I may have made
a mistake earlier.

A lot of things have
not made sense today,

what Chloe said.

About President Logan
being... involved.

I can't leave yet.

928

Jack needs the

Chloe, if they find you here,
you'll be arrested.
