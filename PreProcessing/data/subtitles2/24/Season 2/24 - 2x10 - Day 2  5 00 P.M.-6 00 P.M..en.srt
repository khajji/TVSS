1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:17,770
Six hours ago a cache of weapons-grade
plutonium was found in a warehouse.

2
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:21,084
We also found this.
What do you make of that, guys?

3
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:25,610
- This is a bill of lading from our company.
- For a container sent to Syed Ali.

4
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:29,925
I can track the shipping order.
The database is at the office.

5
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,208
If my father really does
work for the government,

6
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:36,650
wouldn't he have known
if Reza was doing something illegal?

7
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:38,768
Who are you?

8
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:41,890
My name is Syed Ali. You were
looking in places you do not belong.

9
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:44,646
- I don't know anything!
- Kill her.

10
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:45,768
No.

11
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:50,410
We're going down! The pilots don't know
what happened. It felt like an explosion.

12
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:53,929
- They were shot down?
- By a ground-to-air missile.

13
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:57,164
That's not Search and Rescue.

14
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:59,562
- Are they coming here for you?
- I don't know.

15
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:02,928
Drop it.

16
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:08,167
I'll tell you where the bomb is in exchange
for immunity, for the murder of Jack Bauer.

17
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:10,325
Someone from CTU
is supposed to pick us up.

18
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:12,688
Captain said it's out of their jurisdiction.

19
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,924
- We told you why we can't go back to LA.
- Yeah, I know. The bomb.

20
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:19,244
Miss Myers, if the information you provide

21
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,086
culminates in the interception
of the nuclear device,

22
00:01:22,173 --> 00:01:25,370
you'll be pardoned in advance
for the murder of Jack Bauer.

23
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:29,651
Mr President, there was only one
right choice to make and you made it.

24
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:41,203
You've been told by a well-respected
member of the press, Mr Ron Wieland,

25
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:45,764
that there is an imminent terrorist threat
levelled against this country.

26
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,763
That is true, so far as it goes.

27
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,731
Please.

28
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,208
The fact is, we get a dozen
such threats every day.

29
00:01:56,293 --> 00:02:01,128
And do I know more about them
than I publicly reveal? Of course.

30
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:05,252
What is released to the public and when
is a matter of judgement.

31
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,801
You have elected me
to exercise that judgement

32
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:10,771
in the best interests of this country.

33
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:18,366
That's what I've done since I took office.
That's what I'm doing today.

34
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:23,891
And I can assure you that we have
the situation well under control,

35
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,929
and there is no cause for alarm.

36
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,447
Thank you.

37
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,766
Not the Gettysburg Address,
but it should buy us time.

38
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,571
It was fine.

39
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:40,488
- What's the situation with Jack Bauer?
- Still being held hostage by Nina Myers.

40
00:02:43,093 --> 00:02:47,769
It didn't have to be like this, Jack.
I never meant for it to be personal.

41
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,001
It felt pretty personal
when you killed my wife.

42
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:56,611
I had to. Teri overheard something
that compromised my escape route.

43
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:00,322
What about bombing CTU?
All those people you used to work with?

44
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:04,565
I didn't bomb CTU. I just sold the plans.

45
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:08,769
You believe what you have to,
but you killed your friends.

46
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:11,572
Shut up, Jack! Shut up!

47
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:14,807
Now we are done talking!

48
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:21,566
We're just gonna wait for Palmer to call
and then this'll all be over. You got it?

49
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:31,086
You know what, Nina? You're right. I don't
really wanna just sit here and wait to die.

50
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:33,482
Don't move, Jack!

51
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:35,052
I mean it!

52
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:43,123
You kill me before they verify the information,
you'll be in violation of your agreement.

53
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:46,603
- They'll just slap your ass back in jail.
- And you'll be dead.

54
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,043
I'm already dead.

55
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,688
Last warning, Jack.

56
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:56,526
That's it. One more step and I'll shoot.

57
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,761
Argh!

58
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,572
- Team one, move in! Go!
- Go, go go!

59
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:04,962
- Move, move, move!
- Grab her!

60
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,008
Secure the weapon.

61
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,844
Got it.

62
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,931
- Notify the chopper.
- Get her up.

63
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,683
- Let's go.
- We're not going back to LA.

64
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:23,525
We've been through this.

65
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,491
- I told you before.
- I know, the bomb. Move. Walk.

66
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:29,531
Forget about us.
You wanna get blown to pieces?

67
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:32,889
I told you who my dad was.
You think they’d send someone from CTU?

68
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,248
- Get in.
- I'm not going back to LA.

69
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:39,008
- Miguel!
- Get down! Get down! Don't move.

70
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:42,130
- I got him.
- Miguel!

71
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,091
- Careful.
- Let's go. Get in.

72
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,493
Yes. Good. Yes, I'll tell him.

73
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,604
It's over.

74
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:01,328
- Is Jack OK?
- They got to Nina before she shot him.

75
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,928
- What about her?
- As you requested, she wasn't seriously hurt.

76
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,891
They're awaiting orders.
Do you want her taken to prison?

77
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:12,283
No. We'll honour our original deal.

78
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:15,922
I'll pardon her as soon
as we confirm her information.

79
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:19,289
- In the meantime, where do you want her?
- Los Angeles.

80
00:05:19,693 --> 00:05:23,208
Let her share the fate
of everyone she's endangered.

81
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:25,329
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:32,968
That's affirmative. I'll meet the chopper
just south of the gully in the field.

83
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:35,448
- Roger that.
- Copy.

84
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,524
Now...

85
00:06:44,413 --> 00:06:49,089
We're here to find transactions you claim
Bob Warner had with Syed Ali.

86
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,971
The sooner we do that,
the sooner we're out of here.

87
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:53,930
Have a seat.

88
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:59,731
- I can't work like this.
- I'll be keying the computer.

89
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:08,411
How do I open the invoice files?

90
00:07:13,093 --> 00:07:15,891
- What?
- I need to access the invoice files.

91
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:19,852
- File, open, warehouse.
- How are they ordered?

92
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:22,845
- Chronologically, I think.
- You think?

93
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:28,730
Look, my fiancée just left me on my wedding
day because I'm sending her father to jail.

94
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:33,170
And since he's my employer, that pretty
much means my whole life's in the toilet.

95
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,689
So why don’t you cut me some slack?

96
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:39,890
There's a nuke somewhere in this city.

97
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:44,046
And if you don't give me
something useful in the next hour,

98
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:47,011
I'll take you back to CTU
and chain you to the roof,

99
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:51,450
so you'll have a front row seat
when the damn thing goes off.

100
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,291
Do you want to suffer as he did?

101
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,648
No, of course not.

102
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:57,571
Then tell me what you’ve learned
from your father's computer files,

103
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,530
who you told.

104
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:04,087
I already told you. I don't know anything.

105
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,404
Jack Bauer.

106
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:36,687
Jack?

107
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:41,085
Mr President, the soldiers
that attacked us at the crash site,

108
00:09:41,173 --> 00:09:45,007
they were Americans,
or at least, American trained.

109
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:46,651
What?

110
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:50,851
One of the soldiers that was killed
had a tattoo of a coral snake on his arm.

111
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,766
That's a signature of a group
out of Fort Benning.

112
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:57,323
- What sort of group?
- A deep cover special ops unit.

113
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,802
The only reason I know about the tattoos,

114
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:02,771
is because early in my career
they tried to recruit me.

115
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,845
Their commander is a Colonel Samuels.

116
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,812
- I've never heard of this unit.
- No, you wouldn't have. That's the point.

117
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:13,522
They'd be buried pretty heavily
in NSA's budget.

118
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,887
NSA.

119
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,205
OK.

120
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:23,890
Even if NSA originally trained him, isn't it
possible he's freelancing now? A mercenary?

121
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,533
If it was just the tattoo, I'd agree with you.

122
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:29,969
But the men that attacked us
had access to our flight plan.

123
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,762
The only way they could have got
that information was from on the inside.

124
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:38,881
Mr President, I know it sounds very
far-fetched that we got attacked by Americans,

125
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:42,807
but that tattoo is
very distinctive and very specific.

126
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,566
I appreciate the information.
Where are you now?

127
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:49,931
We're in a chopper. We're on our way to
the address that Nina Meyers provided for us.

128
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:53,722
We should be touching down soon, sir.
Our ETA is 15 minutes.

129
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:57,169
- Keep me posted, Jack.
- Yes, Mr President.

130
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:08,770
Jack's on his way to the Syed Ali house.
Do you want a feed up here?

131
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:12,084
No. I assume you have that under control.

132
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,004
Yeah, we do.

133
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:24,966
Was there something else?

134
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:34,251
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:43,013 --> 00:11:45,766
So what are you gonna do tomorrow?

136
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,447
- What?
- If the bomb doesn't go off.

137
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,444
Thought about it?

138
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:52,962
No.

139
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:56,572
You'll probably come back to work here?

140
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:59,523
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

141
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:04,050
I don't know. Are you happy in this job? Hm?

142
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:10,327
Believe it or not, I used to want
to be a teacher... a long time ago.

143
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,083
You know why I didn't?

144
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:17,007
Cos DOD offered me more money.
That's how I made my decision.

145
00:12:19,253 --> 00:12:21,767
So I made myself miserable,

146
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:27,928
and I made everybody else around me
miserable for an extra $5,000 a year.

147
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:30,888
That was my price.

148
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,088
Sorry.

149
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:41,649
You know, Michelle,
I'm not a big advice giver,

150
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,486
but under the circumstances...

151
00:12:45,653 --> 00:12:48,486
Don't wait around for your life
to happen to you.

152
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:51,451
Find something that makes you happy, do it.

153
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:58,125
Because everything else
is all just background noise.

154
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:15,164
- Roger.
- Mr President.

155
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:22,608
Tell me everything you know about
Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning.

156
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,809
I don't know anything about Samuels.

157
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:29,648
What about a special ops units
from down there called Coral Snake?

158
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,530
No, sir. Nothing.

159
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:35,492
How could NSA be funding a paramilitary
group and you not know about it?

160
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:38,610
Without knowing specifics,
I really can't say for sure.

161
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:43,046
My guess is that the Department of Defense

162
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:46,091
has used some of their
discretionary resources,

163
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:50,564
attached our name for budgetary purposes.
It happens all the time.

164
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:55,488
That's absurd. NSA is information gathering
only. They have no military mandate.

165
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:59,725
I'd assume that this Coral Snake group,

166
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:02,566
like many others that we see,

167
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:07,090
falls under somebody's pet project,
gets funded on the sly.

168
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:11,803
How would you know that, Roger? A minute
ago you told me you'd never heard of them.

169
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:16,045
I'm just conjecturing from
past experience, Mr President.

170
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:21,645
I have no concrete information.
Let me look into it.

171
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:24,643
You do that.

172
00:14:44,973 --> 00:14:50,047
Jack Bauer's plane was shot down
by an American military unit.

173
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:54,923
Jack told me himself. I won't go into details,
except to say that I believe him.

174
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,402
American military? Why?

175
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,723
I just spoke to Roger Stanton.

176
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:03,362
I think he's hiding something from me.
I'm going to arrest him.

177
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,530
Arrest the head of NSA?

178
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:13,922
Bauer said the unit that attacked his plane
is connected to a Colonel Samuels.

179
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:16,803
Samuels is funded by NSA.

180
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:21,887
With all due respect, David, that's pretty thin.

181
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:23,691
By itself, yes.

182
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,082
But the ambassador's chopper crash,

183
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:29,404
the evacuation of
military personnel out of LA,

184
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:34,487
Ron Wieland's escape from custody,
those things happened after Stanton arrived.

185
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:39,649
Firing Stanton will cause chaos.
All the agencies report through him.

186
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,691
He's running the search for the bomb,
for crying out loud.

187
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:46,129
If the president's right,
he's not running it, he's impeding it.

188
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:49,205
- Why would he do such a thing?
- I don't know.

189
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:53,684
But if he is, we have a better chance
of finding the bomb if we get rid of him.

190
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:55,731
David...

191
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,373
you can't do this on a hunch.

192
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:01,729
If Stanton turns out to be innocent
and that bomb goes off,

193
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,281
you'll be blamed for the death of millions.

194
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:08,252
If you do nothing and he is guilty
of something, you'll be blamed anyway.

195
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:13,885
No, no, no. At the very least, we need
to get some kind of proof, some evidence.

196
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,012
You cannot just arrest
the head of NSA, David.

197
00:16:18,093 --> 00:16:20,607
Sherry's right, Mike. We need proof.

198
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:28,171
Find me a connection between Stanton
and this Colonel Samuels. And find it quickly.

199
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:40,925
LA County 470, go ahead.

200
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:45,370
This is Officer Brown with Valley.
I'm trying to reach Detective Bill Gucoff.

201
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:49,446
Brown. You're transporting
two suspects down to Central?

202
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:53,412
- Mm-hm, that's right.
- Hold on. I'll patch you through.

203
00:16:53,493 --> 00:16:55,643
- Gucoff here.
- Hey, Bill.

204
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:59,009
- Yeah?
- I'm bringing the prisoners down.

205
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:03,885
- All right. You got everything under control?
- The guy gave us trouble...

206
00:17:03,973 --> 00:17:07,283
- What?
- Get the bandanna out of my pocket.

207
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:10,289
- Why?
- To start a fire.

208
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,523
What? You're crazy.

209
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,923
He'll have to pull over and stop the car.

210
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:18,811
- And then he'll put it out. Then what?
- I don't know.

211
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:23,967
Maybe it'll do enough damage and we'll have
to go back to the station. It'll buy us time.

212
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,930
That is just crazy.

213
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:30,529
Crazier than going to Los Angeles where
a nuclear bomb might go off any minute?

214
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:33,286
Hey, listen, this may sound a little crazy,

215
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:37,605
but did you happen to hear anything about
some kind of a bomb threat today?

216
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:39,172
What?

217
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:42,165
I can't do this. You gotta do it.

218
00:17:42,253 --> 00:17:45,245
- No.
- Kim, you can do it. You're smaller.

219
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:48,291
No, I haven't heard anything.

220
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:50,364
- Come on.
- You sure?

221
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:59,802
Why? Somebody tell you
there was a bomb or something?

222
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:04,489
What's going on? You know something
that I don't? What's up?

223
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:08,168
I don't know. It may be nothing,
but one of the kids here,

224
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,323
apparently her father works for CTU.

225
00:18:12,773 --> 00:18:15,446
He gave her some kind
of information about a bomb.

226
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:19,287
Just check it out for me.
Like I said, it's probably nothing, but...

227
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,969
No problem.

228
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,931
OK, Gucoff. Thanks. I owe you one.

229
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:24,806
- Kim.
- Hang on, OK?

230
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:38,926
- Hello. Can anyone hear me?
- This is CHP Station Six.

231
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,607
Kim. Kim. Don't.

232
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:48,245
We're on San Fernando, the 118. There's
been an accident. We need an ambulance.

233
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,643
- How's the officer?
- Hurt. So is someone else.

234
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,088
- Two injured?
- Yes.

235
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:57,529
- Stay there. We're sending someone now.
- Hang on.

236
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,162
All units. All units proceed
to San Fernando at the 118.

237
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:04,051
MVA. Officer down. Officer down.

238
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:31,046
I'm gonna ask you just once more, huh?

239
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:34,168
Who did you tell?

240
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:36,289
No one.

241
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,927
Here's an infrared of the house.
Two people in this room.

242
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:46,403
We assume one is Ali,
but we'll need to take 'em both alive.

243
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:48,529
- Your men in position?
- In 90 seconds.

244
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:50,012
- Good.
- Yeah?

245
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:51,970
- George, it's me.
- Where are you?

246
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:55,682
I'm on site. Syed Ali's in the house.
We're gonna move in a minute.

247
00:20:55,773 --> 00:21:00,289
We need auxiliary teams ready to move as
soon as we find out the location of this bomb.

248
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:05,163
- We're already working on it.
- I'll get back to you as soon as we get him.

249
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:10,088
Agent Baker?
Let me know when your teams are ready.

250
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:15,884
This is Bob Warner's access code.

251
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:19,682
As you can see, he logged on
roughly twice as often as I did.

252
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:24,532
- This is a restricted area.
- I need to speak with Reza.

253
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:26,922
I'm afraid I can't do that.

254
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:30,164
- Just a minute. It's our wedding day.
- I realise that.

255
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:34,644
- We're in the middle of an investigation.
- Can I talk to him for one minute?

256
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:39,847
- Can I talk to Reza for a minute?
- I tried to explain.

257
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,572
- Make it fast.
- Thank you.

258
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:49,168
Marie?

259
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,405
Hey, what I said before, I didn't mean it.

260
00:21:57,093 --> 00:21:59,607
I'm so sorry. This has been such a shock.

261
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,684
No, no, no. It's all right.

262
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:04,003
You are the man I'm going to marry.

263
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:08,962
I know, whatever you're doing, you have to
do it. I love you. Whatever happens, happens.

264
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:11,362
My angel.

265
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:16,243
We have to get back to work.
You can wait in the next room if you'd like.

266
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,244
Thank you.

267
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:45,206
It was barely a nick,
not nearly as bad as it feels.

268
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,811
You don't have to kill me.

269
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,566
Just leave me here.

270
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:03,929
By the time someone finds me,
you'll be 100 miles away.

271
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:12,206
Something's going to happen, very soon.

272
00:23:14,373 --> 00:23:19,242
Something terrible,
which will cause much suffering.

273
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,483
This will be easier.

274
00:23:26,893 --> 00:23:28,849
Take cover!

275
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:34,243
Fall back. Fall back.

276
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,928
I have here a woman!
If you come any closer, I'll kill the woman!

277
00:23:41,093 --> 00:23:44,847
- Bring in the shield now.
- We need the body bunker right away.

278
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:50,681
They don't negotiate. Yet they do shoot.

279
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:55,691
It's not you they want alive, it's me.

280
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:59,451
I'll try and take him out with a beanbag hit.

281
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:26,205
Suspect is secure.

282
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:28,204
You're all right. You're all right.

283
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:31,842
It's all right. It's all right.
Just relax. Take a breath.

284
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:35,050
It's over. It's over. OK?

285
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,887
- Jack, he's going into convulsions.
- What?

286
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:43,569
- Did you see him take anything?
- I was watching him the whole time.

287
00:24:44,613 --> 00:24:46,808
Cyanide. He must have had it in his mouth.

288
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:49,646
We need a medic in here now!
We need a medic now!

289
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:52,008
Copy that.

290
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,611
Damm it!

291
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:02,202
I want him photographed, fingerprints.
Send it to CTU for analysis.

292
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,171
I want confirmation that that is Syed Ali.

293
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:25,003
You called them. You should go.

294
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,527
I'll go when they get here.

295
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:31,003
It'll be too late. They'll see you.

296
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:32,811
I'll be fine.

297
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:44,329
Thank you so much... for everything.

298
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:52,167
As soon as this is all over,
I'm gonna find you. OK? I promise.

299
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,884
Go.

300
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:35,285
Notify Dispatch. 143.

301
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:43,241
- Did you get the area locked down?
- Yes, sir.

302
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,967
You should drink some water.

303
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:08,611
Kate, my name is Jack Bauer.
I'm a federal agent.

304
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:13,813
You've been through an ordeal, but I have
to ask you a few questions. Is that all right?

305
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:17,526
- How did you get here?
- Um...

306
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:24,370
I was... trying to help my sister.

307
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:29,163
So I hired a private investigator.
Those men thought we knew something...

308
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:35,089
Slow down, slow down. The dead man in
the other room was a private investigator?

309
00:27:36,733 --> 00:27:38,928
Paul Koplin.

310
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:40,844
What they did to him...

311
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:44,846
They? There was more than one man here?
How many men were there?

312
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:49,370
Two. The other one left before you came.

313
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:52,445
Did you get his name?

314
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:55,001
- Syed Ali.
- Are you sure?

315
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,125
Can you describe him for me?

316
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,329
Tall. Thin.

317
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:03,923
Do you remember what he was wearing?

318
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:08,882
A black shirt.
With... silver buttons down the front.

319
00:28:08,973 --> 00:28:10,326
Black pants.

320
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:14,201
Do you remember what kind of a car he
got into? Do you know where he was going?

321
00:28:15,373 --> 00:28:18,012
Excuse me for one moment.

322
00:28:18,093 --> 00:28:20,243
Baker, this is Agent Bauer.

323
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:25,691
Syed Ali is still alive. We are looking for
a Middle Eastern man, wearing all black.

324
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:28,241
I didn't get a make on the car.
Send out an APB.

325
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,722
- We need to find him now.
- Copy.

326
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:34,408
Kate, you said you came here
to help your sister. Who is she?

327
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:37,007
Marie. Marie Warner.

328
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,691
She was supposed to get married today.

329
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:48,084
Tell Mike what you told me.

330
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:53,566
There's a back-channel communications
network the CIA used to use, called OPCOM.

331
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,042
It's been shut down for over 20 years.

332
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:59,887
Last month, NSA was given orders
to resurrect it.

333
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:03,761
It was an eyes-only order
issued by Roger Stanton.

334
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:13,411
- I'm not sure that's enough.
- By itself, it's not.

335
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:17,452
Unless Stanton used OPCOM to contact
Colonel Samuels in the last few hours.

336
00:29:17,533 --> 00:29:19,603
My source is checking on that now.

337
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:25,211
Mike, call the Attorney General.
Start working on this from the legal side.

338
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:31,203
If we find this connection,
we'll move on it, have Stanton arrested.

339
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:46,528
I think we got a positive ID. Cross-reference
his prints with the name Paul Koplin.

340
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,922
- CTU?
- Bauer. Put me through to Tony.

341
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:51,243
Hold, please.

342
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,801
- It's Tony. What's up?
- I'm still at the house.

343
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:57,602
I just questioned the woman that
Ali was torturing for information.

344
00:29:57,693 --> 00:30:00,253
Her name is Kate Warner.
Run a background check.

345
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,972
- Did you say Kate Warner?
- Yeah. Why?

346
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:07,331
I had her family picked up this morning.
I was with her hours ago.

347
00:30:07,413 --> 00:30:10,211
- What's the connection?
- Reza Naiyeer,

348
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:13,012
her sister's fiancé, had dealings with Syed Ali.

349
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:16,210
He's denying it.
He says it was the father, Bob Warner.

350
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:20,252
Richards took Naiyeer to Bob Warner's
office to hack into his computer.

351
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,484
I have Warner here with me right now.

352
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:28,772
Jack, will Kate talk to you?
Cos her family's not cooperating.

353
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:33,608
Yeah. But I gotta give her time. She's been
through hell. You should see this place.

354
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,853
Jack, there's one more thing.

355
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:38,968
What?

356
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:42,602
The father, Bob Warner,
he freelances for the CIA.

357
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:51,010
We're gonna have to start from the beginning.
You'll have to run everything again.

358
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:55,405
Start connecting the dots. These people
are involved. You gotta find out how.

359
00:30:55,493 --> 00:30:59,327
- Get back to me when you've got anything.
- All right, you got it.

360
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:09,492
Gentlemen, I need you to pack up.
I need the room.

361
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:12,922
- Agent Baker?
- Baker here.

362
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:15,481
- How's Miss Warner doing?
- Not so good.

363
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:19,449
As soon as you think she's ready,
bring her down to the bathroom.

364
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:21,842
Will do. Baker out.

365
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:28,206
Those three dates and
anything the following week. Hold on.

366
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:31,683
OK. Good. Let me know as soon
as you find something out. Thanks.

367
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:33,411
- Sir?
- What have we got?

368
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:36,929
- I found a way into the OPCOM channels.
- Good. Tunnel in.

369
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:40,210
The problem is, the files
are pass code protected.

370
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:43,365
We'll need someone internal
to open them. It'll take time.

371
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:45,250
Hold. No, it's not.

372
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:50,361
I just got the name of a deputy director
who's retired, but his code is still active.

373
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:52,045
We could use that.

374
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:55,762
Jean, could you hold on for a sec?
Uh-huh. Let's see.

375
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:02,646
- Try this. It should work. I'm back.
- I'll head over to the OC and check it out.

376
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,042
- Good.
- Oh, that's terrific.

377
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:09,126
Jean, I'm gonna cross-reference these,
but I need you to stay in the office.

378
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:12,250
- No problem.
- Right. OK. Thanks. Bye.

379
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:17,402
I'm collecting the dates that
Samuels' office logged onto OPCOM.

380
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:21,168
If Mike can trace Stanton's access,
we can look for a match.

381
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:25,041
- That's great.
- If we have that, you'll have the proof.

382
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:29,126
Stanton has a dozen staff who share his code.
How are we gonna pin it on him?

383
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:34,526
There's a four-digit subcode that only belongs
to him. That's the one that'll nail him.

384
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,844
- Sherry?
- Yes.

385
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,811
You're doing an incredible job here today.

386
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,724
Thank you.

387
00:32:46,053 --> 00:32:50,205
I'd forgotten how talented
you are at all this stuff.

388
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:53,490
David, I've worked with you
for over 25 years.

389
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:57,081
It had to rub off on me somehow.

390
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:01,362
I'm glad you're here.

391
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:07,811
I have always been here.

392
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,804
You remember that.

393
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,891
Yeah.

394
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,843
All right. Call me if there's anything.

395
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:42,045
- That was Barbara at the Warner office.
- What'd they find?

396
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:46,570
Nothing yet. They're still going through
the records. Reza seems to be cooperating.

397
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:48,291
This is driving me crazy.

398
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:52,605
It doesn't make sense that Syed Ali has
a connection to this white-bread family.

399
00:33:52,693 --> 00:33:55,127
So you believe Bob Warner?

400
00:33:55,213 --> 00:34:00,333
There's nothing in his profile or behaviour
that suggests he's involved with terrorists.

401
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,007
I agree. But look at the facts.

402
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:06,210
There is a paper trail between
Warner Investments and Ali.

403
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:08,363
Kate Warner was abducted for a reason.

404
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:10,728
I know.

405
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:16,285
Look, put together a list of all the managers
and directors of Bob Warner's company.

406
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:19,206
- I want to widen the search a notch.
- Good idea.

407
00:34:19,293 --> 00:34:21,124
Anything else?

408
00:34:21,213 --> 00:34:22,885
Yeah.

409
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:27,012
I was talking to Mason before, and...

410
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:31,250
And?

411
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,609
This is hardly the time,
but I don't know how much time we have,

412
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:40,325
so... I just wanted you to know
that if you wanted to go out sometime...

413
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:44,008
- Michelle...
- I just wanted you to know how I felt.

414
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:46,004
No, Michelle...

415
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:49,805
I feel the same way.

416
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:55,329
I've just been keeping
my distance because...

417
00:34:56,813 --> 00:35:00,442
Because of what happened
between you and Nina?

418
00:35:02,973 --> 00:35:04,292
Yeah.

419
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:08,691
So you think I just want you
for your information?

420
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:15,811
So... what are we saying here, then?

421
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:19,162
If we save LA from a nuclear bomb,

422
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:23,166
then you and I can get together
for dinner and a movie? Is that it?

423
00:35:26,933 --> 00:35:30,289
- I'll get that list.
- Yeah, that's...

424
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:43,208
Syed Ali left... after he killed Mr Koplin.

425
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:48,611
They talked for a minute or two.

426
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:52,411
They looked at me a couple of times.

427
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:59,811
It was like...
like I wasn't important any more.

428
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,489
They embraced, and he left.

429
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:13,247
Did they say anything to each other
when he was leaving?

430
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:17,292
Yes, but... they spoke so softly.

431
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:19,841
And mostly in Arabic.

432
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:24,210
Arabic? How can you be so sure?

433
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:28,127
My family lived in Saudi Arabia
when I was younger.

434
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:31,728
When my sister got engaged to Reza,
I picked it up again.

435
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:36,091
Can you identify any words that they said?
Anything at all?

436
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:43,452
Salat. They said "salat" several times.
It means prayer.

437
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:48,049
But I couldn't really hear anything.
They were so soft.

438
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,601
Baker, this is Jack. Get ahold of CTU.

439
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:53,491
I want a list of every mosque
in a 15-mile radius.

440
00:36:53,573 --> 00:36:56,883
- Mosques?
- They talked about prayer before Ali left.

441
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:59,407
- The time fits.
- Roger that.

442
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:05,689
- Did that help?
- Yes.

443
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:08,492
Yes, I think it did.

444
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:09,801
OK.

445
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:15,092
Kate, the normal protocol would be to transfer
you back to CTU for further debriefing.

446
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:21,412
But the truth is, I don't know
what Syed Ali looks like.

447
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:25,211
No one does, except for you.

448
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:30,167
I need you to identify him for me.

449
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:42,402
- Stanton.
- It's me.

450
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,604
Excuse me.

451
00:37:56,253 --> 00:38:00,166
- You know better than to call me here.
- They know about OPCOM.

452
00:38:00,253 --> 00:38:02,289
- How?
- I told them.

453
00:38:02,373 --> 00:38:04,728
- What?!
- David had the bit between his teeth.

454
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:07,168
He was gonna find out one way or another.

455
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:10,962
This way, I get him trusting
me again, little by little.

456
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:15,285
- What do we do now?
- They'll connect you to the plane.

457
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:19,366
David's having an arrest warrant
drawn up as we speak.

458
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:23,685
Stay the course, Roger. When this is over,
you'll have everything you want.

459
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:27,402
While, in the meantime,
it's important that you don't talk.

460
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,848
- Don't talk about you.
- That's right.

461
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,686
It's more important than ever
that I stay in place.

462
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:35,651
- How much time do I have?
- Not much.

463
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,124
Hold on.

464
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:48,569
Here's the shipping order.
It was entered last January.

465
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:52,248
- Bob and I were both in Europe then.
- So he logged on from overseas.

466
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:58,249
That's not possible. It's not international. But
it didn't originate from this terminal either.

467
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,692
Somebody hacked in.

468
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:11,410
Hold on. This can't be. I set up
this program on my own computer.

469
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:16,810
- You said you were out of the country.
- I left my laptop here.

470
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:19,965
Who else had access to it?

471
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,930
Nobody.

472
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,165
Except...

473
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:31,492
Marie?

474
00:39:32,613 --> 00:39:35,491
I didn't expect you to find anything.

475
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:38,565
I underestimated you.

476
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:11,011
Well then, the last two years have just been...

477
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:15,330
It's just been an act, is that it?
I mean nothing to you?

478
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,131
Huh?

479
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,886
I don't understand. Say something, Marie!

480
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:31,410
Reza... you really are very sweet.

481
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:14,725
