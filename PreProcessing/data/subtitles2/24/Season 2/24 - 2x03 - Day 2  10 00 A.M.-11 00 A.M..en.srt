1
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:17,007
Just got off a conference call
with NSA and Division.

2
00:00:17,093 --> 00:00:20,881
There's a nuclear bomb, under terrorist
control, somewhere in Los Angeles.

3
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:23,043
It's set to go off at some point today.

4
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:25,765
George, where are you going?

5
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:27,525
- Bakersfield.
- Why?

6
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:31,242
- I don't have to tell you.
- You're trying to get outside the blast radius.

7
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:35,451
Sir, we have a serious situation.
Taking time out to coddle the media...

8
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:42,291
Once the rumour mill starts, we've got two
problems. We don't need mass hysteria.

9
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:45,087
My sister is getting married today, Ralph.

10
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:49,769
We have to establish whether or not there's
a connection between Reza and the terrorists.

11
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:52,242
A passport would be ideal.

12
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,651
You'll be dropped
three blocks from the salvage yard.

13
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,088
We haven't seen Wald come in yet.

14
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:02,210
That's Eddie Grant,
one of Wald's main go-to guys.

15
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:05,091
- You haven't changed much, Jack.
- What's your point?

16
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:07,733
I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule.

17
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:09,007
What are we doing?

18
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:12,529
Today we're turning a government building
into a cemetery.

19
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:15,252
- What building?
- The CTU.

20
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:20,523
Kim. Take my keys
and get her away from here.

21
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:24,685
Kim, stop the car. I will kill you.

22
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:27,446
Stop the car, Kim. Do not do this.

23
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:32,163
I need you to come over here. Right here.
Wait for me. I'm gonna go get some help.

24
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:34,403
Tell me where my daughter is, Kim.

25
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:39,444
Megan? Megan?

26
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,402
Megan! Megan!

27
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:52,404
Megan!

28
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:53,846
Megan!

29
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,083
Megan! Megan!

30
00:01:56,173 --> 00:01:59,165
Have you seen a little girl? Nine, blonde hair?

31
00:02:03,013 --> 00:02:05,368
I'll be fine, OK? I'll be fine.

32
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,891
You are Gary Matheson?

33
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:10,608
Yeah.

34
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:12,843
About time you got here. Where you been?

35
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,322
We just got the call five minutes ago, sir.

36
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:18,052
You're reporting a child abduction?

37
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:21,170
It's my daughter. She took my daughter.

38
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:23,164
Describe the suspect for me.

39
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:25,767
I can do better than that. Her name is...

40
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,730
Could you stop, please?

41
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,883
Her name is Kimberly Bauer.

42
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:33,761
- She works for my wife and me.
- I need a description, sir.

43
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:38,926
- Mason.
- It's Tony. How far out of the city are you?

44
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:39,923
Why?

45
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:42,846
I just got off the line
with Steve Lawler from District.

46
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:44,332
About what?

47
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,325
LAPD made a vehicle match
with somebody on our watch list.

48
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:51,611
- He wants you to check it out.
- This is coming out of LAPD? Come on.

49
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,765
Lawler doesn't trust their judgment,
so he wants you there.

50
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,606
Plus he knows it's on your way to Bakersfield.

51
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:00,571
I know you're headed out there
to follow up on a lead,

52
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,803
but Lawler wants this checked out.

53
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:04,008
What's the address?

54
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:10,087
Before you go to your press conference,

55
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:14,451
Rayburn wanted me to give you
this updated damage projection.

56
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,604
These casualty figures are higher.

57
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:23,163
They have all but ruled out dirty bombs
and conventional weapons.

58
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:27,292
They feel that we are actually
dealing with a nuclear bomb.

59
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,446
Megan!

60
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:38,048
Megan!

61
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:46,966
Megan!

62
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:51,211
Get away from her! Get away!

63
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:55,726
Where did you go? I told you to wait.

64
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:56,609
Huh?

65
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:59,446
I was looking for you.

66
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,124
Oh, God. OK, OK.

67
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,564
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,609
I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK.

69
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,604
You're gonna take that building down
with three charges?

70
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,649
It's all in the placement, Jack.

71
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,725
- Did you guys spread those fuses?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,529
What made you target CTU anyway?

73
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,685
Why are you asking so many questions?

74
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:49,927
- I just wanna know what I'm getting into.
- Nobody asked you to get into this.

75
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:55,007
The time comes, all you gotta do is keep
your eyes open and we'll do the rest.

76
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:58,288
Whatever you say, Eddie.

77
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:10,964
- Yeah.
- Dad.

78
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:14,168
- Did you get my message?
- Listen to me...

79
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:19,725
- I left it on your phone about an hour ago.
- I lost my phone. Gary flipped out on me.

80
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:21,166
Can you find it?

81
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,448
- Find what?
- Your phone.

82
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:28,323
I'm in trouble. I need you to come get me.
I can't go to the police with this.

83
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:34,166
- Where are you?
- I'm at a payphone on Spring Street.

84
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:38,883
- What's the number?
- Dad, I want you to come get me.

85
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:41,203
I can't do that.

86
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,443
Why not?

87
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,647
Why don’t you go to Carol's?
I'll call you there.

88
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,803
- Aunt Carol's?
- Yeah.

89
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:52,772
- She lives in San Jose, Dad.
- I know where she lives.

90
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,492
Dad, you're acting really weird right now.

91
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:58,565
Just go there.
And for once do what I ask, OK?

92
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,011
- Who was that?
- My girlfriend.

93
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:17,484
I asked her to pick something up for me.
She just doesn't listen.

94
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:30,812
Tony, Jack Bauer's daughter on line five.
She sounds pretty freaked.

95
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:35,011
- Kim, this is Tony. You all right?
- I just spoke to my dad. He's acting strange.

96
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,926
- He pretty much hung up on me.
- He's on a job, Kim.

97
00:06:38,013 --> 00:06:41,050
Since when?
I just saw him a couple of hours ago.

98
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,044
Maybe I can help you out.

99
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:46,091
It's messed up. I have the police after me.

100
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:49,961
- Why?
- I didn't do anything wrong. I've just been...

101
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,733
Kim? Hello, Kim?

102
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:56,527
Hello?

103
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,889
Kim? The connection's messed up.

104
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:02,407
Tell me where you are
and somebody'll pick you up.

105
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:05,371
- I can't stay here.
- Can you find a way to CTU?

106
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:08,570
Yeah, I guess so. I can take the bus.

107
00:07:08,653 --> 00:07:12,248
Do that. When you get here
I'll help you straighten everything out.

108
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,244
OK.

109
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,766
Come on.

110
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,844
There's noise on all the phone lines.

111
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:21,562
I tried a filter and I can't get rid of it.
It may not be our system.

112
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:25,009
Today of all days.

113
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:30,087
Call the phone company, and switch
all priority calls to wireless protocol.

114
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:38,568
- You trying to knock out their phone lines?
- Don't bug me. I'm working.

115
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:42,965
We're causing some interference
so the phone company sends out a crew.

116
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:46,841
Maybe you could go out to the road, Jack.
Keep an eye out.

117
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:50,042
Sure. No problem.

118
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:14,441
- CTU operations. Go ahead.
- Hello? Is this CTU? Can you hear me?

119
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:16,524
Hello? Damm it.

120
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:27,567
- Northwest Regional.
- This is Jack Bauer from CTU.

121
00:08:27,653 --> 00:08:30,451
- I need to speak with the president.
- Who is this?

122
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:36,324
It's Jack Bauer.
Priority access code 7117A. This is urgent.

123
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:39,405
- Hold, please.
- Please don't put me on hold.

124
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:47,484
- Lynne Kresge.
- I have a Jack Bauer for the president.

125
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:51,566
- He has a clearance code.
- Put him through to me, please.

126
00:08:51,653 --> 00:08:55,407
- Mr Bauer, this is Lynne Kresge.
- I need to speak with the president.

127
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,088
I'm terribly sorry.
He's with the press corps right now.

128
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:01,321
Mr Bauer, hello?

129
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:05,201
CTU's phone lines are down.
I need you to get them an urgent message.

130
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:06,408
What is it?

131
00:09:06,493 --> 00:09:10,532
CTU, Los Angeles, is going to be blown up
within the hour. Wald's group is doing it.

132
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:13,605
- Is this the nuclear bomb?
- No, it is not the nuke.

133
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:16,810
But you need to evacuate CTU
and you need to alert a bomb squad.

134
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:19,885
- There are at least three charges on the...
- Jack.

135
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,724
All set, Jack.

136
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:32,329
I applaud Governor Schulman's efforts
to protect Oregon's endangered species.

137
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:36,850
His work with the Natural Resources Defense
Council has created a new paradigm...

138
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:39,925
Wald's crew is planning
to blow up CTU, Los Angeles.

139
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:43,608
It is a non-radiological attack,
and it is happening within the hour.

140
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,287
- Where'd you get this?
- Jack Bauer.

141
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:53,723
They wanna cripple CTU's investigation,
divert attention away from the major strike.

142
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:57,362
- I agree.
- Has Bauer contacted CTU?

143
00:09:57,453 --> 00:10:00,126
He couldn't get through.
Phone lines are down.

144
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,886
- Somehow we have to warn CTU.
- No, we don't.

145
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,282
- We can't.
- What are you talking about?

146
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:09,127
If Wald's crew fails,
they'll think somebody tipped off CTU.

147
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,249
They'll figure out it was Bauer.

148
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,803
Are you seriously suggesting
we just let these people at CTU die?

149
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:18,522
- Jack Bauer gave specific instructions.
- Why isn't he stopping them?

150
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:21,685
Because he knows
he's gotta keep his cover intact.

151
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:26,483
He knows if he's exposed he can't get to Wald
and we lose our only chance to find the nuke.

152
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:31,044
- This is the president's decision.
- He's telling the press it's business as usual.

153
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:35,649
We've already detained Ron Wieland illegally.
We can't muzzle the entire press corps.

154
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:40,887
- We still have to tell the president.
- We will. When he's in a position to hear it.

155
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,091
- It will be too late by then.
- Lynne, this is my call.

156
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:48,082
I don't work for you.

157
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,689
- Jenny Dodge.
- It's Lynne. I need to speak to the president.

158
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:03,209
- He's in a press conference.
- I don't care. This is urgent.

159
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:06,842
- I want to speak with him now.
- OK. I'll try to get to him.

160
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:16,884
Hey, look at this.

161
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:20,008
Someone cut the chain.

162
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:23,688
Get on the radio to Dispatch
and have them send security.

163
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:27,603
Who are you?

164
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:32,525
Don't move. Don't move!

165
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:36,765
What's your name? What's your name?
Look at me. What's your name?

166
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:39,083
- Cam Strocker. Is that your name?
- Yeah.

167
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:41,971
Cam, look at me. You wanna live, Cam?

168
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,930
Cam.

169
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:49,208
- Cam. Cam. You wanna live?
- Yeah.

170
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,966
This is what you’re gonna do: call your boss,

171
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:55,363
tell him you need an on-site systems check
at CTU headquarters.

172
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,523
Got that?

173
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:00,252
Can you do it? Can you do it?

174
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,402
That's a good answer.

175
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,762
It's Eric Rayburn from NSA.

176
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:29,402
Mr Rayburn? This is Tony Almeida.

177
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:32,929
I understand you're the ranking agent on site.
Is that correct?

178
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:36,528
- Yes, sir, it is.
- Then I need you to execute an order.

179
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:37,568
Of course.

180
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:41,089
I want you to copy and transfer
your database onto our server,

181
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:44,165
anything related to the nuclear threat.

182
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:50,521
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, sir, I did. May I ask why?

183
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:54,367
It's precautionary, given
the extraordinary threat we're facing today.

184
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:57,729
- But I would like it done sooner than later.
- How soon?

185
00:12:57,813 --> 00:12:58,962
By 11.

186
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,965
The earliest I could get that done is by noon.

187
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:05,648
- You have until 11.
- Sir, that may not be enough time.

188
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,566
Then you probably should get started.

189
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:10,644
Thank you, sir.

190
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:13,925
- Paula.
- Yeah.

191
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:17,005
- I need to pull you off your SIM analysis.
- I'm almost done.

192
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:21,723
I want you to sort and send data to the NSA
server, everything relevant to the nuke, OK?

193
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:24,805
- When do you need it done?
- Right now.

194
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:27,566
I'm gonna have to generate
a fresh encryption code.

195
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:32,443
- I'm gonna need to use Mr Mason's office.
- Just do it, please. Thank you.

196
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:40,890
Tony, what's going on?
First the phone lines go down

197
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:44,727
and then NSA puts in a rush order
for us to transfer all our data on the nuke?

198
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:48,010
He says it's precautionary.

199
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:51,927
Then he would have issued
the same order to every other agency.

200
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:54,402
- Look into that, would you?
- Yeah.

201
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:15,284
How you doing? George Mason, CTU.

202
00:14:15,373 --> 00:14:20,652
Arroyo, LAPD. Barber made a vehicle match
from the alert you guys put out this morning.

203
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:23,042
- Have you checked inside?
- We were about to.

204
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,693
Our captain made us stand down
until you got here.

205
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:29,482
Relax, Sergeant. I wanna be here
even less than you want me here.

206
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,444
Hello?

207
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,282
What's this?

208
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:06,564
Nice.

209
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:27,012
You OK in there?

210
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,482
We got a man down in here.

211
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:37,052
Get out of the building!
Get out of the building!

212
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:40,569
Call Hazmat and have them
set up a quarantine.

213
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:43,042
I think we got a hot zone.

214
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,768
You OK?

215
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:16,844
Yeah?

216
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:23,082
Does your mom cry a lot?

217
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:26,243
I don't have a mom.

218
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,324
Where is she?

219
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,084
She passed away.

220
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:37,122
But you have a dad, right?

221
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:41,164
Do you make him mad?

222
00:17:43,613 --> 00:17:45,763
Sometimes.

223
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:48,447
I always make my dad mad.

224
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:52,931
No, when your dad gets mad,
it's not because of you.

225
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:56,050
- But he always says it is.
- Well, he's wrong.

226
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,966
I promise you he's wrong.

227
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:07,052
Everything's gonna be OK, Megan.
I'm never gonna let him hurt you again.

228
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,522
You know the drill.

229
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,085
How's it going?

230
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,688
- I'm doing a system check and line repair.
- Let me see your work order.

231
00:18:31,773 --> 00:18:36,403
My office just called a few minutes ago.
They spoke with McKendrie.

232
00:18:36,493 --> 00:18:39,053
He says you got
some serious noise on your lines.

233
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,522
- Let me see your ID.
- Sure.

234
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:53,206
You're doing fine, Cam.

235
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,284
Isn't he, Jack?

236
00:18:56,173 --> 00:18:58,562
Yeah, he's doing great.

237
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:11,208
- Is the back open?
- It's just my crew back there.

238
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:14,205
I still need to look.

239
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:16,284
Go ahead. It's open.

240
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:37,405
- There's a lot of you.
- It's a big job.

241
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:59,282
It's all clear.

242
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:04,242
All right. Go ahead.
Have your IDs ready for security up ahead.

243
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:21,212
This isn't a bank.
There's nothing to steal here.

244
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:24,205
- We're not stealing anything.
- Then why are we here?

245
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,329
We're taking back our country.

246
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:29,405
From who? Who are you people?

247
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:33,642
Jack, tell him who we are.

248
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,924
We're patriots.

249
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:09,770
Kate, it's for you.
Some guy named Ralph Burton.

250
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,844
Thanks.

251
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:15,164
So who is he? A new boyfriend?

252
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:18,001
Maybe.

253
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:21,407
Why can't I ever get
a straight answer out of you?

254
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:24,087
Can you just give me the phone?

255
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:29,609
- Hello.
- Kate.

256
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:33,368
Did you check
the passport information I gave you?

257
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:38,243
I'm afraid it confirms that Reza Naiyeer
has had contact with Syed Ali.

258
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:44,565
What does that mean?
Are you saying Reza's a terrorist?

259
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:47,087
The authorities need to determine that.

260
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:51,485
- Authorities? What authorities?
- I had to alert homeland security, Kate.

261
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:53,564
Are they gonna arrest him?

262
00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:58,443
I'm not sure yet, but until I hear from them,
please keep this to yourself.

263
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:01,085
I have to tell my sister.

264
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:06,406
You can't tell her or anyone else about this
until you hear from me again.

265
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:11,886
- I don't believe this is happening.
- I know it's hard, but just try to act normal.

266
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:15,170
My sister is marrying someone
who works with terrorists

267
00:22:15,253 --> 00:22:17,892
and you expect me to act normal?

268
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:23,366
You could endanger yourself and your family
if you let on that anything is wrong.

269
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,244
Kate.

270
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,052
Yeah. I understand.

271
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,932
Kate.

272
00:22:57,013 --> 00:22:58,844
- Come with us.
- Not right now.

273
00:22:58,933 --> 00:23:03,290
My cousin Sanjar just arrived. We wanted you
to meet him before he headed to the hotel.

274
00:23:03,373 --> 00:23:06,524
- I can meet him later.
- You'll probably recognise him.

275
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:09,491
- He was at Stanford the same time you were.
- He's cute.

276
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:11,962
No, really. No! I said no!

277
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:29,726
Kate, what is your problem?

278
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:34,443
I'm sorry, Marie. I just...
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

279
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:37,809
What did you mean?
You've been acting really weird all morning.

280
00:23:37,893 --> 00:23:41,363
What is it, Kate? Tell me, what's going on?

281
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,802
You're my little sister.
And I love you so much.

282
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:55,606
And... I just want you to be happy.

283
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:57,684
That's it.

284
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:03,887
Well, then, be happy for me, OK?

285
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:06,362
That'll make me happy.

286
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:09,889
Because this is gonna be
the best day of my life.

287
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,124
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

288
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:17,684
- No crying.
- I'm sorry.

289
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:21,368
- I'm getting married.
- I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

290
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,806
- Jenny.
- Yes?

291
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,282
I told you I need to speak to the president.

292
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:42,251
I have to draft a statement
anticipating the nuclear event.

293
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,847
- Why haven't I heard from him?
- He's on camera.

294
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,926
I told you this was urgent.
You should have slipped him a note.

295
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:54,246
I did. I'm sure as soon as the president
can extricate himself, he'll call you.

296
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,284
Let's get those portable units in here now.

297
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,933
Looks like this lead turned out to be real.

298
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:19,732
Some kind of lab where
they may have assembled the nuke.

299
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:22,930
- Based on what?
- They found radioactive material.

300
00:27:23,013 --> 00:27:25,607
What kind of radioactive material?

301
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:29,571
They're still doing field analysis on it.

302
00:27:29,653 --> 00:27:31,962
Was anyone exposed?

303
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:34,362
All of them in the bag.

304
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:38,844
They're putting us through decon now.
Precautionary measure.

305
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:44,370
We have three dead bodies. I'm gonna
send you photos and fingerprints on 'em.

306
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:46,683
See if they match anybody on our watch list.

307
00:27:46,773 --> 00:27:49,845
- Your phone, sir.
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

308
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:53,050
George, look,

309
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:56,250
NSA ordered us to send them
our case database.

310
00:27:56,333 --> 00:28:01,088
Paula's already on it, but I sense they're
keeping us out of the loop on something.

311
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:03,687
They're consolidating data from all agencies.

312
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:06,731
That's just it.
We're the only agency they've asked.

313
00:28:06,813 --> 00:28:09,691
Sir, the phone.

314
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:11,923
Tony, I gotta go. Call Chapelle.

315
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:15,688
Tell him what you just told me.
See what he can find out for you. I gotta go.

316
00:28:15,773 --> 00:28:19,686
- George, you sure you're OK?
- I'm fine.

317
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:25,923
I need all your clothes off.

318
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:28,811
You're not even gonna buy me dinner?

319
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:37,244
Check him over at hoses.

320
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:53,610
Easy, guys. I like my skin.
Try and leave some on.

321
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:09,486
Did you finish exporting
those files to Division?

322
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:15,170
No, it's in process now. As soon as they
finish uploading, I'll send an encryption key.

323
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,562
Paula, are you all right?

324
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:30,168
Yeah.

325
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:35,088
I was a little nervous before, but Tony said
everything's probably gonna be OK.

326
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:44,287
I grew up in LA, you know.

327
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:48,970
My whole family is here, my friends are here.

328
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:54,173
So if this bomb goes off, that just means
all of a sudden everyone's gonna die?

329
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:57,245
No. No, not necessarily.

330
00:29:57,933 --> 00:30:00,128
It depends on a lot of things.

331
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:02,966
Yeah, that's probably right.

332
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:06,125
Well, I should check the upgrade.

333
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:09,803
Paula.

334
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:12,487
Are you gonna be OK?

335
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:17,522
I guess so. I'm really scared,
but there's nothing I can do about it, right?

336
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:21,564
It's fine, Michelle.

337
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:34,290
- You gonna kill me too?
- Not today.

338
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:39,489
Just relax. Just relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

339
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:42,645
I'm trying to stop this thing. I need your help.

340
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:47,249
Two cars over there's a large grey SUV. I want
you to hide under it and wait until we go.

341
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:51,121
After we've gone, I want you
to take this back into the building.

342
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:53,852
Go to security, ask for Tony Almeida.

343
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:59,087
It'll show him where all the bombs
are located. He'll know what to do. Now go.

344
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:01,403
What are you talking about, man?
Who are you?

345
00:32:01,493 --> 00:32:03,609
I'm a government agent. I'm undercover.

346
00:32:03,693 --> 00:32:07,129
You work for the government?
And you let them kill Danny?

347
00:32:07,213 --> 00:32:10,808
- It happened before I could stop it.
- You son of a bitch!

348
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:14,845
Listen to me. Listen to me.

349
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:18,688
I'm sorry about your friend. I am.

350
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:24,291
But we are in a very serious situation, so you
better get your ass under that car right now.

351
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:28,127
These guys'll be back in a minute.
If you're still here they will kill you.

352
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:31,523
I won't be able to stop them.
Do you understand?

353
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,090
The lives of everyone in this building
are at stake right now.

354
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:41,768
So, please, get that message
to Tony Almeida.

355
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,804
Come on, go.

356
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:03,362
Where's your boy, Eddie?

357
00:33:11,013 --> 00:33:13,288
Jack? Jack?

358
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,930
Jack.

359
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:19,843
What happened? Where's the guy?

360
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:21,924
Look at me. Jack.

361
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:26,363
What happened?
Jack, look at me. What happened?

362
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:29,570
- I don't know.
- Where's the telephone guy?

363
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:33,612
I don't know. I was looking out
like you asked me to,

364
00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:36,969
and the next thing I know
you're slapping me in the head, Eddie.

365
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:40,807
What are you telling me, Jack?
Are you saying you let the son of a bitch go?

366
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,283
- I didn't tie him up.
- Are you saying it's my fault?

367
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:49,288
Do you believe this guy? He walks in
off the street, breaks Dave's ankle...

368
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,968
Back off! Back off.

369
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,613
Shut up. Jack, get in the front of the van.

370
00:33:55,333 --> 00:34:00,202
Get in the front of the van. We got seven
minutes until this building goes down. Get in.

371
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:49,448
Hi.

372
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:52,605
My name's Kimberly Bauer.
Tony Almeida is expecting us.

373
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,684
OK. He'll take care of you.

374
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:00,965
- Where are we?
- Don't worry. We're safe here.

375
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:29,007
- How much time have we got?
- Four minutes.

376
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,527
Unless the phone guy
already pulled the alarm.

377
00:35:31,613 --> 00:35:33,604
Leave it alone.

378
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:41,485
The press conference ended five minutes ago.

379
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:46,044
The president was supposed to call me
the minute, very minute that he...

380
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:54,049
What are you doing?

381
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:57,250
It was you. You told Jenny
to keep the president away from me.

382
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:00,086
I spared the president
from a no-win situation.

383
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:03,165
The people did not elect you
to make that choice, Eric.

384
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:05,892
- It's too late.
- Maybe not.

385
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:11,532
- Get out of my way.
- Don't do this, Lynne.

386
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:14,002
You do not want me for an enemy, I promise.

387
00:36:14,093 --> 00:36:18,086
- Are you threatening me?
- Just giving you some strong advice.

388
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:20,964
What's going on?

389
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:29,250
Jack Bauer called. He said that
Wald's crew is planning to blow up CTU.

390
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:33,406
It's a non-nuclear strike,
which suggests that it's a secondary target.

391
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:36,132
- When?
- We're not sure. Bauer got cut off.

392
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:38,647
- Have you called CTU?
- That's what we were debating.

393
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:39,802
Debating?

394
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:45,570
Right now Wald is our only thread to finding
the nuke. But Bauer hasn't got to Wald yet.

395
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:49,885
If we stop Wald's crew, they may realise
it was Bauer that turned them in.

396
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:52,726
In the meantime,
I'm having CTU transfer their intel

397
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:57,170
so our only losses would be
infrastructure and personnel.

398
00:36:57,253 --> 00:37:00,370
Those losses are unacceptable.
Contact CTU immediately.

399
00:37:00,453 --> 00:37:02,444
Yes, sir.

400
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:10,812
- Think I'm making a mistake?
- I do, sir.

401
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:24,047
Tony. That guy over there,
he's asking to see you.

402
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:27,330
He claims he was taken hostage
by these men that wanna blow up CTU.

403
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:31,850
He said there are bombs planted here,
here and here. I'll have a squad check it out.

404
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,764
- Order an evacuation.
- We don't know...

405
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:37,243
This is why NSA wanted us
to transfer over our database.

406
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:42,168
They knew we were being targeted and
didn't say a thing. We have to evacuate now.

407
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:43,891
Everyone, listen up.

408
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:49,366
This is Lynne Kresge. I'm calling
to tell you about a possible threat to CTU.

409
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:53,082
We just found out about it.
NSA knew about this a half an hour ago.

410
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:56,688
- That's why Rayburn wanted our files.
- Right now get your people out.

411
00:37:56,773 --> 00:38:01,289
I want you to go down this hallway
and calmly clear everyone out.

412
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:11,488
- What's going on?
- We're evacuating.

413
00:38:11,573 --> 00:38:15,452
- I'm looking for Tony Almeida.
- I'm sorry. We've gotta go right now.

414
00:38:28,053 --> 00:38:30,044
35 seconds.

415
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:42,368
I need you to move a little faster.

416
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:46,489
No, leave your things behind!

417
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:55,971
- What are you doing?
- I'm almost done with the encryption.

418
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:58,647
- Leave it! There's a bomb!
- We can't lose this data!

419
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,531
Would you leave it? Come on!

420
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:07,408
Let's go! Come on, hurry! Hurry!

421
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:37,691
- We did it, Jack.
- Good job, Eddie. Good job.

422
00:40:02,173 --> 00:40:05,370
We're too late. CTU was just hit.

423
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:17,122
- I want Mommy.
- I know.

424
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,164
It's OK.

425
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,207
You're clean.

426
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:33,682
Then why so grim?

427
00:40:34,453 --> 00:40:36,967
The tests are back from the field analysis.

428
00:40:37,053 --> 00:40:40,443
The substance you inhaled is...
well, it's plutonium.

429
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:46,324
Based on the particle size, atmospheric
saturation, length of time you were exposed...

430
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,324
Cut to the chase, Doctor.

431
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:52,406
Your radiation exposure level is high.
Definitely lethal.

432
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,973
How much time do I have?

433
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:02,762
Could be as much as a week
or as little as a day.

434
00:41:04,093 --> 00:41:06,084
I'm sorry.

435
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,567
