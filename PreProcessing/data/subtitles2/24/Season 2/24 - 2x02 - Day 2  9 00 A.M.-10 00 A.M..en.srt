1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:16,404
There's a situation, Mr President.

2
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:20,725
There's a nuclear device,
under terrorist control, that's on US soil.

3
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,326
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

4
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,881
This bomb is going to go off today.

5
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:28,886
Today's gonna be a very long day, and I don't
want my own people working against me.

6
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:31,562
Hey, you two! Cut it out.

7
00:00:31,653 --> 00:00:33,803
What? I can't kiss my own wife?

8
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:37,568
She's not your wife
for at least another 10 hours.

9
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:39,689
When you asked for
a background on Reza Naiyeer,

10
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:44,130
I was proofing a file on another individual.
Reza's name came up.

11
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:47,728
There's a man named Syed Ali
with ties to terrorist organisations.

12
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,289
- Hey, sweetheart.
- What are you doing here?

13
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:54,366
- I just wanted to see you. I miss you.
- Dad, it's too hard for me right now.

14
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:57,286
- Then why won’t you...
- Every time I see you, I think of Mom.

15
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,088
Are you a complete idiot?

16
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:01,652
I don't like when he gets like this.

17
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:04,327
I need a few minutes
with my daughter before I leave, OK?

18
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,608
Did I not tell you to get outta here?

19
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:08,684
Shut up! Shut up, Megan!

20
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,245
What am I doing here, George?

21
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,528
There's a rogue nuclear weapon
here in Los Angeles.

22
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:19,367
- How close are you to IDing a prime suspect?
- The most promising one's Joseph Wald.

23
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:21,842
Are there any witnesses
against Wald in his trial?

24
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,925
Marshall Goren. Apparently
without him there's no case.

25
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,844
You are Marshall Goren?

26
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,085
No, Jack!

27
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,767
- Are you out of your mind?
- You wanna find this bomb?

28
00:01:32,853 --> 00:01:35,413
This is what it's gonna take.
I'm gonna need a hacksaw.

29
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:50,688
Quantico wants permission to relay the
nuclear threat to their mid-level tacticians.

30
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:54,448
- How many people are we talking about?
- Between 600 and 700.

31
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:57,411
Only if they assure
they can contain the information.

32
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,849
I will confirm that
before I give them approval, sir.

33
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:05,768
I want everyone to know that, besides
the threat of a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles,

34
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:09,243
I'm just as concerned with the dangers
of panic and mass hysteria.

35
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,322
Absolutely.

36
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,007
So where are we on everything else?

37
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:16,483
Well, NSA is taking a two-pronged approach.

38
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:20,691
They're trying to pick up a trail
on any known Second Wave terrorists,

39
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:25,130
and they're also trying to source
stolen weapons-grade nuclear materials.

40
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:12,285
Yes, call the rep,
tell them what the matter is, OK?

41
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:16,286
Why can't she hang around?
I said I'd be back in a couple of minutes.

42
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:18,608
Thank you. Yes...

43
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:22,003
Hey, Kim. Stay there.
She's gonna be fine, OK?

44
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:24,766
We'll work this out
in a couple of minutes. All right?

45
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:27,048
Hey, Donny?

46
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,612
Yeah.

47
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:31,253
Yes, no... Uh... It's... it's...

48
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,412
I know it's late.

49
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:35,006
Why can't she...

50
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:36,731
OK.

51
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:40,567
Right, right. Yeah, do that.
Yes, I know. She's being a...

52
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:42,686
No, no, no.

53
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,333
No, everything's fine. It's fine.

54
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,447
Yes, I know...

55
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,522
Kim, take my keys. Get her away from here.

56
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:53,372
Right.

57
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,047
Tell them to wait until I get back, OK?

58
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,851
I'll call you back.

59
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:07,491
Come on!

60
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:16,407
Kim! Stop the car. I will kill you.

61
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:18,688
Stop the car! Do not do this, Kim.

62
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,444
Do not do this.

63
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,251
Star-Sat. Password, please.

64
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,723
7073. I need to track
the location of my car, please.

65
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:46,361
We'll drop you three blocks
from the salvage yard.

66
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,445
- What about the car?
- Ready, with a tracker in the trunk.

67
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:50,522
Good.

68
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,047
We haven't seen Wald come in the yard yet.

69
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,328
- What about his people?
- We're not sure.

70
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:58,211
Any of these men look familiar?

71
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:00,686
No.

72
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,329
Yes, that's Eddie Grant.
He's one of Joe's main go-to guys.

73
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:07,722
When I was undercover, we were friends.

74
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:13,410
As soon as I'm in, I don't wanna see any of
our people. You keep everybody at a distance.

75
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,882
You know any more about
the size of the bomb?

76
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,964
Not yet.

77
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:38,924
Sir, the press is asking questions.

78
00:05:39,013 --> 00:05:43,245
They know you cut your fishing trip short
and they'd like to know why.

79
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:48,321
If you'd like, I can get Jenny to take care of it.

80
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:51,644
- No, I'd better take care of it myself.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:55,962
- Sir, we've got a lot to cover.
- I have to deal with the press.

82
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:59,932
Sir, we have a serious situation
and taking time out to coddle the media...

83
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:04,723
What you don't get, Eric, is that once the
rumour mill starts, we've got two problems.

84
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:06,849
The last thing we need is mass hysteria.

85
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:22,606
- Mason.
- George, it's Jack. Let me speak to Tony.

86
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,968
- What do you need?
- Have you picked up Kim yet?

87
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:28,602
Grothy just got to the house
a few minutes ago. Kim wasn't there.

88
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:32,652
- What do you mean? Where is she?
- We don't know. She wasn't at the house.

89
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,167
I told you to tell me when you knew anything.

90
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:38,006
I was just picking up the phone. Relax, Jack.

91
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,607
Don't tell me to relax, George.

92
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:44,368
Grothy's gonna wait until Kim gets back.
Meantime, you hang in there.

93
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:46,921
George, just find Kim, OK?

94
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:51,006
That's what we're doin', Jack.
We're gonna find her and get her out of LA.

95
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,928
- Trust me.
- OK. Thank you.

96
00:07:09,373 --> 00:07:13,332
- Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message.
- Hey, sweetheart. It's your dad again.

97
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:16,723
I can't tell you how important it is
that you leave Los Angeles.

98
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:19,885
I'm sending a man over from my office.
His name is Roy Grothy.

99
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:22,851
He's gonna pick you up
and take you over to Aunt Carol's.

100
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,652
Honey, please, do this for me, OK?

101
00:07:25,733 --> 00:07:28,122
Call me back as soon as
you get these messages.

102
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:30,408
I love you. Bye.

103
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:39,171
Paula, have we gotten a Division update yet?

104
00:07:40,053 --> 00:07:44,808
Uh, yeah. Tony, shouldn't we
be working from outside LA?

105
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:45,928
Why?

106
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:49,688
If there's a nuclear bomb
somewhere in the city...

107
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:53,482
Try to tune it out, Paula.
You never know how good the intel is.

108
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:01,566
Almeida, we have a lead. Just caught
a couple of coyotes at the border.

109
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:04,565
- Who were they bringing in?
- Not who, what.

110
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,928
Michelle, you want to pull it up?

111
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:09,049
Two forged Middle Eastern passports.

112
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:13,126
The markings on the paper conform to
a process used by some of our suspects.

113
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:16,489
They were headed for Culver City.
Let's get somebody over there.

114
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:18,564
- Who?
- Who's in the area?

115
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:22,123
- The only one in that section is Roy Grothy.
- Good. Send him.

116
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,249
- George...
- What?

117
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:28,690
- That's who we sent to pick up Kim Bauer.
- He's idling over there. Kim's not around.

118
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:31,003
We promised Jack we'd take care of her.

119
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:36,326
Fine. We'll send a gofer until he gets back.
In the meantime, don't lose this window.

120
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,411
- Hey, cowboy.
- Can I help you?

121
00:09:18,493 --> 00:09:20,563
- I'm looking for Joe.
- Joe?

122
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,564
Joseph Wald.

123
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:25,247
Sorry, man. I think you got the wrong place.

124
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,564
Hey, cowboy. I ain't got a whole lot of time.

125
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:32,089
Why don’t you tell Joe Jack's back in town,
see what he says?

126
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:34,368
Why don't I tell him, Jack?

127
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:42,326
Why don't I tell Joe Jack Roush is here?
He'd love to see the guy that put him in jail.

128
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:48,732
Hey, Eddie. I just came to square things up
with Joe. You know I didn't put him in jail.

129
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,408
Sure you didn't.

130
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:58,768
Get the back room ready.

131
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:02,841
Damm it, Eddie.
I got something I need to show Joe.

132
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:05,527
The only thing he's gonna
wanna see is you... dead.

133
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,808
What about Marshall Goren?

134
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,052
What about him?

135
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:15,332
Word on the street is that he turned
state's evidence, gonna put Joe away for life.

136
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:17,968
Go on, Eddie. Look in my bag.

137
00:10:21,973 --> 00:10:25,204
- What for, Jack?
- Think of it as a present for Joe.

138
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,725
I told you, I wanted to
square things up with him.

139
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:36,244
Frank, give me that bag.

140
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:47,444
Just open it.

141
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:59,483
What the hell, Jack.

142
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:03,808
I don't think you gotta worry
about Goren testifying any more.

143
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:25,288
Jack's back.

144
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:43,882
Fortunately for me
the vice president arrived when he did.

145
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:47,010
We were both running out of small talk.

146
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:49,565
Mr President?

147
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:52,683
- Mr President?
- Jane.

148
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:57,369
We were told you were going fishing this
morning. What brought you back so early?

149
00:11:57,453 --> 00:12:02,368
I already caught my quota. My conservation
policy is coming back to haunt me.

150
00:12:03,573 --> 00:12:07,327
- Mr President...
- Look, let's not have so much fun all at once.

151
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:11,088
We're here for a couple of days.
I'll talk to you guys later.

152
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:22,966
- OK, what did Wieland want?
- I think he's putting it together, sir.

153
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:26,409
How can he? I just found out myself
less than an hour ago.

154
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,927
I'm sure he doesn't know the details,

155
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,005
but Wieland knows everyone
and they all owe him.

156
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:37,041
OK... Keep your eye on him for now.

157
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:41,285
If we go out of our way to put off the press,
they'll know something's up.

158
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:42,601
I agree.

159
00:12:43,573 --> 00:12:45,768
- I have to get back to the OC.
- OK.

160
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,124
What's this?

161
00:13:02,893 --> 00:13:06,522
- My head hurts.
- I know, Megan. We'll be there real soon.

162
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:09,605
- Where are we going?
- The police station.

163
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,684
You know what?

164
00:13:15,613 --> 00:13:18,081
We're gonna go down this alley.

165
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:31,721
Do something, Kim.
Make him go away, please.

166
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:50,452
Where are you going with my daughter, Kim?
Huh? Where you gonna go?

167
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,490
Megan, honey, get out of the car.
Come to Daddy.

168
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,328
Do something.

169
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:11,364
Get out of the car.

170
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,365
Hurry!

171
00:14:22,173 --> 00:14:24,050
Move! Move, move, move, move.

172
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,842
Kim!

173
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,084
Megan!

174
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,604
Megan, it's Daddy.

175
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:53,452
Listen to me, pal. Kim is gonna hurt you.

176
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:57,849
Megan, just call out to Daddy, OK?
I'll come get you.

177
00:15:01,813 --> 00:15:03,804
Megan!

178
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:05,689
Megan!

179
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:20,172
Don't get that stuff tangled. We won't have
time to separate them once we get there.

180
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,450
- Who's that?
- That's Jack.

181
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:28,127
Are you outta your mind
bringing him here today?

182
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,773
He used to work with us, Dave.

183
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:34,442
What the hell is that
supposed to mean, Eddie?

184
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:39,527
I used to work for Joe. I just did a nickel for
him up in Gainesville. That's what it means.

185
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:41,604
Oh-oh. Is that a fact?

186
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:46,088
And he happens to show up today
of all days? I'm not buying this, Eddie.

187
00:15:46,173 --> 00:15:48,971
He did a solid for Joe.
He took care of Goren, Dave.

188
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:52,045
- Well, if he can get to Goren, he must be...
- Hey, Eddie.

189
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:55,569
Look, man, I just need to speak to Joe, OK?
Then I'm outta here.

190
00:15:55,653 --> 00:16:00,283
- I hear you, Jack.
- If he's stayin', I'm checkin' him out.

191
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:04,730
- Don’t you have something to do, Dave?
- I'll bird-dog his records in two minutes.

192
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:09,807
Don’t you think it's worth two minutes
considering what's about to happen?

193
00:16:09,893 --> 00:16:11,884
Check it out.

194
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:18,127
- Have a seat, Jack.
- OK.

195
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:27,610
- Jack what?
- Roush. R-o-u-s-h.

196
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,242
He's in. They just went online.
They're checking Jack's background.

197
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,801
Already?
The network addresses aren't ready.

198
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:43,806
Better send it to me now. Tony, did you
backfill those Gainesville end dates?

199
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:47,010
- Not yet.
- I need them now. They're looking for it.

200
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,642
- These guys don't waste time.
- I can't believe they got in so quickly.

201
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,645
- You want me to stuff some data in?
- They want this now.

202
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,442
I'm gonna forge their server portal
and hope they don't look too closely.

203
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:05,644
I'm not finding any
release documents on this guy.

204
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,849
What does that mean, Dave?

205
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,731
That means he's lying. That's what it means.

206
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,328
Keep lookin'.

207
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:24,847
Listen, Jack, if this time you did
in Gainesville doesn't check out,

208
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,288
I won't let you walk outta here.

209
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,762
It's gonna check out, Eddie.

210
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:46,645
Anything?

211
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,724
No.

212
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:54,643
Come on.

213
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,964
- Tony, I need it.
- OK, I got it. Hold on, hold on.

214
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,484
It's still looking.

215
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:19,611
Wait a second. I think I found it.

216
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:28,568
Yeah, here it is. It just took a little longer
to come up than I thought it would.

217
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,484
Told you it would check out.

218
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:46,252
You almost made me shoot a friend, Dave.

219
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:52,811
I'm sorry about that, Jack.
You still got that '64 Mustang?

220
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:57,048
No, the lawyers got that.

221
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,844
Eric.

222
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:16,848
Are we narrowing things down at all?
I mean, are we making any headway?

223
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:19,686
- It's too soon to tell.
- Too soon?

224
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:23,402
Aren't we assuming that this bomb
could go off at any moment?

225
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:27,611
What can I say? I've never been sanguine
about our chances of stopping it.

226
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:30,287
Not with just a few hours' warning.

227
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:33,971
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm not giving up, sir.

228
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:37,841
Every protocol is being followed,
every resource tapped.

229
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:44,088
But I would give serious thought to your plan
of action if in fact we have a detonation.

230
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:50,044
I still feel a discussion with the Pentagon
this morning is in order.

231
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:54,087
Fine. Thanks, Eric.

232
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:55,162
Yes, sir.

233
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:05,284
Come in.

234
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:10,290
I just spoke with Jenny.
I'm afraid we have a problem.

235
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:12,568
- What now?
- Ron Wieland.

236
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:17,522
He's convinced the network to give him
a 10-minute live report today at noon.

237
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:18,602
For what?

238
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:23,050
He's heard the alert condition has changed
and that you are managing a situation.

239
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:24,964
Damm it.

240
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:28,841
- He's going live based on what?
- Jenny doesn't know, sir.

241
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:33,529
But I'm assuming that he will avoid the facts
and present the rumour.

242
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:42,333
- I'm sorry, Lynne. I'm not mad at you.
- There's no need to apologise, sir.

243
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:45,211
How would you like to proceed?

244
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:52,208
Set up a private interview
in 10 minutes with Mr Wieland.

245
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:55,205
- The condition is no one's to know.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,889
And, Lynne...

247
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:00,604
Get Armus over here.

248
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:06,211
Yes, sir.

249
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,127
Hey, man. How you doing?

250
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:27,125
- Get the hell outta here.
- I just wanted to bum a smoke.

251
00:21:27,213 --> 00:21:29,807
I don't smoke, so get out.

252
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:35,010
You're packing the fuses a little tight, sport.

253
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,084
What did you say?

254
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:40,762
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!

255
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:43,970
- Makin' friends, Jack?
- The guy's a moron.

256
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:47,409
- What did Joe say?
- Joe's busy. Maybe tomorrow, bro.

257
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:49,529
I just need to see him for five minutes.

258
00:21:49,613 --> 00:21:53,970
We got this thing going down today, Jack,
so swing by tomorrow around four.

259
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:58,684
Yeah, OK. That's cool.

260
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:03,888
It's good to see you, man.

261
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,366
Good luck.

262
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,564
It's time, Dave.

263
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,284
- Mason.
- George, it's me.

264
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:46,412
- Did you get to Wald yet?
- Not yet. His crew are shutting me out.

265
00:22:46,493 --> 00:22:49,007
- George, you gotta pick these guys up.
- Why?

266
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,368
They're packing charges. They're involved.

267
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,251
If we pick 'em up, are they
gonna lead us to Wald in time?

268
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,322
I don't know.

269
00:22:55,413 --> 00:23:01,124
Well, stick with them until they do. NSA just
upgraded his probable role in today's threat.

270
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,603
Put him just a click away
from the Second Wave terrorists.

271
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:07,082
OK, I'll try and figure something out.

272
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,730
Damm it.

273
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,970
- Mr Mason?
- Yeah.

274
00:24:27,053 --> 00:24:29,851
I've opened up that socket
to Division you asked for.

275
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,924
Thank you.

276
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:53,484
George, where are you going?

277
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:56,088
- Bakersfield.
- What for?

278
00:25:56,933 --> 00:26:00,892
Following up on a lead. We're short-handed
today so I gotta cover it myself.

279
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:04,488
- Peter's assigned to Bakersfield.
- I put him on something else.

280
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:07,610
- What?
- I don't have to tell you that.

281
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:10,332
Well, I guess I disagree.

282
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:14,372
I mean, if you're just trying
to get outside the blast radius...

283
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,447
Who the hell do you think you are?

284
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:23,605
- Do you have access to my information?
- No, George, I don't.

285
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:26,605
Then keep your mouth shut and do your job.

286
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,090
Get down!

287
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,043
- I feel funny.
- What's wrong?

288
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:10,283
- My head hurts.
- Where?

289
00:27:10,373 --> 00:27:12,364
Right there.

290
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:16,729
- Is that where you hit your head?
- I think so.

291
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:22,649
Honey, we can't stay here. I need to
make a phone call. You can rest then.

292
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:24,132
- No!
- Why not?

293
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:28,604
- I can't. My head really hurts...
- It's just over there. It'll be really quick.

294
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:30,684
Please, for me. You can do it.

295
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:33,845
- No, I can't. I don't feel good.
- OK, listen, listen. Shh...

296
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,128
We have to stay quiet, Megan.

297
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:40,323
What do you wanna do? Stay here? Yeah?

298
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:43,405
OK. But you have to wait.
You promise you'll stay here?

299
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,484
You promise?

300
00:27:46,293 --> 00:27:49,922
We're gonna put you in these boxes.
I'll be right back.

301
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:55,247
- I don't want you moving.
- I won't.

302
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:58,848
I'm gonna be really quick.
Please, just don't go anywhere.

303
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:01,163
I'll be right back.

304
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:07,646
- This is Burton.
- Hi, it's Kate Warner.

305
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:10,805
- Did you get something for me?
- No, I couldn't get his wallet.

306
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:15,250
There are only a few things we can use
to check out his connection to this guy Ali.

307
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:19,485
- Actually, a passport would be ideal.
- I don't think he carries that around.

308
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:24,601
It's gotta be around somewhere.
Check his briefcase. Look in his car.

309
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:28,527
- Ralph, I can't just steal his passport.
- You won't have to.

310
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:34,210
Just write down the countries that have been
stamped for entry over the last six months.

311
00:28:34,293 --> 00:28:35,692
Let me know, OK?

312
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:15,644
Kate!

313
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,207
- What are you doing?
- l, uh...

314
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:29,172
Craig said more vans were coming
and they needed the space.

315
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:34,008
- How you gonna drive it without the key?
- I was looking for it.

316
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:37,165
- Well, why didn’t you call me?
- You were busy.

317
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:41,961
I'm running for strawberries.
When I come back, I'll park on the other side.

318
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:44,044
Great.

319
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:20,883
What are you still doing here?

320
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:24,443
- My car won't start.
- Well, take a cab. Beat it.

321
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:30,365
You need to learn to mind your own business.

322
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:33,727
- Hey, Eddie.
- What?

323
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:36,008
I hope this job isn't too important.

324
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:40,132
Junior here packed your fuses too tight.
There's no way it'll blow. He's a joke.

325
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,844
See what I'm telling ya?

326
00:31:48,893 --> 00:31:50,884
Agh!

327
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:53,962
Jack!

328
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:02,210
It's broken. He just broke my ankle.

329
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:10,448
- You broke his damn ankle, Jack.
- He shouldn't have been playing with adults.

330
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:40,762
This is the 911 emergency operator.
Please stay on the line.

331
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:50,524
Who are you calling, Kim? The police are
looking for you for kidnapping my daughter.

332
00:32:50,613 --> 00:32:52,604
- Let go of me.
- All right. OK.

333
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,649
I'm sorry.

334
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,566
I'm not gonna hurt Megan. I promise.

335
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:06,163
I know it was wrong of me to push Carla,
but I have been under a lot of pressure lately.

336
00:33:06,253 --> 00:33:08,244
You don't understand.

337
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:13,165
I'm not a bad person. OK?

338
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:20,371
You were right to take Megan away from that
situation. I would have done the same thing.

339
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:24,002
But, listen... I'm her father, OK?

340
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:30,083
I need to apologise to her and tell her
that she doesn't have to be afraid of me.

341
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:36,209
You understand that, right?

342
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:39,289
Yeah.

343
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:43,882
Where is she?

344
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:54,323
Why don’t you go home and talk to Carla?
If it's OK with her, I'll bring back Megan.

345
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:57,246
- You don't tell me what to do, OK?
- I'm not...

346
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,643
You don't tell me what to do.
Tell me where my daughter is!

347
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,926
Tell me where my daughter is, Kim!

348
00:34:36,013 --> 00:34:37,332
Tell me!

349
00:34:50,253 --> 00:34:53,689
And the last entry is Frankfurt, May 19th.

350
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:56,970
- Great. That's a big help.
- So what does that tell us?

351
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:02,764
We'll compare Reza's travel dates with Syed
Ali's. See if we can find a terrorist connection.

352
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:06,323
Um... OK. Yes, that would be great.
Thank you.

353
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:09,046
There's the bride.

354
00:35:09,133 --> 00:35:13,046
Reza's parents are coming in early,
so I called Brent's and I ordered lunch.

355
00:35:13,133 --> 00:35:16,284
- Good. I'll pick it up.
- OK. Thank you.

356
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:19,410
I finally feel like everything is under control.

357
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:24,771
- Kate...
- What?

358
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:30,889
- I never thanked you.
- For what?

359
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:33,009
For everything.

360
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:36,290
For being the maid of honour,
for helping me with the wedding,

361
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:39,445
for... being my big sister.

362
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:43,012
- Marie...
- I love you.

363
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,964
Oh, honey.

364
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:48,089
Oh, I love you too.

365
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:53,044
Now, get to work.

366
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:11,448
- Ron.
- Mr President.

367
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,728
Good to see you. Come in.

368
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:18,411
Please, sit down. Can I offer you anything?

369
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:20,688
Oh, no, thank you, sir.

370
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:28,723
I understand you're about
to go live with a story today.

371
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,929
Just what is it you think is going on?

372
00:36:31,013 --> 00:36:35,848
I think the alert condition has been elevated
and you don't want us to know that, sir.

373
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:37,924
You think?

374
00:36:38,013 --> 00:36:41,483
Do you want me to tell you my sources?
You know I can't do that.

375
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:46,446
You're barking up the wrong tree, Ron.

376
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:51,163
I don't recall the last time a journalist
got a private interview with the president

377
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,244
on a few minutes' notice.

378
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:57,884
So... my 22 years in the business
tells me I'm barking up the right tree.

379
00:36:59,853 --> 00:37:01,844
I tell you what, Ron.

380
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:06,324
There's gonna be a briefing tomorrow.
If you want a 30-minute jump, I can arrange it.

381
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:08,404
Why are you horse-trading with me?

382
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:12,042
Because if you go live with a story
about unsubstantiated threats,

383
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:14,772
you will cause mass hysteria.

384
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:18,892
- That could be worse than the threat itself.
- So there is a threat.

385
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:21,965
Ron... we get them every day.

386
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:25,844
So you want me to sit on this,

387
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:30,324
even though it's my professional right
to take what I've got on the air?

388
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,602
Ron, you know me.

389
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:40,209
I've been more forthcoming with the press
and public than any politician you know.

390
00:37:40,293 --> 00:37:45,686
So when I ask you for a favour, I do it in the
spirit of what's best for the American people.

391
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:54,328
- Let me think about it.
- Fair enough.

392
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,406
- Thank you, Mr President.
- Thank you, Ron.

393
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,408
- Armus.
- Yes, sir.

394
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:26,325
- I think we're gonna have to deal with this.
- Yes, sir.

395
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:37,847
Mr Wieland, I'm Richard Armus. I'm with
the president's Secret Service Blue Unit.

396
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:41,130
There's something the president
wants you to see before you go.

397
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:44,649
- It won't take more than a few minutes.
- Let go of my arm.

398
00:39:01,053 --> 00:39:03,647
You haven't changed much, have you, Jack?

399
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:08,885
- What's your point?
- I'm short a man and I'm on a schedule.

400
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:13,443
I'm looking for work.

401
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:16,730
This isn't a job. You're gonna
do this for nothing, Jack.

402
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,327
My price is a thousand a day.

403
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:23,406
Well, Jack, I'd say you owe me a bit more
than that for what you did to Dave.

404
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:25,882
You do this, I don't tell Joe.

405
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:30,603
You don't do it, you'll be too busy
lookin' over your shoulder to find work.

406
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:36,446
- What's the job?
- You're gonna like it.

407
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,969
Megan...

408
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:54,248
Megan. Megan!

409
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,328
Megan! Megan!

410
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:01,204
Megan!

411
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:10,287
No! Megan! No!

412
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,130
Megan!

413
00:40:14,293 --> 00:40:16,090
Megan!

414
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:28,127
Megan! Megan!

415
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:35,010
Yeah, we're right on schedule.

416
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:39,325
We'll talk to you in about an hour.
All right, that's great. Rock out.

417
00:40:40,413 --> 00:40:42,927
- Where are we goin'?
- West LA.

418
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:46,085
- What are we doin'?
- A conversion.

419
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:48,047
What do you mean?

420
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:52,251
Well, today we're turning
a government building into a cemetery.

421
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:56,403
- Which building?
- A branch that's been dogging us for years.

422
00:40:56,493 --> 00:41:00,486
They call it the LA Counter Terrorist Unit -
the CTU.

423
00:41:02,413 --> 00:41:04,404
Good.

424
00:41:27,493 --> 00:41:31,372
