1
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:15,891
Vice president's on the line.

2
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:19,329
Jim, I have reason to believe
the Cyprus audio was fabricated.

3
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:21,404
I thought we proved it was real.

4
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:25,964
CTU LA is in the process of obtaining
intelligence that may show otherwise.

5
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:30,524
With all due respect,
it's too late for second thoughts.

6
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,764
- Come out with your hands on your head.
- I killed a man!

7
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:36,811
If you turn yourself in,
they'll consider that.

8
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:40,408
If I see you coming in, I will kill her!

9
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:43,802
Go, go, go!

10
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,929
- He wasn't working alone.
- What?

11
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,811
Baker was keeping an eye on Kate.
Michelle distracted him.

12
00:00:48,893 --> 00:00:51,930
- Did you help Jack take Kate Warner?
- Of course not.

13
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:54,573
Put a filter on all
of Michelle's communications.

14
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,723
Let me know when Jack tries to contact her.

15
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:59,566
- What's going on?
- Ten minutes ago a man called me.

16
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:04,169
Said he had proof the evidence the president
was basing his decisions on was forged.

17
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:06,448
He'll give me more info
if I bring you to him.

18
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,525
I got what you need. I won't give it to you
until you give me Kate.

19
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:12,252
How does the evidence prove
the recording was forged?

20
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,891
I have the source recordings.

21
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,804
Why did you follow me from CTU?

22
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:19,203
When you broke out, you isolated yourself.
You'll need help.

23
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:39,163
They're coming at us
from both sides of the alley!

24
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:42,287
The roof!

25
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:45,046
Fire escape!

26
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,847
Give me the keys!

27
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,842
- Here!
- Yusuf, give me cover!

28
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:09,563
Kate, get out of the trunk and stay down!

29
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:15,403
- Left! On the left!
- Go for the door now!

30
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:45,246
Kate, come with me.

31
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:49,610
Get down. Stay down!

32
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:52,765
- Who are these guys?!
- Follow-up team sent by my employers.

33
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,970
- Figured out they didn't get me.
- How'd they know you were here?

34
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:58,089
Beats the hell out of me.

35
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,930
- Jack, you there?
- Yusuf, are you OK?

36
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,605
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

37
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,082
I've managed to get
to the vehicle and rearm.

38
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:23,812
- What's out there?
- Three down that I know of.

39
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:28,125
There's three more. I don't have their
positions. I'll find a better vantage point.

40
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:32,092
We'll figure out what we're gonna do
in here. I'll get back to you. Stand by.

41
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:36,132
- Have him cover us. Let's get out of here!
- We don't know how many are out there!

42
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:40,411
- I'll call my person at CTU. She can help.
- Negative. You're not calling anybody.

43
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:45,487
The only way you get the proof Palmer needs
is if we do this my way. We go now!

44
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:49,771
They're trying to kill us.
Doesn't it prove something?

45
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:52,447
Not to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in DC.

46
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:56,731
- Call Yusuf, let's shape an exit strategy!
- Jack.

47
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:01,604
- Yusuf, go ahead.
- Sounds like another Humvee just arrived.

48
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:03,729
Son of a bitch. Stand by.

49
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,964
We're surrounded.
You've gotta let me make this call.

50
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:10,602
I've got someone on the inside
that can give us infrared satellite.

51
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:15,289
I guarantee you,
I will not jeopardise your identity.

52
00:04:15,373 --> 00:04:17,807
- Off line?
- Yes.

53
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,684
Do it.

54
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,327
- Dessler.
- It's Jack. Are we secure?

55
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:30,167
My cell's scrambled, but don't call
on agency numbers. I'm being monitored.

56
00:04:30,253 --> 00:04:32,483
You were right, Ali's recording was fake.

57
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:37,442
The president's about to invade the
Middle East based on falsified evidence.

58
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,650
- Do you have proof?
- Not yet, but I can get it. I need your help.

59
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:44,567
It'll be difficult. Tony's been breathing
down my neck since I helped you.

60
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:48,532
- Work around it. I need infrared satellite.
- Where are you?

61
00:04:48,613 --> 00:04:52,083
- Get the coordinates off our connection.
- What are you looking for?

62
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:55,165
We're surrounded.
There's three of us inside.

63
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,323
I need to know how many men are outside.

64
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:00,723
I got a friendly at the end of the alley,
behind the dumpster.

65
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:03,008
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.

66
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,202
- Yusuf?
- I'm here.

67
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:08,410
We're gonna be a few minutes.
We're waiting on satellite.

68
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:11,451
It's gonna take a while.
We should secure our position.

69
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:13,524
Come on.

70
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,523
- Is Mr Garcia gonna be all right?
- He'll live.

71
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:24,562
I'm gonna put down that you claim
the shooting was an accident.

72
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:25,642
It was.

73
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:31,683
He'll still have to explain to the DA what he
was doing going into the store with a gun.

74
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,245
- It wasn't his.
- What's that?

75
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:47,407
The gun, it was mine.

76
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:51,003
What are you doing with a gun?

77
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,690
Someone gave it to me earlier tonight.

78
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:01,723
Look, my name's Kim Bauer.

79
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,928
This afternoon,
I escaped from police custody.

80
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,527
And I'm a suspect in a murder.

81
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,045
While most Americans are asleep
and haven't heard the news

82
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:20,570
about the nuclear detonation in California,
many are up and are starting to react.

83
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:25,044
That reaction is taking many forms,
and in some cases violence is erupting.

84
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:30,002
We're still awaiting a statement from
the White House on who is behind the attack.

85
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:32,402
- That's enough.
- We hope...

86
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:36,884
- The alert status of the National Guard?
- They're ready in metropolitan areas.

87
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:41,728
- What about outside the big cities?
- We may have to get help from the military.

88
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:45,203
Local law enforcement
might not be able to do the job.

89
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:49,047
Call General Bowden,
tell him to put troops on standby.

90
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,124
The army? We can't do that.

91
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,493
- You're worried about posse comitatus.
- Exactly.

92
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:58,122
We can't use army or air force
on American soil. Only navy and marines.

93
00:06:58,213 --> 00:07:02,764
No, the navy can't help us. And there are
not enough marines on standby.

94
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:07,451
- I'll deal with the consequences. Call him.
- Yes, sir.

95
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,048
- The status of our bombers?
- They're proceeding to their targets.

96
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:13,249
- Where are they now?
- South of Greenland.

97
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,564
They should enter Middle Eastern airspace
in four hours.

98
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,928
Thank you.

99
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,363
What are you doing on the satellite?

100
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:33,202
Just checking on something.
Prepped the files for the next shift?

101
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:35,488
Yeah, I'm almost done.

102
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:39,847
I'm gonna go see if Tony needs some help.

103
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:59,083
- Hey... what's up?
- You asked me to keep an eye on Michelle?

104
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:03,052
- Yeah.
- She was accessing a mod-sat screen.

105
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,852
That's not unusual.
We've been on mod-sat all night.

106
00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:08,925
She received a call
that wouldn't lock onto our log.

107
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,402
- It was open?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,610
- It might have been Division.
- It might have been.

109
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:22,684
All right... find out what she
was looking at. Let me know.

110
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:54,003
Yusuf, what's happening out there?

111
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:00,129
I think they’re repositioning.

112
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:04,411
We're still waiting on satellite.
I'll get back to you.

113
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:16,603
With CTU's help, we're gonna
get out of here, I promise.

114
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:18,809
What does Wallace want with me?

115
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:22,602
- He needs you to get out of the country.
- Needs me? How?

116
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:28,165
With your father's CIA connections, his
company has a special travel dispensation.

117
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:33,366
They wouldn't let him on board
as a passenger unless...

118
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:35,887
I was on the plane with him.

119
00:09:35,973 --> 00:09:38,123
I know.

120
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:40,204
Kate.

121
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,926
I will not let you get on that plane.

122
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,291
Is there any way I can find out
how my boyfriend is doing?

123
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,331
I don't know about that.
Wait till we get to the station.

124
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:45,530
There was also another officer.
His name was Brown.

125
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:48,730
- He was in the accident as well.
- I don't know him either.

126
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:53,682
Look, miss, you're under arrest.

127
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:57,288
So, take my advice, don't say any more.

128
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:59,523
It doesn't matter anyway.

129
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:03,087
You can make a phone call at the station.

130
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,323
Who am I gonna call?

131
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:10,928
My dad was the one who was flying
the plane, the one with the bomb in it.

132
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:14,001
I don't have anyone any more.

133
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:39,964
- Almeida.
- She's looking at infrareds.

134
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:42,203
She's been collecting data.

135
00:11:42,293 --> 00:11:47,492
Pull coordinates off what she's looking at.
If it's for Jack, that's where we'll find him.

136
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,167
- I tried that.
- What's the problem?

137
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:53,165
She's covered her tracks.
She's pulled 100 quadrants.

138
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:55,767
I have no idea which one she's interested in.

139
00:11:55,853 --> 00:12:00,244
I'll tell you what, I'll deal with this, Carrie.
All right? Thanks.

140
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:21,010
- Yeah?
- I don't have a lot of time. Are you ready?

141
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:23,243
Give me one sec.

142
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:28,405
- OK, I'm ready.
- I count11, including your friendly.

143
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:31,246
I'm sending you their positions
on an infrared map.

144
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,406
They're all stationary except for one.
Jack, he's roving.

145
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,610
- OK, send it.
- OK.

146
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:43,844
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

147
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:46,652
How much longer do you need
to stay anonymous?

148
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:50,772
- I don't know, why?
- Tony's watching me. Gotta go.

149
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,492
- How are you holding up?
- All right.

150
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:57,290
- I've got so much to do.
- I know.

151
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:04,889
You always take a phone
with you to the bathroom?

152
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:08,409
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know.

153
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:12,281
We've been monitoring all communication
coming in and out all day.

154
00:13:12,373 --> 00:13:15,683
- If you're breaking protocol...
- I'm not.

155
00:13:15,773 --> 00:13:19,732
All right, then I'll ask you again.

156
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:23,408
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know.

157
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,484
But you have to call President Palmer.

158
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:31,727
Tell him not to act on the recording
until Jack finishes the investigation.

159
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:34,771
- So you have talked to Jack?
- I didn't say that.

160
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,045
Listen carefully, Michelle.

161
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:41,170
- You don't work for Jack, you work for me.
- Get past your ego...

162
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,609
Ego? You don't like the way
I'm doing my job, that's your problem.

163
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:49,483
But if you know anything about Jack Bauer,
you'd better tell me about it right now!

164
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:55,249
I have no information. I'm not helping Jack.

165
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,601
I hope you're not lying to me.

166
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,729
She counted nine, plus one roving.

167
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,169
If I was a sniper,
I'd cover the building from here.

168
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:22,051
- Yeah, looks right.
- We'll have to build a corridor.

169
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:25,443
- Which exit?
- This one right here.

170
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:29,924
Go between here, let 'em fire at each other.
It'll give us ten seconds to get to the car.

171
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:32,652
With just us firing?

172
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,324
We don't have another way.

173
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,522
Jack, I know how to shoot a gun.

174
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:57,567
Take this. You stay right behind me.

175
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,682
- Yusuf, this is Jack, do you copy?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:04,764
We're getting ready to make our exit.

177
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:07,287
- Let me give you positions.
- Go ahead.

178
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,364
We've counted nine, plus one roving.

179
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:14,447
We got two shooters on the balcony right
above me. Three in the building adjacent.

180
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,687
I just got off with the secretary of defence.

181
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:21,686
He wants to know how much longer
you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape

182
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,365
before we fail-safe the orders.

183
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:27,844
Jack Bauer will have up until the time
the planes start releasing bombs.

184
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:31,721
From the secretary's point of view,
that's tying the DOD's hands.

185
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:35,283
The longer it takes for your decision,
the less flexibility he has,

186
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,364
and he may want to launch a prestrike...

187
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,684
There will be no prestrikes on this mission.

188
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,732
We're gonna utilise every moment
we have to be thorough.

189
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,008
- He won't like that.
- That's his problem.

190
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,082
I understand.

191
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:51,927
Sir, there's a situation
that requires your immediate attention.

192
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,128
What, Mike?

193
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:56,410
Civil unrest is starting
to tip up and down the East Coast.

194
00:15:56,493 --> 00:16:00,088
The area I'm most concerned about
is outside of Atlanta.

195
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:01,526
What's going on there?

196
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,968
Some ad hoc militias have joined forces

197
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:07,329
and they're getting very aggressive
in one of the suburbs.

198
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,169
- Is this racially motivated?
- Yes.

199
00:16:10,253 --> 00:16:14,644
The demographics of the area
are predominantly Middle Eastern.

200
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:16,883
What do you hope to accomplish here?

201
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:20,010
We want Washington to know
we consider ourselves at war.

202
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,529
We want these people interned.
And if they won't do it, we will.

203
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:27,526
Who do you want interned? Most people
in this neighbourhood are US citizens.

204
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:31,003
They weren't born here.
Some of them don't speak English.

205
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:35,052
They memorise answers to 50 questions,
take the test, then we let them vote.

206
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,522
How do you respond
to claims that these people

207
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,411
have no more to do
with the bomb than you or I?

208
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:44,930
If we'd locked down our borders 20 years ago,
none of this would have happened.

209
00:16:45,853 --> 00:16:49,812
What's eerie is, even though the crowd
has been here for half an hour,

210
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:51,884
there are only a few police cars.

211
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:56,171
Why? I thought we ordered
the National Guard.

212
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:59,086
Some are on their way,
some are at other flash points.

213
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:03,928
- Want me to call the FBI and the army?
- And tell them what?

214
00:17:04,013 --> 00:17:06,811
- They've had their orders.
- The problem is resources.

215
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,771
We just don't have enough bodies
to cover everything.

216
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:11,969
Where's the media heading right now?

217
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,011
It's happening all up and down
the East Coast.

218
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:20,531
But this city, Marietta in Atlanta, seems
to have the most traction with the press.

219
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:25,770
All right. This is what we're gonna do.

220
00:17:25,853 --> 00:17:29,641
We may be short on manpower,
but it doesn't have to appear that way.

221
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:33,282
Send all the Eastern Georgia
National Guard to Marietta.

222
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:37,207
And tell the media that this is where
something's going to happen.

223
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:39,648
What's going to happen, sir?

224
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,087
If this is what the people
are going to be watching,

225
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:45,733
let's show them
how we're going to respond.

226
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:48,168
I want them to see
how we protect our citizens.

227
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:51,609
We will not put up with
racism or xenophobia.

228
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:55,527
If this is where it's gonna start,
this is where it's gonna stop!

229
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:25,048
All right, I'm all set up here.

230
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,772
Start laying down the smoke.
We're ready to go.

231
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:30,845
Copy that. Go in on the smoke.

232
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:48,967
You take the men on the left,
I got the ones right above us. You ready?

233
00:18:49,053 --> 00:18:52,841
Smoke's in place. I'll draw fire
and go pick up the vehicle.

234
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,849
Go!

235
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,887
- Kate!
- Jack!

236
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:26,123
Kate, get down!

237
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,483
Kate. Come on, we gotta keep going.

238
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:32,406
Keep moving!

239
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:36,287
Get in the front seat and stay down!

240
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:39,288
Get down!

241
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:04,922
Stay down! Go, go, go!

242
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:17,682
Let me look at it.

243
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,802
No exit wound.
We gotta get you to a hospital.

244
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:29,091
- No. LAX, cargo departures.
- You will not make it.

245
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:31,289
I'll make it. Just stop the bleeding.

246
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:36,288
Kate, in the glove box, there's a first-aid kit.
Get me all the gauze, pads and wraps.

247
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:40,732
Hold on, hold on.

248
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:44,168
Put pressure on it now.

249
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:46,084
It's a surreal scene in Marietta.

250
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:49,210
It's 4.30am and normally people
would be at home, asleep.

251
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:54,003
Yet today a showdown is in the making.
The riots have escalated all over the city.

252
00:21:54,093 --> 00:21:56,846
Fires and looting
are reported to be widespread.

253
00:21:56,933 --> 00:22:00,482
The National Guard continue to roll in,
as do the angry citizens,

254
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:06,489
who are taking out their frustration on this
peaceful Middle Eastern community.

255
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,645
You got what you asked for.
It's on all the news channels.

256
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:14,124
Manski of the National Guard wants to know
what tactical rule-set you wanna follow.

257
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:17,523
- What are they on now?
- Containment only.

258
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:19,604
Unacceptable. I want the law enforced.

259
00:22:19,693 --> 00:22:22,491
Tell him to start making arrests
and taking people in.

260
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:26,248
Sir, if you declare a curfew you can start
pulling every one of them in

261
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:29,848
- before this thing gets out of control.
- That a good idea, do it.

262
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:33,562
- Tell him we're not afraid to take action.
- Yes, sir.

263
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,884
What will help more
than anything, sir, is your voice.

264
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:40,283
You need to talk directly to the people.

265
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,684
I know.

266
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:47,372
Tell Jenny I'll be down in a few minutes.

267
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,609
- Murphy speaking.
- This is Novick. I need Jenny Dodge.

268
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:56,972
- Carrie.
- Yeah?

269
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,170
LAPD said there was automatic-weapon fire
in Studio City.

270
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,131
Police are finding bodies
and military-spec weapons.

271
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:07,286
We got the address. Check it against
what Michelle pulled off the satellite.

272
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,364
Right away.

273
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:13,091
Is that the location, Michelle? Huh, is it?

274
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:18,763
The police just got there,
they already got four bodies. So let's talk!

275
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:26,361
- Yeah, that's it.
- We gotta call him. He may need our help.

276
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:30,128
Jack made it clear that the only way
to get proof is if CTU stays out of it.

277
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:33,649
We don't even know if he's still alive!

278
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:45,728
He's on an open channel. You won't be able
to trace it, but you can talk to him.

279
00:23:48,573 --> 00:23:50,768
- Michelle!
- No, Jack, it's Tony.

280
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:53,492
Tony, trust me, stay out of this!

281
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:56,406
- What's going on?
- The president asked me for proof

282
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:59,451
that the Cyprus recording was fake.
I'm trying to do that.

283
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:04,607
The man who can provide proof will only
deal with me. He won't cooperate with CTU.

284
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,969
- That's why I left in that way.
- How do we know he's not using you?

285
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:11,966
Cos ten commandos tried to kill him
to stop him from making a deal with me.

286
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:14,647
- What's he want?
- He wants to disappear.

287
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:16,086
We'll deal with him here.

288
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:19,483
He will not cooperate with us
under those circumstances.

289
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:22,929
I understand, but this country's
about to go to war over this.

290
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:25,732
This is too big for one person
to handle. Even you.

291
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:28,088
Keep going straight!

292
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:30,641
Sorry, I can't do it.

293
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:43,768
He's still bleeding bad!

294
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,089
Hey, Bobby.

295
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,607
Is this Kim Bauer?

296
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:55,571
- I'll take her.
- What about processing her?

297
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:58,213
It's OK. Go fill out the report.

298
00:25:04,053 --> 00:25:06,487
Come with me.

299
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,643
We'll go in here.

300
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:20,003
Have a seat.

301
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:37,204
Looks like you've had quite a day.

302
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:41,047
- Yeah.
- You took Megan Matheson from her home.

303
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:45,206
- She was being abused.
- Got into a fight with her father.

304
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,729
Then, you took Megan again,
this time from the hospital.

305
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:53,045
- You stole Gary's car and fled the city.
- I had to. I knew about the bomb.

306
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:58,002
Understood. But then you were stopped
by CHP Officer Raymond Brown,

307
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:00,084
who discovered the dead body of Carla.

308
00:26:00,173 --> 00:26:03,051
- I didn't kill anyone.
- I know you didn't.

309
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,931
We know Gary killed his wife.
We're looking for him.

310
00:26:06,013 --> 00:26:09,403
There was a witness, and we found
his prints on the murder weapon.

311
00:26:09,493 --> 00:26:11,290
- You did?
- Yes.

312
00:26:11,373 --> 00:26:14,763
You're off the hook for everything
that happened this morning.

313
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:15,842
Thank God.

314
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:20,290
There's still the matter of you and your
boyfriend's attempted escape from custody.

315
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:26,289
Officer Brown was badly injured
in the accident. But he's gonna make it.

316
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:30,207
And we now know that you were
telling him the truth about the bomb.

317
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:32,090
So I'm free?

318
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:36,166
You should have somebody from CTU
call the DA's office on your behalf.

319
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:38,403
But yes, you'll be free to go.

320
00:26:42,173 --> 00:26:45,848
I know my father usually does this,
but I have clearance.

321
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:49,209
An officer of the company
has to be on the flight.

322
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:52,450
- I'll be on it. Can you hold on?
- Certainly.

323
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:55,127
- Where are you going?
- Jakarta.

324
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,243
Surprised I'm giving up my destination?

325
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:02,325
No. You'll just change it
once you're in the air.

326
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:07,051
Prep a cargo transport
to Jakarta, Indonesia.

327
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:09,442
Give us clearance so we can leave tonight.

328
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:12,525
Who else will be flying with you?

329
00:27:12,613 --> 00:27:14,604
What name should I give them?

330
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:18,811
- Passport, in my pocket.
- I got it.

331
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:27,722
- William Patterson.
- One moment, please.

332
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,169
Come on, stay with me.
He's losing consciousness!

333
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,403
Wallace, we can't take this chance.

334
00:27:37,493 --> 00:27:41,805
Tell me where the evidence is, and I give
you my word, I'll get you out of the country.

335
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:46,648
You know what, Jack? You were a real
badass back there at the warehouse.

336
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:49,167
Son of a bitch.

337
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:52,364
No.

338
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:56,571
- I'm losing him! Damn it!
- What are you doing?

339
00:27:56,653 --> 00:28:00,532
I wanna see if there's an urgent
care centre in the neighbourhood.

340
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:02,604
Come on!

341
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:07,243
Four blocks. Four blocks, make a right. Go!

342
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:13,849
I want ID's on the bodies.
See what traces are on the weapons.

343
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:17,846
- Bauer's actions are CTU's responsibility.
- We won't run from this.

344
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,731
- Let's find out who they are.
- Send in forensic teams?

345
00:28:20,813 --> 00:28:22,371
- Yeah.
- NSA and field units?

346
00:28:22,453 --> 00:28:25,843
Yeah, that's fine.

347
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:29,164
Mr Almeida,
Kim Bauer on line four.

348
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:34,603
- Kim, where are you?
- At a sheriffs station in Santa Clarita.

349
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:38,845
- What happened?
- I won't be charged for murder, but...

350
00:28:38,933 --> 00:28:42,812
- Look, I still might need some help.
- Sure, what do you need?

351
00:28:42,893 --> 00:28:46,647
They were taking us back to LA,
and my boyfriend and I tried to escape.

352
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:50,772
And we got into a car accident.
A police officer was injured.

353
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:54,687
- I'll call the DA's office, see what I can do.
- Thank you.

354
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:57,606
I'm sure you'd rather be talking
to your dad about this,

355
00:28:57,693 --> 00:29:01,527
but I know they probably told you
he's not available right now.

356
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,730
- What are you talking about?
- He's in the field.

357
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,563
In the field? You mean, he's alive?

358
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:13,407
Oh, my God, Kim.
You still think he died in the plane.

359
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:16,132
- He didn't?
- No, no. George Mason took over.

360
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,966
He was able to get out in time.

361
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:21,851
Oh, my God. When can I talk to him?

362
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:24,208
Not for a while, Kim.

363
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:36,644
Come on, come on, get him!

364
00:29:43,773 --> 00:29:46,048
- I need to see the doctor!
- You can't do that.

365
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:48,169
- Open the door!
- I will call the police!

366
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:52,769
- Lady, I am the police. Now, open the door!
- Let him in. Let him in!

367
00:29:54,613 --> 00:29:56,126
- We need you!
- What happened?

368
00:29:56,213 --> 00:30:01,287
He's been shot. I'm a Federal Agent.
He has information vital to national security.

369
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:04,843
I need you to stop the bleeding
and keep him alive.

370
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:08,243
This is a clinic. He needs a hospital.

371
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:12,451
We don't have time. You've got to do
what you can now. Doctor, please.

372
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:17,527
All right. Clara, get me suture kits, lidocaine
with epi, and a crash cart. Now, now!

373
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:22,129
The wound's right here.
He's got a bullet lodged in his back.

374
00:30:48,253 --> 00:30:51,723
- Hello.
- Miguel, it's me.

375
00:30:51,813 --> 00:30:56,329
- Kim. Are you OK?
- I'm fine. How are you?

376
00:30:57,613 --> 00:30:59,683
- I'm OK.
- Yeah?

377
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:07,053
Look, it's so weird,
but the police know Gary killed Carla.

378
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:10,603
We're not gonna be charged with anything,
except maybe the escape.

379
00:31:10,693 --> 00:31:13,765
But I think we're OK there, too.

380
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:17,368
- That's good.
- Good? It's great.

381
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:19,603
Yeah.

382
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:23,242
- How about you?
- I'm fine.

383
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,528
Are you sure? I mean, you don't sound...

384
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:30,164
I don't sound what? Excited?
Gee, Kim, I'm really sorry.

385
00:31:30,253 --> 00:31:33,529
Miguel, what's wrong?
Why are you acting like this?

386
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:40,367
- I shouldn't have let you talk me into it.
- Yeah, but it worked out.

387
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:44,287
For you. I'm the one
that's here in the hospital.

388
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:49,166
- You just said you were fine.
- I am going to be fine.

389
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:55,045
- I'm just gonna be fine without you.
- What?

390
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:59,562
- I don't wanna see you any more.
- Why not?

391
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:02,531
- There's no "why not", it just is.
- No.

392
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:06,003
Miguel, what is going on? Are you OK?

393
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:11,847
- I'm coming to see you right now.
- Kim, I said no. It's over.

394
00:32:13,373 --> 00:32:16,126
You mean that?

395
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:20,322
Yeah... I mean it.

396
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:12,570
I know the rules.
I know that I work for you.

397
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,611
And if you fire me, I wouldn't blame you.

398
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,002
This isn't about me firing you, Michelle.

399
00:33:18,093 --> 00:33:21,722
This agency is supposed to be supporting
the president and this country.

400
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,566
If I can't account for our actions,
we've got chaos.

401
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:29,773
Jack is in an impossible situation. I was
helping him get proof the audio was fake.

402
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:34,165
Yeah? Well, where's the proof?
We don't have any proof.

403
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:36,892
We don't have Jack,
he doesn't want to be found.

404
00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:42,326
What do you want from me, Michelle?

405
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:50,451
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

406
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:55,763
Yeah, well, you've said it.

407
00:33:55,853 --> 00:33:59,971
Now, if you don't mind,
I got work to do, all right?

408
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:27,490
Our planes are over the Atlantic.

409
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:30,326
They will be reaching
their targets in three hours.

410
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:33,689
- The pilots' communication posture?
- Comm is open to them.

411
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:36,128
The planes can be ordered back
at any time.

412
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:37,692
Good.

413
00:34:37,773 --> 00:34:41,846
I don't know if anyone's told you, but
the sooner we can lock this mission down,

414
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:45,005
the more comfortable
the Joint Chiefs will be with it.

415
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:48,847
My job's not to make
the Joint Chiefs comfortable.

416
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:51,367
Thank you. That'll be all.

417
00:34:51,453 --> 00:34:53,444
Yes, sir.

418
00:35:01,373 --> 00:35:06,163
Mr President. There's been
a development in Marietta.

419
00:35:06,253 --> 00:35:10,724
The National Guard took on a more
aggressive posture at our request.

420
00:35:10,813 --> 00:35:14,362
But the disturbance got to be
more than they could handle.

421
00:35:16,253 --> 00:35:18,892
What happened?

422
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:21,248
Two people were killed, sir.

423
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:26,691
The National Guard started shooting
rubber bullets, and there were two fatal hits.

424
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:31,650
One of the victims
was a leader of the dissent, and...

425
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:41,928
- And?
- And the other was a young boy, sir.

426
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:49,646
He was Middle Eastern, and he was from one
of the families that we were trying to protect.

427
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,407
What's going on now?

428
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:04,805
They've made some arrests,
but the crowd is still unruly.

429
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:09,205
Now, we might want to think
about taking a step back.

430
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:13,605
Maybe the presence of the National Guard
is making matters worse.

431
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:17,652
If we step back now, those families
are left completely unprotected.

432
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:19,769
Yeah.

433
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,844
A young boy.

434
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:26,644
What was his name?

435
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:30,004
The boy?

436
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:35,285
- I don't know, sir.
- The boy had a name. Find out.

437
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:38,368
Indeed I will, sir.

438
00:36:49,533 --> 00:36:52,411
It was a tragic accident.

439
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:03,445
Tell the National Guard to hold their ground.

440
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:07,492
I want that neighbourhood protected.
I want order restored.

441
00:37:07,573 --> 00:37:09,564
Yes, sir.

442
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:26,203
There's the bullet. It missed the jugular,
but still caused damage.

443
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:29,330
- What can you do?
- I might be able to tie off the bleeders.

444
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:33,850
- You can't get the bullet out without surgery.
- We don't have time for that.

445
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:36,288
I don't feel comfortable with this.

446
00:37:36,373 --> 00:37:39,570
They can shut me down.
I'm not authorised for this procedure.

447
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:42,611
I guarantee that won't happen.
I need you to do this now.

448
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:47,289
- At least tell me what this is all about.
- It has to do with the bomb that went off.

449
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:50,604
I'm sorry, I can't tell you more than that.

450
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:54,966
- All right, I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

451
00:37:55,053 --> 00:37:57,806
- Give him some Versed.
- No, don't sedate him.

452
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:02,444
I need him to be able to talk.
Just numb the area around the wound.

453
00:38:04,853 --> 00:38:09,005
Don't worry, beautiful.
I've been worse than this.

454
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:14,486
- He's gonna die.
- We better hope he doesn't.

455
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:19,283
OK, so we'll depart at 3.45?
That'd be great. Thank you.

456
00:38:20,253 --> 00:38:23,450
- Is he on?
- They gave us a departure time for 3.45.

457
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:24,807
Good.

458
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:27,930
He won't give you information
till we're off the ground.

459
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:30,652
I told you, I'm not letting you
get on that plane.

460
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:33,042
All he wants to do is get out of the country.

461
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:38,127
Soon as we get him to the airport, he'll give
us the information. The rules have changed.

462
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:41,604
Hold still, almost there.

463
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,728
Stop. It's done.

464
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:52,170
It's not done. Now, sir, please lie still
or I'll have to sedate you.

465
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:55,131
- I said, I'm done!
- Push the Versed now.

466
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:57,773
- Wait!
- Jack.

467
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:02,881
- What?
- Jack, I'm not gonna make it. I can feel it.

468
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,043
Just tell me where the evidence is now.

469
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:09,131
It's on a memory chip.

470
00:39:10,413 --> 00:39:12,973
Two AIF files.

471
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:20,412
The source recordings prove
the Cyprus audio is a fake.

472
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,768
Where is the memory chip?

473
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:27,288
It's in... inside...

474
00:39:27,373 --> 00:39:29,887
- Inside what?
- Inside...

475
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:32,806
Inside where? Come on, Wallace.

476
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:36,283
Inside where? Doctor!

477
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:39,843
- He's in V-fib!
- Excuse us. We need to get in here.

478
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:41,924
- No pulse.
- We're at 200 joules.

479
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,004
Here you go, Doctor.

480
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:48,968
- Charging. 1-2-3, clear.
- Clear.

481
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:56,047
- Still in V-fib. Charging, 1-2-3, clear.
- Clear.

482
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:04,610
- Still in V-fib. Charging, 1-2-3, clear.
- Clear.

483
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:15,284
He's dead.

484
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:26,688
Jack, what are we gonna do?

485
00:40:26,773 --> 00:40:28,764
I don't know.

486
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,726
I don't know.

487
00:41:16,493 --> 00:41:20,645
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

488
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,084
We got it.

489
00:42:17,573 --> 00:42:20,326
