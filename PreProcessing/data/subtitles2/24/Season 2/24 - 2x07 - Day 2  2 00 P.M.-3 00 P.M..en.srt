1
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:18,045
- Reza's parents are here.
- Where is Reza?

2
00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:20,089
Men from the government are talking to him.

3
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:22,562
Who wired that money
into Syed Ali's accounts?

4
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:26,248
Bob Warner, Marie's father.

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,403
Come with me, please.

6
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:30,961
- What did you tell them?
- The truth.

7
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:33,521
How did you get in here
without my authorisation?

8
00:00:33,613 --> 00:00:36,446
- I need to talk to you.
- You're not my wife any more.

9
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:39,286
- It's not about us.
- Then what?

10
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:42,809
There are members of your own
administration allying against you.

11
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,929
That's why I came here today.

12
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,085
I need to get you out of here
because I want you to be safe.

13
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,606
- OK.
- Come on.

14
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:51,809
Your daughter's not with
any of the departments.

15
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,487
Then where the hell is she?

16
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:56,643
Give her to me, Kim.

17
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,443
We need to get out of here.

18
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,569
Get his car keys.

19
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:05,450
Nina killed your wife.

20
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:10,402
My goal is the same as yours, to stop
this bomb. Who is the man in Visalia?

21
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:14,930
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen. He's
the only one who knows where the bomb is.

22
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:19,211
The team's assembled in Visalia.
We'll have tactical and field units. Jack...

23
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,966
It's all right. It's all right. Just take it easy.

24
00:01:35,493 --> 00:01:39,771
Pull up 30 feet from the left wing.
Escort, lay back.

25
00:01:57,413 --> 00:01:59,404
Move.

26
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:05,768
Jack drugged Miller
to get me alone. Tell Mason.

27
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,445
- Is he in the van?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:11,843
He's gonna come to in 20 minutes.
He'll have a headache.

29
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,288
Here's command authority.

30
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:17,524
- I owe you, Doug. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:23,053
Get in the plane.

32
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:45,891
Agent Bauer. Rick Phillips, FBI.

33
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:49,412
Harris and I will be
your transit team to Visalia.

34
00:02:49,493 --> 00:02:52,724
We'll act as reinforcements
once we're on the ground.

35
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:56,852
So, we're clear here, Jack?
I know what you did to Ed Miller.

36
00:02:56,933 --> 00:03:00,846
Rick, right? Do yourself a favour.
Stay out of this.

37
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,969
Do your job, get us to Visalia.

38
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:07,732
My job is to make sure this runs smoothly.
That means keeping her safe.

39
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:12,567
Consider me your new chaperone.

40
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:19,805
I need two lines set up through CTU.
One for mobile, one for the translator.

41
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:22,691
It'll be tricky cos their
phone lines are sketchy.

42
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:24,764
It's already done.

43
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:26,927
Good.

44
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:53,810
Way to go, Kate.
You broke his parents' hearts, too.

45
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:57,886
I'm so sorry, Marie. But I don't know
what these government people found.

46
00:03:57,973 --> 00:04:01,090
And believe me, I wish they
hadn't have found anything.

47
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:05,052
But aren’t you curious?
Why are they asking Dad questions now?

48
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,363
You started a witch-hunt in our family.

49
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:11,332
No, Marie. It's because Reza
is connected to some bad people.

50
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:14,769
- Maybe even terrorists.
- You're out of your mind.

51
00:04:14,853 --> 00:04:19,483
We're not gonna put our heads in the sand,
Marie. Or this could end up hurting Dad.

52
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,133
We're not gonna let that happen.

53
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:24,726
Come with me.

54
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,566
What did you tell them?
What did you accuse my father of?

55
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:30,451
I didn't accuse him of anything.
It's his company.

56
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,764
You're pointing your finger
at him to cover yourself!

57
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,332
- Kate!
- Stay out of this.

58
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:38,211
You don't talk to her like that.
You listen to me.

59
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:41,251
I have done more for your father
than you will ever know.

60
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:46,043
And all I've ever gotten from you
is suspicion and resentment. I'm sick of it.

61
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:48,363
I didn't connect you to a terrorist.

62
00:04:48,453 --> 00:04:51,251
No? Then who did?
I don't know any terrorists!

63
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,086
All I know is you paid for someone
to dig up dirt on me.

64
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:55,367
Apparently, he did.

65
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:59,002
No, he didn't, because all he found
out was stuff about Bob, not me.

66
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,653
So if anybody's guilty, it is your father.

67
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:06,887
- Don’t you make this about my father.
- Stop it. Stop, Kate! Both of you, stop it!

68
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:17,283
Nice work, Kate.

69
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,370
Call me when you get that.

70
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:27,445
- I'll have it today. Four o'clock too late?
- No.

71
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:31,208
- I'll talk to you then.
- Yeah, good. Alrighty. Bye-bye.

72
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:36,726
If it isn't the Chief of Staff himself. Mike!

73
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:38,963
Sherry.

74
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,812
You look beautiful... as always.

75
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:45,771
What are you doing here?
Did David ask you to come here?

76
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:49,926
No. I just showed up on my own.

77
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:53,287
So, how have you been?

78
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,049
- Fine, Mike. Just fine.
- Yeah?

79
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:01,651
Yeah. You know, it's been a challenging
year. But what is it they say?

80
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:07,649
We... learn from our mistakes
and grow from our misfortunes.

81
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,688
Have you told that to David?

82
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:13,082
No.

83
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:17,644
I don't think he's ready
to hear that yet. Not now.

84
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:22,369
But he is waiting for you,
so why don’t you just go on in?

85
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:25,251
I'll see you later... I'm sure.

86
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,124
Here you go, sir.

87
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:35,128
Don't speculate, don't say anything.
We don't know where he is.

88
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:37,602
- That is our position.
- Yes, ma'am.

89
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:40,685
- All right, good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

90
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:44,646
Sir, we have to talk about Ron Wieland.

91
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:47,850
What about him? Does anybody
know we have him sequestered?

92
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:53,007
No, but Jenny got a call from his production
crew. They haven't seen him in four hours.

93
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:56,130
They'll figure out the last person
they saw him with was you.

94
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:58,204
Then leak a story.

95
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,329
Mike. Good to see you.

96
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,881
I got here as soon as I could. Hi, Lynne.

97
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,452
Mike.

98
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:10,284
Armus brought me up to speed
on the Wieland situation.

99
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:14,366
I did some research, found out there
is precedent for the executive branch

100
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:19,573
taking action against the press
at times of national crisis.

101
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:23,371
So, when you say leak a story,
what kind of a story?

102
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:28,049
Make it appear as though Wieland
went to Portland on a personal matter.

103
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:32,445
Armus can arrange that. It's a band-aid,
but it'll get us through the day.

104
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,245
- Talk to Armus. Put it in motion.
- Yes, sir.

105
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:46,290
- I saw Sherry on my way in.
- Oh.

106
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:50,446
- Should I attach any significance to that?
- It was her decision to come here.

107
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:56,005
That's what she said. But I have to tell you,
I'm surprised you're allowing her to stay.

108
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:01,763
For the time being, Mike.
Just for the time being.

109
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:06,165
Let's go to the OC. I'll bring you
up to speed. There's a lot to cover.

110
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:11,648
- You wanna send that on to Division?
- Yes, sir.

111
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:15,166
- Mr Mason?
- Yeah?

112
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:19,326
- I just got off the phone with Ed Miller.
- How's it going between Jack and Nina?

113
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:23,645
He doesn't know. Jack drugged him
and got on the plane without him.

114
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,803
Please tell me you're kidding.

115
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:28,487
Sloane's bringing Ed back now.
What should I do?

116
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:31,724
They're on a plane.
There's nothing anybody can do.

117
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:35,408
Except hope that his impulse for revenge
doesn't cloud his judgement.

118
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:40,089
- You mean like drugging one of our agents?
- What can I say? The guy's a little crazy.

119
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:44,485
That's why I didn't want him here
in the first place, but... he gets results.

120
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:48,608
And we need some
pretty big results here, so...

121
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:11,645
Just because Sherry tells you that
there's a conspiracy against you,

122
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,122
that doesn't make it true.

123
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:22,171
But if it is true, it will affect every
aspect of our response to this bomb.

124
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:25,290
Sherry was right about
the military evacuation of LA.

125
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:27,648
That's specific information.

126
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:31,965
She still has well-routed sources.
But a conspiracy?

127
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:35,966
Don't forget where she's coming from.
She may have her own agenda.

128
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:40,604
I'm well aware of that, Mike. She's on
a tight leash. I wanna find her source.

129
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:46,208
Let me look into this
so-called cabal against you.

130
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:48,887
If there's any substance to it,
I'll uncover it.

131
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:53,683
Right now, the country needs
your attention on the situation in LA.

132
00:09:57,253 --> 00:10:00,211
Start with Stanton.

133
00:10:00,293 --> 00:10:02,727
Stanton?

134
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:07,443
The head of NSA, conspiring against
the president of the United States?

135
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:12,129
Aside from the implications if that were
true, hasn't he always been an ally to you?

136
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:16,286
Yes. But he's also Eric Rayburn's boss.

137
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:20,048
It's not inconceivable Rayburn
could be doing Stanton's bidding.

138
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:24,490
- They have always been on the same page.
- That's not enough to indict Roger.

139
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:30,569
I know. That's why I want you to check him
out. I'm hoping you can prove me wrong.

140
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:40,053
I'll talk to Roger as soon as I settle in,
see if I can get a read on him.

141
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,124
Thanks, Mike.

142
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:55,605
- How long until we land?
- About ten minutes.

143
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:07,404
- How far is Faheen from the airport?
- I'll tell you when we land.

144
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:12,806
We are fighting the clock, so you better start
talking. How far is Faheen from the airport?

145
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:17,887
We need her to cooperate, Jack.
Threatening her isn't gonna help.

146
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,845
Fine.

147
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:27,085
Get her changed.
I need her to look like a civilian.

148
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,124
Come on, let's go.

149
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,288
No.

150
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:40,046
Here. She doesn't leave my sight.

151
00:12:24,653 --> 00:12:27,451
Everything's working out, right?

152
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:31,321
Why don’t you come by? It's not
the Ritz-Carlton but it works for us.

153
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,768
- OK, I'll come on down.
- I gotta go.

154
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:39,010
- Yeah?
- Jack's about to land in Visalia.

155
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:42,529
- Have they got a location for Faheen?
- No. Not until they land.

156
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:46,049
- Stay on it. I'll be down in a minute.
- Right.

157
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,763
Double espresso au lait, and it's hot.

158
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:07,646
Out of three. And five cents is your change.

159
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:10,492
Hello?

160
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,167
John, it's your father.

161
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:18,522
- Hello? You there?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

162
00:13:19,453 --> 00:13:22,604
Look, I... I know it's been a while.

163
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,048
- Two years.
- That long?

164
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:28,330
- Yeah.
- That's my fault.

165
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:33,323
John, I'd really like to see you today.

166
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,166
- I can't.
- It's important.

167
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:40,212
Dad, listen, you can't just call me
out of the blue and expect me to jump.

168
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:43,763
I don't really want to see you,
and even if I did, I can't. I'm busy.

169
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:47,368
I know I screwed up. I understand
if I'm not your favourite person.

170
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:52,129
But can you do this one thing for me?
Come to CTU. You know where that is, right?

171
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:55,330
I can't do it today, Dad.
I'm in the middle of something.

172
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:59,008
- Tell me what's going on.
- I need to see you, that's what's going on.

173
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:03,928
You're not listening to me, Dad. I'm gonna
have to call you when I have a chance.

174
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:28,004
Get up.

175
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:55,724
Let's go.

176
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,170
- I'm Agent Dockerty.
- Jack Bauer. Phillips and Harris.

177
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:10,404
We're all set up.
All we need now is a location.

178
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:14,122
Where we going, Nina? What's the location?

179
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,886
- A thrift store on North Collins.
- The name?

180
00:15:16,973 --> 00:15:19,771
- Crescent Collectibles.
- Our transportation?

181
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:23,289
Three teams, three vehicles.
They're waiting for your orders.

182
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:27,252
Crescent Collectibles is in
the De Anza district. That's not too far.

183
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:31,121
- We can set up base camp here.
- Do it. Take her.

184
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:34,973
- What you wanna do with her?
- She stays with me.

185
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:38,250
Why? Keep her here
and my guys will watch her.

186
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,688
- I'm gonna use her.
- Use her how?

187
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,286
You'll see.

188
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:48,565
- All right, everyone. Thank you.
- Thank you.

189
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:52,851
- Roger.
- Mike. I heard you were here.

190
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:57,051
I understand the president handed
Eric Rayburn his walking papers.

191
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:01,092
Eric messed up.
The president was right to dismiss him.

192
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:06,964
Still, he fired someone you appointed.
It takes character to support that.

193
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,087
I got a nasty workload today.
You have to excuse me.

194
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:17,166
Actually, the president wants me
to insert myself into your day.

195
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:20,689
That might be difficult.
I'm moving a mile a minute here.

196
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:25,483
I understand. I'd like to look at any paper
you have on the most active leads.

197
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:28,167
Let me play catch-up.

198
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:32,610
All right. We can use a little help
in the civil response area.

199
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:36,322
Great. I'll be working up here in four.
Get me what you got.

200
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:54,411
- Update me.
- CTU Los Angeles is yielding good leads.

201
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:59,692
They raided a warehouse within city limits
and found weapons-grade nuclear material.

202
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:03,561
Langley is using satellite playback
to determine who was there.

203
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,087
- A suspect was killed?
- There was a shoot-out.

204
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,449
Division's having a hard time ID'ing the body.

205
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:10,602
What's this?

206
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:14,083
Jack Bauer is still involved
in the investigation.

207
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:17,131
I thought he was dismissed
after his assignment.

208
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:20,091
He's heading the team
that's tracking Mamud Faheen.

209
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:25,008
And Nina Myers, the woman you granted
immunity to, she's helping them.

210
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,687
Bauer and Nina Myers
are working together?

211
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:33,561
Yes, sir. I believe he volunteered.

212
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:40,565
- What's the time divisibility?
- From the time we break in, 30 seconds.

213
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:43,963
- What about the roof?
- We're looking to see if it's viable.

214
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:47,011
It's not. He'll have sensors on the wall.

215
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:49,891
You go through the front door,
Faheen'll commit suicide.

216
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:52,567
If he's so willing to die, why'd he leave LA?

217
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:56,282
He doesn't want to be collateral damage,
but he'll die to protect the plan.

218
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,887
We can't take a chance.
We need this guy alive.

219
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:02,648
- Gas canister?
- He knows our protocols, and he's prepared.

220
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:06,487
- How does he know your protocols?
- She gave them to him.

221
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:08,962
It doesn't matter. Nina, you're going in.

222
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,771
- What?
- He knows you.

223
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:14,323
- He also thinks I'm in prison.
- Make him believe you got out.

224
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:17,211
The day his bomb's going off?
He'll know I'm lying.

225
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:21,844
You're a good liar. The only way he's gonna
know is if you let him. We need 30 seconds.

226
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:27,451
He will put a bullet in my head before I say
hello, and then he'll turn the gun on himself.

227
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:31,685
We'll make sure he doesn't
turn the gun on himself.

228
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:50,489
- How's it looking?
- Good. We're just waiting for the feeds.

229
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:52,928
Do we know what dialect Faheen speaks?

230
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:58,041
- Yeah. Nina gave us the information.
- Mr Mason? Tony Almeida's on the line.

231
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,970
- Yeah, Tony.
- Naiyeer's starting to talk.

232
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:10,204
He says Bob Warner is the one
that had dealings with Syed Ali.

233
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:12,523
Warner claims he doesn't know anything.

234
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:16,162
Bring them both in.
We'll separate them and turn up the heat.

235
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,483
Are you giving me the OK to arrest them?

236
00:19:18,573 --> 00:19:22,452
- If they don't come willingly, yes.
- On what charge?

237
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:25,491
I don't care if it's jaywalking,
just bring 'em in.

238
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,126
OK. You got it.

239
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:39,089
- What's going on with my father?
- Give me a minute, please.

240
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,764
I need you to get Bob Warner.
We're gonna finish this up at CTU.

241
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,367
Got it.

242
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,842
Reza, I'm gonna need you to come with us.

243
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:54,084
- Come with you where?
- Back to CTU.

244
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,129
- For what?
- Further questioning.

245
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:58,852
I'm not going with you anywhere.

246
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:04,246
Look, I'm not arresting anybody... yet.
But I will if you force me to.

247
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,929
Now, you're coming with us either way.
How we do this is entirely up to you.

248
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:11,402
Do what the man says. Don't argue with him.

249
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:14,485
- Bob, I haven't done anything wrong.
- Reza.

250
00:20:14,573 --> 00:20:16,803
Reza, please, do this for me.

251
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,492
OK?

252
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:28,644
- Then I'm coming with you.
- We can't take you with us.

253
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,884
Then I'll follow you.
You've ruined my wedding day.

254
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:35,522
I'm not gonna let you separate me
from my fiancé.

255
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,684
Right this way.

256
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,132
Dad?

257
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:52,364
Call everyone, explain
the wedding's been postponed.

258
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:55,362
I want you to call Larry. Tell him where I am.

259
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:58,650
- Dad, Larry's a tax attorney.
- It doesn't matter.

260
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:01,167
It doesn't matter. He'll know what do.

261
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,244
- OK?
- All right.

262
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,401
Good afternoon.

263
00:21:23,493 --> 00:21:28,123
You two haven't been formally introduced.
Lynne Kresge, Sherry Palmer.

264
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:31,046
Lynne. It's lovely to meet you.

265
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:36,810
Mrs Palmer. Mr President, there were
a few guidelines from Director Stanton

266
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:40,090
that I wanted to go over
with you in this meeting.

267
00:21:40,853 --> 00:21:45,369
OK. Let me just break the ice here.
Lynne, I have invoked executive privilege

268
00:21:45,453 --> 00:21:49,048
and have granted Sherry
a provisional security clearance.

269
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,489
- I see.
- This meeting is about the possibility

270
00:21:52,573 --> 00:21:56,771
of people inside this administration
who may be organising against me.

271
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:59,048
- Against you?
- David.

272
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:05,129
Maybe you should bring Lynne up to speed
on where we are with Roger Stanton.

273
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:18,568
- Mr President?
- Things have been happening too fast today.

274
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:22,612
Our problems are compounded
by the possibility of a dissenting faction.

275
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:26,163
- You think Roger might be a part of that?
- It's possible.

276
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:31,092
If you don't mind my asking, sir,
what led you to this hypothesis?

277
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:34,404
It troubles me to articulate this, Lynne,

278
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:39,886
but the ambassador's helicopter accident
solved a lot of Roger Stanton's issues.

279
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:45,570
- Those issues were shared by many...
- I'm so sorry to interrupt, David.

280
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:50,329
But there's something else
that you probably don't know, Lynne.

281
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:52,927
And that is that Roger Stanton

282
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:56,972
has been having secret meetings
with the minority leader in the Senate,

283
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:01,569
and Eric Rayburn has been in attendance.

284
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:05,362
Actually, Sherry,
I am aware of those meetings.

285
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,487
They were trying to forge a bipartisan base

286
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:13,488
in order to stop questionable allocations
made by the Armed Services Committee.

287
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:17,452
And, sir, the only reason
I did not brief you on this earlier

288
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:20,889
is because the vote is not
for another two months.

289
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:26,246
But I have very detailed records,
if you would like to take a look at them.

290
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,688
This doesn't solve our problems today.

291
00:23:31,773 --> 00:23:37,291
We've got to avert a disaster and we can't do
that if our own people are working against us.

292
00:23:37,373 --> 00:23:43,164
Now, I need to know that Roger Stanton
is supporting this administration.

293
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:45,642
I'm already working alongside Roger.

294
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:50,011
Lynne, I'd like you to keep track
of your conversations with him as well.

295
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:56,009
Now, I've put together a list of people on the
Hill who might be able to help in this matter.

296
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:58,288
Thank you, Mike.

297
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,811
LA Investigations. Paul Koplin speaking.

298
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:53,691
Hi. This is Kate Warner.
Is Ralph Burton there?

299
00:24:53,773 --> 00:24:57,891
No. I'm sorry, Kate, Ralph's not here.
Can I help you with something?

300
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:01,852
- I need to talk to Ralph.
- He left for the day.

301
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:06,723
He works for me. I'm familiar with the case.
Is there something I can do for you?

302
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:11,008
I need some help.

303
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:15,609
I have to get into
my father's private records.

304
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:22,443
Lynne? Lynne?

305
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,251
- Yes?
- Can I have a sec?

306
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,801
Sure.

307
00:25:34,293 --> 00:25:38,764
I know that you're uncomfortable with me
taking some of these tasks from you.

308
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:41,925
After all, I'm not officially on David's staff.

309
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:46,450
Mrs Palmer, my discomfort has nothing
to do with you being on his staff.

310
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:49,093
My only concern is to serve the president.

311
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,722
I need to know the people around him
are competent. I don't know you.

312
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:57,489
You seem like a pretty smart woman,
so let me explain something to you clearly.

313
00:25:57,573 --> 00:25:59,564
Mm.

314
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:02,611
David did not get here by himself.

315
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:06,652
He's had competent people
around him his entire life.

316
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:12,091
Obviously, you're one of them.
Not necessarily the best, just the most recent.

317
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:17,731
So have some respect for those of us
who put him into office.

318
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:20,771
We just might be able to help you.

319
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,603
Fair enough.

320
00:26:37,133 --> 00:26:39,328
Be careful, Sherry.

321
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:44,126
I need Lynne.
Don't turn this into a competition.

322
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:46,408
I understand.

323
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:52,648
I just... need her to know that I'm not
just around here as window-dressing.

324
00:26:53,573 --> 00:26:58,886
- I'm sure she got the message.
- I'll behave. Promise.

325
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:06,162
Sherry... you don't have
a lot of friends here today.

326
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:13,363
In fact, it seems like every time I turn around,
somebody's advising me to send you away.

327
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:18,447
Then why don’t you?

328
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:22,526
Because you may be able to get
information that nobody else can.

329
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:42,608
OK, slow down.

330
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:46,891
As soon as we get a positive ID,
we'll be in within 30 seconds.

331
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:48,929
- This is it.
- Get out.

332
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:51,486
Get out!

333
00:27:55,653 --> 00:28:00,363
All teams on alert.
Nina is in play. Nina is in play.

334
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:03,411
This is team two. We've got her.

335
00:28:03,493 --> 00:28:05,927
Roger that, team two.

336
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,042
Stay on frequency one.

337
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:33,209
- Michelle, can you read me?
- Copy.

338
00:28:33,293 --> 00:28:37,002
OK, she's in. We're moving into position now.

339
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:46,284
Is there something I can help you find?

340
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:51,364
- I need to see Mamud.
- I'm sorry, I don't know any Mamud.

341
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:54,286
Tell him Nina is here to see him.

342
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:56,884
Nina?

343
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:03,567
Wait here, please.

344
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:32,723
Go, go, go.

345
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,569
Come with me.

346
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:51,852
Michelle, I've got static. There's nothing
on my monitor. What's going on?

347
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:56,723
She's leading her through
a door into a hallway.

348
00:29:58,173 --> 00:30:00,846
Against the wall.

349
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:03,884
Hands in the air.

350
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:08,803
They're checking her for weapons.

351
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:16,644
- What are they saying?
- They thought she was in prison.

352
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:20,089
Nina said she escaped.

353
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:33,565
Now they’re taking her into another room.
It looks like the one off the east exit.

354
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:22,726
- Who is she talking to?
- I can't tell. The target's still in shadow.

355
00:31:22,813 --> 00:31:24,724
What are they saying?

356
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:29,250
She said... She's explaining who
she had to pay to escape from prison.

357
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:33,804
- Jack, should we go?
- Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen.

358
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:44,928
- My audio went dead.
- I lost mine, too.

359
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:48,005
- OK, that's it. Everybody go!
- OK, OK.

360
00:32:12,293 --> 00:32:14,090
Stand in position!

361
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:22,328
Let's go!

362
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:25,733
Stand in position!

363
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:33,166
Go, go, go, go!

364
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:38,163
Phillips! Faheen's unconscious!

365
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:42,091
She's gone. Nina's gone.
Secure the building.

366
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:45,324
This is Phillips.
We need medics at the east entrance.

367
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:17,569
Drop it.

368
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:30,844
We're leaving LA now, Aunt Carol. We'll
probably be another four or five hours.

369
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:35,484
OK, we will. Bye.

370
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:44,889
- Damm it.
- You gotta be kidding.

371
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:51,048
- Just play it cool.
- Cool? We're in a stolen car.

372
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:19,090
- Licence and registration?
- Did I do something wrong?

373
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:21,733
You were speeding.

374
00:35:26,013 --> 00:35:28,686
- Registration, too.
- This is my boss's car.

375
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:31,685
I'm not sure where he keeps it.

376
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:34,241
I'm sure it's in here somewhere.

377
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:39,325
- I think this is it.
- Here you go.

378
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:47,524
I'll be right back.

379
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:02,162
- What are you doing?
- Anything else I can do?

380
00:36:02,253 --> 00:36:05,051
- No, Ken. I got it from here.
- Got it.

381
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:07,727
I'm sorry, John.

382
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:11,089
Hey, I told you I needed to see you, right?

383
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:15,168
What happened here?

384
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:17,608
Never could get you
to watch the news, could I?

385
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:22,721
If you're looking to bond, having your son
arrested isn't the best way to do that.

386
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:32,082
I don't have much time, John. Things are
happening here. I can't go into it fully.

387
00:36:32,173 --> 00:36:34,767
- You could never go into anything.
- It's my work.

388
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:38,892
- Look into it if you start a second family.
- That's not gonna happen.

389
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:43,164
Look... I understand if you're angry.

390
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:47,929
I'm not angry, Dad. I don't care.

391
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:51,562
I really just don't understand.
What are you trying to do here?

392
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:02,443
I got this bank account.
Nobody knows about it.

393
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:07,129
It's got a couple hundred thousand
dollars in it. I want you to have it.

394
00:37:07,213 --> 00:37:11,525
The number to my book-keeper, who I've
spoken to. He'll be transferring the money.

395
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:14,764
You bringing me here to tell me
you're giving me money?

396
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:19,722
What did you expect me to do? Expect me
to give you a hug? I don't want your money.

397
00:37:19,813 --> 00:37:23,283
Then give it to your mom. I'm sure she does.

398
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:27,881
- Cos thing is, I'm not going to be needing it.
- Why is that?

399
00:37:34,573 --> 00:37:36,882
Why is that, Dad?

400
00:37:36,973 --> 00:37:41,524
You don't bring me here, offer me a small
fortune, then not tell me what's going on.

401
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,763
I'm dying, John.

402
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:48,083
You son of a bitch.

403
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:15,133
Is it cancer or something?

404
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:18,884
Something like that, yeah.

405
00:38:22,373 --> 00:38:28,369
Look, John... something bad
is gonna happen in Los Angeles today.

406
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:32,730
- And I need you to leave town.
- You want me to leave now?

407
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:35,850
Go to Phoenix and stay with
your mom for a little while.

408
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:38,367
I mean it. It's dangerous to be here.

409
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:44,002
I can't explain it to you,
but you just have to go, OK? Just go.

410
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:47,688
Dad, listen. I don't... This doesn't matt...

411
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:49,570
Damm it!

412
00:38:54,653 --> 00:38:58,168
You're a good kid.
I hope I didn't mess you up too bad.

413
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,369
- You all right?
- Yeah.

414
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:04,287
Get out of here, all right?
Just get out of here, OK?

415
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:17,806
Oh, God.

416
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:22,082
The vehicle
is registered to a Gary Matheson.

417
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:27,412
- We can't let him take us back to LA.
- I know.

418
00:39:28,053 --> 00:39:30,442
Why's he taking so long?

419
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:46,887
- You say this is your boss's car?
- Yes.

420
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,326
- Who's the little girl?
- I'm her au pair.

421
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:55,653
- Her what?
- She baby-sits her.

422
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:58,721
I wasn't talking to you.

423
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,730
I'll tell you what.

424
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:11,329
I'm gonna let you get off with just a warning
this time. But you slow down, all right?

425
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:15,643
- Yes, Officer. Thank you.
- Thank you.

426
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:27,284
Hold up!

427
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,009
You want to step out of the car
and open up the trunk?

428
00:40:40,053 --> 00:40:43,250
Step out of the car and open up the trunk.

429
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:16,691
Put your hands on your head
and lay on your stomach.

430
00:41:16,773 --> 00:41:19,207
Get down. Get down! Get down.

431
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:22,365
Get out of the car!
Keep your hands on your head.

432
00:41:22,453 --> 00:41:25,604
- What's going on?
- Lay down on the ground.

433
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:28,253
Carla! Oh, my God! He killed her!

434
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:31,245
- What's happening, Kim?
- Megan, get back in the car!

435
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,927
Put your hands behind your head.

436
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,448
Stay there. Cross your legs. Stay still.

437
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:40,127
Officer in need of assistance.

438
