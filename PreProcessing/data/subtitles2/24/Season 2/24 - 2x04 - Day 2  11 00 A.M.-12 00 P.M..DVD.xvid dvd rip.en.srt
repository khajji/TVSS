1
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,672
Hey, what are you doing there?

2
00:01:23,593 --> 00:01:25,470
Max!

3
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,783
Joshua!

4
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:30,023
How'd you get here?

5
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:32,308
Did anyone see you?

6
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,432
It's OK. He's a friend.

7
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,231
Yeah, sure.

8
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:39,952
You just threw me back there, that's all.

9
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:41,830
You're Joshua, right?

10
00:01:41,913 --> 00:01:44,188
Joshua. Right.

11
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:46,468
Original Cindy. Good to meet you.

12
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,703
I'm makin' breakfast. You hungry?

13
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:56,587
I was gonna come by
and bring you some stuff.

14
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:59,426
- Come to find Father.
- Father? Who's Father?

15
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:03,347
Sandeman. He made us.
He's gonna make Max better.

16
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:06,106
Your love-bug thing
where you can't touch Logan?

17
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,866
Well, get on it, boo.
I'm tired of seeing you mopin'.

18
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:13,026
This virus bitch has gotta go down
so that you can get busy with your man.

19
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:17,512
Max and Logan getting busy. That's the plan.

20
00:02:17,593 --> 00:02:21,711
The plan is we're gonna find Father.
Logan's tracking down some leads.

21
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:25,706
In the meantime, you gotta lay low.
You can't be walking around out there.

22
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:28,261
Don't mope. I'm on it.

23
00:02:31,073 --> 00:02:33,382
You want some more? We got more food.

24
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:34,908
Down.

25
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,061
OK.

26
00:03:02,713 --> 00:03:04,704
Eight dollar.

27
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,183
Chill, Pop. It wasn't me, I swear.

28
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:26,868
Somebody call an ambulance.
Somebody call an ambulance!

29
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:55,029
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

30
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:57,104
Then she escaped.

31
00:04:57,193 --> 00:05:01,550
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

32
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,942
she is haunted by her past.

33
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:09,027
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

34
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:46,193
So then I ran a search
of university records.

35
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:46,591
So then I ran a search
of university records.

36
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:49,392
Figured if Sandeman
was the genius behind Manticore,

37
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:53,910
he'd probably have some sort of degree
in genetics or biochemistry or something.

38
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:58,544
- Anything turn up?
- A couple of PhDs but nothing in sciences.

39
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:04,186
- And what about the house?
- His name wasn't on it.

40
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:08,585
Mortgage held by an offshore corporation
and the taxes paid from a numbered account.

41
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:12,231
If you're splicing genes
for a secret government agency,

42
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:15,350
gotta make sure you cover your tracks.

43
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:19,870
In May of '08, the bank repo'ed the property
after six months of non-payment,

44
00:06:19,953 --> 00:06:21,944
and it's sat there empty ever since.

45
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:26,584
- Looks like Sandeman just disappeared.
- Maybe he retired someplace sunny.

46
00:06:26,673 --> 00:06:29,824
Or he ran for his life.
We're talking about Manticore.

47
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:32,507
The place wasn't exactly
known for job security.

48
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,629
Yeah, well.

49
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:38,672
If he had time to pack his bags,
he probably would've taken this.

50
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:47,191
The Manticore symbol.
We're sure he's one of the good guys?

51
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,867
Joshua's sure. That's enough for me.

52
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,342
Maybe we could check it for prints or DNA.

53
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,503
- I don't know. After ten years?
- Worth a shot.

54
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:57,187
We got nothing on this guy.
Not even a first name.

55
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:01,392
I'll call Matt Sung.
See if he can get the police lab to do it.

56
00:07:02,393 --> 00:07:06,386
We're gonna find him, Max.
And we're gonna beat this.

57
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,907
I just want things to be the way they were.

58
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:13,872
You know, when we could hold hands
without you keeling over on me.

59
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:23,466
- Asha.
- I just got this close to getting busted.

60
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,908
- Listen...
- They ran my papers on the computer.

61
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:29,588
I knew they were onto them being forged
because they took forever.

62
00:07:29,673 --> 00:07:31,664
So I just got the hell outta there.

63
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:35,462
- That's a smart move.
- All I wanna do is go home and take a bath.

64
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:38,625
- Now I gotta find a new fake ID.
- I can probably help with that.

65
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,431
We gotta talk about Manticore.

66
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:45,541
I'm glad your friend Max and her furry little
friends got outta there, but it's really...

67
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,272
- Hi.
- Hi.

68
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:52,792
What I meant was we... My group, that is...

69
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,262
The S1Ws,
the political organisation I was...

70
00:07:55,353 --> 00:08:00,632
Yeah. Government's saying Manticore was
just a VA hospital you guys burned down.

71
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,944
Sorry. From me and all my furry little friends.

72
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:09,031
I gotta get to work. Have fun.

73
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,502
"All I wanna do is take a bath."

74
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:19,788
All I wanna do is drown her in one.

75
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:42,272
Don't get mad. It's not her fault
everything handcuffs you to Manticore.

76
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:45,869
But what is up?
Is someone trying to tell me something?

77
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:57,903
- Rafer?
- Lie still.

78
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:01,391
- I'm OK.
- I don't know. You went down pretty hard.

79
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:04,385
- That was you?
- Sorry. You came out of nowhere.

80
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:07,632
- What the hell are you doing?
- Relax. I'm a paramedic.

81
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,386
- You deliver pizzas.
- That was just part time.

82
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:13,112
We spent a night together
and you think you know me?

83
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,627
Lie still.
I gotta check for broken bones.

84
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:22,225
Next time you wanna cop a feel,
hit me harder and make sure I'm out cold.

85
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,907
No damage. Just a scratch!

86
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:27,344
Max.

87
00:09:37,673 --> 00:09:39,982
- Matt, did you get it?
- Yeah, just arrived.

88
00:09:40,073 --> 00:09:42,871
Listen, I appreciate you doing this.

89
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:43,393
No problem.
I'll send the results as soon as I can.

90
00:09:43,393 --> 00:09:45,429
No problem.
I'll send the results as soon as I can.

91
00:09:45,513 --> 00:09:47,151
Great.

92
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,904
Biochemist. I'm a scientist.

93
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:53,508
I'm sure you got a great team of
scientists working at the precinct.

94
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,426
Hello. The boy that died today
in Chinatown, I was there.

95
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:58,504
I may have been exposed to something.

96
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:02,142
The coroner's still investigating.
We'll have her report tomorrow.

97
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:06,067
- I would like to see a copy of that.
- File a request with the ME's office.

98
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:09,350
- This is totally unacceptable...
- Just follow him.

99
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,707
- Sung.
- Yeah?

100
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,512
You had a sketch artist
working on something?

101
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:17,552
Yeah. Rumours flying around Chinatown
about some strange guy in an overcoat.

102
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,032
I'll say.

103
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:21,752
The eyewitness says his face was bleeding.

104
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,381
Could be the dead kid was exposed
to what he's got.

105
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:27,941
Could be.

106
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:32,868
Let's keep this under wraps until the autopsy
comes out. I don't want to start a panic.

107
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:35,308
You haven't been in Chinatown lately.

108
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,384
There's already a panic.

109
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:48,430
What happened to you?

110
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:50,947
Where you been?
Been paging you all morning.

111
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,752
I lost my pager
when I got hit on Charles Street.

112
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,428
- But I'm OK, thanks for asking.
- Here, hot run. Sector Nine.

113
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:00,630
- Can I borrow...
- No. You're not covered on company bikes.

114
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:03,750
If you so much as break a fingernail,
we both know you'll sue.

115
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:08,509
Let's go! Bip-bip-bip!
It's called Jam Pony, not Jam Clydesdale.

116
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,583
Hey.

117
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:18,030
OK, you are a paramedic. You trying
to make me feel bad for not believing you?

118
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:20,308
No. I came by to give you this.

119
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:23,623
And to see if you wanted to have lunch.

120
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:26,432
My way of making up
for our little run-in.

121
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,829
- Listen, I'm really sorry about...
- Forget about it.

122
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:37,303
How can I? I put my foot so far down
my mouth, I got teeth marks on my knee.

123
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,024
She must hate me.

124
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:46,142
Really, forget about it.
Eat something.

125
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,224
I'm not really hungry.

126
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:53,427
About what happened that night...

127
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,188
- I'd rather just forget about that night.
- Me too.

128
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:59,628
I was in a really weird head space.

129
00:11:59,713 --> 00:12:02,910
I just broke up with my girlfriend,
like, three weeks before.

130
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:06,508
Anyway, if I came on too strong
I'm sorry, cos I'm not like that.

131
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,072
It's OK.

132
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,986
I came by a couple of times
and no one knew where you were.

133
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,667
I had to deal with family stuff.
It's complicated.

134
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:17,268
- Family stuff's always complicated.
- You have no idea.

135
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,826
Thought maybe you had
a boyfriend somewhere.

136
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,111
That's complicated too.

137
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:30,232
Which has gotta be
the understatement of the century.

138
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:33,828
Max and I danced around each other
for almost a year.

139
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:38,589
When we finally figure out what's going on
between us, this virus thing happens.

140
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:41,665
- We can't be together.
- What do you mean? Why not?

141
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:44,463
It's hard to explain. It's like...

142
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:47,503
It's too intense.

143
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:49,353
Sometimes I think maybe
we're just not meant to be.

144
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,423
Sometimes I think maybe
we're just not meant to be.

145
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:54,710
I mean, if it's right,
why does it have to be so hard?

146
00:12:55,433 --> 00:12:57,424
I don't know.

147
00:12:58,633 --> 00:13:01,750
Logan's probably just better off without me.

148
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:06,193
I just want you to be happy.

149
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:12,744
He'd be lucky to be with you.

150
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:18,233
Anybody would be.

151
00:13:28,353 --> 00:13:29,706
I should go.

152
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:33,183
- I'd better get back to work.
- Yeah, me too.

153
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,225
You don't have ID. Asha!

154
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:45,868
See you around.

155
00:14:08,953 --> 00:14:11,342
This is your bus ticket, sir.

156
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:40,706
Yeah, that mutant. I saw it here yesterday.

157
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,909
Grabbed a pigeon, bit its head off.

158
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:48,304
Looked at me like I was next.

159
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:52,023
- It's worse than I thought.
- What?

160
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:55,025
Mutant infestation. They're here as well.

161
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,742
Were you born dumb or do you put in work?

162
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,428
Ambulance, we gotta get an ambulance.

163
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:20,184
22, all Chinese.

164
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:24,110
- What did the ME say?
- If it's what killed the kid yesterday,

165
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:28,345
it's some kind of pathogen.
She's never seen anything like it.

166
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:33,587
- I mean, is it some kind of toxin or what?
- She's running tests, trying to figure it out.

167
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:38,144
- You see Eyes Only's hack about Manticore?
- Yeah. Why?

168
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:42,829
The government says it never existed, but the
word on the street is the place burned down

169
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:45,825
and a bunch of genetically-engineered
whatsits got out.

170
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:49,906
- Those are just rumours.
- There's a rumour one's hiding in Chinatown.

171
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:52,553
Supposedly deformed,
bleeds through his skin.

172
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:55,830
- You think they're connected?
- I don't know. Eyes Only might.

173
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,427
- Can you talk to him for me?
- I'll try and get to him.

174
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:00,504
- I appreciate it.
- Sure thing.

175
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:04,871
Listen. I'm sorry, Matt.

176
00:16:05,353 --> 00:16:08,823
- I know this is close to home.
- Yeah.

177
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:13,626
- It was horrible.
- Those poor people.

178
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:17,592
The news said anybody there should
get checked for infection. I'm scared.

179
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:20,267
Can I talk to you?

180
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,583
Five minutes, then I start docking.

181
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:28,867
Even if there is a screwed-up transgenic, it
doesn't mean he's got what killed the people.

182
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:32,070
When you were at Manticore,
were you aware of any experiments

183
00:16:32,153 --> 00:16:35,907
that involved exposure
to virulent bacteria or pathogens?

184
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:40,828
- No. Why are you jumping to conclusions?
- Because the guy's been seen in the area.

185
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:45,464
If this is linked to me and my furry little
friends, why are all the victims Chinese?

186
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:49,831
- Manticore's big on equal opportunity.
- Could be that it takes prolonged exposure.

187
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:53,110
If this guy was downtown,
maybe it'd be rich white people dying.

188
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:55,263
Ever think it was something they ate?

189
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:58,823
Or they got bit by the same mosquito?
Or some bug got loose from a lab?

190
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,904
Come on, Max!

191
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:05,589
This is nothing new to Manticore. Look what
they did to you and me, for God's sake.

192
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,386
Just because I'm poison doesn't mean
we all are. Your five minutes are up.

193
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:32,902
Hold it right there.

194
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:43,428
- I love what you've done with the place.
- Laying low.

195
00:17:43,513 --> 00:17:46,585
Good, cos it's dangerous out there,
especially these days.

196
00:17:47,313 --> 00:17:52,262
Like it here. Father's books. Father's house.

197
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:56,629
Yeah. Listen, about Father.

198
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:59,989
Logan's come up empty.
He's still working on it.

199
00:18:00,073 --> 00:18:03,986
He'll find Sandeman,
just as soon he's done saving the world...

200
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:06,789
from us.

201
00:18:09,313 --> 00:18:12,669
Max and Logan. That's the plan.

202
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:14,471
I don't know.

203
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:19,069
I'm starting to think there is no plan,
and if there is I'm not clued in at all.

204
00:18:19,153 --> 00:18:21,621
Father ever talk to you about fate?

205
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:26,070
You know, like whether
some things just weren't meant to be?

206
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:31,585
Canine with human DNA not meant to be,

207
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,552
then Joshua.

208
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:37,227
Max and Logan not meant to be,

209
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:39,992
then getting busy.

210
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:44,633
- We'll see.
- You'll see.

211
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:46,704
This virus bitch going down.

212
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,388
It's him.

213
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:58,782
- Hello.
- If you're calling to apologise...

214
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,592
I'm not but I will if that's what it takes.

215
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:05,108
Spit it out.

216
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:05,633
- Asha was heading home and...
- She left already?

217
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:08,306
- Asha was heading home and...
- She left already?

218
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:13,513
Yeah, and she got arrested by sector cops.
I need your help.

219
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:16,712
- You want me to save her?
- I don't know who else to ask.

220
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:19,353
- Try Sung.
- I did. He's not answering his page.

221
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,826
- Smart man.
- If they run her prints and see who she is...

222
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,950
- Yeah, yeah. Where is she?
- Sector Four headquarters.

223
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:29,622
We'll meet you at Crash in an hour.

224
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:34,907
Look, I told you. I left my ID at work.

225
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:38,342
I can bring it in tomorrow.

226
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,984
Your prints came through, Ms Barlow.
We know you're with the S1W.

227
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,631
I don't know what you're talking about.

228
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,988
I want the names and addresses
of everyone in your group.

229
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:59,064
This is crazy.

230
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,748
This department does not take
terrorist activities lightly.

231
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,791
The S1W are not terrorists.

232
00:20:06,913 --> 00:20:10,588
Tell me what I want to know
or this is going to get ugly.

233
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,384
I'm gonna kick your ass!

234
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:27,865
I'm gonna kick your ass!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

235
00:20:34,873 --> 00:20:37,910
It's my thing. Come on.

236
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:45,707
You know a girl named Max?
Hangs out here a lot?

237
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:48,512
Yeah, hard to miss but hasn't been in tonight.

238
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:51,109
- I'll have a beer.
- Take that one.

239
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,342
You know Max?

240
00:20:57,433 --> 00:21:00,353
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

241
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:00,671
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

242
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:04,709
- Rafer.
- Logan.

243
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:08,987
Right.

244
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:21,748
Listen. Thanks.
I know you didn't have to.

245
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:25,068
It was a favour to Logan.

246
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:30,147
Besides, it wouldn't be right for you
to take the rap for something you didn't do.

247
00:21:31,313 --> 00:21:35,670
You going in? I'm just gonna get
my ID from Logan and go, so...

248
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:41,186
- You're waiting here for Max, right?
- Yep.

249
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,269
- That's my cue to go.
- You don't have to.

250
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:53,063
- Things with Logan are screwed up just now.
- Yeah, but he's crazy about you.

251
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:55,872
She digs you, man. I'm just gonna back off.

252
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:59,148
Have a seat.

253
00:22:01,313 --> 00:22:06,706
I don't know how things are gonna
play out between us, so I'm gonna go.

254
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,751
I wouldn't want to mess
anything up for her. Neil!

255
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:11,831
Yeah?

256
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,063
- You know Asha?
- Yeah, I know Asha.

257
00:22:15,353 --> 00:22:18,231
- I'll give it to her.
- Great. Thanks.

258
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:19,507
See ya.

259
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,106
Good night.

260
00:24:02,713 --> 00:24:05,750
Help! Help, help!

261
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,302
Help!

262
00:24:08,273 --> 00:24:10,264
Help, help!

263
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:55,747
What are you doing here?
I told you I'd call you.

264
00:24:56,193 --> 00:24:58,423
- He's clean.
- Clean?

265
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:00,549
Not a trace of the pathogen.

266
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,272
Let me take a look at that.

267
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:16,863
What is that?

268
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:23,026
Looks like a tattoo.

269
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:30,462
Why do I get the feeling
you guys aren't tellin' me something here?

270
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:34,070
- What's goin' on?
- You killed an innocent man.

271
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:36,744
That's what's going on.

272
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:44,951
- Looked like he was hurting the kid.
- We know, Matt.

273
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:48,582
- Something killed all those people.
- Lab tests came back today.

274
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:53,349
It's not an infectious agent.
They were exposed to the pathogen directly.

275
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:57,221
- Where'd it come from?
- Don't know. I can tell you this.

276
00:25:57,313 --> 00:25:59,907
Mother Nature didn't cook this thing up.

277
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:02,666
The pathogen's genetically engineered.

278
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,021
If the pathogen's man-made,

279
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:08,308
then either it escaped from a lab

280
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:11,430
or somebody's exposing
people to it on purpose.

281
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:15,430
No, don't worry. I got my hands on
a copy of the ME's report.

282
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:17,708
They're chasing their tails.

283
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:21,510
I'm ready when you are.
All I need is a test subject.

284
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:27,822
I'll be expecting you.

285
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,222
He was downstairs people.

286
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:35,702
Didn't turn out so good.

287
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:40,105
Lives in the basement in case Manticore
needs to cut him up for spare parts.

288
00:26:40,193 --> 00:26:44,232
Finally gets out in the world,
and they shoot him dead like he's an animal.

289
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:48,465
This is why I'm always on you
because it's not safe out there.

290
00:26:48,553 --> 00:26:53,104
People get real scared
when things are different.

291
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:58,347
Yeah, but what I forgot to tell you is, when
they get scared, they can get really mean.

292
00:26:59,713 --> 00:27:01,704
I'm sorry.

293
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:07,469
There's a rumour going around the black
market about a new kind of bio-weapon,

294
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:10,431
capable of distinguishing
between population groups.

295
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:13,073
A nasty trick no one's been able
to pull off before.

296
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,508
Maybe some kind of anti-Asian hate group.

297
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,903
Maybe. Maybe what's happening
is some kind of field test.

298
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:22,671
- Why do you say that?
- No one's claimed responsibility.

299
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:26,587
And look at the way it's playing out -
starting with a single victim,

300
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:29,141
then a handful in a narrowly targeted area.

301
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:31,509
I'm not sure what's worse.

302
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:37,031
Somebody's out to kill me and mine
or that they're using us as guinea pigs.

303
00:27:38,393 --> 00:27:41,988
- Got anything else for me?
- I'm working on some leads but it's slow.

304
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:44,064
Internet's been crashing all day.

305
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:46,588
- Do what you can.
- Talk to you later.

306
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:54,108
Hello.

307
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:58,391
Hey. I just wanted to call.

308
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:03,267
- I never got to thank you for springing Asha.
- No big deal.

309
00:28:03,353 --> 00:28:08,791
And because you were right.
I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.

310
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:13,151
Whatever it was that killed those people
had nothing to do with transgenics.

311
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,509
Guess our thing has just got me
a little spun, you know?

312
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:19,304
Yeah, me too.

313
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,224
Is that me or you?

314
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:23,304
Think it's me. Hold on.

315
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,952
- Logan? I'm at Crash. Come over.
- Max, come over. I'm at Crash.

316
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:31,343
- I don't think so.
- Not tonight.

317
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,901
I have someone on the other line.

318
00:28:33,993 --> 00:28:36,587
- All right.
- OK. See you.

319
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,664
- Hey.
- Hi.

320
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:42,902
- So.
- Anyway, I just wanted to say...

321
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:48,267
sorry about everything.

322
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:51,504
Yeah, me too.

323
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:55,271
- Good night.
- Good night.

324
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:19,544
- Hey, Max.
- Hey.

325
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,030
What delays?

326
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:18,345
I told you three steps
were gonna be involved. Did I not?

327
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:21,903
Step one, target the pathogen
to a single individual.

328
00:30:21,993 --> 00:30:25,986
Expose him to it via airborne dispersal,
make sure he's the only one it affects.

329
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:28,143
Went off without a hitch, did it not?

330
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,701
Excuse me.
Could you not put that there, please?

331
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:33,387
It is a very expensive piece of equipment.

332
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:36,111
Thank you.

333
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:37,906
Step two.

334
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:41,429
Target the pathogen
to a specific race of people.

335
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:43,663
The Chinese at the bus stop.

336
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:49,191
I used gene expression on the base pair
for the epicanthic fold. You know, the eyelid?

337
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:52,231
Worked perfectly. No one died but them, yes?

338
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:57,903
Your technology is very impressive.
But let's move on to step three.

339
00:30:57,993 --> 00:31:00,951
I'm ready. You see,
it was easy with the Chinese.

340
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:03,672
I had specific gene sequences
that I could target.

341
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:07,792
But the kids you're targeting...
Wow, that was tough.

342
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,384
Because they're just
a little bit of everything.

343
00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:12,701
- In the end...
- Cyril.

344
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:15,591
...I targeted
their immunological surveillance cells.

345
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:20,383
Cyril! Action is character.
Show me some.

346
00:31:20,473 --> 00:31:21,513
- I showed you, didn't I?
- Yes.

347
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,309
- I showed you, didn't I?
- Yes.

348
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:25,783
I paid you half upfront.
I gave you everything that you asked for.

349
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:28,068
Now it's time for you to show me.

350
00:31:30,673 --> 00:31:32,903
This is your test subject.

351
00:31:37,993 --> 00:31:40,268
No problem.

352
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:42,344
We can do it right now if you'd like.

353
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:46,187
No, I wanna do it in the field.
I wanna know for sure.

354
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,264
Well, you're the boss.

355
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:51,390
How does tomorrow sound?

356
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:56,470
Assuming it all goes according to plan, how
soon can you ramp up pathogen production?

357
00:31:56,553 --> 00:32:01,627
Well, I can manufacture enough to blanket
the entire western seaboard by Friday.

358
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,988
How you disperse it is, of course, up to you.

359
00:32:04,073 --> 00:32:08,669
These are good for small areas, but they're
expensive and very hard to get ahold of.

360
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:11,904
- We'll use helicopters.
- Well, that sounds like a plan.

361
00:32:12,193 --> 00:32:16,505
By the weekend, there won't be a transgenic
left alive from here to San Diego.

362
00:32:16,593 --> 00:32:20,745
Good. Maybe I'll play
a round of golf on Sunday.

363
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:34,072
Matt, I think I may have a lead. It said
in the police reports that, both times,

364
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:38,305
when the boy died and at the bus station,
people thought they heard fireworks.

365
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:40,827
- Yeah? So it's Chinatown.
- No, listen.

366
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:44,350
There's a type of bio-agent
dispersion cartridge.

367
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:49,983
It's fired from a hand-held launcher,
triggered by an altimeter.

368
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:54,510
According to my source, a buyer just shelled
out for three of them, 20 grand apiece.

369
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:56,823
Took delivery last week.

370
00:32:56,913 --> 00:32:59,985
- Tell me you got an address.
- Have I ever let you down?

371
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:30,031
- Three steps are gonna be involved here.
- Why am I not surprised?

372
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:33,992
Step one. We take the test subject
into the target area. We release him.

373
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:36,109
Step two.

374
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:39,105
We use this to disperse the pathogen.

375
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:42,344
There's enough to kill
any transgenic in a two-mile radius.

376
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,583
That's ample to cover Sector Four.

377
00:33:44,673 --> 00:33:47,949
- What if he escapes the kill zone?
- No, that would be impossible.

378
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:52,106
It takes a minute for the plume to hit
ground level and four minutes to dissipate.

379
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:55,105
There's no way on earth
he could make it out alive.

380
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:57,661
Step three.

381
00:33:57,753 --> 00:34:00,586
We track him and we retrieve the body.

382
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:02,664
I have a correction to step three.

383
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:05,342
You track him and retrieve the body.

384
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:08,630
I'm staying away from here
until this is done.

385
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:13,345
What if you messed up
and got a couple of base pairs wrong?

386
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:16,231
We could end up
with a sector full of dead people.

387
00:34:16,873 --> 00:34:20,502
- You don't trust me?
- Make a believer out of me, Cyril.

388
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:22,663
You'll get the rest of your money.

389
00:34:23,673 --> 00:34:25,664
You have a nice day, now.

390
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,864
Matt.

391
00:34:48,193 --> 00:34:50,184
What is it?

392
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:52,343
Max, it's me. We got a problem.

393
00:35:14,873 --> 00:35:17,068
You're free to go.

394
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:25,743
You can run but you can't hide.

395
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:35,706
What the hell are the cops doin' here?

396
00:35:35,793 --> 00:35:37,511
Son of a bitch.

397
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,584
Drive.

398
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:43,273
Units three and four, move into position.

399
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:45,741
Units three and four, move into position.

400
00:35:49,153 --> 00:35:51,713
They're gonna test the pathogen on an X5.

401
00:35:51,793 --> 00:35:55,229
He busted out of a van on Mercer,
took off down 11.

402
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:02,545
- I gotta get him out.
- In a minute, it'll hit ground level.

403
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:05,545
The sector will be toxic
for four minutes after that.

404
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:08,067
- I'm going in.
- Max!

405
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,428
Jam Pony messenger comin' through.

406
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:13,627
- Max! Max!
- Hold up. Passes only.

407
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:52,392
No, wait!

408
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:35,307
Lady.

409
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:40,913
I have no idea who you are,
but you just cost me five million dollars.

410
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:06,548
Thanks for letting him stay the night.
He's had a rough couple of days.

411
00:39:06,633 --> 00:39:10,342
Logan's gonna help me
get him over the border tomorrow.

412
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:13,869
Killing us all, that was the plan.

413
00:39:14,513 --> 00:39:18,472
It still is. We just got lucky this time.

414
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,868
See you first thing in the morning.

415
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,389
You lay low, little fella.

416
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,663
You too, big fella.

417
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:44,782
Convinced Sung to let me hang on
to everything we found in the guy's lab.

418
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:48,627
Didn't want whoever hired him
to get their hands on it again.

419
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:51,591
- He's a good guy, Sung.
- Yeah, he is.

420
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:55,825
He's got a lot of questions.
Not sure what I'm gonna tell him.

421
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:58,711
As little as possible
is usually a good idea.

422
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:02,507
I'll do my best.

423
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,264
Did I mention I was sorry
for jumping to conclusions?

424
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:09,584
Yeah.

425
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:17,632
- Anything turn up on Sandeman's cane?
- Nothing but traces of Rodentia calcium.

426
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:19,988
The rats tried to eat it.

427
00:40:20,073 --> 00:40:22,712
- Another dead end.
- Yeah.

428
00:40:26,113 --> 00:40:28,263
Listen, about the other night at Crash.

429
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:30,583
Didn't know you were gonna be there.

430
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:33,588
Same with me.

431
00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:36,713
I just needed to get out.

432
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:40,104
I know the feeling.

433
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:43,911
So.

434
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:46,545
Anyway.

435
00:40:53,473 --> 00:40:55,111
Rafer.

436
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:57,343
Asha.

437
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:40,952
