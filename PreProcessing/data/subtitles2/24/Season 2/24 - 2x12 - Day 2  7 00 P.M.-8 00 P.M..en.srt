1
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:19,165
There's a link between Stanton and the
mercenaries that shot down Bauer's plane.

2
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:24,850
Stanton won't be easy to break. You may
need to expand the limits of how far you'll go.

3
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,289
Mr Stanton, by order of the president,
I'm placing you under arrest.

4
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,809
This falls outside
the parameters of your charge.

5
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:34,930
What would you like me to do, sir?

6
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:38,289
I don't know
what you’re talking about.

7
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:43,325
- Where is she now?
- She ran off after the accident.

8
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:48,043
Maybe she was trying to avoid the local
police or trying not to get brought back to LA.

9
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:50,283
Just find her, George.

10
00:00:51,373 --> 00:00:53,364
Ow!

11
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:58,050
Marie, we have a problem.
Basheer and Marko are dead.

12
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:01,205
- What do you need me to do?
- They were gonna pick up the trigger.

13
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:04,683
- Where is it?
- The place Marko worked. In his locker.

14
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,766
You must gain access to this locker
and bring the trigger to Omar.

15
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:09,888
I'll take care of it.

16
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:12,533
I've earned the right to know what's going on.

17
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:18,085
Syed Ali is at the centre of a terrorist attack.
We need you to identify him for us.

18
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,482
He's in there. Syed Ali. He's in there.

19
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,647
Damm it!

20
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:25,451
He's dead, Jack.

21
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,524
These clothes don't belong to this man.

22
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:32,004
Maintain secure exits.
Ali is still in the building.

23
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:58,566
Step outside until
we get the situation resolved.

24
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:02,487
- Agent Bauer told me to stay. Talk to him.
- As soon as you step outside.

25
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:07,089
She stays with us. She's gotta make
the final identification on Ali.

26
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,563
This was in the pocket
of the man Ali set on fire.

27
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:15,488
- It might be a document Ali was carrying.
- Photo it, send it to CTU.

28
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:17,848
Are you trying to protect this man?

29
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,493
No, I have no misplaced loyalties.

30
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:25,442
If the man has murdered an innocent, he is as
guilty in the eyes of Islam as he is in yours.

31
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,366
The man that I'm looking for
set in motion a plan today

32
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,843
to detonate a nuclear weapon
in Los Angeles.

33
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:35,687
- Are you certain?
- Yes, we're certain.

34
00:02:35,773 --> 00:02:39,652
We estimate between one and two million
people will die if this bomb goes off.

35
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,806
That, sir, is why we need to find him now.

36
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:49,923
Thank you for informing me, but I can be
no more honest with you than I have been.

37
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:53,926
But if you find this man, perhaps
I can talk to him in a way you cannot.

38
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,889
Persuade him.

39
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,964
Agent Bauer?

40
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,243
Thank you.

41
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:09,371
We found something I think you should see.

42
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:18,884
We found this trap door. It's not on
any of the schematics you gave us.

43
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,053
Open it.

44
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:34,324
- I go down... I'm going down alone.
- I know this is your operation...

45
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:38,929
Listen to me. We just lost one of Ali's men
to a cyanide capsule hidden in his tooth.

46
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:44,645
We have to assume Ali's willing to take
his life the same way. He can't see us coming.

47
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:48,885
Have your men assemble at the base
of the ladder. Await my instructions.

48
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:54,127
Have you got your baton with you?
Let me have it. OK.

49
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:24,641
- Hello?
- Marie.

50
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:28,851
- There has been a change of plans.
- Why? What's going on?

51
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,730
Just go to the rendezvous point.

52
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:34,772
If I'm not there within one half-hour
of the time we have planned,

53
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:37,606
then you know what to do.

54
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:40,810
- You remember what I said, yes?
- I remember.

55
00:04:59,653 --> 00:05:04,090
I've got the suspect!
Engage the room! Engage the room!

56
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,764
Get his legs!

57
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:14,401
- That's him! That is Syed Ali!
- Get her outta here! Get her outta here!

58
00:05:14,493 --> 00:05:16,927
Get her outta here!

59
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,525
I got the cyanide. Get him ready.

60
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:34,647
Baker!

61
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,611
Find out who he was talking to.

62
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:46,372
It's hard not to sit here and think
that there must be some mistake,

63
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:49,365
even with the evidence you have.

64
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:56,409
It's black-and-white, Bob. Your daughter
killed Reza and two of our agents.

65
00:05:56,493 --> 00:06:00,645
And I need you to help us understand
what her connection to Syed Ali is.

66
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:04,328
If I'd known she was involved,
I would have done something.

67
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:10,204
And now that you do know,
does it help explain any strange behaviour?

68
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:14,491
Anything you can tell us will help.

69
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,564
Well...

70
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:23,689
Marie went to college in London
while I was working there.

71
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:29,484
That's when her mother died,
and it hit her hard, hit us all hard.

72
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:32,332
And?

73
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:35,892
She ran away for a while.

74
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:38,123
How long?

75
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,889
Three, maybe four weeks.

76
00:06:44,173 --> 00:06:47,563
We got the police involved, but...

77
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:50,884
she sent us a letter saying that she was fine,

78
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:56,969
that she was travelling
and she just needed some space.

79
00:06:58,173 --> 00:07:00,403
And when she came back...

80
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:08,485
I was so grateful to see her
that I stopped asking questions.

81
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:13,972
No sense that anything had changed?

82
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:16,931
Any fundamental difference?

83
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:22,763
She had become less politically inclined.

84
00:07:22,853 --> 00:07:27,722
Marie had always flirted with causes,
respectable causes.

85
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:31,692
Like save the wilderness
or abolish the death penalty.

86
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:36,287
She stopped talking about all that.

87
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,683
That's precisely what happens
when you're radicalised.

88
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:44,608
Handlers train you to stop talking
about anything, keep it to yourself,

89
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:48,163
so you're better able to blend in
with the background.

90
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,687
Marie had handlers?

91
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:56,525
Hey, can it wait? I'll be right back with this.

92
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:07,363
This scan came in from the mosque. A burnt
paper fragment found in Ali's clothing.

93
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,411
The only thing visible
is in the lower left quadrant.

94
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:13,485
It looks like a piece of a number.
A six or an eight.

95
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,928
Are all our forensics people out in the field?

96
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:20,086
We got Murdoch on loan from San Diego.
He's an expert with computer imaging.

97
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:23,085
If anyone can see this, he can.

98
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:27,208
- How are you doing? George Mason.
- Hey, man. Randy Murdoch.

99
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,761
- Pleased to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

100
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:35,692
- Any way to accelerate the process?
- My CPU's faster than anything you got.

101
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:41,245
Parallel processing could take too long
to set up. If there's anything there, I'll get it.

102
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,166
Great. Where's Tony
and the satellite feed Jack wants?

103
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:45,527
In progress.

104
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:48,252
- Thank you. Keep it up.
- All right.

105
00:09:07,053 --> 00:09:11,012
- Who else knew about the bomb?
- I don't know what you’re talking about.

106
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:13,732
Jack Bauer is interrogating Ali as we speak.

107
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:18,125
We'll be informed of his progress on
a minute-by-minute basis, but nothing yet.

108
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:20,647
We're certain he knows
the location of the bomb?

109
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:23,770
- Jack Bauer is.
- Make sure he has all the resources he needs.

110
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,002
Yes, sir.

111
00:09:25,093 --> 00:09:28,165
The pain's only going to get
much, much worse.

112
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:33,608
You can stop it.

113
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:36,082
Agent Simmons tells me that Roger

114
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:40,132
received the same training
of resisting interrogation he did.

115
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:44,843
- I'm increasing the voltage.
- But everyone breaks eventually.

116
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:00,765
You have an entry point?

117
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:04,846
She entered the forest somewhere
between 8-3 and 8-4 on the topo map.

118
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:08,084
- And heading?
- No. No idea which way she was headed.

119
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:10,164
- Keep me posted.
- What are you doing?

120
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:14,769
- Getting more men looking for Kim.
- I told you to divert resources to the bomb.

121
00:10:14,853 --> 00:10:18,812
The satellite feed is happening.
I was telling the sheriff to look for her.

122
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:21,646
You're a resource. Don't split your attention.

123
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:25,521
I promised Jack I'd do everything I could
to look for Kim. Just like you did.

124
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:29,049
Kim is outside the blast radius.
The rest of Los Angeles isn't.

125
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:33,604
Stay focused on the bomb, Tony!
That goes for everybody!

126
00:10:39,453 --> 00:10:43,207
- LA County Ranger Station.
- This is Tony Almeida at CTU.

127
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:46,490
I'm trying to track somebody
who went into the forest.

128
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,564
Hold while I transfer you.

129
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:46,929
Hey, somebody there?

130
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:48,842
Hello?

131
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:56,603
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- Me? What are you doing here?

132
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:01,930
I got into a car accident.

133
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:07,292
I started running, and before I knew it,
I was out here. I had no idea where I was.

134
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:10,968
I got stuck in this stupid thing.

135
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:15,444
Look, all I wanna do is get back
to the highway and get outta here.

136
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,884
Why were you running
from the highway in the first place?

137
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,045
I told you, I was scared and panicked.

138
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,161
Damm it.

139
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:48,246
Oh, God. Thank you.

140
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,203
Coming through here.

141
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:12,763
We're moving into position now. Baker out.

142
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:24,448
I know who you are.
I know everything that you’ve done.

143
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:27,331
Where is the bomb?

144
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,763
Where's the bomb?!

145
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:40,011
You are wasting my time.

146
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,563
When is the bomb gonna detonate?

147
00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,247
You're the one wasting time.

148
00:13:49,053 --> 00:13:51,851
I woke up today knowing I will die.

149
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:57,847
I can make you die with more pain
than you ever imagined.

150
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:06,088
Then I will have that much
more pleasure in paradise.

151
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:08,164
Right.

152
00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:14,642
We gotta figure out how to get you
to the nearest ranger station.

153
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:18,408
No, that's OK. I don't wanna go back there.

154
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:23,043
The same reason you ran from the highway?

155
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,768
Here, I got it. Thank you.

156
00:14:38,053 --> 00:14:41,523
The highway is a couple of miles that way.

157
00:14:42,653 --> 00:14:48,888
But the terrain's too rough to follow at night,
and there's cougars up in that area.

158
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:53,968
My place is a half-mile that way.

159
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,841
I could put a roof
over your head for the night.

160
00:15:20,493 --> 00:15:23,087
I am the imam of this mosque.

161
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,288
Do you deny these men's accusations

162
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:35,448
that you are planning to explode a bomb
that will kill millions of people?

163
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:41,492
The Koran clearly forbids the killing
of innocents and non-combatants.

164
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,371
You know this as well as I do.

165
00:15:44,453 --> 00:15:47,331
We have different interpretations
of the Koran.

166
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,325
You are misguided.

167
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:54,683
Someone has twisted
the words of the prophet.

168
00:15:54,773 --> 00:15:57,446
Allah does not love aggressors.

169
00:15:58,453 --> 00:16:04,210
Listen to me. The murder of one innocent, let
alone millions, will not get you into paradise.

170
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:08,969
We will continue this debate
when I see you there, Imam Al Fulani.

171
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:22,522
I want the images from this computer
transferred to these monitors.

172
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:26,242
I have talked to men who misuse
our religion to channel their hate,

173
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,450
but I have not known anyone
who would act on their impulses.

174
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,206
Can you make an appeal
that'll make any difference?

175
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:36,650
- I will try again, but I don't think so.
- We don't have that kind of time.

176
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:39,566
Please, I want to try again.

177
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:42,611
You can't be involved
with what's gonna happen next.

178
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,888
Please escort the gentleman upstairs.

179
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,972
- Agent Bauer?
- Yeah.

180
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:54,887
We recovered the last number Ali dialled
on his cell. It's a 310 area code. 555-2130.

181
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:57,851
- We're doing a work-up on it now.
- OK, good.

182
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,164
Wait. What was that number?

183
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:08,007
555-2130.

184
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:16,483
No, that's not possible.
That's my sister's cellphone number.

185
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:25,806
What's going on?
What are you not telling me?

186
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:28,248
Why don’t you give us a minute?

187
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:36,324
Reza and two of our agents
were found shot to death

188
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:40,292
in your father's building
about an hour and a half ago.

189
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:43,604
- What?
- Your sister Marie was with them.

190
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:48,084
- Marie? Is she OK?
- They don't know where she is right now.

191
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,324
When were you going to tell me?

192
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:55,292
When we had confirmation that
she was the person that pulled the trigger.

193
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:59,685
What? That is ridiculous.
How could you even think that?

194
00:17:59,773 --> 00:18:02,446
Because we have video tape on her.

195
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:08,688
She was the only person seen leaving your
father's building in the last hour and a half.

196
00:18:08,773 --> 00:18:13,403
She was probably trying to escape.
She could have been hurt.

197
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:17,723
You don't know if she picked up.
The phone could have been stolen!

198
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:21,362
You really believe your sister
has nothing to do with this?

199
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,648
Yes, I really believe it.

200
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:27,692
There's one way you could prove
that to me. Phone her cellphone.

201
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,322
But if she picks up, you have to keep her
on the phone so we can find her.

202
00:18:31,413 --> 00:18:34,564
That's the deal. Can you do that?

203
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:37,121
OK.

204
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,924
OK.

205
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:45,043
OK.

206
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,363
I'm gonna be right back.

207
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:50,566
Baker?

208
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:56,209
We need to trace a cellphone call.
But manipulate the caller ID.

209
00:18:56,293 --> 00:19:02,766
We need to make it look like it's coming
from Kate Warner's phone. Get on it now.

210
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,572
Our equipment will make it look like
you're calling from your cellphone.

211
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:28,929
Tell her you're worried
cos you haven't heard from her.

212
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:32,005
We're linked into the cell-provider network.

213
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:34,732
Once we lock, we can track the phone.

214
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:37,566
OK, good. Let's make the call.

215
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:41,007
What if it's not her?
What if it's someone else?

216
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,687
That's what we need to find out.

217
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:48,611
Finding your sister right now
could save the lives of millions of people.

218
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,524
Please make the call.

219
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:12,884
Hello?

220
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,804
Hi.

221
00:20:16,493 --> 00:20:19,212
It's me.

222
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:22,842
I haven't been able to reach Dad.
He's not back yet.

223
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,811
What's going on?

224
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:30,091
Just taking a drive... to clear my head.

225
00:20:32,613 --> 00:20:34,763
I can understand.

226
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:39,883
I'm so sorry, Marie, about everything.

227
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,964
Yes.

228
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:50,290
Do you want to meet
back at the house? Grab a bite?

229
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:53,844
Can you?

230
00:20:54,813 --> 00:21:00,171
They've found Reza, haven't they?
They know what's happened.

231
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:05,088
I don't know. I don't know what happened.

232
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:06,572
Oh, Marie.

233
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:10,291
Tell me, please, what happened?

234
00:21:11,093 --> 00:21:13,653
You wouldn't understand, Kate.

235
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:20,572
You killed Reza? And those agents?

236
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:23,770
People have to die for things to change.

237
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:25,889
We're locked.

238
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:33,364
You couldn't have done this. They forced you.
You didn't know what you were doing.

239
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:42,206
We tracked it to a ten-block section of Sylmar.

240
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:44,887
Tell CHP to shut down that ten-block radius.

241
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:46,486
Send vitals on Marie Warner.

242
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:49,246
- Tell them to find her.
- Got it.

243
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,131
You don't know who she was with!

244
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:56,092
They could have been forcing her.
You don't know!

245
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,485
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

246
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:20,732
- Any word back from the ranger station?
- Nothing yet. They mounted a search.

247
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:24,647
Tony. I just sent this to Jack
over at the mosque. Check it out.

248
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:27,531
This paper has a very irregular pulp pattern.

249
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:31,367
The final step in the process
is to take samples from various points,

250
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:34,525
to create a CGI algorithm
of what the paper looked like

251
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:37,969
without any of the writings
or other impressions on it.

252
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:42,410
We then subtract that from what
we've actually got, and what we get...

253
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:50,292
is a representation of anything
that interrupts that pattern.

254
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:56,886
There it is. OK. This is only a partial.

255
00:22:56,973 --> 00:23:01,603
There are a few more markings.
Letters or numbers to the right of these.

256
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:03,888
But I need time. They're more obscure.

257
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:08,251
Do we have any contacts whatsoever as to
what these numbers and letters refer to?

258
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:14,169
They photographed the paper on both sides.
That's the only area with any information.

259
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:15,686
All right. Good job.

260
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:19,812
Michelle, get anyone we can spare
on that sequence of letters and numbers.

261
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:22,248
Check VIN numbers, licence plates.

262
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,052
Also get crypto to see if that's a code.

263
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:27,124
I'm on it.

264
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:32,604
- Agent Bauer?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:34,493 --> 00:23:36,882
This just came in from CTU.

266
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:42,933
Open the door. Open the door!

267
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:47,124
N34, what does that mean?

268
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:49,204
What does that mean?

269
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:53,090
You screwed up, Ali.

270
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:56,370
We're gonna cross-reference
that number in our database.

271
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:59,923
Marie Warner is being picked up as we speak.

272
00:24:00,013 --> 00:24:04,564
The pieces are starting to come together.
No matter what, we'll find this bomb.

273
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:08,931
So you can either tell me now
or I can make you suffer.

274
00:24:09,693 --> 00:24:12,366
You wanna suffer?

275
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:16,128
I already told you. I'm not afraid to die.

276
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:21,571
The only way you're gonna die today
is if I kill you. Your bomb's not going off.

277
00:24:21,653 --> 00:24:23,962
- We have a live feed.
- Patch it through.

278
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:25,691
Go.

279
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:39,804
Those men will kill your family
if you don't tell me where the bomb is now.

280
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:55,289
I despise you for making me do this.

281
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:57,489
They're waiting for my order.

282
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:03,608
This is your last chance. Where's the bomb?

283
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:19,084
Sir.

284
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:24,612
Are you aware Jack Bauer's
threatening the lives of Syed Ali's family?

285
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:26,331
No.

286
00:25:26,413 --> 00:25:29,530
- Where is the family?
- In their own country.

287
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:35,165
CTU's been in contact with the security forces
there who have Ali's family in custody.

288
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:39,292
We just got word that Jack has requested
they kill the family one by one

289
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:42,285
till Ali tells us the location of the bomb.

290
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:54,364
- Would the security forces do this?
- They do act against civilians.

291
00:25:54,453 --> 00:26:01,450
And their government is afraid of retaliation
if a bomb does go off. Yes, I think they would.

292
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:10,563
Can we let this happen?
Condone the murder of innocent people?

293
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:14,771
The bomb is an act of war
and wars result in civilian casualties.

294
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:17,492
I don't want a rationale here, Mike.

295
00:26:17,573 --> 00:26:21,009
I don't know of a war where
a president targeted children.

296
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:26,725
Compare this to a weapons factory
near a hospital - a situation we have faced.

297
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:31,648
A bombing would still be ordered on the logic
that many more people will be saved

298
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:34,805
by the destruction of the factory.

299
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,090
The numbers are even more compelling here.

300
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:42,325
A few people may have to die
to save millions.

301
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:48,052
How could it have come to this?

302
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:03,165
Your wife's been writing
you letters every day.

303
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:06,245
She doesn't know where to send them.

304
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:10,927
Your son Asad wants to grow up
and be just like you.

305
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:17,483
Turns 12 next week.

306
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:20,966
I don't think he's gonna make it.

307
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:35,448
I know what it's like to lose someone,
to watch them get killed right in front of you.

308
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:38,969
I don't wanna hurt your family.

309
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:45,606
But I will order those men to pull that trigger
if you don't give me the information I need.

310
00:27:47,493 --> 00:27:49,643
I am...

311
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:52,122
I am doing Allah's work.

312
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:57,846
No. You're going to kill millions of people,
that's what you’re doing.

313
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,009
Agent Bauer.

314
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:04,165
It's important. It's the president.

315
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:12,452
This is Jack Bauer.

316
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:15,366
Can't let you do this, Jack.

317
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:21,449
Sir, Ali was willing to take his own life
to complete his mission.

318
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,763
His only vulnerability is his family.

319
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:27,129
It is not the policy of this country
to kill innocent children.

320
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:29,807
The action would take place in his country.

321
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:33,169
You would not be involved.
This would be a field decision.

322
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:37,371
My decision is final. I'm sorry, Jack.

323
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,004
Yes, sir.

324
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:45,452
I understand, Mr President.

325
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:49,162
No, I do not think that
there is another alternative.

326
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:52,643
I know it's a difficult decision, sir.

327
00:28:54,453 --> 00:28:55,602
Yes, sir.

328
00:28:57,093 --> 00:29:01,086
Thank you for your support, Mr President.

329
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,528
He authorised the action.

330
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:20,882
- Roger Stanton isn't available.
- When can I talk to him?

331
00:29:20,973 --> 00:29:22,804
That's all I can say, Rich.

332
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:27,364
If you have a tactical question, talk to
Scott Grant. He's got the NSA playbook.

333
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,569
- I can use your name?
- Sure.

334
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:32,929
Mike. Can I just have
a quick word with you, please?

335
00:29:33,013 --> 00:29:34,332
Yeah, sure, Lynne.

336
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:41,643
I don't trust Sherry Palmer.
She shouldn't be here.

337
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:46,602
I'm up to my eyeballs trying to hide this
interrogation with Stanton from Washington.

338
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:49,412
If you have a problem, deal with it yourself.

339
00:29:49,493 --> 00:29:53,281
I think you know me well enough
to know this is not some battle over turf.

340
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:57,161
- This is about Roger Stanton.
- What?

341
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:01,724
I was waiting for the appropriate time
to tell you. I wanted to be sure.

342
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:05,203
Someone has approached me
with evidence of communications

343
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:08,046
between Roger Stanton and Sherry Palmer,

344
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:11,409
and it has been over the last six months.

345
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:16,169
Roger said he met her today
for the first time.

346
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:18,323
Yes. I know.

347
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:26,321
My God.

348
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:36,245
You've known Sherry for a very long time.
Is today indicative of how she operates?

349
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:41,969
Then this shouldn't be
too much of a shock to you.

350
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:49,411
Sherry Palmer's a lot of things,
but a traitor to this country?

351
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:54,044
I don't believe that.
What kind of communication? Phone calls?

352
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:57,443
Yes. Phone calls, emails. Mike.

353
00:30:57,533 --> 00:30:59,524
Face to face.

354
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:03,803
Who's your source on this?

355
00:31:03,893 --> 00:31:06,282
It's been through an intermediary,

356
00:31:06,373 --> 00:31:11,003
but I actually have a meeting
with the source in about ten minutes.

357
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:13,402
- Where?
- Off site.

358
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:20,283
- Are you telling the president?
- No. He's got enough on his plate already.

359
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:26,050
And he'd want proof, anyway.
You go ahead with your meeting.

360
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,522
Let me know what happens.

361
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:34,288
- Be careful.
- I will. Thank you.

362
00:31:39,013 --> 00:31:43,211
- Shall we proceed as planned?
- Affirmative. Start with the older son, Asad.

363
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:46,126
If that's not successful,
move on to his younger son.

364
00:31:46,213 --> 00:31:50,286
- Copy that. Waiting for your orders.
- We are a go.

365
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:58,644
I can't wait any longer.
Tell me where the bomb is or I will kill Asad.

366
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:07,007
Ali, I know you think what you’re doing
is right, but it's my job to not let it happen.

367
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:12,645
Please don't make me do this.
Asad is just a boy. Tell me where the bomb is!

368
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:16,282
Tell me where the bomb is! Fine.

369
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:18,364
Kill him!

370
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,925
No! No!

371
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:35,044
Tell me where the bomb is!

372
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:42,284
- Tell me, and I'll spare your family!
- I will not tell you!

373
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:43,885
Your meeting's changed. Now it's with me.

374
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:49,212
No, don't go anywhere, Lynne.
We need to talk.

375
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,409
- I don't think so.
- Yes, we do.

376
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:56,886
You think you've connected me to Roger.
That's exactly what they want you to think.

377
00:33:56,973 --> 00:34:00,602
- Who is "they"?
- The people Roger's conspiring with.

378
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:06,288
So you're confirming that Roger Stanton
is involved? He knew about this bomb?

379
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:10,525
Roger's more involved
than David could possibly know.

380
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:13,525
What the hell does that mean?

381
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:19,165
- This conspiracy, what is its goal, then?
- To take over the presidency.

382
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:23,292
These people are feeding you
misinformation about me

383
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:25,841
because they're afraid I'll get in the way.

384
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:28,208
How did you know about this meeting?

385
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:30,932
I don't have to be involved
to know the moves.

386
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:34,892
If you knew what Roger was doing,
why haven’t you said anything?

387
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:39,046
Probably for the same reasons
you're keeping this line of inquiry to yourself.

388
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:42,284
I want to have as much
concrete evidence as possible.

389
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:48,130
Sherry, you could have said any of this to me
back at the retreat. Why come here?

390
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:52,331
To make a point. That's all.

391
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:56,446
To make a point?

392
00:34:57,253 --> 00:35:00,006
I think this is a warning.

393
00:35:00,093 --> 00:35:05,042
I think you orchestrated all of this
to show me how powerful you are.

394
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:08,808
You have your own and not the president's
best interest at heart.

395
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:16,129
I will do everything to make sure you don't
hurt him or undermine this administration.

396
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:34,685
Asad is dead. There's nothing
I can do to change that.

397
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:37,526
You can still save Fareed's life.

398
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:40,446
I'll give you ten seconds. Where's the bomb?

399
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:46,165
You're running out of time.
I will tell these men to kill your last son!

400
00:35:46,253 --> 00:35:48,483
Where is the bomb?

401
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:50,768
That's it. Take him out!

402
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:54,733
- I will tell you!
- Hold it.

403
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:56,644
- I will tell you.
- Tell me now!

404
00:35:56,733 --> 00:36:00,806
- It is at Norton Airfield.
- Why? What's the plan?

405
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:07,048
We were going to fly over downtown
and detonate it.

406
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:14,409
It is true. It is... it is true.

407
00:36:22,093 --> 00:36:24,243
- Dessler.
- It's Jack. Get me Mason.

408
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,324
It's Jack.

409
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,202
What do you have?

410
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:32,286
The bomb's at Norton Airfield.
They're planning to fly it over the city.

411
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:37,322
Norton's a medium-size airfield.
They do cargo, private aviation.

412
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:42,771
Every plane's tail number begins with the
letter "N". That's probably what this refers to.

413
00:36:42,853 --> 00:36:44,889
OK. We're on our way.

414
00:36:44,973 --> 00:36:48,329
We're moving units Bravo,
Echo and Lima to Norton Airfield,

415
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:50,802
where we believe that the bomb is located.

416
00:36:50,893 --> 00:36:54,124
Call FAA and have them
ground flights in or out of Norton.

417
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:58,889
If they do get the plane in the air, we wanna
have two F-16s at the ready to intercept.

418
00:36:58,973 --> 00:37:02,602
We'll get bomb units and SWAT teams
over there as well, so just move.

419
00:37:02,693 --> 00:37:07,448
And, remember, the "no unnecessary contact"
rule remains in place.

420
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:17,728
Put Miss Warner against the wall.

421
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:21,772
You killed my boy!
You killed my boy! You killed my boy!

422
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:25,528
I will get you for this! You will die for this!

423
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:33,411
How could you? You're worse than they are.

424
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:38,203
Reroute the satellite back to normal feed.
I want confirmation.

425
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:42,889
Rerouted satellite.
You should have live picture now.

426
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:45,764
Thank you.

427
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:48,847
Hold this for me.

428
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:53,208
We're gonna come in from the north.

429
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:58,162
Set up our men coming in from the south
from these two gates.

430
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:04,208
He's alive.

431
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:10,692
It was all an act.

432
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:16,292
Kate, come with me,
help me talk to your sister.

433
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:17,647
What? Where?

434
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:20,645
Norton Airfield. It's where the bomb's located.

435
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:23,691
- Do you really think she's there?
- Yes, I do.

436
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:30,925
- Please, Kate, we don't have much time.
- OK.

437
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:32,562
Come on.

438
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:38,764
Here you go, sir.

439
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:53,528
Wake up. Stay with me, Mr Stanton. Wake up.

440
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:58,323
There we go. Who else knew
about the bomb, Mr Stanton?

441
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:27,325
