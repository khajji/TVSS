1
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:15,811
You may not be able to contact me.

2
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:18,088
- Why?
- Chappelle became a problem.

3
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:20,289
I had to take him out of play
and they're onto me.

4
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:23,445
- They'll take me out soon.
- Who do I contact if I need help?

5
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:25,922
Michelle is setting up an off-site station.

6
00:00:26,013 --> 00:00:28,766
- You're under arrest. Where's Dessler?
- I can find her.

7
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:32,689
Affirmative, Central. She's in custody.

8
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:35,565
Kim? Hello?

9
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:37,371
- Who are you?
- I'm Kate Warner.

10
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,125
Your father sent me to come get you.

11
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:42,603
Why would my dad send someone
he'd just met to come get me?

12
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,172
He trusts me.

13
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,165
The sooner we leave, the sooner
you and your dad can be together.

14
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:49,608
The Attorney General said
you'd want me for your counsel.

15
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:52,287
- What have they told you?
- You've been removed from office.

16
00:00:52,373 --> 00:00:56,446
The evidence was manipulated
by a man named Peter Kingsley.

17
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,649
I need you to find out all you can about him.

18
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:02,442
- What happens now?
- We got one last play. Deliver Kingsley.

19
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:05,889
He's far too dangerous,
and you'll never get close to him.

20
00:01:05,973 --> 00:01:08,612
You're right. I won't, but you will.

21
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,923
Kingsley doesn't know Hewitt's been killed.

22
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:13,686
If you say you can deliver him,
that should get his attention.

23
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,082
I want the tapes that you made
of our conversation.

24
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:17,891
I'll give you Alex Hewitt in return.

25
00:01:17,973 --> 00:01:21,045
All right. LA Coliseum, gate 18, 30 minutes.

26
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:25,251
- What support will you get from CTU?
- As of now, none. Ow!

27
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:27,929
Jack? Jack!

28
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,801
- You OK?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:55,203
Come on.

30
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:59,081
Damn it. The car won't start.
We gotta get out of here.

31
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:03,732
My seat belt's jammed.

32
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:08,450
Mrs Palmer, I'm gonna need your help.

33
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,605
Mrs Palmer, please don't do this.

34
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:15,605
I'm sorry, but I have to take care of myself.

35
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:17,649
When I'm free I'll call an ambulance.

36
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:21,408
- You can't do this!
- I don't have a choice.

37
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,165
You're a very impressive man,

38
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:26,211
but you see everything as
either good or bad, just like David.

39
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:29,683
- The world is so much more complicated.
- No, it's simple.

40
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:33,732
There's a war about to start and you're
the only person who can help me stop it.

41
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:37,886
- What about the president?
- He turned away from me.

42
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:42,603
After 25 years of building a life together,
a family, he turned me away.

43
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:45,366
Eventually they will connect you
to this conspiracy.

44
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:47,842
That bomb was never supposed to go off.

45
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:50,845
None of this was supposed
to happen this way.

46
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:55,211
I know. I believe you.
You can put an end to it now.

47
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:59,366
If you help me get Kingsley,
your husband will get his presidency back.

48
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,808
That will be because of you.

49
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:04,282
Mrs Palmer, please.

50
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,762
God damn it!

51
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:24,051
What do you want me to do?

52
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:28,285
There's a knife in the glove box.
Help cut me out.

53
00:03:32,373 --> 00:03:33,772
Come on in.

54
00:03:33,853 --> 00:03:38,643
This is much better. It's simpler.
We gotta be able to explain this thing.

55
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:42,328
- I need to talk to you, Mike.
- I'll be down in five minutes.

56
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,131
Mike.

57
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:45,805
It's important.

58
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,172
Excuse me.

59
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:02,845
What is it?

60
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,243
It's a file on Peter Kingsley.
They pulled it up a few minutes ago.

61
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,167
Peter Kingsley, the man Jack Bauer
thinks is behind the bomb.

62
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:13,563
There's a record of phone calls he made,
as recently as six hours ago,

63
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,609
to a soldier named Jonathan Wallace.

64
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,730
Wallace was a member
of the Coral Snake brigade.

65
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:21,407
He apparently killed his own men.

66
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:24,603
I know who Wallace is.

67
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:28,368
The planes have passed over
their final checkpoint

68
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:30,887
and will reach their targets within the hour.

69
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:33,043
Our primary targets are all military,

70
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:37,684
but one includes a command-and-control
centre inside a residential area.

71
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:42,767
As smart as our weapons have become,
there may be some collateral damage.

72
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:46,207
You mean civilian casualties.

73
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:47,487
Yes, sir.

74
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:52,049
- There's no way to avoid these?
- I'm afraid not.

75
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:57,890
Then it's something
we're just gonna have to live with.

76
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:03,042
Ryan Chappelle.

77
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:07,649
- Ryan, this is Mike Novick.
- How can I help you, sir?

78
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:12,761
I know there’s been some confusion today
about the veracity of the Cyprus audio.

79
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:16,129
Not really. Our teams came
to the same conclusion as Langley.

80
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:21,287
Do you know if Bauer's still trying to find
evidence that the recording was fabricated?

81
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:24,285
Yes, but he's operating outside our authority.

82
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,933
I want you to assist his investigation.

83
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:31,165
- Sir, I don't even know where he is.
- Then find him.

84
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,892
I'm not sure why you're asking me to do this.

85
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:36,726
I was told we're at war
and to proceed accordingly.

86
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:40,283
We're not at war yet.
You have 30 minutes to report back to me

87
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,489
the findings of Bauer and your efforts.

88
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:44,803
- But sir...
- That's a direct order, Ryan.

89
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:48,852
You have my channel.
Call me back on this line. That's all.

90
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:56,049
- I'll be on the plane in an hour.
- Why the delay?

91
00:05:56,133 --> 00:05:59,842
The bomb detonating in the wrong location
created a little extra work.

92
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,208
Nothing to worry about, I hope.

93
00:06:02,293 --> 00:06:04,761
Not at all. I won't bore you with the details.

94
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:06,764
Bore me.

95
00:06:07,893 --> 00:06:10,532
I still have to take care of Alex Hewitt.

96
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:13,650
Hewitt is the only one
who can bring this whole thing down.

97
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:16,725
- You told me you'd have him by now.
- I wasn't able to find him.

98
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:20,010
But I'm taking care of it. Don't worry.

99
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:29,529
Sit down, both of you.

100
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:32,605
You don't need Michelle here.
She was acting under my orders.

101
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:36,049
- I can defend myself, Tony.
- I said sit down.

102
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:46,528
I need you to get me in contact
with Jack Bauer.

103
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:53,370
Oh, I see. Jack got some support above you
and now you're being squeezed, right?

104
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:55,842
Can you do it or not?

105
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,969
What's goin' on?

106
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:02,683
Bauer's evidence might
actually have some relevance.

107
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:06,083
- Which means we were right.
- No. You damn near put me in a coma.

108
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,368
That's assault.

109
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:16,047
I'll tell you what.
You drop the charges against us...

110
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:21,012
and we'll help you.

111
00:07:23,733 --> 00:07:28,204
Come on, Ryan. You of all people
know that’s your best move.

112
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:36,327
- Fine.
- In writing.

113
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:40,531
All right, in writing.
Just get me in touch with Bauer.

114
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:48,409
- Shouldn't we call for help?
- I'm not working under CTU's authority.

115
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,405
- To them I don't exist.
- So we're out on our own.

116
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,085
Completely.

117
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,483
- Are you all right? You need some help?
- He got hurt.

118
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:59,485
- Can you get us to a hospital?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

119
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:02,690
- Mrs Palmer, you need to drive.
- What do you mean?

120
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:07,005
- Sorry, but we need your car.
- Hey, easy, all right? Go ahead, take it.

121
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,049
Thank you.

122
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,963
They're ready, sir.

123
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:47,762
- Miss Warner. Hi. Carrie Turner.
- Hi. Kate.

124
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,492
- You must be Jack's daughter Kim.
- Where's my dad?

125
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:55,044
He's still in the field. Wait here.
I'll tell Ryan Chappelle you're here.

126
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,523
- I'll handle this.
- I thought you were in custody.

127
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:01,252
I was released.

128
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:06,091
Kim, I heard what happened to you.
Are you all right?

129
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:10,849
Yeah, I guess so. Look, I just wanna see
my dad and make sure he's OK.

130
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:14,369
No, he's not here right now.
He won't be back for a couple of hours.

131
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,570
- Does he know I'm here?
- No. We'll tell him when he phones in.

132
00:09:17,653 --> 00:09:21,726
- Jack insisted we call as soon as we get here.
- He's just not reachable now.

133
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:25,886
I'll have Carrie take you back and
get you situated. I'll be there in a minute.

134
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:28,687
Hey.

135
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:31,045
It's gonna be OK.

136
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,291
OK.

137
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,164
Miss Warner?

138
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:42,842
I don't know if you're aware of this but...

139
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:46,323
your father came back here
after we released him.

140
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:47,368
Why?

141
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,809
He wanted to talk to your sister
before she was taken away.

142
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:54,283
- They brought Marie back here?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,926
You lied to me?

144
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:06,607
You killed Reza?

145
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,690
You tried to kill your own sister?

146
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:16,484
You were willing to set off a nuclear bomb
in a city with ten million people?

147
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:24,685
You tell me why.
Because I need to understand.

148
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:31,882
Tell me that they forced you to do it, that they
brainwashed you, that they threatened you.

149
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:36,205
You can tell me that you didn't
know what you were doin'.

150
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:40,532
There must be a reason.

151
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:43,841
There is no reason, Dad.

152
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:51,087
I can't accept that.

153
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,244
I couldn't either.

154
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:07,251
Until I looked into her eyes and she pointed
a gun at me and started to pull the trigger.

155
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:13,564
Trust me, Dad.

156
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,570
She's not gonna give you any answers.

157
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:23,044
She can't. At least, nothing
that we could ever understand.

158
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,245
Dad...

159
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,122
Come on. Let's go.

160
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,925
Kate.

161
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,052
You think you'll be safe out there.

162
00:12:47,253 --> 00:12:49,164
You won't be.

163
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,006
- Jack, it's Tony.
- Tony, you back in play?

164
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:09,561
Yeah. Jack, Kim's here at CTU.

165
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:13,646
- She's safe.
- Thank God. Don't tell her what's going on.

166
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,452
- Just say I'll be back as soon as I can.
- I will.

167
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,809
- Jack, this is Ryan. We need to talk.
- You son of a bitch.

168
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:22,407
You stopped that chopper
picking up me and Hewitt.

169
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:26,645
- Hewitt's dead. I hold you responsible.
- Listen, things have changed.

170
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:30,203
You got full support.
Give me your mission profile.

171
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:33,404
I've set up a meeting with Kingsley.

172
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,166
We're gonna meet him
at the LA Coliseum, gate 18.

173
00:13:36,253 --> 00:13:38,528
Mrs Palmer will wear a wire
and make him confirm

174
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:41,207
that the three countries had
nothing to do with the nuke.

175
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:45,172
Stand down until you get some support.
Our people will be there soon.

176
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:48,643
We don't have time. Kingsley's
expecting the meet to go down now.

177
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,644
You need backup.

178
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:56,649
If you wanna help me, get me voice prints of
Kingsley and Mrs Palmer for authentication.

179
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:57,882
Done.

180
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:02,125
- And a live audio feed to the White House.
- You want an audience with the president.

181
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,363
Yes.

182
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,648
All right. Keep the line clear.

183
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:11,966
- Copy. We're pulling into the Coliseum now.
- We need to get a SWAT team to his location.

184
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,282
Pull over there.

185
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,002
Wait here for me.

186
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:40,124
Come on.

187
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,211
Let's get you wired.

188
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:55,246
Take your jacket off your shoulder.

189
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,209
This is a wireless transmitter.

190
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:04,731
They won't know to look for it.
They won't be able to trace it.

191
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:09,409
- This is crazy. We shouldn't do this alone.
- We don't have another choice.

192
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:13,008
Remember, Kingsley doesn't want
to leave here without Hewitt.

193
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:16,085
That's gotta be to our advantage.

194
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:24,407
OK, say something.

195
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:26,484
I'm scared.

196
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:30,444
OK, it's working.

197
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,406
- Yes, Mike.
- Mr President,

198
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:47,372
I am against any delay in our military actions.
I have been from the start.

199
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:53,608
But there is a good chance we'll receive
evidence soon the Cyprus recording is false.

200
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:56,969
We know Second Wave brought
the nuke into the country

201
00:15:57,053 --> 00:16:00,966
and we know they're sponsored by
these three countries. What am I missing?

202
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:04,887
I don't have all the details,
but I just learned about a possible link

203
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:08,602
between Second Wave
and a man named Peter Kingsley.

204
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,206
Who is he?

205
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:15,686
He's apparently part of a consortium of oil
interests with contracts in the Caspian Sea.

206
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:17,729
An oil consortium's behind the nuke?

207
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:22,648
Bauer believes he can get a confession
from Kingsley. He's set up a live audio feed.

208
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,009
Our bombers are due to drop their payloads
in less than 20 minutes.

209
00:16:26,093 --> 00:16:29,051
Bauer's meeting Kingsley any minute.

210
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,012
This is the live voice print.

211
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:37,166
And this is the voice file we have on record

212
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:42,646
which will prove that it is,
in fact, Sherry Palmer.

213
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,963
- It's confirmed.
- The one below is Kingsley?

214
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,726
- Yeah.
- Are you guys getting this?

215
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:50,407
- We're good here.
- How far out is our backup?

216
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:53,610
- They're 11 minutes out.
- That's too long. We've gotta go now.

217
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,649
- Just wait.
- We can't.

218
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:59,521
We're already ten minutes past
the meeting time. Is Prescott ready?

219
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:03,242
Tony's on with the White House.
They're setting up a live audio feed.

220
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,891
OK, good. We are set to go.

221
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:10,282
How are you doing, Mrs Palmer?

222
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:13,490
What's to prevent Kingsley
from shooting me?

223
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:15,962
He won't do anything until he gets Hewitt.

224
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:20,331
But the moment he realises
we don't have Hewitt...

225
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:22,722
I'll be covering your back.

226
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:27,682
That's not very comforting
considering the condition you're in.

227
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:30,162
I may not make it out of this.

228
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:36,047
I'm not gonna lie to you, Mrs Palmer.
That's a possibility.

229
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:46,481
I'm doing this for David.
You know that, don’t you?

230
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,251
Yes.

231
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,167
Will you tell him that?
In case something happens.

232
00:17:56,613 --> 00:18:01,164
I'll take care of it, Mrs Palmer.
You've gotta go now.

233
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:31,452
- Mike.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:35,572
We just finished setting up the feed.
I hope this isn't gonna be a waste of our time.

235
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,247
Believe me, Mr President, so do I.

236
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,083
What's going on, Mike?

237
00:18:45,053 --> 00:18:48,170
The president and I thought
you should be part of this.

238
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:52,326
Along with Prescott and the Attorney General,
we will be listening to a live feed.

239
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:56,008
- Of what?
- A sting operation against Peter Kingsley.

240
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,732
It appears he was the architect
of today's bombing

241
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:01,452
and the delivery of the Cyprus audio.

242
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,284
- Bauer found Kingsley.
- Yes.

243
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:09,924
But... it won't be Bauer
who'll be talking to Kingsley.

244
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:15,926
What difference does it make
as long as we get him to incriminate himself?

245
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,325
What is it, Mike?

246
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,729
It's Sherry who'll be talking to Kingsley.

247
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,485
I don't understand.

248
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:36,363
It seems that Kingsley recruited her
some months ago.

249
00:19:36,453 --> 00:19:39,013
She was part of this.

250
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:44,171
Sherry was working with this man, Kingsley?

251
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,971
It appears that way, sir.

252
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,847
To detonate a nuclear bomb and start a war?

253
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,412
No.

254
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:55,771
It's unclear how much she knew,
or how deep she was in it.

255
00:19:56,573 --> 00:20:00,964
We just have to hope she can extract
a confession from Kingsley.

256
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:04,807
So now Sherry is working with Jack Bauer
to bring down Kingsley?

257
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:08,727
Yes. And at considerable risk to herself.

258
00:21:02,213 --> 00:21:05,091
Scott, don't do anything until I tell you to.

259
00:21:05,173 --> 00:21:07,733
- We need Hewitt.
- Understood.

260
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:06,210
- Where's Hewitt?
- He's safe.

261
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,528
Where is he?

262
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:13,167
You lied to me. You wanted
this bomb to go off all along.

263
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,291
You used Roger Stanton and you used me.

264
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:19,807
Yes, I did.

265
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:25,206
Well, now I'm tied to you, and
the nuclear detonation. I want safe haven.

266
00:22:25,293 --> 00:22:28,763
- That's your problem.
- Well, I just made it yours.

267
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,321
Because you won't see Hewitt until I'm safe.

268
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:35,372
- Don't horse trade with me.
- Don't insult my intelligence.

269
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:39,526
- We got a match on Kingsley's voice.
- Ryan, you got it.

270
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:43,851
You're not going anywhere till I have Hewitt.

271
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,969
That doesn't work for me.

272
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:55,644
I'll call you on this line to give you
Hewitt's location after I'm safely away.

273
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,689
You don't need to know where I'm going.

274
00:22:57,773 --> 00:23:01,971
- We're not getting what we need here.
- She'll get it for you.

275
00:23:06,933 --> 00:23:11,165
- Now there’s the matter of the recordings.
- They're right here.

276
00:23:11,253 --> 00:23:14,768
Every phone conversation
between you and me.

277
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:21,965
No. I want all of them, including Cyprus.

278
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:27,002
Why Cyprus?
You had nothing to do with that.

279
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:30,165
- Insurance.
- Insurance?

280
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:35,850
Once the country goes to war, the
government will never let that be exposed.

281
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:38,845
Hewitt is the only one who can hurt us.

282
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,766
- Because he forged the Cyprus recording.
- Right.

283
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:46,369
- You got your proof. Let me go ahead.
- Get it confirmed from the White House.

284
00:23:46,453 --> 00:23:49,923
- She can't stay much longer.
- Are you satisfied?

285
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:53,210
CTU wants to know
if that's enough to prove it.

286
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:57,252
Have you confirmed this is live
and the voices have been authenticated?

287
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:59,528
Yes, sir.

288
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:04,286
- So that's it.
- Yes.

289
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:07,729
When I land... I'll call you.

290
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,012
Hm.

291
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:15,532
You're bluffin'.
You don't have Hewitt, do you?

292
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:18,173
- Oh, yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

293
00:24:24,533 --> 00:24:27,172
Scott, take her out.

294
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,484
Kill her.

295
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:47,003
Run, Sherry!

296
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:48,842
Come on. Come on.

297
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:02,773
Mrs Palmer, get out of here. Go!

298
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:36,448
Jack Bauer.

299
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:46,288
You've caused me a lot of trouble today, Jack.

300
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,484
You're not gonna give me Hewitt, are you?

301
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,086
Our bombers are three minutes
from the targets.

302
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:40,325
Initiating sequence
six one tango one.

303
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:43,362
Target in view. Weapons lock.

304
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:46,851
Are we go for a strike?

305
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,766
Are we go for a launch?

306
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:52,971
We are awaiting command.

307
00:28:53,053 --> 00:28:55,009
Abort the attack.

308
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:58,130
Abort, abort.

309
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:15,370
What do you mean, Kingsley's dead?
How could that happen?

310
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,762
I warned you not to use him.

311
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:20,083
So we did use him and he failed.

312
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:22,971
But it won't matter.
Once the war starts we'll be OK.

313
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,932
- It isn't going to start.
- Why's that?

314
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:30,562
The president found out about the Cyprus
recording and called off the attack.

315
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:33,531
There isn't going to be any war, Max.

316
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:39,531
Well... we're going to have
to do this another way.

317
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:43,242
- Another way? What are you talking about?
- You'll find out.

318
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,244
It'll start today.

319
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:56,133
It's me. Go ahead.

320
00:29:59,373 --> 00:30:01,728
The cabinet has annulled its earlier action.

321
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:05,726
I have instructed the Secret Service
to resume its charge of serving you

322
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:08,532
as President of the United States.

323
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:10,772
I see.

324
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:15,085
I've also tendered my resignation,
effective immediately,

325
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:20,930
and those members of the cabinet who voted
against you have also agreed to resign.

326
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:25,364
Jim.

327
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,164
Gentlemen, ladies...

328
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:34,483
we came dangerously close to war today.

329
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:40,211
That all of us reacted emotionally
to the nuclear detonation is understandable.

330
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:46,648
But leaders are required
to have patience beyond human limits.

331
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:53,090
The kind of action we nearly took
should only be exercised

332
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:56,688
after all other avenues have been exhausted.

333
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:02,485
After the strictest standard
of proof has been met.

334
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:10,048
By casting me aside so quickly,
you effectively lowered those standards.

335
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:12,647
And that was a profound mistake.

336
00:31:24,293 --> 00:31:28,844
It was not, however,
a mistake you're likely to make again.

337
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:33,203
Therefore I do not accept your resignations.

338
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:37,213
We have a nation to heal today.

339
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:43,605
And all of you play a vital role
in that healing process.

340
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:48,848
Mr President...

341
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:53,161
I don't know what to say.

342
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:56,249
There's nothing to say.

343
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:58,811
We have work to do.

344
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,606
That'll be all.

345
00:32:07,813 --> 00:32:10,088
- Jenny, set up a press conference.
- When?

346
00:32:10,173 --> 00:32:12,767
As soon as you can. And I want it public.

347
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:17,802
I want to speak to the people directly.
They deserve my assurance.

348
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:19,929
Yes, sir.

349
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:28,846
Mike, I wanna thank you again
for calling CTU in the 11th hour.

350
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:33,525
Of course, Mr President.

351
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:41,927
But you should have been with me to the end.

352
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,128
That's what I expected of you.

353
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:49,447
That's why I appointed you.

354
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:02,850
I'm relieving you of your post,
effective immediately.

355
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:09,525
Yes, Mr President.

356
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:29,609
Thank you, sir.
I can't take all the credit myself.

357
00:33:29,693 --> 00:33:33,766
It's a great team
George Mason put together here.

358
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:36,083
Yes, I will. Thank you, sir.

359
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:41,170
Tony. That was District Director Vaughn.

360
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:45,246
He's so happy with what we did here today
he doesn't know where to start.

361
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,449
That's great.

362
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:51,765
So... what's up, my friend?

363
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:56,044
Well, um...

364
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,523
it's like this.

365
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:03,005
Either fire me...

366
00:34:03,093 --> 00:34:05,527
or get out of my chair.

367
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,522
The chair's all yours.

368
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:37,404
- Hey.
- Hey.

369
00:34:38,853 --> 00:34:43,483
The new shift is here.
They've been brought up to speed.

370
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:46,724
I was thinking I'd get
my brother and go home.

371
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:54,164
Michelle, um...

372
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:58,562
there's a handful of people
who made a big difference today.

373
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:00,769
You're one of'em.

374
00:35:00,853 --> 00:35:05,324
You made some tough choices and
went up against me. You were right.

375
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,685
Thanks.

376
00:35:10,813 --> 00:35:14,806
So, um... why don’t you
go home and get some rest?

377
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,525
Michelle.

378
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:32,967
See you tomorrow.

379
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:57,808
- I'll need to see the contents of your bag.
- I'm Kate Warner and this is Kim Bauer.

380
00:36:12,173 --> 00:36:14,164
Excuse me.

381
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:21,602
- Hey, honey.
- Daddy.

382
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:26,653
It's gonna be all right.

383
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:34,964
I know.

384
00:36:38,493 --> 00:36:40,723
I love you.

385
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:47,884
I love you too.

386
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:03,371
Dad? I'm gonna take care of you.

387
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:17,128
I urge you in the strongest terms

388
00:37:17,213 --> 00:37:22,970
not to indulge any rumours or theories
that you may have heard, or may soon hear.

389
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:27,806
Once the facts are known,
I will present them to you myself.

390
00:37:27,893 --> 00:37:33,445
Until then, know that we are all safe
and that we will continue to be safe.

391
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:41,722
The most patriotic thing that we can all do
today is to keep living our lives.

392
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:46,682
So I urge you all, go back to work,
go back to school.

393
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:51,612
Because the freedom we enjoy,
the freedom that we earn every day,

394
00:37:51,693 --> 00:37:56,562
is the very thing that will defeat
our enemies and keep us strong.

395
00:37:57,613 --> 00:37:59,524
God bless America.

396
00:38:02,493 --> 00:38:05,326
God bless us all. Thank you.

397
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,644
Thank you very much. God bless you.

398
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:13,491
Thank you. Thank you.

399
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:17,245
Thank you. Good to see you.

400
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,767
Thank you. Thank you.

401
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,606
Thank you. Thank you.

402
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:32,888
Thank you.

403
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:36,249
Mr President!

404
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:41,490
Hi.

405
00:38:42,813 --> 00:38:45,122
Excuse me, Mr President.

406
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:46,441
Thank you.

407
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,171
Mr President.

408
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:51,763
- Hi.
- Thank you.

409
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:56,291
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

410
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:00,643
- Yes.
- It's done.

411
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:02,849
Thank you.

412
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,644
Mr President?

413
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:28,011
The president's down!
We need medical assistance. Help!

414
00:40:30,653 --> 00:40:33,929
Mr President?

415
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,925
Mr President? It'll be all right, sir.

416
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:39,129
We need an ambulance! Help!

417
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:13,686
