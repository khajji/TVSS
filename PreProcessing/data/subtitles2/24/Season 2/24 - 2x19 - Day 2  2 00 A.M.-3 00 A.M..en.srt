1
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:15,049
Talk to me.

2
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:19,649
Jack made it clear that the only way
to get proof is if CTU stays out of it.

3
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:22,531
- We don't know if he's alive!
- He's on an open channel.

4
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:25,047
You can't trace it, but you can talk to him.

5
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:27,964
- Michelle!
- No, Jack, it's Tony.

6
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:31,602
The president asked me for proof
that the Cyprus recording was fake.

7
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:34,890
The man who can provide proof
will only deal with me.

8
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:37,123
How do we know he's not using you?

9
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,364
Ten commandos tried to kill him
to stop him making a deal with me.

10
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:41,283
Jack.

11
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:45,446
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Just tell me where the evidence is now.

12
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:47,603
It's on a memory chip.

13
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:52,244
The source recordings
prove the Cyprus audio is a fake.

14
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,324
Where's the memory chip?

15
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,131
Inside...

16
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:59,091
Come on, Wallace. Inside where?

17
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,851
Doctor!

18
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,924
He's dead.

19
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:08,964
We got the chip.

20
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:11,404
Our planes are over the Atlantic.

21
00:01:11,493 --> 00:01:14,291
They will be reaching
their targets in three hours.

22
00:01:14,373 --> 00:01:18,161
The secretary of defence
wants to know how much longer

23
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:21,086
you'll give Jack Bauer to disprove that tape.

24
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:25,530
Jack Bauer has up until the time
the planes start releasing bombs.

25
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:29,128
From the secretary's point of view,
that's tying the DOD's hands.

26
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,568
We're gonna utilise every moment we have.

27
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:34,725
- He's not gonna like that.
- That's his problem.

28
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:46,564
In order to exploit the advantages
of a surprise attack,

29
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:50,441
we've launched 12 bomb squadrons
from three stateside bases.

30
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:57,086
But initial air strikes will be launched from
our bases in the region here, here and here.

31
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:03,005
Your request was for air strikes to begin
before your address to the nation.

32
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:05,084
I know what I asked for.

33
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:09,804
That came out wrong.

34
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:14,409
You have done a remarkable job
mobilising our forces on such short notice.

35
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:16,085
Thank you, sir.

36
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:21,850
Mr President, is it fair to assume
that you’re still behind the attack?

37
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,448
Cos I'm sensing some equivocation.

38
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:32,083
I told the vice president,
but I haven't shared this with the rest of you.

39
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:37,245
Jack Bauer, the CTU agent most responsible
for finding the nuclear bomb,

40
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,086
believes the Cyprus audio is fabricated.

41
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:44,052
- Bauer has no hard evidence?
- Not at this point.

42
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:50,129
This battle plan requires our surprising the
enemy with a strike of overwhelming force.

43
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:53,649
We will lose that advantage
if we wait any longer.

44
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:57,408
The target countries
will mobilise their defences

45
00:02:57,493 --> 00:03:01,532
and our casualties will increase
over the long term.

46
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:04,525
- By how much?
- Up to 20,000 troops.

47
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:18,248
Then we have no choice

48
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,609
but to proceed with the plan as stated.

49
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:30,083
What I have to say to the president will have
a direct impact on the meeting that he's in.

50
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:35,406
- He can't be disturbed at this time.
- Fine. Just make sure he knows I called.

51
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:40,521
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
They won't interrupt until it's finished.

52
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,132
Come on.

53
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,564
- Almeida.
- It's Jack.

54
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:55,044
- Where are you?
- I can barely hear you. It's a bad connection.

55
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:58,762
- I want you to bring Wallace back here now.
- Wallace is dead.

56
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:04,530
But I got the evidence. It's a memory chip
containing the original source recordings.

57
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:07,605
- How do you know it's real?
- He died trying to give it to me.

58
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:12,926
He had it surgically implanted. I hardly think
he'd have done that if it wasn't authentic.

59
00:04:13,013 --> 00:04:17,131
- Where are you?
- In North Hollywood, 40 minutes from CTU.

60
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:20,842
- We'll bring you the chip.
- Call in your route. I'll send an aerial escort.

61
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:26,963
I need you to get in touch with the president.
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.

62
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:29,613
Not until I confirm what you’re holding is real.

63
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,285
Jack, come here.

64
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:34,126
You've got to at least
tell him what's going on.

65
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,681
- I need you here, Jack.
- Tony, can you hear me?

66
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:40,732
- I hear you, Jack.
- I gotta go. Please just do what I ask.

67
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,491
- What?
- We can't go anywhere with this chip.

68
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:47,326
- Look at this, embedded in the silicon.
- What is it?

69
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,927
A transponder. It acts like a tracking device.

70
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,526
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:51,613 --> 00:04:54,810
Our group uses circuits like this
to track sensitive material.

72
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:56,611
I don't understand.

73
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:59,969
Whoever Wallace stole the chip from
tracked him to the warehouse.

74
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:04,843
- They'll find us if I don't disconnect it.
- Can you avoid destroying the audio file?

75
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:06,924
- I think so.
- Good.

76
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:13,011
Danny, you have to stop doing this.
I told you not to call.

77
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:16,449
I'm sorry you're upset,
but I don't have time for this right now.

78
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,967
Why? What's going on?

79
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:22,523
Nothing. Don't worry.
We're taking care of things here.

80
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,923
Really? What am I supposed to do?

81
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:29,244
- Sit tight. I'll call you when I get a chance.
- Forget it.

82
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:38,889
Hey.

83
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,964
Something's wrong with the phones.

84
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:44,363
The network's been overloaded
since news of the bomb broke.

85
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:47,684
- Who were you talking to?
- No one. What's going on?

86
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:51,209
Jack just called. He says
he's got the evidence from Wallace.

87
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:55,889
- Does the president know?
- We haven't confirmed it's authentic yet.

88
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:59,249
The president's acting on the assumption
that the recording is real.

89
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:03,008
And this evidence may prove
that it's not. I know.

90
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:06,369
Tony, you've gotta call the president.

91
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:09,164
I'm thinking about it.

92
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:17,526
This is too big.
I need something with a finer point.

93
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:22,289
What about this? Will that work?

94
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:24,841
Yeah. Good.

95
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:31,282
- How much longer do you need?
- A minute or two.

96
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,648
- One or two?
- One if you stop bothering me.

97
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:36,725
Those people who want
their chip back are here.

98
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,168
Will the tracker still function?

99
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:43,644
- The signal should still transmit.
- I think I can lure them away from here.

100
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:47,772
- You and Kate get the chip over to CTU.
- Us?

101
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:50,048
Don't worry. This is gonna work.

102
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:54,965
Kate, move here against the wall.

103
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:06,565
- Got it.
- Bring it here.

104
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:09,213
Still locked on target?

105
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,602
This way.

106
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:18,290
OK. I want you to meet me at Moorpark
and Vineland, a few blocks west of here.

107
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:23,970
If I'm not there in 15 minutes, leave without
me, but you get that chip to Tony Almeida.

108
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:27,489
- Be careful.
- I'll be OK.

109
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:39,084
Signal's dropping off.

110
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,769
- Wait. He's moving.
- Where?

111
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:46,562
Just ahead. Toward the east entrance.

112
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:51,005
I'll catch up.

113
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:06,525
I waited till the meeting broke to tell you
the governor called from Sacramento.

114
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,173
- What's going on?
- People are hitting the streets.

115
00:09:09,253 --> 00:09:12,689
He wants you to dispatch
the National Guard like you did in Marietta.

116
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:17,130
Mr President, Tony Almeida is holding
for you on the emergency Satcom network.

117
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:18,441
Why on Satcom?

118
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:21,969
Since news of the bomb got out,
network circuits have been overloaded.

119
00:09:22,053 --> 00:09:25,966
90%of all systems
went down a few minutes ago.

120
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:30,490
- I can talk to Almeida if you want.
- Put him on speaker.

121
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,890
Mr Almeida, this is President Palmer.

122
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,646
You're also on with
Mike Novick and Lynne Kresge.

123
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,691
Jack Bauer just called
with some new information.

124
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:44,322
I'm a little conflicted about
contacting you with this.

125
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:47,928
He has evidence that proves
the Cyprus recording is counterfeit.

126
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:52,245
- What kind of evidence?
- Source recordings of each of the men.

127
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,769
- They were then re-edited.
- Have these been authenticated?

128
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:58,890
- Not yet. We're getting 'em soon.
- How soon?

129
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,964
Within the hour, sir.

130
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:05,369
Mr Almeida, your confidence
in Jack Bauer is curious.

131
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:09,332
An hour ago you told me
he assaulted CTU personnel

132
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:12,883
and took illegal custody of a witness.

133
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:16,443
- He had no choice under the circumstances.
- I don't follow.

134
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:22,403
The man with the evidence would not
have turned it over had Jack involved CTU.

135
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:26,964
So what makes you so sure that this is
any more real than the Cyprus recording?

136
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:29,567
That's just it, sir. I'm not.

137
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:32,121
- But Jack Bauer is.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:40,845
Thank you for your candour.
I'll take this information under advisement.

139
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,527
Thank you, Mr President.

140
00:11:01,173 --> 00:11:04,324
I'm calling off the attack.

141
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:08,602
Sir, before you do that, we should
talk through the consequences.

142
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:11,048
We've talked enough, Mike.

143
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:17,129
I appreciate your respect for Jack Bauer. I do.
But you know the man's reputation.

144
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,443
I know the man.

145
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:22,093
Then start thinking
about your own reputation.

146
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,891
Meaning?

147
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:27,045
A nuclear bomb was detonated on US soil.

148
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:32,446
We've been shown proof connecting the
weapon to three nations in the Middle East.

149
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,171
Proof that may be false.

150
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:37,325
Unless you respond decisively,

151
00:11:37,413 --> 00:11:43,363
your enemies will exploit that as a failure of
leadership, as a sign of personal weakness.

152
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,523
So what are you saying, Mike?

153
00:11:45,613 --> 00:11:50,528
That I should continue with a military
operation just to prove that I'm decisive?

154
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:54,322
- What if Jack Bauer's right?
- What if he's wrong?

155
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,211
Sir, we have all heard
the Pentagon's assessment.

156
00:11:57,293 --> 00:12:02,811
Stopping and restarting military action could
cost tens of thousands of American lives.

157
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:09,082
An acceptable risk if the alternative is
waging war against three innocent countries.

158
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:15,089
Mr President, we know from past experience
these countries aren't innocent.

159
00:12:15,173 --> 00:12:21,282
I'm urging you in the strongest
possible terms to reconsider.

160
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:38,362
I've made up my mind.
Now get General Gratz back in here.

161
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:40,603
Conference in the Joint Chiefs.

162
00:12:46,653 --> 00:12:49,645
They look fine. Send them to District.

163
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:52,524
Excuse me.

164
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:57,609
Hey. Look...

165
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:02,323
I just wanted you to know
that I told the president about Jack.

166
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:03,766
- You did?
- Yeah.

167
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:07,971
If Jack has what he says he has,
the president should know about it.

168
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,611
How did he react?

169
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:14,244
He wants us to keep him
apprised of the situation.

170
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,642
You did the right thing, Tony.

171
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:19,201
We'll find out when Jack
gets here with that chip.

172
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:21,761
- When did he say?
- About 20 minutes.

173
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:24,651
When he does get here,
make sure that thing is real.

174
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:27,611
I'll pull up the CPB software right now.

175
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:29,649
All right. Thanks.

176
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,803
Tony.

177
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,451
Yeah?

178
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,932
Thank you.

179
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:37,642
Yeah.

180
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:47,929
All circuits are busy.
Please try your call again.

181
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,890
- Still no signal?
- I have signal.

182
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:53,852
- I just can't get through.
- Maybe it's from CTU's end.

183
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,642
I'm sure they're very busy
gearing up for the war against my country.

184
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,531
There won't be a war, Yusuf.
They'll get the chip.

185
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:04,367
- They're gonna know the truth.
- Assuming they want the truth.

186
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:06,967
They don't want war.

187
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:09,044
You sure about that?

188
00:14:15,253 --> 00:14:20,850
You might feel differently
if it was your family being threatened.

189
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:26,443
- Vineland and Moorpark, right?
- Yeah.

190
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:43,442
I'll keep an eye out for Jack.

191
00:14:45,373 --> 00:14:47,762
- He's in the northeast quadrant.
- Moving?

192
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,809
- Just stopped.
- Davis, where are you?

193
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:52,361
Sweeping north along the east wall.

194
00:14:52,453 --> 00:14:55,331
He's inside the northeast corner.
Pin him down.

195
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:56,129
Yes, sir.

196
00:14:56,213 --> 00:15:00,286
- Do not kill him until I have that chip.
- Understood.

197
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:35,450
He took the tracker off the chip.

198
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:39,128
Ronnie, he's running north toward Magnolia.
Come on, let's go!

199
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:00,565
All right, let's get him back inside.

200
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:19,571
Is the president dedicated to this action?

201
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:22,326
General, this was not
a decision he made lightly.

202
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:28,045
- I haven't been briefed on this.
- The president will explain his decision.

203
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,966
Until he does,
you should brief your own staff.

204
00:16:31,053 --> 00:16:35,888
- All right. I'll take care of it.
- Thank you for your patience.

205
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:39,170
- More blowback?
- And then some.

206
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:44,486
Mike, have you heard anything about
this meeting that the vice president called?

207
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:45,642
A meeting?

208
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:51,603
Apparently he's asked Cabinet members
to be on hand an hour and a half from now.

209
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:54,810
- What's the agenda?
- I don't know, because I wasn't invited.

210
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:58,169
- Who told you about this meeting?
- Someone on Gendler's staff.

211
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:02,087
He doesn't know anything more
than what I'm telling you.

212
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:06,086
Is it something to do with
the president calling off the military strikes?

213
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,006
Mike, what else could it be?

214
00:17:09,093 --> 00:17:12,802
- Did you tell the president about this?
- No, not until I find out more.

215
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:18,206
- For all I know, it could just be a rumour.
- That's probably all it is.

216
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:23,492
- I'll ask around anyway.
- Keep me posted if you hear anything.

217
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:53,763
- O'Hara.
- Where's Stark?

218
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:55,844
Right here.

219
00:17:57,573 --> 00:17:59,803
Get him up. Yes?

220
00:17:59,893 --> 00:18:01,690
Ronnie, you got the chip?

221
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,923
I'm with the agent who took it off Wallace.

222
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:06,049
- It was Jack Bauer, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

223
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:09,921
We've scanned his clothing
and induced vomiting to check his stomach.

224
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:14,848
It's a waste of time. He's not gonna
have it on him. Let me talk to him.

225
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,484
Yes, sir.

226
00:18:24,733 --> 00:18:26,724
You're on with Bauer.

227
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:31,209
Jack, you're a hero here. Congratulations.

228
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,443
Let me tell you what I wanna do.

229
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:38,004
The world doesn't have to know anything
about the arrangement we're about to make.

230
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,527
- We'll keep it private.
- Who am I talking to?

231
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:48,611
Give me a break. Look, I need the chip.
So let's not be pigs here, all right?

232
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:51,083
You tell Ronnie where it is,

233
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:57,169
I authorise a very large sum, large enough to
compensate you for any guilt you might feel.

234
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:58,527
It's not for sale.

235
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:00,569
If someone wants to buy it, it is.

236
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:04,851
How can you justify starting a war
just to profit from the outcome?

237
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,731
We're just controlling the chaos, that's all.

238
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,373
No, you're causing it.

239
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:15,766
Let's not waste each other's time
trying to bridge our differences, OK?

240
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:19,892
There's only one thing
we need to agree on: a price.

241
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:21,929
I already gave you my answer.

242
00:19:22,013 --> 00:19:24,368
When Ronnie's finished,
you'll give me another.

243
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,967
No, my answer's final.

244
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:30,292
Ronnie!

245
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:32,409
I think he wants to talk to you.

246
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,608
I heard. I'll get you your answer.

247
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:39,048
This man Bauer, I've read his file.

248
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:41,647
- So have I.
- You know he won't be easy to break.

249
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,644
He'll break.

250
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,293
- I appreciate your confidence.
- I've earned it.

251
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:49,604
Yes, you have. There's also a time issue.

252
00:19:49,693 --> 00:19:53,083
Then you'd better let me get started, sir.

253
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,724
The chip, Jack.

254
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,763
The chip, Jack.

255
00:20:56,773 --> 00:20:59,003
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

256
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:02,768
- Jack's bringing a chip in.
- That's what Tony said.

257
00:21:02,853 --> 00:21:08,052
He wants me to run point on the analysis. I'm
having trouble accessing the CPB software.

258
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,283
Just send it to my screen. I'll do it.

259
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:14,810
I just need you to...
unlock the indexing function.

260
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:17,327
- I said I would do it.
- I don't need you to do it.

261
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:21,201
- I need you to unlock the indexing function.
- What is your problem?

262
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:24,808
- You've been gunning for me all day.
- I could say the same about you.

263
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:28,568
I'm just trying to do my job.

264
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:30,763
Dessler.

265
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:34,448
- Can I see you up here a second?
- Yeah, sure.

266
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:38,322
- Just do what I asked.
- Fine.

267
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,803
- So what was that about?
- What?

268
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:55,123
You and Carrie,
what were you arguing about?

269
00:21:55,213 --> 00:22:00,333
Nothing. I asked her to open some software
and she's making me jump through hoops.

270
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:02,404
I know you don't wanna tell me,

271
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:07,009
but whatever bad blood there is between
the two of you, I gotta know what it is.

272
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,926
It doesn't matter, especially today.

273
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:15,565
It does matter. It's interfering with your work.
What's the problem?

274
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:24,882
When I worked for Carrie over at Division,
we were friends.

275
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:30,090
I introduced her to my brother.
He was married. He had kids.

276
00:22:30,173 --> 00:22:32,733
He left them for her.

277
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:36,010
And then she got bored. She dumped him.

278
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:42,122
Danny lost everything. His family, his job.

279
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,730
It got so bad, he tried to kill himself.

280
00:22:52,813 --> 00:22:54,929
Look...

281
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:59,450
It's unfortunate you two have to
work together, but you do.

282
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:03,412
And I gotta keep this office
running today, all right?

283
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:06,212
- I understand.
- Good.

284
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:13,329
Almeida.

285
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:17,406
- Can I speak with Michelle?
- Just a second.

286
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:19,484
It's for you.

287
00:23:20,253 --> 00:23:23,290
- Dessler.
- Your brother Danny's here to see you.

288
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:26,843
Show him to my station. I'll be right down.

289
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,448
Are we OK here?

290
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:32,966
Yeah.

291
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,604
Wow. This is nuts.

292
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:53,567
Hey. Hey, little sister.

293
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:56,087
Thanks for bringing him in.

294
00:23:56,573 --> 00:23:58,689
- How are you? You OK?
- I'm fine.

295
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:02,049
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to you.

296
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,328
- We were talking and you hung up.
- I know.

297
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,405
I tried to call you back,
but the phones weren't working.

298
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:10,769
So you came here at 2.30 in the morning.
I don't have time for this.

299
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:14,971
I wanted to apologise to you face to face.

300
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,886
I'm sorry that I yelled at you before. I'm sorry.

301
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:20,248
Apology accepted. But you have to go now.

302
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,563
It's just this whole thing with the bomb.

303
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:26,202
It's not just me. A lot of people
are afraid of what's gonna happen next.

304
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:28,853
Nobody knows what to do, you know?

305
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:33,085
It's gonna be OK.
We're taking care of things here.

306
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,164
I know. I know you are.

307
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:42,050
Why don’t you go home and get some sleep?
I'll come over as soon as I can.

308
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,727
- Ignore her.
- You didn't tell me Carrie works here.

309
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:48,249
She's not working here.
We were short-handed. Danny, please.

310
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,563
You don't return my calls?

311
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,042
- Who are you?
- My sister works here.

312
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:57,490
- I've been in the middle of things right now.
- I was just worried about you.

313
00:24:57,573 --> 00:25:00,212
- I was hoping you'd be worried about me.
- Stop.

314
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:04,411
- Why? You taking Carrie's side now?
- Of course not. Come to my station.

315
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:08,042
- Hey, come here. I wanna talk to you.
- Danny!

316
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,686
Why didn’t you call me back?

317
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:19,810
Tell them I'm your brother, Michelle!

318
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,844
Lynne.

319
00:25:43,253 --> 00:25:45,244
You were right about the meeting.

320
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,405
Prescott's calling Cabinet members
personally to set it up.

321
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:50,927
Is it about the president
calling off the attack?

322
00:25:51,013 --> 00:25:55,404
I don't know yet. My source at Defence says
he has information. He agreed to meet me.

323
00:25:55,493 --> 00:25:57,802
- Who is it?
- Jesper Isberg.

324
00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:01,329
He won't tell me anything over the phone.

325
00:26:01,413 --> 00:26:04,450
- When are you meeting him?
- Now.

326
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:05,602
Where?

327
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:09,129
I don't think you should be there, Lynne.
You might spook him.

328
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:15,812
I brought you into this. I wanna hear what's
going on before we take this to the president.

329
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:19,124
There's a room upstairs, 522.
It's used for storage.

330
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,204
I'll meet you there.

331
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:40,684
I'll be right back.

332
00:26:47,413 --> 00:26:49,404
Michelle?

333
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:53,248
Where are you going?

334
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,528
I was just going over to IT.

335
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,322
I'm still trying to access the CPB software.

336
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:01,404
IT's the other way.

337
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:07,048
I just... I just need a minute, Tony.

338
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,170
Hey.

339
00:27:10,973 --> 00:27:12,964
Carrie's gonna be fine.

340
00:27:15,893 --> 00:27:19,124
Is she gonna...
Is she gonna press charges?

341
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:21,249
No, I don't think so.

342
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:26,682
It's all my fault. I should've seen it coming.

343
00:27:26,773 --> 00:27:31,369
It's family. These things happen.
You can't see it coming.

344
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:36,531
He's my brother. I mean, his kids...

345
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:42,928
Maybe I should have
told him about the bomb.

346
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,322
It was a tough choice, but you made it.

347
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:49,007
And, by the way, you were right.

348
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,730
No.

349
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:54,885
Nothing I've done today is right.

350
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,008
Michelle.

351
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:59,165
All these people today that are dead.

352
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:04,531
And then this recording.
I don't know if we're right about that.

353
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:08,049
I can't... I can't do this any more, Tony. I can't.

354
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:11,125
Michelle. Come here, come here.

355
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:15,570
I'm so tired. I'm so scared.

356
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,972
It's OK.

357
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:21,331
It's OK. It's all right.

358
00:28:38,613 --> 00:28:40,604
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

359
00:28:53,373 --> 00:28:54,965
Tony.

360
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:57,203
Chapelle's looking for you.

361
00:28:57,293 --> 00:28:59,568
Yeah, OK.

362
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:27,284
Jack?

363
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:44,012
Jack.

364
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:45,405
Come on, Jack.

365
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,164
You're gonna kill him.
You can't keep doing this.

366
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,811
Don't ever touch me again.

367
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,731
- Yes?
- Have you made any progress?

368
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:35,089
- We're still working on him.
- I told you, there's a time issue.

369
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:37,050
Yes, sir. You told me.

370
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:41,923
You do not wanna disappoint me on this.
Get me that chip, Stark.

371
00:31:44,213 --> 00:31:45,965
I will.

372
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:08,611
- So where's this person we're meeting?
- He'll be here soon.

373
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:12,606
Have you heard anything else about
why Prescott called this meeting?

374
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:15,002
We knew there’d be consequences, Lynne,

375
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:19,723
dissent within the administration,
but nothing like this.

376
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,371
Like what, Mike?

377
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:25,526
What do you know about Section 4
of the 25th Amendment?

378
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:31,483
It provides that if the majority of his Cabinet
feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties

379
00:32:31,573 --> 00:32:34,371
that the president could be
removed from office.

380
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:38,651
And the vice president
becomes acting president.

381
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,884
Prescott can't do that.

382
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:47,163
Mike, we're talking about a palace coup.

383
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:50,483
- Jesper Isberg?
- Yeah.

384
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:52,643
Give us a moment, please.

385
00:32:56,613 --> 00:33:01,243
Before we talk to him, I need to know where
you stand vis-à-vis the president's decision.

386
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,403
Are you questioning my loyalty?

387
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:09,568
There's going to be a lot of lobbying among
the Cabinet. I need to know where you stand.

388
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:14,204
I may not agree with the president's decision,
but it was his decision to make.

389
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:20,084
As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott
who should be charged with treason.

390
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:22,448
Are you sure that's how you feel?

391
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,524
Yes, Mike.

392
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:28,771
I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne.

393
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:31,804
Mr Isberg.

394
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:40,048
I'm sorry.

395
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:44,285
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Mike?

396
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,284
Oh, my God.

397
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,090
You're with Prescott?

398
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:55,052
Only because David wouldn't listen to reason.

399
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:59,124
- You said so yourself.
- Mike, you can't...

400
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:03,289
We've been worried about
his indecisiveness since he took office.

401
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:06,683
And now it's going to cost
the lives of 20,000 Americans.

402
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:09,367
I can't let that happen.

403
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:12,768
I'm doing this for the good of the country.

404
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:17,244
Lie to yourself all you want.
Don’t you dare lie to me.

405
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:20,889
- I'm sorry.
- Mike, this is not...

406
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:24,363
What are you doing? Mike! Mike!

407
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:28,884
Open this door!

408
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:31,570
Open this door!

409
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:36,090
Until you hear from me -
only me - do not let her out.

410
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:38,164
Understood.

411
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:41,204
Open this door!

412
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:57,650
Open this door!

413
00:34:57,733 --> 00:35:04,047
The White House confirms the explosion.
The president will address the nation shortly.

414
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:09,002
Police have reported a number of hate crimes
against Middle Eastern businesses.

415
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:14,042
Authorities are urging people to stay
inside their homes and off the street.

416
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:21,602
- Jack said to leave without him.
- Let's give him another minute.

417
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:25,732
We've given him much longer
than he asked for already.

418
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:29,647
We have to get this chip to CTU.
They're expecting it.

419
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:31,963
What if Jack needs our help?

420
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:35,045
Getting this to CTU is the priority.

421
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:46,088
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?

422
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:47,811
Yeah.

423
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:50,043
- Hey!
- Hey!

424
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:52,406
He's a damn towel head.

425
00:35:52,493 --> 00:35:57,647
Your people tried killing us with that bomb.
You're not getting a second chance.

426
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:05,410
Get back. Get back, put your hands up,
get down on the pavement.

427
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:08,212
Facedown! Hands where I can see 'em! Now!

428
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,682
- Do what he says.
- Your turn.

429
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:13,764
Get down.

430
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:17,843
Kate, get back in the car.

431
00:36:22,493 --> 00:36:24,802
Yusuf! Behind you!

432
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:27,205
No!

433
00:36:27,973 --> 00:36:30,168
Think twice next time you come here!

434
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:33,962
Stop it! You don't know what you’re doing!

435
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,362
Chapelle.

436
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:50,923
Ryan, it's Tony Almeida.
I was told you were trying to reach me.

437
00:36:51,013 --> 00:36:55,723
Thanks for getting back to me so soon.
Congratulations on the promotion.

438
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,646
I wish it could have been
under better circumstances.

439
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:02,567
- Yeah, Mason was a good man.
- Yeah, he was.

440
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:07,773
- We're pretty busy around here.
- I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

441
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:11,846
- About what?
- I'm on my way over from Division.

442
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:12,809
Why?

443
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:16,772
I thought you could use some help,
with all that' s going on.

444
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:19,208
We're doing pretty well here, Ryan. Thanks.

445
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:22,524
I'm sure you are. I'll see you in 30 minutes.

446
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:41,964
- Dessler.
- Hey.

447
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:44,647
Have you heard anything
about your brother yet?

448
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:49,602
Yeah. They sedated him.
They said they'd call me when he wakes up.

449
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:53,807
- How are you holding up?
- OK.

450
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:56,924
- You?
- I'm OK.

451
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:03,641
Listen...

452
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:07,487
About what happened before.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

453
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:10,087
No, don't. Don't be sorry.

454
00:38:11,613 --> 00:38:13,604
I'm not.

455
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:18,444
Really?

456
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:21,564
Really.

457
00:38:25,493 --> 00:38:28,690
- What about Carrie?
- Don't worry about Carrie.

458
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,843
I know her. She's not gonna let this go.

459
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:35,085
It's none of her business. It's gonna be OK.

460
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:37,164
All right.

461
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,848
Wake him up.

462
00:38:52,973 --> 00:38:57,251
- We should probably give him a minute.
- Wake him up.

463
00:39:05,413 --> 00:39:07,688
You've been on this side before, Jack.

464
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:10,970
You know everybody has a limit
to how much they can take.

465
00:39:11,053 --> 00:39:13,886
Everybody has a breaking point.

466
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,604
Even you.

467
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:22,932
I understand you've got a daughter. Is it Kim?

468
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:35,846
You wouldn't want Kim
to be an orphan, would you?

469
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:46,284
Hit him.

470
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:02,205
Again.

471
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:04,682
He's no good to us dead.

472
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:19,808
Wake him up.

473
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:34,764
Wake him up.

474
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:42,122
- What's the problem?
- He's not responding.

475
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:02,611
- He's dead.
- Cut him down!

476
00:41:06,893 --> 00:41:08,884
Outta the way!

477
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:12,602
Get some epinephrine!

478
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:15,082
Clear his airway.

479
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:18,603
- Where's that epinephrine?
- There isn't any.

480
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,082
Go find some!

481
00:41:43,013 --> 00:41:47,484
