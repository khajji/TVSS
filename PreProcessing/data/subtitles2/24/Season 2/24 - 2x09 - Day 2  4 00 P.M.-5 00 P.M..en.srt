1
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,760
Tell me about Ron Wieland.

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,680
- He's going public with the rumour.
- About the bomb?

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,960
We're holding him at the OC.
When the crisis passes I'll let him go.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,360
You better come out here.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,680
What I find most troubling is that

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,440
our president knows about this threat
and is saying nothing.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,720
- Who was controlling that room?
- Armus.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,000
I want to see him now.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,240
Kim, I'm scared!

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
Where are you taking her?
She can't go back to LA.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
I checked you out.
Your father does work for CTU.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,720
Now you tell me, what did he tell you
was gonna happen today in LA?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,760
It's a nuclear bomb.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,920
What's my father's connection to all this?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,960
He wrote a cheque to Syed Ali for $475,000

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,200
in return for consulting services.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,800
Maybe they were doing business.

18
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,800
Syed Ali's only business
is bankrolling terrorists.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,320
I’m a consultant for the CIA.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Let's go!

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,120
Nina, how big is the bomb?

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,440
What did he tell you?

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,400
- Everything.
- No!

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
We're losing him!

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,080
- Jack...
- Secure her!

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,640
I know where the bomb is.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,880
I was illegally detained inside the
president's retreat for the last six hours.

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,040
That tells you how much he did not
want this information come out.

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,200
No, Karen.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,160
- That does me no good.
- What am I looking for?

31
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,200
Wieland has a source inside of this
administration, and I need to know who.

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,320
- I’m on it.
- Fine.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,520
Then you get back to me with that. OK.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,800
No, I need the information. Good.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,160
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,400
- What does that mean?
- Wieland's been contained for six hours.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,800
After you met with him,
someone let him out.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
And you think it was me?

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,320
Even if I had the resources, which I don't,

40
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,760
why in God's name would I want to see
Wieland cause a panic, especially today?

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
- I don't know.
- David, I had nothing to do with this.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,880
I swear on the lives of our children!

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,520
Mr President...

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,360
Wait here.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,600
You find Armus yet?
I wanna know how Wieland got past him.

46
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Take a look.

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,640
What's this?

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,800
A digital playback from
the surveillance feeds at OC.

49
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,560
That's Armus.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,000
This happened 25 minutes ago.

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
- Armus let him out?
- Yeah.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,440
- Where is he?
- We haven't found him.

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,040
Mr President, if Armus is
working covertly against you...

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,640
It’s not covert now! It’s in my face!

55
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,520
- We will find him, sir.
- We'd better.

56
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,640
Because whomever he's working for
is trying to keep me from finding this bomb!

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
- How long till we go down?
- Any minute.

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,520
The pilots found us a place to crash land.
I've gotta get the coordinates to George.

59
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,760
- George?
- Jack, what's happening?

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,960
We're going down.
The pilots don't know what's going on.

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,920
It felt like some kind of explosion.
We're losing all kinds of power.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,440
They think they can make
a safe crash landing

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,680
on a soft riverbed located in sector J.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,880
The coordinates are 34-30-44 north,

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,880
119-0-niner-0-5 west.

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,080
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, we got it.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,440
Nina, there's a chance we're
not gonna make it through this.

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,520
We need to know the location
of the bomb now!

69
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,920
We've given you everything
you've asked for! Please!

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Can she hear me?

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,400
Hold on, I'll put you on speaker.

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,400
Nina, you got your pardon from the
president. What more do you want?

73
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Even if I survive this, Jack's gonna kill me.

74
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,280
- Phillips is there to protect you.
- He can't protect me from Jack!

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,440
Nina, all I want is the location of the bomb.

76
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
I give you my word,
I will not harm you in any way!

77
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,760
I don't believe you!

78
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,240
- Where is the bomb?
- Rick, holster your weapon!

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,440
- Do one last good thing with your life!
- Phillips, what is going on?

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Phillips, that's an order! Take your seat!

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the captain. We're not
going to make it to the riverbed.

82
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Everyone assume crash position
and get ready for impact.

83
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,360
George, we're going down!
We're not gonna make the riverbed.

84
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,720
The coordinates I gave you,
they're going to be off...

85
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,040
Get the crash-site coordinates from ATC
and send in search and rescue.

86
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,960
ATC, this is CTU.
I need the exact coordinates.

87
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,720
I'll prepare a statement in the next hour.
In the meantime, let's find Armus.

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,280
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Sherry... I owe you an apology.

90
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Why? What did Mike say to you?

91
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,520
Richard Armus was the one
who let Wieland go.

92
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,640
But Armus doesn't have his own agenda.
He must be working for someone else.

93
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
We're looking into it now.

94
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,440
I’m sorry I jumped to the wrong conclusion.

95
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
It's all right.

96
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,720
I don't expect you to change
your attitude towards me overnight.

97
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Apology accepted.

98
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
David...

99
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,960
What are you gonna do?

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Talk to the press.

101
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,880
I’m not sure how, but I may have to
go after Ron's credibility.

102
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
- Ron's credibility?
- Yes.

103
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Make it look like his report was motivated

104
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,800
by personal dislike,
that it's not based in fact.

105
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,640
Yes, but it is based in fact.

106
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,160
- Believe me, I wish there was another way.
- Maybe there is.

107
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,360
Why don't you just tell the truth, David?
It's what you do best.

108
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,480
I mean, you pulled it off with Keith,
with our divorce.

109
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,920
You've earned the public's trust. Just use it.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

111
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm just wondering if you've really changed,

112
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,560
or if you've just gotten better at pretending.

113
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,600
- Sir?
- Yes, what is it?

114
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,600
We just got word from CTU in Los Angeles.

115
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,520
The plane Jack Bauer was returning in
just went down.

116
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
It crashed?

117
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,840
We're still waiting for details.

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Oh, my God!

119
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,200
Rick. Rick!

120
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,480
Rick!

121
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,720
Myers...

122
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,760
I haven't found her.
I don't even know if she made it.

123
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,360
Find her...

124
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm gonna find her. You gotta hang in there.

125
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
Hang in there. Search and rescue
will be here any minute.

126
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,800
Just hang in there. I'll be right back.

127
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,200
Come on, come on.

128
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,400
These images were taken around the time
the pilot reported the explosion.

129
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,720
- They were shot down.
- By some kind of ground-to-air missile.

130
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,360
Compile a list of anybody that might
have had access to their flight plan.

131
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,120
If Nina didn't die in the crash,
whoever it was will want to finish the job.

132
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,440
I have search and rescue scrambling now.

133
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,160
Make sure they're well armed.
Get me their ETA as soon as you have it.

134
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,120
George, Richards told me you had Warner
and Naiyeer transferred to room seven.

135
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,880
- That's right.
- I separated them for a reason.

136
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,560
It's not working, so let's put them together
and play them off each other.

137
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,440
One minute you're trying
to save your own ass,

138
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,120
then you act like you give
a damn about anybody...

139
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,560
- Back off!
- No, I'm not gonna back off.

140
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,800
Not today. Now, what's going on?

141
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,600
Remember the warehouse
in Panorama City?

142
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,080
Weapons-grade plutonium,
airborne in the fire fight.

143
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
- You were exposed?
- Yeah.

144
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,160
Said I'd be lucky
if I made it through tomorrow.

145
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,360
I don't know what to say, George.

146
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,720
Me too.

148
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,680
Does anybody else know about this?

149
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Just Jack. You. Can we keep it that way?

150
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Do you need anything?
Is there something I can do?

151
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,720
Just do you job. Let me do mine.

152
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,800
So you both claim not to know Syed Ali.

153
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,640
- It's not a claim. It's the truth.
- Sit down.

154
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,280
- I'd rather stand.
- Sit down!

155
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,960
Where the hell do you think you are?
Wake up!

156
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,360
A cache of weapons-grade plutonium was
found in a warehouse in Panorama City!

157
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
A nuclear weapon was assembled there
and it's set to be detonated today.

158
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,600
A nuclear bomb?

159
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,080
We also found this in the warehouse.
What do you make of that, guys?

160
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,200
This is a bill of lading from our company.

161
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,680
For a container sent to Syed Ali,

162
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,400
which means at least one of you
is lying right now.

163
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,560
I'll let you two work that out
between yourselves.

164
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Whoever talks first gets immunity.

165
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,360
It's a one-time offer.
It expires in ten minutes.

166
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,600
- They're gonna come for us soon.
- What's taking them so long?

167
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
I don't know, but they'll be here.

168
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,320
- We're leaving soon.
- Where are we going?

169
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,680
- Central booking.
- LAPD? That's downtown.

170
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,760
- I know where it is.
- Aw, man.

171
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,160
What did I tell you? I don't believe this.

172
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,960
Someone from CTU is supposed to pick
us up. Can you call George Mason?

173
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,120
Captain says it's out of their jurisdiction.

174
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,120
Look, you're both suspects
in a capital crime.

175
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,080
- We told you why we can't go back to LA.
- The bomb.

176
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
- Yes.
- I checked it.

177
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,040
There's been no departmental alert
or elevated threat status.

178
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,200
They do not want the entire city
to panic at once.

179
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,920
Do you think we're making this up?
Call CTU. They'll tell you.

180
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm a cop. I have my orders, OK?

181
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,560
I'll sign you two out
before I take you back to the city.

182
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,000
- I don't believe this. We can't go back to LA.
- When my dad finds out, he'll fix things.

183
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,800
We shouldn't be counting on your father.

184
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,200
No offence, but you were right
when you said how messed up he is.

185
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,360
Everything I've said about my father
is because I was angry

186
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,280
and I blamed him for
what happened to my mom.

187
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,960
- Maybe you were right.
- No.

188
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,640
No, listen, it wasn't his fault,
and he did the best he could.

189
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,040
It just all turned out wrong.

190
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,840
No, this is crazy.

191
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,920
How can they keep us here
without letting us see a lawyer?

192
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,120
Huh?

193
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,520
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

194
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Because nothing we say
will make any difference.

195
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,840
They'll make it look like we're involved.

196
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,320
With a nuclear bomb? I've done nothing
wrong! This is crazy! I have nothing to hide!

197
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,440
- What about you, Bob?
- What about me?

198
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,600
- You got anything to hide?
- Of course not. No.

199
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
You made the authorisation to Ali.

200
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,200
- No, I didn't.
- Then who did?

201
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,400
Don't interrogate me.
That's exactly what they want.

202
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,840
Yeah? I'm not asking for them.

203
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,040
lf you didn't make the authorisation...

204
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,280
Naiyeer's levels are even.
Warner's spiking all over.

205
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,880
They also said...
that you work for the CIA.

206
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,400
I let the CIA pass information through
our distribution network a couple of times.

207
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,400
- That's it.
- Why didn't you tell me?

208
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,040
- Because it is none of your concern!
- I think it concerns me now!

209
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,400
I think a nuclear bomb pretty much
concerns everyone! Don't you?

210
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,840
You know what I'm thinking, Bob?

211
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm thinking that all your generosity

212
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,360
and acceptance is just a load of crap.

213
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,400
Reza, you better sit down and shut up

214
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,960
before you say something you will
regret for the rest of your life.

215
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
You lied to me.

216
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
I can track the shipping order!

217
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,480
Bob's code signature will show that
he authorised the transaction order!

218
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,800
- Get off of me.
- No, just stop it.

219
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,200
The database is at the office.
I'll take you there.

220
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,680
Step outside.

221
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,920
- I'm not taking the fall for you, Bob.
- Come on. Take it easy.

222
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,440
All right, all right.

223
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,480
- Hey, where's George?
- With Naiyeer. He broke.

224
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,200
Could you tell him the search and rescue
is about 12 minutes from the crash site?

225
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,920
OK.

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
- Tony.
- Yeah?

227
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,560
- What's going on with George?
- As far as what?

228
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,760
He's sick, isn't he?

229
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,760
He's got some kind of
radiation poisoning, doesn't he?

230
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Where'd you get that?

231
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,920
Hazmat's all over the warehouse he
raided this morning, so it's gotta be hot.

232
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,360
His nose was bleeding, and Shipler told me
he was throwing up in the bathroom.

233
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
And it doesn't take a doctor to figure it out.

234
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,800
Besides, I can read your face
pretty well by now.

235
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,160
Look, he doesn't want
anybody else to know, OK?

236
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,000
- How bad?
- Pretty bad.

237
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,200
Can he run things in his condition.

238
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,120
- Yeah, I think so.
- That's not good enough.

239
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
lf he's compromised mentally
or physically, we can't...

240
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
He can do his job, Michelle.

241
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,280
He wants to do his job like I've never seen.
He's determined to stop this bomb.

242
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,600
So am l, which is why I think
he should step down.

243
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,200
I'll keep an eye on him. And the second he
misses a step, I'll make sure he backs off.

244
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,320
- No, you can't baby-sit him.
- I'm not baby-sitting him, Michelle.

245
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
Now, you gotta trust me on this.

246
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Can I see that information
as soon as you get it?

247
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,680
I made some notes on David's speech.

248
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,720
I thought maybe you might
want to incorporate them.

249
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,760
I haven't even shown that
to the president yet.

250
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,800
- Jenny showed me a draft.
- She shouldn't have.

251
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,680
She's known me for a long time, Lynne.
She knows what I have to offer.

252
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,600
Mrs Palmer, the president believes

253
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,240
that you can be an asset to him
during this time of crisis.

254
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,800
That's why you're here. He did not give you
licence to insinuate yourself into...

255
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,840
Wait, wait, wait.
Put your back down, Lynne.

256
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,640
I am not here to trespass on your territory.
I am here to help.

257
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,600
That's why I'm coming to you first
before I go directly to David.

258
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,640
Mrs Palmer, that sounds like a threat to me.

259
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,480
Unless David's speech is pitch-perfect,
which it is not,

260
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,000
Wieland's allegations might
bring down this presidency.

261
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,320
I don't need you to tell me
how important this is.

262
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,440
Then you owe it to David
to look at my revisions.

263
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
Give me your hand.

264
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Come on.

265
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
We got a survivor here.

266
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,920
This doesn't look like search and rescue.

267
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,520
- Who are they? Are they coming for you?
- I don't know!

268
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,760
Don't even think about it! Keep going!

269
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,760
Go, go!

270
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,000
Keep going! Keep going!

271
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Take cover in the creek bed.

272
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,480
There's too many of them for me to handle.
I need your help. Give me your hands.

273
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,160
I need you to run recon for me
and handle the ammunition.

274
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
You screw with me now, and we both die.
Do you understand?

275
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,080
Jack, we need to get to higher ground
so I can spot for you.

276
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,600
Take the ammunition. Go. Go!

277
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,120
Would you like some water, Kate?
Maybe some tea?

278
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,320
- How do you know my name?
- I know more than that.

279
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I know you are 29 years old, unmarried.

280
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,800
I know you have an economics degree
from Stanford.

281
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
Who are you?

282
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,560
My name is Syed Ali.

283
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,200
You know who I am?

284
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,800
I've heard your name mentioned.

285
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,160
What else have you heard about me?

286
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,280
Nothing.

287
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Kate, what have you found
in your father's files?

288
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,520
You were looking in places you do not
belong. You must have seen some things.

289
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

290
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Really?

291
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,360
Let go of me! Let go of me!

292
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,320
I told you, I don't know what you are
talking about. You got the wrong guy.

293
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,080
Paul? Oh, my God. What are you doing?

294
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,480
He tells us your father works for the CIA.
This is not new information.

295
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,760
Tell us what you saw and who you told.

296
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,640
We didn't tell anyone
because we didn't see anything!

297
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,920
He's telling you the truth!
Please don't do this!

298
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
Listen to me. Nothing can get
in the way of this sacred day.

299
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,680
- Tell us what you saw and who you told.
- We didn't see anything, I swear!

300
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,160
- The files deleted themselves...
- Don't lie to me, Kate!

301
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,120
- I'm not lying!
- She's not lying!

302
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,240
They were self-deleting files!
We don't know anything!

303
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,040
- What are you...
- No! Stop it!

304
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,280
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

305
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Jack, I can spot you from here.

306
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm set. Where are they?

307
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,080
11 o'clock, 90 metres, moving left.

308
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,440
- I'm out!
- Last pack, Jack.

309
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,360
- Where are they?
- Ten o'clock, within 50 metres.

310
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,800
That's it!

311
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,120
- Where are they now?
- Ten o'clock, two o'clock, higher ground.

312
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
It's a CTU chopper!
They're gonna make a sweep! Stay down!

313
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
Stay down!

314
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,120
Drop it, Jack. I said drop it!

315
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,840
I don't wanna shoot you just yet,
but I will if I have to!

316
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,080
Drop the gun! Drop it! It's over!

317
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,000
Stand down! Stand down or he's dead!

318
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,840
Stand down! She's the only one
who can get us to the bomb!

319
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,000
I wanna talk to the president!

320
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,520
Now!

321
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,840
Megan.

322
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,640
Megan!

323
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,360
- Come here.
- Kim!

324
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,200
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

325
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,160
- I'm scared.
- I know.

326
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,880
- It's scary, but you're doing so good.
- Let's go.

327
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,920
Wait. Where are you taking her?

328
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,120
Do you know where you're going, baby?

329
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,800
Aunt Emily. She's my mom's sister.

330
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,280
Do you know where she lives?

331
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,200
- Santa Barbara.
- Santa Barbara?

332
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,560
Santa Barbara. That's so good.

333
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,800
- Why can't you come with me?
- Oh...

334
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,080
Oh, I will soon, OK?

335
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,560
- I don't wanna go.
- I know.

336
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,680
OK, let's go. Your aunt's waiting.

337
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Go on, OK? You can go now.

338
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,440
Go on. Go on. Don't cry.

339
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,400
No, no, shh. I'm gonna see you soon, OK?

340
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,800
Santa Barbara, that's like, what,
50 miles outside of LA?

341
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,880
- It's more like a hundred.
- Oh, God.

342
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,880
She's gonna be OK.

343
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,040
- Mr Mason, Tony.
- Yeah.

344
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,400
Jack's alive. Seven hostiles were killed,
but there's a complication.

345
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,000
- What?
- Nina Myers took Jack hostage.

346
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,520
She's demanding to speak to the president.

347
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,400
Have Richards and Maccabee
take him to Bob Warner's office.

348
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,160
- Let me talk to her.
- She'll be here when you get back.

349
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,400
We were supposed to get married in an hour.
Just let me explain everything to her.

350
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,800
You have one minute.
Watch him. I'm gonna make a call.

351
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,240
- What did they do to you?
- They just asked me questions.

352
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,840
- Everything's fine.
- Are you sure?

353
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,320
Larry is on his way with a criminal lawyer.
He's one of the top guys in the city.

354
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,440
I'm not gonna need a lawyer.
But your father might.

355
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,760
I don't understand.

356
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,120
Reza, what's going on?

357
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,520
It's your father, Marie.

358
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,000
They think that he might have
something to do with Syed Ali.

359
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,320
My father?

360
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,240
- Yeah, he tried to use me.
- Used you how?

361
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,240
To do business with Ali,
who they say is part of this terrorist group.

362
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,640
- My father? Part of a terrorist group?
- They have proof.

363
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,520
They have this transaction
that's connecting one of us to Ali.

364
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,720
And I know I didn't write it.

365
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,680
I'm sorry to put you in
this impossible situation.

366
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,200
I love you, and I wanna be with you.

367
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,360
But right now, something really bad
might happen if I don't help them.

368
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,560
After everything he's done for you,
to turn on my father...

369
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,680
He turned on me. He turned on us.

370
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,520
What else was I supposed to do?

371
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,600
Marie...

372
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,720
- Come on, let's go.
- Marie.

373
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,280
We have a secured line ready.

374
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,400
That's Nina Myers.

375
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,240
Mike, you should talk to her first.

376
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,640
I don't want to give her access to me
until she gives us something in return.

377
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,840
Miss Myers... this is Mike Novick.
I'm the president's Chief of Staff.

378
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,160
- I asked to speak with the president.
- He's not available.

379
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,920
Do you wanna stop this nuclear bomb or not?

380
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,720
- Of course we do.
- Then put the president on.

381
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,640
I'm authorised to negotiate on his behalf.

382
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,360
What I want is nonnegotiable.

383
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,640
What do you want?

384
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,880
I'll tell you where the bomb is
in exchange for immunity.

385
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,560
The president's already
granted you a total pardon.

386
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,640
Except this is a crime I haven't committed yet.

387
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,240
What crime?

388
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,600
The murder of Jack Bauer.

389
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,360
Add that to my pardon,
and I'll tell you where the bomb is.

390
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,920
And if we don't comply?

391
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
We don't have a choice.

392
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,640
- Is that you, Mr Bauer?
- Yes.

393
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,400
Please tell the president that he has
no other choice but to accept her deal.

394
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,360
- Is CTU on a secured line?
- Yes. This is George Mason.

395
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,400
We're on a designated channel.
Except Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.

396
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,400
Do you have alternatives
to what she's asking?

397
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,880
Any weaknesses that we can exploit?

398
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,840
None. She's a survivor, sir.
She knows Bauer.

399
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,280
She knows if she doesn't kill him now,
he'll hunt her down and find her later.

400
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,240
So, in your assessment, Nina Myers
is our best chance to stop this bomb?

401
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,200
Sir, she may be our only chance.

402
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,520
- Ms Myers, this is President Palmer.
- I'm listening.

403
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,760
- Is Jack Bauer there?
- Yes, Mr President. I'm here too.

404
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Ms Myers... if the information you provide

405
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,040
culminates in the successful interception
of the nuclear device,

406
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,240
you will get everything you asked for.

407
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,360
You will be pardoned in advance
for the murder of Jack Bauer.

408
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,080
I can live with that.

409
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,720
Start talking, Nina.

410
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,680
The bomb will be detonated
by a man named Syed Ali.

411
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,320
We know about Ali.
We need to know where he is.

412
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,560
He's at a house in Chatsworth,
on Starling Court.

413
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,960
18 Starling Court.

414
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,360
Contact the local law enforcement
to set up a perimeter.

415
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Coordinate among the relevant agencies.

416
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,960
Ms Myers, you're not to take any action
until we put our hands on this bomb.

417
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Agreed.

418
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,440
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.

419
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,160
Is there anything you want me to do?

420
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,800
Please make sure that
my daughter is safe, sir.

421
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,280
- Tell her that I love her.
- I'll do that.

422
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,720
Thank you, Mr President.

423
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,680
- Jack?
- Mr President...

424
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,960
Please, you don't need to say anything, sir.

425
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,520
There was only one right choice to make,
and you made it.

426
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm sorry, Jack.

427
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,920
He's right, Mr President.

428
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,720
It's the only way we're going to
find this nuclear device...

429
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,320
before it's too late.

430
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Sir...

431
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,200
The press corps is waiting.

432
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,160
- You've made some changes.
- Yes, sir.

433
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,880
- It's better.
- Thank you, sir.

434
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,800
For God's sake, stop it!

435
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,280
What do you want?
I don't know what you want!

436
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,280
Yes, you do.

437
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,160
We didn't see anything.
We didn't tell anyone anything!

438
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,720
I swear! I don't know anything!
How can I tell you what I don't know?

439
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
I believe you.

440
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,400
If she knew anything,
she would have told us. Kill her.

441
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,840
It won't take them long to find Ali.

442
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,320
This isn't how you thought
it would end, is it, Jack?

443
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,560
This isn't over yet.
