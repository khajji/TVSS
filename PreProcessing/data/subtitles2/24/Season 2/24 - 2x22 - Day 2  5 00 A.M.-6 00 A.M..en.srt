1
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:17,245
There are cabinet members
who question whether you're fit

2
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,166
to continue as chief executive of this country.

3
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,608
We are invoking the 25th Amendment.

4
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:28,484
I intend to show your erratic and irrational
behaviour since the start of this crisis.

5
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:30,882
You see the results. The vote is against you.

6
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:34,090
Please remove yourself from
the decision-making process.

7
00:00:34,173 --> 00:00:38,928
I swear that I will faithfully execute the
office of the President of the United States,

8
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,332
so help me God.

9
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:44,850
I got a message that the president
called off the military offensive.

10
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,127
- Is it true?
- Yes.

11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,726
- You knew about it?
- I did.

12
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:51,806
Why keep my people processing
intel on a scrapped operation?

13
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:55,852
There's a strong possibility
the White House will reinstate the attack.

14
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,128
- Dad?
- Sweetheart.

15
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:02,206
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Are you at the sheriffs station?

16
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:06,445
They're taking me to the Mathesons' house
to pack up my things. Glad you're OK.

17
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,761
Me too.

18
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:09,650
- Have you got the audio file?
- No.

19
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:13,328
Are you saying there's
no audio file on that chip?

20
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:15,449
If there were, they were destroyed.

21
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,889
Michelle traced the sequence
to a hacker named Alex Hewitt.

22
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:22,648
- He created the Cyprus audio file?
- Yes.

23
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:28,208
I'm checking up on a man
who engineered the recording.

24
00:01:28,293 --> 00:01:31,808
Are you convinced
that the Cyprus recording is forged?

25
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,726
Yes, sir, without a doubt.

26
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:36,804
Alex?

27
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:51,892
- Hewitt's not here.
- I'm not surprised.

28
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:55,204
Check the garage, see if his car's still here.

29
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:20,842
Even with the delay, we predict
we have not lost the element of surprise.

30
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:25,563
As you can see here, sir, the primary
targets are still relatively unguarded.

31
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,292
Resistance should be insignificant.

32
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:32,002
- When were these pictures taken?
- Ten minutes ago, sir.

33
00:02:32,813 --> 00:02:35,281
Then we can proceed
with the attack as planned.

34
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:37,443
Yes, Mr President.

35
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:50,888
I need your key codes, sir.

36
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,888
How much longer will Prescott detain me?

37
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:02,646
Until after the press conference.

38
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:06,567
In a couple of hours, he's going
to announce the US response to the bomb,

39
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,247
and his ascension to the office.

40
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:16,086
Your key codes belong
to President Prescott now. It's protocol.

41
00:03:50,693 --> 00:03:52,684
Confirmed.

42
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:20,084
Know why Chappelle called this meeting?

43
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:24,166
No, he just told everybody
to save their work and get in here.

44
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,843
This information is confidential.

45
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:32,529
It'll stay inside until it's been made public,
which should be in the next few hours.

46
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:36,731
The cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment
and removed David Palmer from office.

47
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:40,203
- Jim Prescott is now the president.
- Why?

48
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:43,046
That isn't relevant to our charge.

49
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,011
- Yes, it is, Ryan.
- What's your problem, Almeida?

50
00:04:46,093 --> 00:04:49,847
We know Palmer was removed cos
he didn't wanna go on with the bombings.

51
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,401
That makes what Bauer's
doing more relevant.

52
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:56,327
Bauer has cried wolf twice already.
He's come up with nothing.

53
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:59,803
I have an order from District
that disallows any further resources

54
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:01,645
from being expended on him.

55
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,965
Why is everybody so afraid to look at all
the sides of this? What if Bauer's right?

56
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:10,092
What if it was forged and we're about
to bomb three innocent countries?

57
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:14,451
Tony, let me first say that your office
has done a remarkable job today.

58
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,287
There is no way the people on the Hill
are not going to reward every one of you

59
00:05:18,373 --> 00:05:20,603
for your role in averting disaster.

60
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,288
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Let me finish.

61
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:28,730
The success of this office today
is due in large part to the technical team.

62
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:32,123
The same team that has concluded
that the Cyprus audio

63
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:35,364
is an untreated, unforged original.

64
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:41,050
There comes a time when you have
to let go. Not every hunch works out.

65
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:46,412
Bauer's chasing a ghost.
I can't put it any simpler than that.

66
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,211
That's all.

67
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:55,808
- What are you gonna do?
- I have to talk to one of Prescott's staff.

68
00:05:55,893 --> 00:06:00,125
If Jack comes in with the evidence,
we need somebody in place to take it to.

69
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:03,011
If Chappelle finds out
you're doing an end run...

70
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:05,653
I know. I know.

71
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,482
- The car is gone.
- OK.

72
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:19,249
- What do you wanna do?
- Kingsley took anything important.

73
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:23,531
- We gotta find Hewitt. Let's go.
- Stop right there!

74
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:27,042
- Sit down!
- Let go of me!

75
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,125
Don't move. Don't move!

76
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:34,126
Who are you? Don't look at her,
look at me! Who are you?

77
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:37,046
- I'm nobody.
- He's my private bodyguard.

78
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:40,409
- Secret Service?
- Ex.

79
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:47,612
- Mrs Palmer.
- Jack Bauer.

80
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:50,404
- Stand up.
- Why?

81
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,563
- Stand up!
- What are you gonna do to me?

82
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,962
Turn around.

83
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:57,726
I'm not carrying any weapons.

84
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:01,449
Take a seat.

85
00:07:15,093 --> 00:07:17,402
- Why are you here?
- Trying to help David.

86
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:21,486
- You're no longer part of his life.
- Don't believe everything you read.

87
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:28,092
David's asked me to pool my resources to
see if I can find out who's behind the bomb.

88
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:32,007
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care what you believe.

89
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:42,848
Do you know who did this?
Who ransacked this place?

90
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:47,324
- You're here for the same reason I am.
- What reason would that be?

91
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:50,405
- To find Alex Hewitt.
- Why?

92
00:07:50,493 --> 00:07:54,088
- You must know. You're here.
- Why don’t you tell me?

93
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:58,451
He created a recording
that's about to start a war.

94
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:09,926
How do you know about that?

95
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:12,686
I don't like the way
this conversation is going.

96
00:08:12,773 --> 00:08:16,607
- How do you know about Cyprus audio?
- How dare you talk down to me!

97
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:19,526
I am not a politician.
I will not debate this with you.

98
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:22,685
Answer me. What do you know
about the Cyprus recording?

99
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:26,288
Every expert in the government
with priority clearance

100
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:29,763
has been working on it for six hours.
I've got a lot of sources.

101
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:35,132
- What do you know about Alex Hewitt?
- That he's a freelance audio technician.

102
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,886
- Who does he work for?
- A man named Peter Kingsley.

103
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:39,326
Why?

104
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:42,849
Kingsley represents Caspian Sea
oils interests that want the US

105
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:47,723
at war with the Middle East. Kingsley hired
Hewitt to fabricate the Cyprus recording.

106
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:51,249
Mr Bauer, I've walked the corridors
of power my entire life.

107
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:55,804
You'd be surprised how much information
you can get if you have something to trade.

108
00:08:55,893 --> 00:08:59,522
- What are you doing?
- Take a seat.

109
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,328
Take a seat!

110
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:20,891
Come out!

111
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:26,006
Open the door slowly,
I wanna see both your hands! Now! Now!

112
00:09:26,093 --> 00:09:28,084
Please don't hurt me!

113
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,164
- Get on the ground!
- OK. OK.

114
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:34,166
Don't move. Get on the ground!
Who are you?

115
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:35,242
- Mrs Palmer?
- Alex.

116
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,847
You said you would help me.
Why does he have a gun?

117
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:40,970
- Shut up. Go sit with her.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

118
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:42,486
- Move!
- You said you'd...

119
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:45,371
Shut up. Don't say anything.
He's a federal agent.

120
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,205
- Shut up.
- I am not talking to you!

121
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,488
- Shut up!
- Don't say anything, Alex.

122
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:52,087
Alex, don't say anything!

123
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:55,124
You're gonna talk to me now.

124
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:13,648
You took voice samples from three leaders
and intercut them with Ali's for the audio?

125
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,042
- I didn't say that.
- And Kingsley paid you.

126
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,363
- No!
- You're a traitor.

127
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:22,241
- You know what they'll do to you?
- I'm not. I didn't know, I swear.

128
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,244
I told Mrs Palmer. She'll tell you.

129
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,483
Forget about her. She can't help you.

130
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:30,566
But if you tell me everything about
the Cyprus audio, I'll do what I can.

131
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:34,362
- I won't say anything until I see a lawyer.
- I am your lawyer, son.

132
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:39,402
Those people you worked for thought
you'd die in the bomb. They're after you.

133
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:43,042
If you wanna stay alive,
start telling me everything.

134
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,124
No, I only wanna talk to Mrs Palmer.

135
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:53,692
Why her? How's she connected to this?
How do you know her?

136
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:56,845
I just met her today.
She called, said she could help me.

137
00:10:56,933 --> 00:11:01,529
I know she's the president's ex-wife.
She's got connections high up.

138
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:07,085
She can't help you now, Alex.
I'm the only one who can help you now.

139
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,283
I wanna to talk to her.

140
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:20,091
OK. Let me see what I can do.
Give me your keys.

141
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:22,641
- Why?
- Give me your keys.

142
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,849
- Which one of these locks this door?
- This one.

143
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,808
Just step back.

144
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:46,924
- What did he say?
- Why are you here?

145
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:50,050
Please don't tell me it's to help the president.

146
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:53,967
All right. I came here to protect myself.

147
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:58,049
Alex was paid by Kingsley
to record certain conversations.

148
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:01,205
Some of those were with me,
they incriminate me.

149
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:03,682
You're collaborating with Peter Kingsley?

150
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:07,163
He assured me that the bomb
would never go off.

151
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:10,768
What were you thinking?
What the hell were you thinking?

152
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:13,048
- Who are you calling?
- CTU.

153
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,443
I'm a sworn federal agent.
You just confessed to a federal crime.

154
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:20,651
- I suggest you hang up that phone.
- I need to speak to Tony Almeida.

155
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,327
I am the only one
who can get Hewitt to cooperate.

156
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:27,088
And for that, I'll want
full immunity from prosecution.

157
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:31,363
Now hang up the phone
and I'll tell you everything.

158
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:37,281
- Jack, it's Tony, what's going on?
- I'm gonna have to get back to you.

159
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,086
Start.

160
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:50,845
- Start!
- I wanted to bring down David's presidency.

161
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:54,005
I was so angry with David
for what he did to me.

162
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:59,121
I worked tirelessly for years to put him
into office. I sacrificed everything.

163
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:03,286
My career, my family. David betrayed me.

164
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:06,683
So you wanted revenge.
What did Kingsley want?

165
00:13:08,653 --> 00:13:12,248
Money. A war in the Middle East
would triple the value of his oil.

166
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,211
You're here to ensure
no one connects you to Kingsley.

167
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:18,763
Yes, like I told you, I came to protect myself.

168
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:22,971
Look, Mr Bauer, there's only one person
you need to prosecute for this.

169
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,329
And that person is sitting in that room there.

170
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:29,485
I want full immunity.

171
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:34,126
Otherwise, it's just your word against mine.

172
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,648
She'll talk with you.

173
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:04,566
- I know you're scared.
- You said I would be OK.

174
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:08,123
I know there’s been a little wrinkle,
but we can fix that.

175
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:13,921
What do you think, Aaron? You think
I'm unfit to fulfil my duties as president?

176
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,890
Sir, I'm under orders
not to discuss this with you.

177
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,964
Are you under orders not to listen?

178
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:24,924
- No, sir.
- Good.

179
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,929
Then I'll do all the talking.
I assume you remember Jack Bauer.

180
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:32,844
He believes the Cyprus recording,

181
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:36,289
the single piece of evidence
propelling us into this war,

182
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:38,443
was fabricated.

183
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:42,845
I've been removed from office
because I believe in Bauer.

184
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:47,563
If it wasn't for Jack, Los Angeles
would be a killing field by now.

185
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:52,966
Still, Prescott and the cabinet
refuse to believe that he might be right.

186
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:58,924
If Jack finds the evidence after the planes
have dropped their payloads,

187
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:01,083
then it'll be too late.

188
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,165
We will be at war against
three innocent countries.

189
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:10,648
I'm sure if Jack Bauer finds evidence,
Vice President Prescott...

190
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:15,249
I mean, the president, will recall the bombers.

191
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:22,888
- You're under orders not to speak to me.
- I'm doing my best, sir.

192
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:26,363
- Your best would be to help me.
- By doing what?

193
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,685
I need to talk to Jack Bauer.
Find out if he's secured the evidence.

194
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:47,167
If I remember correctly,
you have a son in the Navy.

195
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,608
Yes, sir, I do.

196
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:56,292
It's a fine thing to defend one's country.
You should be proud.

197
00:15:57,013 --> 00:16:00,323
Let's make sure the cause
he's fighting for is the just one.

198
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:06,726
Get me a sat phone. I need a secure line.

199
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:14,852
Put these in the overnight database.
Chappelle's gonna need 'em for his briefing.

200
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,084
Why are you giving this to me?
This is your situation report.

201
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:20,687
I'm on something else.

202
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,764
What else?

203
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:27,009
I don't have to explain myself
to you, Carrie. Just do it.

204
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,448
You do need to explain yourself

205
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:34,732
cos I think you're going behind
Chappelle's back, trying to help Jack Bauer.

206
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:40,370
Do you really wanna do this, Carrie?
Come after me?

207
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:46,050
I've been letting you get away with a lot,
but if you want the gloves to come off, fine.

208
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,091
What's going on here?

209
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:56,008
She's asking me to take on some of
her workload. I just wanna know why.

210
00:16:56,093 --> 00:16:58,084
Why don’t you wanna tell her?

211
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,363
It's none of her business, Tony.

212
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:08,241
Look, just tell her, so we can
get back to work here.

213
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,364
All right.

214
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:16,366
District's asked me to step in as a liaison
to facilitate the power shift.

215
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,763
I'll be on the phone for the next two hours.

216
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:22,925
Sounds like a promotion. Congratulations.

217
00:17:28,053 --> 00:17:31,523
- You think she believed me?
- No.

218
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:42,450
Go over it again.
Look, I need you to find it fast,

219
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:47,163
even if you need to pull agents who can
help you. This needs to take first priority.

220
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:50,051
Division's breathing down
my neck for some reason.

221
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:53,091
- That's something I don't need.
- I'll take care of it.

222
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,765
All right.

223
00:17:54,853 --> 00:17:56,889
- Mr Chappelle.
- Yes, Carrie?

224
00:17:57,533 --> 00:18:00,286
In my opinion, Tony Almeida's
not fit to run CTU.

225
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,643
- Why not?
- He's got Michelle working off book.

226
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,803
- Doing what?
- I can't say for sure.

227
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:11,364
But I have a feeling the two of them
are still trying to help Bauer.

228
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,364
Thank you.

229
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:30,370
It'll be fine.

230
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:36,285
Here you go, thanks.

231
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,170
- Almeida.
- Tony, it's Jack.

232
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:41,882
- What's happening?
- President still holding off on the attack?

233
00:18:41,973 --> 00:18:45,488
Things have gotten worse.
It's not public, but Palmer's been pulled.

234
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:48,770
- What do you mean?
- His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment

235
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:52,163
because he wanted to wait
for confirmation of the recording.

236
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:54,244
Prescott's now president.

237
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:59,168
I'll bring evidence proving the recording's
been forged. Prescott won't listen to it?

238
00:18:59,253 --> 00:19:03,804
He won't wait for it. Get me that evidence
quickly, and I'll call Prescott with it.

239
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,691
Start by sending a chopper
to the address you gave me.

240
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:09,412
- I got Hewitt.
- He definitely made the recording?

241
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:12,326
- Yes, absolutely.
- Will he testify?

242
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:15,371
We're working on it.

243
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:18,684
If I go to Chappelle and request
a chopper for you, he'll deny it.

244
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:21,810
- He's got orders from District.
- Deal with it, Tony.

245
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:25,522
We got bombers in the air.
Hewitt's our only chance of stopping this.

246
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:26,602
I'll do my best.

247
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:28,411
OK, thanks, Tony.

248
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:31,166
I know, Alex. I understand your concern.

249
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,007
But the fact remains, we both made a mistake.

250
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,926
But we're lucky because they need us.

251
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:43,645
Any deal I make will include you, and vice
versa. Remember, we're in this together.

252
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,724
Are you sure about this?

253
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:50,170
Honey, I would never lie to you.
But you have to remember this one thing.

254
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:54,485
I am the only one looking after
your interest. No one else.

255
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:58,964
I know how these things work.
Just do as I say, and it'll all turn out well.

256
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:00,566
What about him?

257
00:20:00,653 --> 00:20:04,566
Don't worry about him. I'll handle
Agent Bauer. He won't be a problem.

258
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:06,644
He's very low on the food chain.

259
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:11,923
So, if I do this, you can keep me out of jail?

260
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:16,245
Absolutely. You'll be granted
full immunity just like I promised.

261
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,324
OK?

262
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:30,370
All right, Jack, this is how it's gonna work.
He'll come in and testify.

263
00:20:30,453 --> 00:20:34,332
He can demonstrate the technology
in a matter of minutes.

264
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:40,572
Good. The chopper's on its way.

265
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:51,452
You heard Chappelle. He won't let us
have a chopper if he knows it's for Jack.

266
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,730
But Jack's got Hewitt,
who definitely made that recording.

267
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:58,886
- Chappelle can't ignore that.
- He can do whatever he wants.

268
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:02,363
Yeah. Mm-hm. OK.

269
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:05,762
Let me get back to you, Marc.

270
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:08,208
- What?
- Jack Bauer just contacted us.

271
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:09,487
Really? Where is he?

272
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:11,484
- North Hollywood.
- What's he doing?

273
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:14,690
He wants to bring in the guy
who forged the Cyprus recording.

274
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,922
Fine, let him.

275
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,573
He's too far away. We need to send a chopper.

276
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,451
We've been through this, Tony.
I'm done with Bauer.

277
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:25,082
He's chasing a trail that leads nowhere.
We're onto other things.

278
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:31,408
More important than the US launching
military strikes based on false information?

279
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:34,326
The thing is, Tony, you've been reassigned.

280
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:39,161
Reassigned? Where?

281
00:21:39,253 --> 00:21:42,529
I'll let you know in a few days.
For now, you can go home.

282
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:44,649
Ryan, you can't reassign me now.

283
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:50,365
This recording is real. We are going to war.
We need to prepare for domestic response.

284
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:54,048
You have made yourself a liability
I just can't afford.

285
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:57,808
You've got 15 minutes
to clean out your desk and get out.

286
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,607
What are you doing?

287
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:38,813
They took the disk that had my comb filter.
I'll need to rebuild that file to demonstrate.

288
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:46,532
OK, the tarball has to decompress.
It'll take about 20 minutes.

289
00:22:46,613 --> 00:22:48,922
- How's it gonna work?
- I'll make a recording.

290
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:52,085
Right on the spot, shift it around,
reframe segments.

291
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:55,483
It'll have the same specs as Cyprus.
It'll blow their minds.

292
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:59,607
- Good.
- And then I'm free to go, right?

293
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:02,002
That's what she said.

294
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,968
Yes, you'll be fine, Alex.

295
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,488
How come you're being
so nice all of a sudden?

296
00:23:10,573 --> 00:23:13,087
- What do you mean?
- Before, it was all my fault,

297
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:17,086
you called me a traitor,
and now everything's "Fine, Alex"?

298
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:24,321
- You're gonna screw me.
- We won't screw you.

299
00:23:24,413 --> 00:23:26,927
You two made a deal,
you're gonna hang me out.

300
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:31,291
Alex, calm down. We can't hang you out.
You have the proof.

301
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:34,445
- Without you, there is no deal.
- Then I want it in writing.

302
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,603
- Why can't I have an attorney?
- No time.

303
00:23:36,693 --> 00:23:39,048
There are bombers in the air to start a war.

304
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,806
- You'll have to trust me.
- Why should I trust you?

305
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:45,283
Why don’t you have federal counsel
meet us wherever we're going?

306
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:47,125
- Excuse me?
- One phone call.

307
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:52,367
- That's right. We want federal counsel.
- No. I'm not trading with you, Alex.

308
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:57,083
You're gonna do your demonstration,
then I help you. That's the deal. That's it.

309
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,772
- I wanna talk to you in private.
- What are you doing?

310
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:06,526
- I handled everything.
- What are you afraid of?

311
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:09,810
I'm the one who can make this happen.
I wanna talk to him alone.

312
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:13,647
OK, all right, whatever you want.
I'll be over here.

313
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:26,282
- What's going on?
- Is she trying to screw me?

314
00:24:28,853 --> 00:24:33,404
- No. She's trying to help you.
- Why? I mean, she doesn't even know me.

315
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:37,483
Maybe because she thinks
you got tricked into doing something

316
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:39,325
you didn't fully understand.

317
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:43,486
She wants to use her influence
with the president to try and help you.

318
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:46,804
- Because she thinks I'm innocent?
- Yeah, maybe.

319
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:50,453
And I think she likes me.

320
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,893
I think she does.

321
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:25,603
- Do you need any help?
- No, it should only be one suitcase.

322
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:32,447
- Take your time. I'll be waiting in the car.
- Thanks.

323
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:08,770
He just reassigned you?
He didn't give any explanation?

324
00:26:08,853 --> 00:26:13,324
Chappelle doesn't want me in the job. He's
got his own people, and I'm not one of them.

325
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:17,008
What are you going to do?

326
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:20,202
Tony, it's Satcom.

327
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,208
- Almeida.
- This is David Palmer.

328
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,761
Mr President, what can I do for you, sir?

329
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:30,367
I need to speak to Bauer.
Can you reach him?

330
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:33,763
- Can you hold on, sir?
- For a moment.

331
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:44,444
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Tony.

332
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:48,082
- I have President Palmer on the line.
- OK, good. Patch him through.

333
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,731
How we doing on the chopper?

334
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:51,644
- Working on it.
- Work faster.

335
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:56,409
Here's the President. Mr President,
I have Jack on the line. Jack, go ahead.

336
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:58,051
Yes, Mr President.

337
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:00,886
I don't know if you've heard,
but I've been unseated.

338
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:02,201
Yes, I have. I'm sorry.

339
00:27:02,293 --> 00:27:04,602
Where are you on your investigation?

340
00:27:04,693 --> 00:27:07,491
I can tell you the Cyprus audio
has been forged.

341
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:10,645
I have the man who engineered it.
I'm bringing him in soon.

342
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:13,930
We'll patch him through to the
White House, so he can testify.

343
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:17,562
Meanwhile, CTU is trying to process
everything they can on him.

344
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:21,089
Mr President, there is something else though.

345
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,970
What?

346
00:27:23,053 --> 00:27:26,125
Your ex-wife, sir. Sherry, she's here with me.

347
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,522
How did that happen?

348
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:33,170
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.

349
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:36,249
- You can't talk?
- No, sir.

350
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:40,082
Don't trust her, Jack. Do you understand?

351
00:27:40,173 --> 00:27:42,641
Yes, Mr President.

352
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:45,566
- Let me talk to her.
- He wants to talk with you.

353
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,050
- David?
- What are you trying to do?

354
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:57,011
- I'm just trying to help you.
- How can you help me?

355
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,368
You shouldn't have lied to me.

356
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:03,128
That's the problem, David.
It's not always about the truth.

357
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:04,965
And what's that supposed to mean?

358
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:10,047
The truth is, the Cyprus recording was forged.
You are right and they are wrong.

359
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:13,330
The truth is, you're trying
to prevent an unnecessary war,

360
00:28:13,413 --> 00:28:16,849
and Jack Bauer and I are
the only ones who can help you.

361
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:21,890
- Stay out of his way, Sherry.
- All right. All right, David.

362
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:24,123
Let me talk to Jack.

363
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,168
- Yes, Mr President?
- I need this man to come forward now.

364
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,609
- I understand, sir.
- All right. Thank you.

365
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,564
- Tony, you still there?
- I'm here.

366
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:41,008
- How much time have we got?
- Six minutes.

367
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:43,084
- Tony, can you hear me?
- Go ahead.

368
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:45,971
- We need that chopper now.
- You'll have it.

369
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:47,452
Thank you.

370
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:56,409
I'm gonna need your help.

371
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,527
I'm still here at the Matheson house.

372
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:24,807
- Where is it, sir?
- Where is what?

373
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:29,603
Please, David, don't make me do this.

374
00:29:30,453 --> 00:29:32,523
Give me the phone.

375
00:29:50,773 --> 00:29:54,686
- Place Pierce under arrest.
- Mike, don't.

376
00:29:54,773 --> 00:30:00,006
- I coerced him into getting it for me.
- You didn't coerce anyone.

377
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:03,927
Shame on you,
for placing us both in this position.

378
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:07,642
It should be you putting yourself
on the line. Instead, Aaron did.

379
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:12,170
- I tried to be a friend to you, sir.
- I don't want a friend!

380
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:15,165
I need someone to do the right thing.

381
00:30:18,653 --> 00:30:21,565
I'm sorry, Aaron.

382
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:25,123
There's nothing to be sorry for, Mr President.

383
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:43,889
Officer, is that you?

384
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,524
Hello?

385
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:11,251
- Dessler.
- You ready?

386
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:14,723
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

387
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,372
- Yeah.
- Rudin needs you. He's in Holding Room 2.

388
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:29,366
- Tell him to call me.
- The comm's out in that room.

389
00:32:29,453 --> 00:32:32,251
All right, I'm on my way.

390
00:32:57,493 --> 00:32:59,484
Where's Rudin?

391
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:12,523
I got this.
Go send that chopper to pick up Jack.

392
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:35,727
- When are your people getting here?
- Soon.

393
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:43,366
It's not just out of my own selfish desire
that I'm trying to stay clean on all this.

394
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:44,602
Really?

395
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:49,369
It wouldn't be good for David's presidency
if his ex-wife was implicated in this bomb.

396
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:52,172
So, now you care about his presidency?

397
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:58,329
In light of what's happened today,
my resentments seem obscenely petty.

398
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:03,968
I don't know what I was thinking.

399
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:07,363
There's something I haven't
told you yet about Mr Palmer.

400
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:10,323
- Mr Palmer?
- Yes, Mr Palmer.

401
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,850
His cabinet invoked the 25th Amendment
less than an hour ago.

402
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,401
- What?
- Prescott's president now.

403
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:20,212
Oh, my God.

404
00:34:21,013 --> 00:34:23,208
You got what you wanted. Yeah.

405
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:26,603
It's Tony. The chopper's about
to leave. ETA's about 20 minutes.

406
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:29,730
- So, Chappelle's on board with us?
- Not exactly.

407
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:32,373
- What do you mean?
- It's better if you don't know.

408
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:35,206
You'll have to get
the Attorney General involved.

409
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:37,887
- What for?
- Mrs Palmer wants to cut a deal.

410
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:40,441
- A deal?
- Hewitt's testimony incriminates her.

411
00:34:40,533 --> 00:34:43,650
- I'll make sure it's in place.
- It has to go like clockwork.

412
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,691
- There's no margin for error.
- I know.

413
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,642
What did you mean, "I want to cut a deal"?

414
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:56,328
I explained to you that Alex won't say
anything without my permission.

415
00:34:56,413 --> 00:35:00,486
All I care about now is that
he convinces Prescott and the Joint Chiefs

416
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:02,404
that he forged the Cyprus audio.

417
00:35:02,493 --> 00:35:06,691
- After that, you're free to try and cut a deal.
- That is not what we discussed.

418
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,685
- I'm sorry, that's the way it is.
- We'll see about that.

419
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:13,163
Mrs Palmer, the conversations end here.

420
00:35:13,253 --> 00:35:16,802
You don't talk to him again,
do you understand me?

421
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:19,803
Don't try me, Mrs Palmer.

422
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:24,412
Take a seat on the couch.

423
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:19,884
Kim?

424
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:26,121
You know this is all your fault, don't ya?

425
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:34,089
Carla would probably still be alive
if it wasn't for you. Probably.

426
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:44,291
You think I wanted to hurt her? I didn't.

427
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:47,604
I loved her.

428
00:37:38,813 --> 00:37:42,169
- CTU. Dessler.
- This is Kim. I need to speak to my father.

429
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:46,166
- Kim, your Dad's not here right now.
- Please find him. It's an emergency.

430
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:48,323
All right, hold on.

431
00:37:57,773 --> 00:38:00,731
- Yeah.
- It's Michelle. Your daughter's on the line.

432
00:38:00,813 --> 00:38:02,963
OK, fine. Put her through.

433
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,330
- OK, Kim, go ahead.
- Dad.

434
00:38:06,413 --> 00:38:09,803
- Sweetheart, what's wrong?
- I'm at the Mathesons' house.

435
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:12,771
Gary was here. He has a gun.

436
00:38:12,853 --> 00:38:16,368
- He killed the officer that brought me here.
- Where is he now?

437
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:18,887
He's passed out. I knocked him out.

438
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:21,567
- OK, get out of the house.
- What if I killed him?

439
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:24,213
It doesn't matter.
Just get out of the house now.

440
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:26,568
OK.

441
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:28,803
Oh, God! No!

442
00:38:28,893 --> 00:38:31,009
- Kim, what's going on?
- He's moving.

443
00:38:31,093 --> 00:38:33,891
- Grab his gun.
- I've got it.

444
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:40,331
- Shoot him.
- What?

445
00:38:40,413 --> 00:38:42,404
- Shoot him.
- I can't.

446
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:45,803
I want you to point the gun at his chest
and pull the trigger.

447
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:48,532
No, I can't.

448
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:51,605
Kim, shoot him now!

449
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:56,130
Kim. You little bitch.

450
00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:01,565
Kim! Kim!

451
00:39:02,413 --> 00:39:04,404
- Kim, can you hear me?
- Dad!

452
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:08,370
- Did you do it?
- Yeah.

453
00:39:11,093 --> 00:39:14,290
Again. I want you to shoot him again.

454
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:21,482
Shoot him again now, Kim.

455
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:24,963
Shoot him again now!

456
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,407
- Dad?
- Is he dead?

457
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:57,132
- Yeah.
- OK, sweetheart, listen to me.

458
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:01,891
I'll send someone to pick you up now.
Go downstairs and wait. Can you do that?

459
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:05,249
- Yeah.
- OK, baby, hurry.

460
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:15,362
- Where you going?
- I don't trust you any more.

461
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:19,162
Everyone is looking to hunt you down:
Kingsley, the government.

462
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,086
We can help you. Without us,
you don't stand a chance.

463
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:29,162
- Hello?
- Kate, it's Jack Bauer.

464
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:31,892
- Is everything all right?
- No. I need your help.

465
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,692
My daughter was in a shooting,
I think she's in shock.

466
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:37,526
Take the police officer
that I left behind with you,

467
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:39,968
and go and pick her up
and take her over to CTU.

468
00:40:40,053 --> 00:40:44,205
- I'm sorry, Jack, I sent the officer home.
- Son of a bitch.

469
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:48,286
- I don't know what else to do.
- I could do it. Go pick up Kim.

470
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:49,772
- Can you?
- Yeah.

471
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:53,766
Please call the police and tell them
to meet you at 12, Bluetree Drive.

472
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:55,844
OK, do you know where it is?

473
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:57,924
- Yeah.
- OK. I'll call CTU now.

474
00:40:58,013 --> 00:41:00,846
- OK, I'll leave right away.
- Please, Kate, hurry.

475
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:04,765
- Get out of my way.
- No.

476
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:08,163
Alex, get back to work!
Sherry, stay away from him!

477
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,611
I need to speak to Tony Almeida
and Michelle Dessler.

478
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:15,129
- Is it an emergency?
- Yes, it's an emergency.

479
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:17,249
Alex, you...

480
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:26,731
Alex!

481
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,327
Help me.

482
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:34,122
Alex!

483
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:12,606
