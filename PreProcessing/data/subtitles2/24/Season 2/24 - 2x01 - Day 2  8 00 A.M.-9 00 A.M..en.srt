1
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,089
When?

2
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:51,447
Today.

3
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:58,082
Get me Eric Rayburn, NSA.

4
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:09,246
I wish Nicole could have come.
She loves it out here.

5
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,324
Yeah.

6
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,888
What do you wanna do tonight?

7
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:17,441
I don't know. Get a movie?

8
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,525
You came all this way to watch a video?

9
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:30,443
How's your mom?

10
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,171
Who knows?

11
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:37,850
She puts on a happy face for everyone,
but I know she's hurtin'.

12
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:40,731
Yeah.

13
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,601
OK. Copy that.

14
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:48,732
- What is it, Rosser?
- There's a situation, Mr President.

15
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:01,402
OK, try and find me!

16
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:03,848
Excuse me. What are you doing in my bed?

17
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,924
Sh. I'm hiding from Daddy.

18
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:07,332
What?

19
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,847
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Kim.

20
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:14,402
You haven't seen Megan around, have you?

21
00:03:14,493 --> 00:03:17,530
- What does she look like?
- Big wart on the tip of her nose.

22
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,922
- I do not!
- There you are.

23
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,322
Now I'm gonna get you.

24
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,842
- Let me go!
- I'm gonna get you now.

25
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:29,652
I'm going to hide again.

26
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:38,609
How do you keep up with her all day?

27
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,251
It's not easy.

28
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,209
Dad, I'm hiding! Try to find me!

29
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:56,284
Here I come!

30
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:10,201
Rayburn is waiting for us.

31
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,568
I'll see you back at the retreat.

32
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,247
Look, son...

33
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,052
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

34
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,931
- I just miss hanging out with you.
- I know.

35
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:23,208
We'll get there.

36
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:25,329
- See you later.
- All right.

37
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:27,927
I know you wanna spend time with him.
I'm sorry, sir.

38
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:31,642
- How bad is the situation?
- I don't know, but I don't have a good feeling.

39
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:35,851
To my knowledge, no president's
been rerouted by NSA on a morning off.

40
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,924
Thank you.

41
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:50,086
I didn't know how you liked
intel presented at impromptus,

42
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:53,131
if you like it chronologically
with an alphabetical key,

43
00:04:53,213 --> 00:04:56,808
or if you just like
separate folders with access tabs.

44
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:02,005
- I don't really care.
- I did it both ways, so you can choose.

45
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:04,765
Thanks, Paula. George.

46
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,048
- Hi, Mr Mason.
- Yeah?

47
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,523
I ordered upgrades on all the SIM software.
I hope you don't mind.

48
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:14,252
They just went to production
and I thought you’d...

49
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,403
Paula, stop.

50
00:05:16,493 --> 00:05:18,370
Right. OK. Thanks.

51
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:20,612
What do you need?

52
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,083
- Division want a meeting next month.
- For what?

53
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:28,405
They wanna see our proposal
for the LAX security upgrades.

54
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:32,884
Tony, if I'm still here this time next year,
take me out to the woodshed and shoot me.

55
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:37,524
I should be in DC, not chasing old ladies who
set off metal detectors with knitting needles.

56
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,126
The morning of the 15th?

57
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:40,203
That's fine.

58
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:42,853
- Mr Mason.
- What?

59
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:46,164
I just got off the phone
with Eric Rayburn's office at NSA.

60
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:50,451
They've a request, sir.
They want you to take care of it right away.

61
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,846
This can't be right. Eileen, get me Rayburn.

62
00:05:55,933 --> 00:06:00,404
I think he's up in Oregon with the president.
Put it in my office.

63
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,564
What was that about?

64
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:10,486
NSA wants us to bring in Jack Bauer.

65
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,848
What? What for?

66
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:16,926
I don't know. That's all they said.
Isn't Bauer inactive?

67
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,924
Yeah, he's inactive.

68
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,847
We'll have to reschedule our day.
What do we have?

69
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:29,164
National Wildlife benefit at one,
a tour of the new Nike Campus,

70
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:31,403
and your speech tonight.

71
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,688
OK. Cancel what you have to,

72
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:37,322
but I wanna give that speech,
announce the new clean-energy proposal.

73
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:40,962
- I'm not sure you'll have time for any of that.
- Eric.

74
00:07:42,613 --> 00:07:44,569
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Jenny.

75
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:49,204
- What's this about, Eric?
- We have a domestic terrorist alert.

76
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:51,761
- How serious?
- Very.

77
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:56,051
- Has Lynne been informed?
- She's here.

78
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,486
Who else?

79
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:02,647
Representatives from all branches
of the military, some FBI and the CIA.

80
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:09,886
Mr President, I've called Mike Novick.
He's getting on a plane right away.

81
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,804
Good. Thank you.

82
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:26,209
- Gentlemen. Lynne.
- Morning, Mr President.

83
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:30,127
What I'm about to tell you,
Mr President, is triple-sourced.

84
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:35,890
While crucial details are still unknown,
we believe this intel to have high credibility.

85
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,565
Go on.

86
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:42,090
There's a nuclear device,
under terrorist control, that's on US soil.

87
00:08:44,013 --> 00:08:45,526
My God!

88
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,449
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

89
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:53,446
It gets worse.
This bomb is going to go off today.

90
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,564
How do we know this?

91
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,452
This suicide bomber is
Mamud Rashed Faheen,

92
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:09,768
a suspected terrorist who we believe has
been associated with fundamentalist groups.

93
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,606
This is the Valentine's Day bombing
in the West Bank?

94
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:18,211
This particular attack
resulted in 13 fatalities, 26 injured.

95
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:21,171
We discovered that
the secondary purpose of this incident

96
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,689
was to create the impression
Faheen was killed.

97
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,287
- He wasn't?
- No.

98
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:31,888
This was taken five days ago
at a small airport outside Léon, France.

99
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:35,170
We had the man on the left,
Jason Park, under surveillance.

100
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:40,532
It was just a coincidence that we caught
the very much alive Faheen in the photo.

101
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,969
We grabbed Park and tried to extract
everything we could out of him.

102
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:47,409
15 minutes ago he broke
and confessed that for the last two years

103
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:50,690
Faheen has been preparing for
today's attack on Los Angeles.

104
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:52,684
Why didn’t you pick up Faheen?

105
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:56,368
This picture wasn't analyzed
until after the two had separated.

106
00:09:56,453 --> 00:10:00,844
I've contacted Defense, CIA,
FBI and local jurisdictions.

107
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,812
- Everything will be run through NSA.
- Who controls Faheen?

108
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:08,647
Relatively new splinter group
that goes by the name of Second Wave.

109
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,848
Government affiliation?

110
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:13,084
Officially not recognised
by any Middle Eastern state.

111
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,164
Unofficially?

112
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,051
- Get me their prime minister.
- Right away.

113
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:00,006
Gary, your breakfast is ready.
Don't let it get cold.

114
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,084
I'll be right there.

115
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:11,171
I won't be back till this afternoon. I'm
expecting a package. Keep an eye out for it?

116
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,244
Sure.

117
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:17,564
- Mom, I'm going skateboarding.
- And what does that mean?

118
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:21,123
I know - I have to put on my helmet
and my elbow and knee pads.

119
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,204
And stay close to Kim.

120
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,771
- Love you.
- What about Kim?

121
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,128
She's the best nanny ever.

122
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:29,931
- You off?
- Yeah.

123
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:33,403
Coffee's ready, I cut your grapefruit
and I bought some scones.

124
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,882
- Blueberry?
- Of course.

125
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:52,004
- You look good today.
- Thanks.

126
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,084
- I'll see you tonight, OK?
- OK.

127
00:12:05,213 --> 00:12:08,205
You know, Kim, you've got a great body.

128
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,084
You work out?

129
00:12:12,173 --> 00:12:14,562
Not really. I like to swim.

130
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:23,882
Yes.

131
00:12:23,973 --> 00:12:26,441
I have the prime minister
on the phone for you.

132
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:29,047
- Mr Prime Minister.
- Mr President.

133
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,806
I was told you need to speak to me.

134
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:36,091
What can you tell me about a terrorist
organisation known as Second Wave?

135
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:41,201
I've heard of them, but my government
firmly rejects its tenets and its methods.

136
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:45,366
In fact, we've recently arrested
several of its members.

137
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:51,050
How do you account for three Second Wave
camps operating unimpeded in your country?

138
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:53,647
There are no camps in my country.

139
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:56,611
Mr Prime Minister, I know two things.

140
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:01,369
One: Second Wave is planning
an attack against one of my cities today.

141
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,809
Two: your government
supports Second Wave.

142
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:10,603
I would appreciate it if you would stop
using my people and my country

143
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,810
as a source for every threat
levelled at the United States.

144
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:18,489
What I'm saying is not meant to be a threat,
simply a statement of fact.

145
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:23,491
If a bomb goes off on US soil today,

146
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:26,883
I will have no choice but to retaliate,

147
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,090
with immediate and decisive force,
against your government.

148
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:32,767
This is an insult.

149
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,323
We are not planning
to attack the United States.

150
00:13:36,413 --> 00:13:38,369
Insult or not,

151
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:43,652
if you care about the lives of your citizens,
you need to hear me loud and clear.

152
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:50,972
Mr Prime Minister,
if a bomb goes off today, it will hurt us,

153
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:53,442
but it will destroy you.

154
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:58,612
Then, Mr President,

155
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:03,483
you will have created an enemy
of over one third of the world's population.

156
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,888
Proceed carefully.

157
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,964
You as well, sir.

158
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:24,044
- You wanna try it again?
- Yeah.

159
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:27,921
Don't fall. You can do it, though.

160
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,004
All right. Slow...

161
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,883
- Yeah.
- Mr Bauer?

162
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,612
- Who is this?
- I have George Mason from CTU on the line.

163
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,207
- I don't work for CTU any more.
- He said that...

164
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:08,683
I'm in the middle of something right now.
Thank you.

165
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,242
I'm so proud of you. You did so good.

166
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:27,126
- Is there any blood?
- Let me see.

167
00:15:27,213 --> 00:15:29,966
No, no blood. You're perfect.

168
00:15:31,373 --> 00:15:33,364
OK. I wanna go again.

169
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:37,492
- All right. Let's go, tough guy.
- Hey! I'm not a guy.

170
00:15:46,973 --> 00:15:50,966
You know what? Why don’t you go play
in the back yard. I'll meet you there.

171
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:53,044
See you in a bit.

172
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:56,963
Hey, sweetheart.

173
00:15:57,053 --> 00:16:00,489
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- I just wanted to say hi.

174
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,848
You haven't been returning my calls.

175
00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:04,924
I'm sorry.

176
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:09,088
I didn't come to ask you
for lunch or hang out.

177
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:13,963
I know you just started this job,
but I just wanted to see you. I miss you.

178
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:19,966
I know. I miss you too.

179
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:24,165
- Then why won’t you...
- Every time I see you, I think of Mom.

180
00:16:24,253 --> 00:16:26,084
- No, honey, please...
- Yes, I do.

181
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:30,724
If you wanna know, I'm telling you,
it's too hard for me right now.

182
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:33,646
All I ever wanted was
the three of us to be together.

183
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,282
- It wasn’t your fault. It just happened.
- Of course it was my fault.

184
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:38,522
Dad.

185
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,887
I'm so sorry, honey. I'm so sorry.

186
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,404
I love you.

187
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:50,250
I'm just... still not ready yet.

188
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:57,651
- Then when?
- I don't know.

189
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,930
Hey, Kim. Come on.

190
00:17:02,453 --> 00:17:04,444
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

191
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,212
- Come in, Eric.
- Mr President, you wanted to see me.

192
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:49,047
Yes. This report seems to be
missing a casualty assessment.

193
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:54,207
I'm having those figures compiled right now.
They'll be ready in about 10 minutes.

194
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:57,490
- Thank you, Eric.
- Mr President, if I may...

195
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:01,929
I think you need to have a serious
conversation with the Pentagon.

196
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:04,481
They need to know how to proceed.

197
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:07,690
It's too early to discuss a response.

198
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:10,571
We don't even know who to retaliate against.

199
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:15,249
- You know the prime minister was lying.
- He was lying about the terrorist camps.

200
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,848
But that doesn't mean his government
is responsible for this threat.

201
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,572
- Mr President, I think...
- Eric, enough.

202
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:26,212
Right now, my only concern
is protecting Americans.

203
00:18:26,293 --> 00:18:30,650
Somewhere in Los Angeles, there is
a terrorist with his finger on the trigger.

204
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,802
We've got to get him.

205
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,446
- Good morning.
- Hi, sweetheart.

206
00:19:10,173 --> 00:19:12,607
Hey, you two! Cut it out.

207
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,366
What? I can't kiss my own wife?

208
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:19,492
She's not your wife
for at least another 10 hours.

209
00:19:19,573 --> 00:19:22,565
- Andre is on the phone.
- Is there a problem with the flowers?

210
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:24,644
- I don't know.
- God!

211
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:27,722
Whoa.

212
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,088
- Sorry.
- So where are the tables?

213
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:34,610
They're not even here yet. I don't know how
they're gonna get everything set up in time.

214
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:37,082
I thought you were picking your cousin up.

215
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:39,528
- I sent a car.
- Cab?

216
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,252
No, the company car.

217
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,927
Hey, Bob. How you doin'?

218
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:47,891
- There's the groom.
- Let me get that for you.

219
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:49,088
I'm fine.

220
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:53,052
I told Marie I'd help her fix the fountain.
Best get to it. Luis.

221
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:57,251
Dad, did you tell Reza he could use
the company car to pick up his cousin?

222
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,563
Kate, honey, please. Not today.

223
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:04,932
If it were every now and then, fine, but there's
the condo in Palm Springs, the days off...

224
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:10,087
Why is it you can't trust Reza? I can't believe
it's because he's from the Middle East...

225
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:13,563
Dad, please.
You brought me up better than that.

226
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:17,651
I don't know. It's... something else.

227
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:20,091
What?

228
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:30,003
I don't know. Maybe I'm just having
a hard time letting go of my little sister.

229
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:40,091
I do miss your mother so much today.

230
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,242
She'd be so proud of both of you.

231
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:57,973
- Rayburn.
- Eric, it's George again.

232
00:20:58,053 --> 00:21:01,090
- What have you got?
- Not a lot. Haven't reached Bauer.

233
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:04,006
- What's this about?
- Your office will be briefed.

234
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:06,209
Just find him and bring him in.

235
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:09,444
We're doing everything we can.
I don't think he wants to be found.

236
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:12,491
In his condition, I don't think
he'll be worth a damn anyway.

237
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:15,531
I'm not asking for your opinion.
I need this guy now.

238
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:19,811
I refuse to believe that given your resources
you can't bring in one former agent.

239
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:23,488
I'll tell you how you can get hold of Bauer,
but you’re not gonna like it.

240
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:28,010
- I'm listening.
- You're with the president right now, correct?

241
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,608
Yeah, I am.

242
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,569
This is Jack Bauer.
Leave your message after the beep.

243
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:56,009
Hi, Jack. It's Tony Almeida at CTU.

244
00:21:56,093 --> 00:22:00,484
I've left messages for you everywhere.
Could you please give us a call?

245
00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:02,564
It's very important.

246
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,852
This is Jack Bauer.
Leave your message after the beep.

247
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:42,211
Hello, Mr Bauer.
I'm calling on behalf of President Palmer.

248
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:46,252
The president needs to speak to you
on an urgent matter. Please call us back...

249
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:50,372
- Hello?
- Mr Bauer? Please hold for the president.

250
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,284
Sir, I have Jack Bauer.

251
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:54,568
- Jack?
- Mr President.

252
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:57,292
You've been avoiding
CTU's calls this morning.

253
00:23:57,373 --> 00:24:00,570
- I don't work for them any more, sir.
- So I hear.

254
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:04,323
How's it all going, Jack?

255
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,405
- It's been difficult, sir.
- I'm sure it has.

256
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:13,727
- I've thought a lot about you this past year.
- Thank you, Mr President.

257
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:16,888
I know this is a bad time,
but I need your help.

258
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:21,012
I've been inactive for over a year.
I can't see how I'd be of any help to anyone.

259
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,165
We are in a grave situation
that requires the attention

260
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:27,131
of all branches of our national security.

261
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:31,525
My advisors are convinced that
you can play an important part in this effort.

262
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:35,606
- I'm sorry, but I'm in no condition...
- Jack, listen to me.

263
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:42,006
I know you suffered a loss, I know it's hard,
but this is not a routine request.

264
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,208
Go to CTU,

265
00:24:43,293 --> 00:24:47,286
listen to what's happening,
and then make your decision.

266
00:24:50,493 --> 00:24:52,484
Jack...

267
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:57,003
You saved my life.

268
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:02,609
I trust you as much as I trust anyone,
and now I need your help.

269
00:25:05,013 --> 00:25:07,049
When do they need me?

270
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:09,124
Now.

271
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,843
Carla, why'd you come back?

272
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:28,562
I was supposed to wrap a gift
for Gary to take to his assistant today.

273
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,008
- I can do it.
- No. I have to do it.

274
00:25:31,093 --> 00:25:32,162
Why?

275
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:35,290
Because Gary likes these things done
in a very specific way.

276
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:37,841
It would take too long to explain it.

277
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,525
OK.

278
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,569
Kim...

279
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:44,887
I'm sorry.

280
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:49,405
Will you take Megan upstairs to play?

281
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:51,245
Sure.

282
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:03,288
Have you looked at your system?

283
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:05,364
No. What's up?

284
00:26:06,213 --> 00:26:13,164
Langley issued an information flow advisory.
Whatever's going on will be inter-agency.

285
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:19,249
All right. Call Lindauer and Grothy and
tell them they don't have a day off after all.

286
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:24,807
And... start filtering anything that comes in.

287
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:44,284
Hey.

288
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:47,925
- Something's going on, isn't it?
- We're not sure.

289
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:51,448
- I could do those redundancies.
- It's OK.

290
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:56,004
- I've studied the protocols.
- Paula, you're trying too hard.

291
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:02,044
Just do your job. Everything's gonna be fine.

292
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,250
Sorry. I waited to get assigned here
for two years. I just...

293
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,848
Heads up. I need all department heads
over here right now.

294
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,128
We've an active priority.

295
00:27:20,173 --> 00:27:23,404
I just got off a conference call
with NSA and Division.

296
00:27:23,493 --> 00:27:26,690
It appears there's a nuclear bomb,
under terrorist control,

297
00:27:26,773 --> 00:27:32,564
somewhere here in Los Angeles, set to go off
at some point in the course of the day, so...

298
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,530
From this moment on,

299
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:39,846
we do not communicate with anybody
outside of our secured envelope.

300
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:45,326
That means we don't call home, we don't
talk to friends, we don't call relatives.

301
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,962
Our job is to find this device and stop it.

302
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:51,123
We do not want to create panic.

303
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:55,451
I know this isn't very pleasant,

304
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:58,764
but this is our job, this is what we do.

305
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:03,003
So let's do it.

306
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,804
George.

307
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:11,647
- I still haven't been able to reach Jack.
- NSA got hold of him.

308
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:16,853
Is this why they wanted him? I mean,
he's been out of play for over a year.

309
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:22,212
I'm guessing it has something to do
with one of his previous covers.

310
00:28:24,693 --> 00:28:30,006
In this scenario, immediate loss of life would
be in the low thousands, relatively small.

311
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:34,405
But the dispersal of radioactive debris
from a dirty bomb is unpredictable

312
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:37,849
and could multiply
that figure many times over.

313
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:44,090
I understand that we don't know whether
this is a dirty bomb or something bigger.

314
00:28:44,173 --> 00:28:47,210
Give me the worst-case scenario.

315
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:50,012
All right. Worst-case scenario.

316
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:54,401
Stolen Soviet nuclear warhead,

317
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:59,283
a properly configured trigger
detonated 500 feet above the city.

318
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:03,810
Approximately 100 square miles
would be irradiated within seconds.

319
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:09,413
Apart from the loss of life, this kind of blow
would have global repercussions

320
00:29:09,493 --> 00:29:11,484
that would last for years.

321
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,482
Thank you, Eric.

322
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:21,444
What would you like to do about the Joint
Chiefs, sir? They're waiting to hear from you.

323
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:23,524
I'm not ready to speak to them yet.

324
00:29:23,613 --> 00:29:27,765
Mr President, if I could suggest
that you at least start the dialogue.

325
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,970
At this point, this is not a military operation.

326
00:29:31,053 --> 00:29:35,968
It is a potential terrorist attack,
and that's the way I'm going to approach it.

327
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:39,962
Yes, sir.

328
00:29:40,933 --> 00:29:42,924
Thank you, everybody.

329
00:31:07,453 --> 00:31:10,092
Paula, I need you to open up
another socket for me.

330
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:13,370
And Mason wants to see you
in the conference room.

331
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,324
Paula?

332
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:33,730
- I don't know if I can do this.
- Of course you can do it.

333
00:31:34,253 --> 00:31:39,771
No, I'm just a programmer and I don't think
I work very well under this kind of pressure,

334
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:43,766
so maybe they just wanna
bring somebody else in.

335
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:47,643
Look, Paula, there is no one else.

336
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:52,249
You're the best at what you do. You know
the system inside out. That's why you're here.

337
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,927
Just take it one task at a time.

338
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,925
Right now all I need you to do
is open up a couple of sockets.

339
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:01,528
And then get to
the conference room, all right?

340
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:04,331
OK?

341
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,404
OK.

342
00:32:25,413 --> 00:32:27,404
Thank you.

343
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:55,569
Hey, Jack.

344
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:58,804
- Hi, Tony. How you doing?
- Fine. How you been?

345
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:02,328
I've been all right. Where's George?

346
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,768
He's waiting for you in the conference room.

347
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:06,844
- You've been briefed?
- Yeah.

348
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,644
Jack.

349
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,126
- Jack Bauer, Michelle Dessler...
- What am I doing here, George?

350
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:36,608
There's a rogue nuclear weapon
here in Los Angeles, Jack.

351
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:39,287
Intel says it's going off today.

352
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:45,521
- How good's your intel?
- Very.

353
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:51,085
NSA have high-probability leads
on regional cells that might be involved.

354
00:33:51,173 --> 00:33:53,926
How close are you to IDing a prime suspect?

355
00:33:55,013 --> 00:33:56,765
Not close at all.

356
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:01,922
That's what you’re here for.

357
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:07,009
Where are you going, Jack? Jack?

358
00:34:07,693 --> 00:34:09,843
George, let me talk to him.

359
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:18,482
Jack.

360
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,803
Just give me a second, Tony.

361
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,612
Hello?

362
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:28,244
- It's me. Listen. This is really important.
- Dad, I told you today, I'm not ready.

363
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,325
- Kim, this is not about us.
- What's it about?

364
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,762
I'm at CTU. They gave me some information.

365
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:37,572
You and I have to leave
Los Angeles together now.

366
00:34:37,653 --> 00:34:42,169
No, Dad. If you're going back to work, fine,
but you’re not dragging me into it.

367
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:45,848
I'm not trying to get back to work.
Kim, don't hang up on me.

368
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:58,883
Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message.

369
00:34:58,973 --> 00:35:02,283
Honey, it's me.
If you don't wanna leave with me, fine,

370
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:04,762
but you’ve got to get out of Los Angeles.

371
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:09,210
It's not safe for you here. Don't talk
to anybody. Just go to Aunt Carol's.

372
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:14,845
I'm gonna call her now and tell her that you’re
coming. When you get there, phone me.

373
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:18,528
Sweetheart, please,
just do this for me. Please.

374
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:23,008
- Jack, wait a minute.
- I don't have time.

375
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:26,210
You were called in
because it's a background match.

376
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,761
You're the only one that can run with this.

377
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:31,003
- I don't care.
- It's not like before.

378
00:35:31,093 --> 00:35:34,563
We can get to Kim, get her out of the city,
keep her safe. I promise you.

379
00:35:34,653 --> 00:35:37,326
The best thing you can do now
is help us find that bomb.

380
00:35:37,413 --> 00:35:41,042
I trusted everybody here at CTU
to protect my wife and I lost her.

381
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:44,523
Tony, I'm not gonna
lose my daughter. I'm sorry.

382
00:35:44,613 --> 00:35:47,650
I know, Jack. I was there.

383
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:57,006
Tony, look, I know you did
everything you could. I do.

384
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:01,482
I just can't lose my daughter.

385
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:04,728
I'm sorry.

386
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:21,646
Carol, it's Jack. I wanted Kim
to get out of the city and come visit you.

387
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:25,567
I'll explain as soon as I talk to you.
Could you do me a huge favour?

388
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:30,044
As soon as she gets there, call me
and let me know she's safe. Thank you.

389
00:36:58,173 --> 00:37:00,482
Great, Almeida. Now what?

390
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:05,044
- Back off, George. I did the best I could.
- I guess your best isn't very good, then.

391
00:37:05,133 --> 00:37:08,569
Maybe there's another way to find Wald.

392
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:13,249
Why didn't I think of that? I bet NSA had us
bring in a burnt-out agent for the challenge.

393
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:17,167
- Anyone could have done the job.
- Settle down, George, all right?

394
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:20,245
Let's sit down, regroup
and figure out what we're gonna do.

395
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,803
What we're gonna do?
We're gonna call NSA. Now.

396
00:37:24,853 --> 00:37:28,448
Here's the deal. I want Knoll or Grothy
to pick up my daughter

397
00:37:28,533 --> 00:37:31,252
and take her a safe distance
outside of this city.

398
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:31,884
Done.

399
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:34,731
I wanna be kept up to date
on their status by Tony.

400
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:38,044
- Sorry, George. I don't trust you.
- You're gonna have to start.

401
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:41,967
What we're up against today
none of us can walk away from.

402
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:44,851
Tony and I'll both take care of Kim.

403
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,324
I'll do it now.

404
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,088
Thank you.

405
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:01,127
Tell me about the regional cells.

406
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,969
The most promising one's
headed by Joseph Wald.

407
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:07,202
Joseph Wald?

408
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:10,330
Wald's been linked to a terror group
called Second Wave.

409
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,689
That's why it had to be you.
You put in time undercover with him.

410
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:16,685
- I put him in jail, George.
- He's out on appeal.

411
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:19,890
And he's actually awaiting trial
right now on new charges.

412
00:38:19,973 --> 00:38:23,522
- If he's convicted, he goes away for life.
- What's Wald's connection?

413
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:27,492
NSA established meetings between him
and the group behind the threat.

414
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:30,610
- Why didn’t you pick Wald up?
- We haven't tracked him down yet.

415
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:34,083
He's not at any of the addresses in his file.

416
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:37,529
Are there are key witnesses
against Wald in his upcoming trial?

417
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:39,331
- There's one.
- Marshall Goren.

418
00:38:39,413 --> 00:38:42,849
- Apparently without him there's no case.
- Good. Bring him in.

419
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,764
Here? What for?

420
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:49,529
You want me to re-establish my cover
with Wald. It takes at least six weeks.

421
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:54,323
You want me to do this in under two hours.
Where's the FBI holding Goren?

422
00:38:54,413 --> 00:38:57,086
Downtown, right here in protective custody.

423
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:59,687
Good. Bring him in. Now.

424
00:39:10,853 --> 00:39:13,651
- Scott's coming to the wedding?
- Yeah. He called.

425
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:16,167
I thought you knew he wouldn't come.

426
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:20,724
I dated him six years ago, honey.
He's more like a brother to me.

427
00:39:21,573 --> 00:39:24,167
Is the groom jealous?

428
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:27,165
Jealous? It's not a question of jealousy.

429
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,492
It's a question of what I'm comfortable with.

430
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:33,770
My brothers married women that
had never been with another man.

431
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:36,492
That's what my family expects of us all.

432
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:38,052
Oh.

433
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:43,287
I see. So, instead, they have to settle
for Marie, who's what - damaged goods?

434
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:47,764
All right, don't let him bait you.
He's just trying to push our buttons.

435
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:51,812
I've got this guy wrapped
around my little finger and he knows it.

436
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:54,282
Kate. Teléfono.

437
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:00,849
I'll show you the seating chart.

438
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:03,128
Thanks.

439
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:06,444
- Hello?
- This is Ralph Burton. Is this a bad time?

440
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:09,127
No, Ralph. Can you hold on a second?

441
00:40:19,613 --> 00:40:22,571
Sorry, Ralph. What's up?
Didn’t you get my cheque?

442
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,564
Yes. That's not why I'm calling.

443
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:27,087
When you asked for
a background on Reza Naiyeer,

444
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:29,562
you were worried about
his financial integrity.

445
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:34,249
The report you showed me said I had nothing
to worry about. Has something changed?

446
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:37,689
Not exactly. He's done nothing wrong
at your father's company,

447
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:41,732
and his financial dealings in the past
have been legitimate.

448
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:43,769
Great. So what's the problem?

449
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:46,651
I was proofing a file on another individual.

450
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:50,009
- Reza's name came up.
- Yeah, so?

451
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:54,086
There's a man named Syed Ali.
He's an international financier

452
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:57,848
with ties to several terrorist organisations.

453
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:01,243
What are you saying?
Reza knows this guy Ali?

454
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:04,405
Well, according to this file,
they've had dealings.

455
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:05,642
Oh, my God.

456
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:10,602
It's possible that Reza's business
with Ali was legitimate,

457
00:41:10,693 --> 00:41:13,969
that Reza didn't even know
about Ali's terrorist connection.

458
00:41:14,053 --> 00:41:18,331
But if you wanna know for sure,
I'm gonna need your help.

459
00:41:21,573 --> 00:41:24,167
What do you need me to do?

460
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:35,884
Let's not waste time. I don't want
my decisions based on speculation.

461
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:42,048
Before I read any of the reports, I want the
sources and their reliability double-checked.

462
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:45,044
Excuse me.

463
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:49,323
Did you set up a comm with the Joint Chiefs
regarding response?

464
00:41:49,413 --> 00:41:50,289
No.

465
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:54,446
The secretary of state called. They're
expecting to speak with you in five minutes.

466
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:56,364
What?

467
00:41:58,693 --> 00:42:00,684
- Cancel it.
- Yes, sir.

468
00:42:06,013 --> 00:42:07,890
Eric.

469
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:09,964
Yes, Mr President.

470
00:42:10,733 --> 00:42:13,122
Would you excuse us, please?

471
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:20,727
I thought I was clear that we're not
to burn time and energy on response.

472
00:42:20,813 --> 00:42:22,565
Of course, sir.

473
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:27,408
Then why is there a conference call
set up with the Joint Chiefs?

474
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:31,008
In case you changed your mind.
It takes time to coordinate.

475
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:34,051
Don't second-guess me, Eric.

476
00:42:34,933 --> 00:42:40,291
Today's gonna be a very long day, and I don't
want my own people working against me.

477
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:44,127
Sir, I would never work against you.

478
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:57,923
Goren's gonna be here any minute.
He'll be back in your custody within the hour.

479
00:42:58,013 --> 00:43:00,208
All right, George.

480
00:43:00,293 --> 00:43:04,445
Our pals at the FBI aren't too happy.
Goren's the state's only witness against Wald.

481
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:07,286
Get what you want fast
cos I want them off my back.

482
00:43:07,373 --> 00:43:08,522
What's that?

483
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:13,368
We're saying you were extradited to Florida
on two counts of armed robbery.

484
00:43:13,453 --> 00:43:16,490
Don't make it armed robbery -
that's not how they knew me.

485
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:19,565
Conspiracy to transport illegal explosives.

486
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:20,483
Got it.

487
00:43:20,573 --> 00:43:22,723
Are you gonna let me in our your plan?

488
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:26,123
And get in touch
with a Rudi Collett, a parole officer.

489
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:30,604
- Brief him and then put him into my cover.
- Jack.

490
00:43:31,613 --> 00:43:35,242
Look at you. You look like a bum
off the street, you're not talking to me.

491
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:39,087
I just confiscated a witness
outside of my authority based on your call.

492
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:42,768
- Are you gonna tell me what you’re doing?
- No.

493
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:48,371
Are you losing it? I don't have the time or
the resources to clean up your messes today.

494
00:43:48,453 --> 00:43:51,047
I'm not losing it.

495
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:59,527
Just put him in the chair.

496
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:04,884
Thank you, gentlemen.

497
00:44:06,973 --> 00:44:09,567
Michelle, please excuse us.

498
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:12,326
- Don’t you want me to...?
- No.

499
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:29,684
- You are Marshall Goren?
- Yeah.

500
00:44:29,773 --> 00:44:33,527
Eight counts: kidnapping a minor.
Two counts: child pornography.

501
00:44:33,613 --> 00:44:35,843
First degree murder.

502
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:39,243
Yeah. Hey, look. I already made my deal.

503
00:44:40,413 --> 00:44:42,688
I don't need to hear this noise.

504
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:47,130
All I gotta do is testify against Wald,
and I walk.

505
00:45:01,853 --> 00:45:05,323
Get a helicopter and a backup team
ready to leave here in 15 minutes.

506
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:07,927
- Are you out of your mind?
- You wanna find this bomb?

507
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:10,766
- This is what it's gonna take.
- Killing a witness?

508
00:45:10,853 --> 00:45:14,402
People like you want results
but you never wanna get your hands dirty.

509
00:45:14,493 --> 00:45:17,485
I'd start rolling up your sleeves.

510
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,051
I'm gonna need a hacksaw.

511
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:09,525
Look, Kim. Olivia's giving Kristen a haircut.

512
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:13,765
- Olivia gave Kristen a haircut last night.
- Her hair grows really fast.

513
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:18,726
Are you a complete idiot?
I had to leave in the middle of a meeting!

514
00:46:18,813 --> 00:46:23,170
How do you think that makes me look?
You cannot possibly be this incompetent.

515
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:27,849
Can we go somewhere else?
I don't like it when he gets like this.

516
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:31,966
What do you mean? What does he do?

517
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:34,248
Stay there.

518
00:46:41,013 --> 00:46:43,686
It's gonna be fine.

519
00:46:44,413 --> 00:46:46,165
Megan.

520
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:49,124
Sweetie.

521
00:46:51,053 --> 00:46:55,046
Megan, are you in there?
Open the door, sweetie. Now.

522
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,164
Go in the bathroom.

523
00:46:58,253 --> 00:47:01,051
- Just a minute. We're in the bathroom.
- You're what?

524
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:03,124
Be right there.

525
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:12,086
Sorry. Megan's going through
a modest stage. No boys allowed.

526
00:47:14,453 --> 00:47:17,570
- So you guys were in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

527
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:23,572
- You didn't hear anything?
- What do you mean?

528
00:47:25,413 --> 00:47:28,211
- Carla had a little accident. She slipped.
- Is she OK?

529
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:30,807
Yeah, she's fine. Just fine.

530
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:37,245
- Why don’t you go give her a hand?
- Well...

531
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:41,451
Listen, I need a few minutes
with my daughter before I leave, OK?

532
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:47,361
- What's the matter, petal?
- We were...

533
00:47:47,453 --> 00:47:50,490
- Did I not tell you to get outta here?
- Mommy!

534
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,893
- It's OK, Megan.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

535
00:47:53,973 --> 00:47:57,443
Daddy's had a bad... I'm sorry.
Just be quiet. Megan, shut up.

536
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,728
- Megan, shut up!
- Leave her alone!

537
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:02,407
Stay down, Kim. I will hurt you!

538
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,652
Shut up, Megan!

539
00:48:18,453 --> 00:48:20,171
What? Yeah.

540
00:48:20,253 --> 00:48:23,643
Yes, I said I'd be back in a couple of minutes.

541
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:24,927
Yeah.

542
00:48:25,013 --> 00:48:27,925
Listen, I just have to take care of something.

543
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:30,527
I'll be a few minutes.

544
00:49:21,853 --> 00:49:25,368
