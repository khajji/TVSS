1
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:18,282
- Why are they asking Dad questions?
- You started a witch hunt in our family.

2
00:00:18,373 --> 00:00:20,648
- What did you accuse my father of?
- I didn't.

3
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,803
You're pointing at him to cover yourself!

4
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:25,327
He says Bob Warner
had dealings with Syed Ali.

5
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:28,086
Bring them in.
We'll separate them and turn up the heat.

6
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:31,483
I need help. I have to get into
my father's private records.

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,325
Who is the man in Visalia?!

8
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:36,883
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen.
He also thinks I'm in prison.

9
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:39,726
- You make him believe you got out.
- I need to see Mamud.

10
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:43,169
- Should we go?
- Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen.

11
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:44,481
That's it. Everybody go!

12
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:51,332
- We have to talk about Ron Wieland.
- Does anyone know he's sequestered?

13
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:55,247
No, but soon they'll figure out
the last person they saw him with was you.

14
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:59,451
I've invoked executive privilege and granted
Sherry provisional security clearance.

15
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,082
Seems every time I turn around,
somebody advises me to send you away.

16
00:01:03,173 --> 00:01:04,367
Why don’t you?

17
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:07,172
You may be able to
get information nobody else can.

18
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:12,524
- Damm it! Just play it cool.
- Cool? We're in a stolen car.

19
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:15,207
Step out of the car, please.
And open the trunk.

20
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,284
- Oh, my God!
- Carla!

21
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:20,490
- Oh, my God! He killed her!
- Put your hands behind your head.

22
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,772
- So whose car is it?
- It's her father's.

23
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:38,248
- Did he give it to you?
- Not exactly.

24
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:43,244
- Then what, exactly?
- We took it without permission.

25
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:47,246
- You stole this car?
- I can't believe he killed her.

26
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:53,329
Gary Matheson, the man Kim works for, beat
his wife and was starting to hurt his daughter.

27
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,211
Kim called me to help
get Megan away from him.

28
00:01:56,293 --> 00:02:01,162
If that's true, why didn’t you go to the police?
Why do I find you 20 miles outside of LA?

29
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:07,092
I thought so.
You have the right to remain silent.

30
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:10,449
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

31
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:15,084
You have the right to an attorney. If you can't
afford one, one will be appointed for you.

32
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:17,289
Do you understand these rights?

33
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,962
Is it safe in here?

34
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,692
Stay away from cordoned areas,
you'll be all right.

35
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:34,607
- This building was bombed this morning.
- Yeah.

36
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,888
- Hey.
- You got the rooms ready?

37
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:40,932
Yeah. They're a little messed up,
but good enough for interrogation.

38
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:46,724
- How we doing here?
- Final tally... 30 dead, 17 wounded.

39
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,452
Davidorff and Lindauer are critical.

40
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,524
What about Paula?

41
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,685
Could you do me a favour
and take them back to the rooms?

42
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:01,843
Follow me, please.

43
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:07,526
Listen, can I talk to you alone?

44
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:10,810
Stay with them. I'll be there in a minute.

45
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:18,328
- Find anything new?
- No, just what I told you on the phone.

46
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:22,770
The two men are contradicting each other.
There's definitely a tie to Syed Ali.

47
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:27,483
Looks like Ali is at the centre of this.
I hope it brings us closer to finding the nuke.

48
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:30,804
- Just tell me how hard I can push him.
- Hard as you have to.

49
00:03:30,893 --> 00:03:35,648
Stick bamboo shoots under their fingernails.
Get what they got. Time's running out.

50
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:45,813
Call Henderson at FBI. Set up a conference
call with him and the Attorney General.

51
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:50,682
- Lynne. You have a sec?
- Sure, Roger.

52
00:03:55,933 --> 00:04:00,961
I understand that Sherry Palmer has
been given provisional security clearance.

53
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:05,012
Yes, that's right. The president
has invoked executive privilege.

54
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:07,084
You OK with that?

55
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:12,522
- It's different.
- Yes, it is.

56
00:04:12,613 --> 00:04:14,604
I've weighed in about it.

57
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:18,971
If I feel that she's becoming a problem,
I'll let the president know.

58
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:23,443
She's his ex-wife.
That's a problem all by itself.

59
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:27,367
No. Sandra, thank you. I'll get back with you.

60
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:40,248
- Tell me about Ron Wieland.
- What about him?

61
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:45,566
I just got off the phone with
Sandra Ivany at the network.

62
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:49,931
She said no one's heard from him
since he met with you this morning.

63
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:57,092
David? You didn't detain him, did you?

64
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:00,609
You are here today to help me,
not question my judgment.

65
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,809
And I am trying to help.

66
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:06,166
What's going on with Wieland?

67
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,643
- He was gonna go public with a rumour.
- About the bomb?

68
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,727
I cannot afford a panic.

69
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:17,366
You can't keep him locked up indefinitely.

70
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:19,808
People are already asking questions.

71
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:23,602
We're holding him at the OC.
When the crisis passes, I'll let him go.

72
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:26,412
Well, meanwhile you've got a problem.

73
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,088
His disappearance could raise questions
you don't want to answer.

74
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:33,290
- I put Armus on it.
- Apparently it hasn't helped.

75
00:05:33,373 --> 00:05:37,127
- The word is getting out.
- What do you suggest?

76
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:42,246
Give him an on-air exclusive
when this is over.

77
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,166
I offered that to him. He didn't want it.

78
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,772
Then let me talk to him.

79
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:52,687
David, one talent you know I have
is dealing with the media.

80
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:55,731
And I know Ron. He likes me.

81
00:05:59,053 --> 00:06:01,362
No. You're here to gather information.

82
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:04,013
And to help. You said so yourself.

83
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:07,085
And today you can't afford to ignore that.

84
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,766
Let me try talking to Ron.

85
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,563
What would you say to him?

86
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:21,369
I'll make it worth his while
not to say anything.

87
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:26,804
- Kim, I'm scared!
- It's OK, Megan.

88
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:30,090
You're gonna be OK. It's gonna be fine.

89
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,849
Where are you taking her?
She can't go back to LA.

90
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:36,970
- Why not?
- It's not safe.

91
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:43,843
- Why didn’t you tell him?
- My dad said not to tell anyone.

92
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,367
He didn't know you'd be charged with murder.

93
00:06:46,453 --> 00:06:48,648
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No. You can't.

94
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:52,328
I'm telling you, Miguel,
my dad said no one can know about this.

95
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:55,325
I think you should tell him who your dad is.

96
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:59,486
Let them call him. Let your dad explain
why we're trying to get out of town.

97
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,963
Come on, let's go. Come on.

98
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:24,288
My father works at CTU,
the place that got bombed this morning.

99
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:29,891
His name is Jack Bauer. Please call him. He'll
explain why it's not safe to be in LA today.

100
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:33,648
You can call your father
after you've been processed.

101
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:44,613
Nina: "Who are you working with in LA?"

102
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:54,766
Faheen: "I'm not going to
give you any information."

103
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:09,762
Faheen: "It's too late. Don't waste your time.
The operation will be done."

104
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:12,048
- This is not working.
- It will work.

105
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,931
- I just need a little more time.
- No, you're done.

106
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,766
- Jack, don't do this!
- On your feet.

107
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,923
- We're going back.
- Did he talk?

108
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,402
- No, he wouldn't talk to her.
- What do we do?

109
00:08:22,493 --> 00:08:25,485
Have Division set up a white room.
We'll handle it in LA.

110
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:29,486
Wrong move. The deeper you bring him in,
the more he'll shut down.

111
00:08:29,573 --> 00:08:32,406
- We'll see.
- Rick, give me more time with him!

112
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:35,405
You've had enough.
Make sure Faheen gets to the airport.

113
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:37,484
- And you?
- I'll be right behind you.

114
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:40,565
- You see what he's doing?
- Jack, you can't take her.

115
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,850
I have a document signed by
the president! He can't do this!

116
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:48,484
- My orders are to stay with you and her.
- Forget that. All they need is Faheen.

117
00:08:48,573 --> 00:08:51,326
Don't push this.
I can't leave you alone with her.

118
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:56,407
- It's got nothing to do with you. Back off.
- Step away from the car, Bauer.

119
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:21,923
- Paul Koplin. Nice to meet you.
- Thanks for coming. Come in.

120
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:26,529
No problem. I spoke to Ralph, he told me
what files we're going to have to get into.

121
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:31,209
- The ones that linked Reza to this terrorist?
- Yes. That's Syed Ali.

122
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:34,251
The company computer
is networked into this house.

123
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,690
I'll have to hack some passwords.
I assume you're authorising me to do that.

124
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:42,322
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Is this it?

125
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:47,362
I don't know why they dragged my family in
for questioning on my sister's wedding day.

126
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:52,447
I'm a little surprised about that, too,
but it's a whole new world out there now.

127
00:09:57,093 --> 00:10:01,644
I'm sorry that happened, but as private
investigators we're required by law

128
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:07,569
to report any terrorist-related information
to Homeland Security right off.

129
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:15,284
Here it is. I accessed the monthly statements
but I couldn't get into any detailed records.

130
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:18,092
All right. Let's see what we can do.

131
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:32,891
Armus? Where are you going?

132
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:36,363
I'm taking Mrs Palmer
to one of the conference rooms.

133
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,603
- Does she have clearance?
- Excuse me.

134
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:42,572
But you don't need to speak about me
as if I weren't here, Mr Stanton.

135
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,803
I'm sorry, Mrs Palmer. Roger Stanton.

136
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:47,453
I know who you are, Roger.

137
00:10:47,533 --> 00:10:50,366
It's just a highly restricted area.

138
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:53,650
Yes, I know. However,
I have been granted access.

139
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:58,765
- Why do you need to be here?
- That you’ll have to ask the president.

140
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,844
- Armus.
- Excuse me.

141
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:08,248
My apologies, Mrs Palmer. It's just we're very
careful about the flow of information today.

142
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,847
There's no need to apologise.

143
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:16,053
I would assume that you’re careful
about the flow of information every day.

144
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:19,843
Thank you.

145
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:31,042
- Sherry Palmer.
- Hello, Ron.

146
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:35,046
Just when I thought this day
couldn't get any stranger.

147
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:38,250
I can imagine
you're not happy about all of this.

148
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:43,202
- I'd like to know what "this" is.
- I don't exactly know myself.

149
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:46,573
I don't believe you, Sherry.

150
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:50,931
But unless they kill me
I'm gonna have the story of the year.

151
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,368
I was kidnapped
by the leader of the free world.

152
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:56,331
That's not necessarily true, Ron.

153
00:11:56,413 --> 00:12:00,691
There actually has been precedent
for this kind of executive action.

154
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:04,129
If you're here to shut me up,
you're wasting your time.

155
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:08,650
I sensed I was onto something.
That they locked me in here only confirms it.

156
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:12,211
I'm coming out of here
with a story. Deal with it.

157
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:16,532
Hm.

158
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:21,883
- Mind if I sit down?
- Of course not.

159
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:30,722
We'd like to release you, Ron.

160
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:33,523
And we will.

161
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:38,403
But we need assurances you won't go public
with the rumour you threatened to broadcast.

162
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:43,851
In return for what? I get an exclusive with
the president on some watered-down story?

163
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:48,688
Not a watered-down story. Something else.

164
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:53,972
You go out there, let everyone know
that you are not missing.

165
00:12:54,053 --> 00:12:56,806
Don't say anything about this morning.

166
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:03,723
The president will let you inside
of the OC to report first-hand.

167
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:07,010
No journalist has ever been inside there.

168
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:13,845
Why did he send you
down here to make this offer?

169
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:18,927
In fact, what are you even doing
back inside David Palmer's circle?

170
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:21,083
Take the deal, Ron.

171
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:28,566
In a couple of hours they'll brief you
and then you'll know more than I do.

172
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:36,251
Hey! Guys, you need some help?

173
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:41,450
Yeah.

174
00:14:58,053 --> 00:15:01,363
Nina: "The only way out of this
is to cooperate with them."

175
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:09,289
Nina: "Mamud, it does your case
no good if you end up dead."

176
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:16,970
"Think about it, Mamud.
We're on our way to Los Angeles."

177
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:25,367
Faheen: "I'm not afraid to die."

178
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:03,129
Nina: "How big is the bomb?"

179
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,483
"What time is it supposed to go off?"

180
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:23,126
Faheen: "You betrayed me.
You betrayed us all. Traitor."

181
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,762
Bring her back here now.

182
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:34,204
Come on.

183
00:16:38,813 --> 00:16:43,091
We are out of time. If you want to
live through this, be straight with me.

184
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:46,449
- When was this planned?
- Six months before I was arrested.

185
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:50,412
- And Faheen approached you?
- Yes, but through an intermediary.

186
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:52,723
- He didn't tell you about the nuke?
- No.

187
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:57,284
I didn't know what the endgame was.
I just knew it was something big.

188
00:16:57,373 --> 00:17:00,524
- Is there another way around Faheen?
- No.

189
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:06,683
Is he really willing to die?

190
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,170
Yes.

191
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,801
Jack, what are we gonna do?

192
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,447
Take her back.

193
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:07,889
Don't drive too long on that spare.
There's not a lot of tread left.

194
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:13,570
- Yes. Thank you very much, sir.
- Why not follow me to Ventura Boulevard?

195
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:16,531
- There's a tire store there.
- No, no, no. We'll be fine.

196
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:19,571
All right. You're all set.

197
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:22,850
- Here. Please.
- Don't worry about it.

198
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:26,448
You know anybody who needs
pool service, give 'em my card. OK?

199
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,649
Of course, of course.

200
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,531
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.
- See ya!

201
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:43,362
The kid said it was dangerous
and to stay out of Los Angeles.

202
00:18:43,453 --> 00:18:46,650
This one told me a similar story.
No details, though.

203
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,611
- Do you think it's true?
- I don't think so.

204
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,684
- What, then?
- They're telling stories.

205
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:54,765
- Want me to call it in?
- Wait until we get back, OK?

206
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:56,889
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

207
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:02,969
- Your friend's got quite an imagination.
- What did he say?

208
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:08,081
That you were leaving town because
some bomb's supposed to go off in LA today.

209
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,006
That what you meant
when you said it wasn't safe?

210
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:16,324
Please, just call CTU
and try and reach my dad.

211
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:21,203
You need to get Megan, the girl that
was with us. Keep her out of the city.

212
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:35,370
LA Dispatch, this is 621. Put me through
to Frank Reed over at FBI Local.

213
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:39,810
I've been unable to
reach anyone at the FBI for 45 minutes.

214
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:45,331
- Unable to reach them? Why?
- Lot of traffic on their lines for some reason.

215
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:48,211
Keep trying.
Give me a call when you get through.

216
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:50,284
Copy that.

217
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,728
What the hell is going on?

218
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:10,005
- How did it go with Wieland?
- He's not gonna play ball.

219
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,653
He thinks he's got the upper hand.

220
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,122
He knows we have to let him go eventually.

221
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:19,092
Whether there's a legal precedent
for this or not, he has a hell of a story.

222
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:22,210
I'm so sorry, David.
I thought I could charm him.

223
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,886
OK, Sherry. That'll be all.

224
00:20:33,613 --> 00:20:35,843
David?

225
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,208
Why are you treating me like this?

226
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:43,686
It's not about you. I just have more
important things to deal with right now.

227
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:49,171
You know,

228
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,086
you've always been able to forgive.

229
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:57,486
Always given everyone a second chance,
but not me.

230
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:09,527
I came here today
to tell you that you were right.

231
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:13,404
Right to kick me off the campaign,

232
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,727
right to file for divorce.

233
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:21,211
Where's all this coming from?

234
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:27,842
A place of honesty, of realisation.

235
00:21:29,493 --> 00:21:31,723
I was too caught up in the power.

236
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:36,288
- And you're not now?
- Of course. You know I love it.

237
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:40,366
But now I am aware of
what I can and can't handle.

238
00:21:41,293 --> 00:21:43,727
So what are you asking for?

239
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,122
Let me help you.

240
00:21:50,213 --> 00:21:54,650
If what I bring to you can be useful,

241
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:59,124
then you can consider it
the start of a new confidence.

242
00:21:59,213 --> 00:22:04,765
All right. But I promise you
absolutely nothing in return.

243
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,652
OK.

244
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,406
All right, there are the transaction records.
On the week of the 23rd,

245
00:23:56,493 --> 00:24:01,726
Reza made four withdrawals from
the company's discretionary account.

246
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:06,409
$175,000, $150,000,
$50,000, another $50,000...

247
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:09,246
- That's almost a half a million dollars.
- Yeah.

248
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,211
- What did he do with the money?
- Let's see.

249
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:19,609
He wrote a check to Syed Ali for $475,000
in return for "consulting services."

250
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:22,491
So what? Maybe they were doing business.

251
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:27,291
Syed Ali's only business
is bankrolling terrorists.

252
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:30,410
What about my father?
What's his connection to all this?

253
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:34,122
Reza convinced CTU your father
authorised these transactions,

254
00:24:34,213 --> 00:24:37,250
or maybe he just did them on his own.
I'm speculating.

255
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:42,088
My father is not involved in terrorism.
The government made a mistake.

256
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:44,403
We have to find it and clear him.

257
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:50,806
All right. Let's try
and get into his personal calendar.

258
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:53,726
Let's see what he did
the days the checks were written.

259
00:24:53,813 --> 00:24:55,531
Fine.

260
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:56,602
OK.

261
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:59,890
Here's your father's schedule for that week.

262
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:06,645
- Nothing here, either.
- Of course not.

263
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:09,122
My father has nothing to do with any of this.

264
00:25:09,213 --> 00:25:12,250
I shouldn't have called you.
This is a waste of time.

265
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,689
- Wait a minute.
- What?

266
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:19,812
There's a file in his personal directory
that's accessed almost daily.

267
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:24,489
It has a resource tab on it,
which means it's a government file.

268
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:27,690
- My dad has government clients.
- Whoa!

269
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:30,003
- What?
- It's an auto-delete program.

270
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:32,766
- Can’t you do something?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

271
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,687
- This can't be right.
- What?

272
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:41,209
The data on this volume has a comsat grid.

273
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:43,853
You see, these are addresses. CSG14877.

274
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:48,211
- That's an encoded coordinate.
- I don't know what you’re getting at.

275
00:25:48,293 --> 00:25:53,447
The only people who have files like these
have government security clearance.

276
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:58,402
- Why would my dad have that?
- I don't know.

277
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:08,689
- Why have I been kept waiting here like this?
- Sit down, please, Mr Warner.

278
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:10,889
- I have some information.
- Sit down!

279
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:30,643
What information do you have?

280
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:34,486
I'm not supposed to
talk to anybody about this,

281
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:37,246
but under the circumstances...

282
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:44,925
I am a consultant for the CIA.

283
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:52,404
There's the contact code for my liaison.
Call Langley, they'll verify.

284
00:26:59,373 --> 00:27:04,891
- Why didn’t you tell me this at the house?
- Come on. You know the drill.

285
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:09,728
I'm not supposed to talk to anyone
about this without clearance.

286
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:12,646
What's your l-3 protocol?

287
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:18,683
I was approached about five years ago
because of my international investment work.

288
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:24,367
They asked me if I'd like to
help my country and I said OK.

289
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:29,324
What do you do?

290
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:33,850
My corporation is used as a conduit

291
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:35,924
to pass information back and forth.

292
00:27:36,893 --> 00:27:40,010
- To whom?
- I don't know.

293
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,283
That is the truth.

294
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,365
Now you listen to me, Mr Almeida.

295
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,921
I am not an enemy of this country.

296
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:55,130
I am a patriot. I love my country.

297
00:27:56,573 --> 00:28:02,489
I don't know any Syed Ali, nor why there is
a record of me doing business with him.

298
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,651
Well,

299
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:08,123
if that's true then you have
nothing to worry about, do you?

300
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:11,808
But there is a connection
between your company and Syed Ali.

301
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:15,124
And I'm gonna find out what it is.

302
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:20,763
So in the meantime, sit tight.
I'm gonna check this out.

303
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:32,447
- Kimberly Bauer?
- Yes. We need to talk to Jack Bauer.

304
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:35,809
- He's not here. What's this about?
- His daughter is in custody.

305
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:38,361
It's important we speak to him immediately.

306
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:41,490
Hold on. OK.
Laurie, I need you to call downstairs...

307
00:28:41,573 --> 00:28:46,806
George, Bob Warner just told me
he does deliveries for the CIA.

308
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,009
CIA? Did you check it out?

309
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:55,009
No. I was about to call his liaison, but it
looks like he's got a legitimate contact code.

310
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,491
If that is the case, then Reza's lying to us.

311
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,041
I don't know. I pushed Reza pretty hard.

312
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:09,365
- I think he's telling the truth.
- We have to push harder than usual today.

313
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:12,445
So dig in and see what you can find out.
Let me know.

314
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:15,809
Mr Mason? It's the sheriff in Newhall.
They're holding Kim Bauer.

315
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:18,487
- Why?
- She's been charged with murder.

316
00:29:18,573 --> 00:29:23,693
Call Jack. This is George Mason.
Who am I speaking to?

317
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:31,889
Bauer.

318
00:29:31,973 --> 00:29:33,565
- It's Michelle.
- What?

319
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:38,606
I don't know how to say this.
We're on the line with the sheriff in Newhall.

320
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,048
- They're holding Kim.
- For what?

321
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:45,172
- She's being held on some criminal charges.
- What are you talking about?

322
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:47,483
She's on the line.
Should I patch her through?

323
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:52,044
- Yes. Get Mason on this.
- I'm on with the precinct. We're working on it.

324
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:56,285
There's a mistake. I need you to
straighten it out and get Kim out of LA.

325
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:58,409
- I'll take care of it.
- Daddy?

326
00:29:58,493 --> 00:30:01,610
- Kim, what happened?
- I was leaving the city, like you said.

327
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:07,086
I was with Megan and my boyfriend, Miguel.
And the CHP pulled us over for speeding.

328
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:12,286
They found a body in the trunk. Carla's body.

329
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:15,206
- Carla? The woman you work for?
- Yeah.

330
00:30:15,293 --> 00:30:20,003
We took her husband's car. He must've done
it this morning and put the body in the trunk.

331
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:24,166
- Oh, my God, help me.
- Just relax, we're gonna straighten this out.

332
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:28,371
He beat her up. That's why I needed
to take Megan. He was hurting her, too.

333
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:31,604
CTU will send someone.
They'll get you out of there now.

334
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:38,927
I don't want them to send someone else.
I want you to help me. Can’t you do that?

335
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,527
They think I killed Carla, Dad.

336
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:49,051
Dad, I need you here now.

337
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:51,442
Hold on a second. Michelle, are you there?

338
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,888
- Yeah.
- What is Faheen saying now?

339
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:57,522
Nina told him that US forces
have been sent to his village,

340
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:01,606
that they're rounding up his family.
Faheen called her a liar.

341
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,331
- Dad?
- Kim, hold on.

342
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:15,132
She just told Faheen that
she has the power to save them.

343
00:31:15,213 --> 00:31:18,046
- Dad?
- Kim, hold on. What are they saying now?

344
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:27,124
- We can't pick it up. The audio's too low.
- Are you there?

345
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:31,843
Yeah. George, I need you to help Kim. If you
have to supersede local authority, do it.

346
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,083
- Get her out of LA.
- Done.

347
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,928
Nina, what did he tell you?

348
00:31:41,293 --> 00:31:42,726
Everything.

349
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:46,806
- No! She just slit his throat!
- Hello?

350
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:49,361
I got her! Get him on the floor!

351
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:52,013
Get him on the floor!

352
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:56,324
Can't stop this.

353
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:58,726
Dad!

354
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:02,803
- You got him?
- We're losing him.

355
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,884
Son of a bitch!

356
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:09,086
- Jack...
- Secure her!

357
00:32:09,173 --> 00:32:13,371
I know where the bomb is.
Take the plane to San Diego.

358
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:18,049
I want civilian transport to Sao Paolo.
I'll tell you everything when we're down.

359
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,772
- George, are you getting this?
- Yeah, I am.

360
00:32:20,853 --> 00:32:22,730
- He's gone!
- This is your call.

361
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:25,725
We're out of time.
I don't like being dicked around.

362
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:28,452
We can bring her into CTU
and press her there.

363
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:31,730
- No. It'll take too long. Take her to San Diego.
- Fine.

364
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:35,566
- Tell the pilot to go to San Diego.
- You got it.

365
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:40,570
This is how it works. We land,
you tell me where the bomb is.

366
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:43,929
We're gonna hold you until
we get a result, you got that?

367
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:45,924
Got it.

368
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,844
Sir? I may have found something
in the Faheen recordings.

369
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,242
- What'd it say?
- A name.

370
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,563
Marko Khatami. Listen.

371
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,491
...Marko Khatami.

372
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:20,091
- Did you try cross-referencing?
- Yeah, he's connected to Syed Ali.

373
00:33:31,773 --> 00:33:34,003
- Mr Naiyeer?
- What?

374
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,089
- Who's Marko Khatami?!
- I have no idea!

375
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:39,403
Who is he?!

376
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:42,284
Get off!

377
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:46,490
- Somebody help me.
- You're crazy!

378
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:52,571
- You're mad!
- Just cool it! Cool down!

379
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,204
Let me go.

380
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:06,323
- Are we being released?
- No. You're being transferred.

381
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,643
- To where?
- I don't know.

382
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:13,568
Someone from CTU called. Said they were
coming to pick you up and take over the case.

383
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:17,282
What about Megan?
You brought her back here, right?

384
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:21,082
- What's gonna happen to her?
- It's none of your business.

385
00:34:21,173 --> 00:34:23,607
You can't take her back to LA!

386
00:34:29,493 --> 00:34:31,484
You listen to me.

387
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:35,042
I checked you out. Your father works for CTU.

388
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:39,206
You tell me, what did he tell you
would happen today in LA?

389
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:43,366
I can't say anything,
but you can't take Megan back.

390
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:45,842
Just tell me what's going on.

391
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,044
It's a nuclear bomb.

392
00:35:00,173 --> 00:35:04,132
They didn't say anything
because they don't want to start a panic.

393
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:14,165
OK.

394
00:35:30,413 --> 00:35:34,611
- Did you get anything else off the recording?
- It's 99%noise.

395
00:35:37,813 --> 00:35:41,408
- You OK?
- Just running on empty.

396
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:48,122
- Then why don’t you get something to eat?
- No, I'm fine.

397
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,204
Your neck's bleeding here.

398
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,923
It's somebody else's blood.

399
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:08,288
Michelle, why don’t you take a few minutes,
get cleaned up and changed. You'll feel better.

400
00:36:12,453 --> 00:36:14,364
Hey.

401
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:17,208
We're gonna survive this day.

402
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:20,444
All right?

403
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:25,125
Come on, get changed. Come on.

404
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:37,407
Mr President?

405
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:44,523
These are the updated guidelines Stanton
sent to local law enforcement and the FBI.

406
00:36:46,093 --> 00:36:51,042
- I understand Sherry ran into Stanton.
- I didn't hear that.

407
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:54,170
Has he said anything to you
about her being here?

408
00:36:56,413 --> 00:37:00,691
- I don't think he's very happy about it.
- Do you have a problem with her?

409
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:04,448
- I know you think she's useful to you.
- That's not what I asked.

410
00:37:05,253 --> 00:37:10,407
I welcome help wherever we can get it.
If you feel she performs a function here...

411
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:13,451
- Sir, you better come out here.
- What is it, Mike?

412
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:23,566
I've confirmed that there is an imminent threat
to national security and public safety.

413
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:27,123
While I cannot confirm the target
or nature of the attack,

414
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:33,402
it may come from Middle Eastern terrorists,
but terrorists in the US may also be involved.

415
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:34,846
How did he get out?

416
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:39,882
What I find troubling about this story
is our president knows about this threat

417
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:42,726
and isn't saying anything to the public.

418
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:46,123
- Who was controlling that room?
- Armus.

419
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:48,568
I want to see him now.

420
00:37:53,413 --> 00:37:57,611
It doesn't make sense. If my father
really does work for the government,

421
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:02,721
which is impossible to believe, wouldn't
he know if Reza did something illegal?

422
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,646
I'd think so,
especially if terrorism was involved.

423
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:08,327
If he knew about Reza, what does that mean?

424
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:13,965
My guess is your father was aware that Reza
was involved in some kind of illegal activity.

425
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:18,490
- He was monitoring him for some reason.
- But that doesn't make sense either.

426
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:22,885
My father would not let someone
he was investigating marry Marie.

427
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:26,522
He got upset if anyone made
any critical remark about Reza.

428
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:31,733
- He treated him like a son.
- I know Agent Almeida at CTU pretty well.

429
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:35,010
I'll give him a call
and see if we could find out...

430
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,724
Go! Go!

431
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:15,088
The Sunday before you killed my wife,

432
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:18,085
Teri and I went down to
the boardwalk in Venice.

433
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:25,409
Just watching all the rollerbladers
and musicians, laughing at the crazy people...

434
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:31,164
Just spending time together.

435
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:36,412
And Teri sees this snow-cone stand.

436
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,369
She giggles like a kid,

437
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:45,765
she takes off running and she
wants to get in line, she wants one.

438
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:49,050
I remember I was watching her...

439
00:39:50,293 --> 00:39:52,488
I couldn't help myself.

440
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:58,846
She was talking with an old lady in line
behind her. The two of them were laughing.

441
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:02,528
I remember thinking to myself
"How the hell does she do that?"

442
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:07,401
"How does she strike up
a conversation with an absolute stranger?"

443
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:12,442
And they just started laughing
like they'd been friends forever.

444
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,684
That's a gift.

445
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:23,804
I remember thinking "God,
I wish I could do that." But I can't.

446
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,324
That was Teri.

447
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,524
My wife.

448
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:37,451
That's what you took from this world.

449
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:43,444
That's what you took
from me and my daughter.

450
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:52,368
I just wanted you to know that.

451
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,323
We got a man down!

452
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:44,166
