1
00:00:14,213 --> 00:00:19,412
Mr President, the soldiers that attacked us
at the crash site, they were Americans.

2
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:21,927
Their commander is a Colonel Samuels.

3
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:25,130
Whoever attacked us
had access to our flight plan.

4
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:29,252
The only way they could have gotten
that information was from the inside.

5
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:35,090
Roger, tell me everything you know about
Colonel Ron Samuels from Fort Benning.

6
00:00:35,173 --> 00:00:37,084
I don't know anything about him.

7
00:00:37,173 --> 00:00:41,769
I just spoke to Roger Stanton. He's hiding
something from me. I'm going to arrest him.

8
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:44,242
I wanted to warn you.
They know about OPCOM.

9
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,130
- How?
- I told them.

10
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,602
This way I get him trusting me again.

11
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:52,768
If she would have known anything,
she would have told us. Kill her.

12
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,083
You don't have to kill me.

13
00:00:58,293 --> 00:01:00,682
Can you identify any words that they said?

14
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:03,128
Salat. It means "prayer".

15
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:05,681
I want a list of every mosque
in a 15-mile radius.

16
00:01:05,773 --> 00:01:10,324
I don't know what Syed Ali looks like.
I need you to identify him for me.

17
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:12,449
- Start a fire.
- You're crazy.

18
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:16,765
Crazier than going to LA where
a nuclear bomb might go off any minute?

19
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,686
There's been an accident.
We need an ambulance.

20
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,524
- Somebody hacked in.
- Who else had access to it?

21
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:32,331
- Marie?
- I didn't expect you to find anything.

22
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,531
- Hello.
- Marie, we have a problem.

23
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,085
What is it?

24
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:24,324
Basheer and Marko are dead.
Omar has the van now.

25
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:27,962
- What do you need me to do?
- They were supposed to pick up the trigger.

26
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:31,762
- Where is it?
- At the place where Marko worked.

27
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:35,163
In his locker. R & J Lumber in Burbank.

28
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:39,408
- Is there a combination?
- No. It requires a key.

29
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:45,648
You must do whatever you can to gain access
to this locker and bring the trigger to Omar.

30
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:47,928
You want me to do this?

31
00:03:48,013 --> 00:03:52,882
Marie, our mission depends on you now.
I'm counting on you.

32
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,204
I'll take care of it.

33
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:59,649
- I know you will.
- I'll see you there.

34
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:03,203
Marie, you should change your appearance.

35
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,284
OK.

36
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:34,804
At the mosque, all we need you
to do is identify Syed Ali.

37
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:37,885
Then we'll transfer you back to CTU.

38
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:41,568
- You OK?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:45,248
I know how difficult this must be for you.

40
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,528
Do you?

41
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:52,812
It would really help me out a lot
if you could tell me what's going on.

42
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,249
I'm not at liberty to tell you
any more than I already have.

43
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,451
Your people took the liberty
of arresting my father.

44
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:06,130
Syed Ali took the liberty of kidnapping me
and killing Paul Koplin in front of me.

45
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:10,286
I think I've earned the right
to know what's going on.

46
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:13,365
We believe Syed Ali
is at the centre of a terrorist attack

47
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:16,763
that's gonna take place in Los Angeles today.

48
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:19,447
What kind of terrorist attack?

49
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,444
A nuclear bomb.

50
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:34,771
You're the only person we know of
that's ever seen him.

51
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:37,413
We need you to identify him for us.

52
00:05:37,493 --> 00:05:43,250
The reason why I'm taking you with me now
is because we're running out of time.

53
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,842
- Jack Bauer.
- It's George.

54
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,926
Baker should be on site any minute. I got
a hard perimeter set up around the mosque.

55
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,811
I'll get back to you
as soon as we get there, George.

56
00:05:56,893 --> 00:06:00,966
Jack, there's something
I gotta talk to you about.

57
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,169
The Sheriffs Department at Newhall

58
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:06,450
were transporting Kim
and they got into an accident.

59
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,004
- What kind of accident?
- Don't worry. She didn't get hurt.

60
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:15,325
What the hell was she doing with them?
Your people were supposed to pick her up.

61
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:19,326
By the time our guys got to the station,
they'd already moved her.

62
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:22,007
I guess some local deputy
was trying to be a big shot,

63
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:24,368
claiming jurisdiction for a murder charge.

64
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:27,126
Where is she now?

65
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:29,488
She ran off after the accident.

66
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:34,283
Maybe she was trying to avoid the local
police or trying not to get brought back to LA.

67
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:38,924
Damm it, George. You told me you would
take care of this. You gave me your word.

68
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:42,050
Please, please find my daughter.

69
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:47,969
Jack, if it's any consolation,
she is outside the projected blast radius.

70
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,442
Just find her, George.

71
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,364
What was that about?

72
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:59,962
My daughter.

73
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,204
- Is she involved in this somehow?
- No.

74
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:07,770
She's in some kind of trouble, though.

75
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:13,606
I don't know yet. I hope not.

76
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,891
Yes, I'll tell him.

77
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:24,842
The consensus at Justice is that
the evidence against Stanton isn't actionable.

78
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:28,243
How much more do they need?
We've established a direct link

79
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,405
between him and the mercenaries
that shot down Bauer's plane.

80
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,565
That connection is still circumstantial.

81
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:38,009
He's been sabotaging our efforts
to find the bomb all day.

82
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:41,403
I cannot and I will not allow him
to continue heading up NSA.

83
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:45,327
I'm only saying it's going to take time
to get a judge to issue a warrant.

84
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:48,962
- We don't have time, Mike.
- Then don't worry about a pretext.

85
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:55,526
Take him out of play now and we'll deal
with the legal ramifications tomorrow.

86
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,044
Sherry was right.

87
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:03,012
My own people working against me.

88
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:10,806
Stanton won't be easy to break.
Not in the time we have.

89
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:18,688
We may need to expand the limits of how far
you've been willing to go in the past.

90
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,570
What are you saying, Mike?

91
00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:27,047
That you do whatever it takes to find out
what Stanton knows about this bomb.

92
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:31,362
I'm sorry. I can't disturb them right now.

93
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:35,002
David only found out about
Stanton because of me,

94
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:38,085
and it makes no sense
that he's keeping me out of the loop.

95
00:08:38,173 --> 00:08:40,482
I'm not sure what you think
I can do about that.

96
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:44,282
Why don’t you just tell me
what he's doing about Stanton?

97
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:47,888
He hasn't let me in on it yet,
so I don't know what's been decided.

98
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:50,931
Can’t you find out?

99
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:55,848
Mrs Palmer, if the president wanted input
from either of us, I'm sure he'd let us know.

100
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:59,767
Lynne, you took credit
for my work on David's speech,

101
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:02,242
and that was OK, I was fine with that.

102
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:08,203
But right now my only interest
is to help David get through this day.

103
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:11,330
I assume that's your priority as well?

104
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,802
I'll see what I can do.

105
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,844
- Miss Warner.
- She stays with me.

106
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:40,448
We're good to go. I've got 30 men
ready to move on your order.

107
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:45,448
- How many people in the mosque?
- 100 to 125, divided into target groups of 10.

108
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,489
- We're not going in, not yet.
- Sir?

109
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:53,921
We go in hot and it'll give Syed Ali time to
take his own life before Kate can identify him.

110
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:57,767
- What's the alternative?
- We wait for the prayer service to end.

111
00:09:57,853 --> 00:10:01,892
He comes out, Kate identifies him,
then we'll take him out surgically.

112
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:05,852
- Fast and alive. He's no good to us dead.
- What if someone spots us first?

113
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:09,482
They phone Ali, we lose our surprise.
Assuming he's even inside.

114
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:12,724
We're working on a weak hunch.
He might be at some other mosque.

115
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:16,249
We're gonna have to take that chance.
We're waiting this out.

116
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,406
I could go in. See if he's inside.

117
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:27,164
I'll wear a hijab, hide my face.

118
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,369
He wouldn't see me.

119
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:34,087
I don't feel comfortable
putting you in that kind of a position.

120
00:10:34,173 --> 00:10:37,848
From what you’ve told me,
we're all in a pretty bad position.

121
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:41,972
If I could help, I'd really like the chance.

122
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:51,883
- You really think you can do this?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:59,890
Get me the schematics to the mosque.
I'll look at the floor plan.

124
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:34,929
- Everything's in place, Mr President.
- Do it.

125
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,004
Let's move.

126
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,172
What's going on, Mike?

127
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:06,087
Mr Stanton, by order of the president,
I'm placing you under arrest

128
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:10,485
for conspiracy to commit treason
against the United States of America.

129
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:13,690
What the hell are you talking about?

130
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:18,209
Hands off.

131
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,093
I demand to speak to the president.

132
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:25,529
I'm sure you'll get your chance, sir. Let's go.

133
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:05,964
Come in.

134
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:12,606
Sir, Mrs Palmer's been trying
to reach you for the last half-hour.

135
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,843
Yes, I know.

136
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:18,209
She's on line seven waiting right now.

137
00:13:18,293 --> 00:13:22,366
- I can put her off if you'd like.
- No, I'll take it.

138
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:26,012
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:41,202
- Yes, Sherry. What is it?
- David, thank God.

140
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:45,764
I was just wondering
what you’d decided to do about Roger.

141
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:48,367
I'm having him questioned.

142
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,604
Has he admitted to ordering
Jack Bauer's plane shot down?

143
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:52,728
Not yet.

144
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:55,327
Then we don't know
any more than we did an hour ago.

145
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:57,404
What is your point, Sherry?

146
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:01,372
My point is I think you should have waited
for something more concrete.

147
00:14:01,453 --> 00:14:06,129
I don't run my decisions past you,
Sherry, not any more.

148
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:10,923
A large part of the intelligence you're basing
your decisions on came from me.

149
00:14:11,013 --> 00:14:14,130
I think I've earned a seat at the table here.

150
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:17,569
You're not a member of my staff.
You're not a government employee.

151
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:21,123
- And you're not my wife.
- That was your decision, not mine.

152
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:26,606
Sherry, whatever role you're playing
here today is on my terms, my timetable.

153
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:30,402
Continue doing what you’re doing.
I'll speak to you soon.

154
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,484
But...

155
00:14:42,493 --> 00:14:45,883
We need one person that
we can coordinate with, not three.

156
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,328
Yeah, we got that sorted out.

157
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:53,282
You have him contact Jack Bauer.
He's running point for us.

158
00:14:55,453 --> 00:14:56,442
Hey.

159
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:04,484
FBI. They want a representative at the
mosque, but they've got their wires crossed.

160
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:07,485
Listen, what we were talking about before...

161
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,772
Yeah, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
put you on the spot like that.

162
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:17,442
No, actually, I'm glad you did.

163
00:15:18,933 --> 00:15:21,845
- You are?
- Yeah.

164
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:26,961
There's been something hanging
between us since you started here.

165
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,487
Yeah. Yeah, there has.

166
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:38,003
I made a decision a while ago to try to keep
personal and professional stuff separate.

167
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:40,084
But now I...

168
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:45,843
Michelle Dessler.

169
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:49,528
- Tell Almeida Warner's getting agitated.
- OK, I'll tell him.

170
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,411
- There's a problem in room seven.
- Bob Warner?

171
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,882
Yeah, he's getting violent.

172
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,487
Get your hands off of me!

173
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:05,564
You can't keep me here!

174
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,483
- What's going on?
- He asked for water.

175
00:16:09,573 --> 00:16:12,645
- He bolted out the door.
- Why can't I see my lawyer?

176
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,167
Sit him down. Calm down, Mr Warner!

177
00:16:15,253 --> 00:16:19,132
I won't calm down.
I want someone to start listening to me.

178
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,852
I need you to calm down!

179
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,572
Whatever Reza told you, he's lying.

180
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:27,884
You are not helping your case here.
You understand me?

181
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:34,048
You wanna have a conversation, or do you
want me to lock you up for the night?

182
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:40,924
Where are my daughters?

183
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:44,722
Marie left here five minutes
after Reza was taken to your office.

184
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:46,804
What about Kate?

185
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:53,043
What? Has something happened to Kate?

186
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,363
She's with one of our agents.

187
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,490
One of your agents? Why?

188
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:01,925
You're gonna have to trust us, Mr Warner.

189
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:04,971
She's gonna be fine, all right?

190
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:06,964
Trust?

191
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:11,644
This is where the men pray,
in front, closest to the entrance.

192
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:16,523
You walk by them as you pass through here
down to the women's prayer area in the back.

193
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:20,208
You've got one shot. Once you pass them,
their backs'll be to you.

194
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:22,363
Get a clean look at the whole room.

195
00:17:22,453 --> 00:17:28,642
If you spot Ali, go past the women's prayer
area here, up here to this fire-exit door.

196
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:33,249
We'll disable the alarm while you're inside.
We'll be waiting for you in the alley.

197
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,403
- Are you clear?
- Yeah.

198
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:40,408
- Are your men in place?
- Yeah.

199
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,484
OK. Let's go.

200
00:17:52,293 --> 00:17:54,761
Kate, you sure about this?

201
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,052
Yeah.

202
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,404
OK. Take this.

203
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:05,523
If Ali sees you, or you feel like
you're in danger, press that.

204
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:12,212
It'll send a distress signal to my walkie-talkie
and we'll be in immediately.

205
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,284
Be careful.

206
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,803
She's in.

207
00:18:55,333 --> 00:19:01,203
- The prayers have already begun.
- I'm sorry I'm late. There was traffic.

208
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:04,126
- Have you prayed with us before?
- Yes.

209
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:07,410
It's been a while, though. I've been away.

210
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:38,005
It's Jack. You're all right.

211
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:41,290
He's in there. Syed Ali. He's in there.

212
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:56,483
Stanton's last call was to Virginia.

213
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:59,371
He wasn't on long enough
to get a complete number,

214
00:20:59,453 --> 00:21:02,923
but we know it's a Langley prefix.

215
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:05,167
CIA.

216
00:21:07,253 --> 00:21:09,244
Sergeant.

217
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:20,924
Sit down.

218
00:21:29,613 --> 00:21:32,002
We have it all, Roger.

219
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:38,646
You reactivated OPCOM
with an eyes-only order.

220
00:21:39,413 --> 00:21:45,488
You used it to communicate with Colonel
Samuels as recently as two hours ago.

221
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:52,250
And we've connected Samuels directly to
the mercenaries that tried to kill Jack Bauer.

222
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:58,522
I don't know, Roger. It almost seems
as if you want this bomb to go off today.

223
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:07,372
But I'll tell you this: if people die,
Roger, you'll be executed.

224
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:15,803
And even if we find the bomb in time, you'll
still get life without the possibility of parole.

225
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:22,331
But all I want... is to find the bomb in time.

226
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:28,687
That's why I have a deal for you.

227
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:35,766
You tell me everything -
I mean everything - and I'll bury this.

228
00:22:37,813 --> 00:22:40,691
You resign, due to health reasons.

229
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,248
You'll collect your pension.

230
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:49,327
You'll retire in a nice house,
somewhere in the country.

231
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:52,689
You'll be given a written grant of immunity.

232
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:58,412
And nobody will ever know
anything about this.

233
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,644
Do we have a deal?

234
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:22,042
I don't know what
you're talking about, Mr President.

235
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:25,648
I've done nothing wrong.

236
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:29,612
I don't know any more
about the bomb than you do.

237
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,652
I want you to cover
these two back exits from the alley.

238
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:52,486
We're looking for
a Middle Eastern man, late 30s.

239
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:55,292
Black shirt, silver buttons, black pants.

240
00:23:55,373 --> 00:23:57,807
Miss Warner and I will
cover the main entrance.

241
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:01,966
As soon as the crowd starts
to leave the building, she'll identify Ali.

242
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:04,487
I'll inform Agent Baker. He will give the go.

243
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:09,124
No one moves before that happens.
If you fire your weapon, shoot to wound only.

244
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:12,285
We're looking at 19 minutes
before the service is over.

245
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,888
Is everybody clear?
We cannot afford any mistakes here.

246
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:17,964
OK. Let's go.

247
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:39,086
- There you are, sir.
- Thank you.

248
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:52,568
Control the focus with the centre dial here.

249
00:25:02,693 --> 00:25:09,610
What you did for us in the mosque, I thought
it was really courageous. Thank you.

250
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:13,129
You're kidding me. I'm still shaking.

251
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:15,443
You did great.

252
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,923
The prayer service lets out in 17 minutes.

253
00:27:57,973 --> 00:28:01,522
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Thanks for keeping this discreet.

254
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,331
Of course.

255
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:06,166
Ted, how long have you been
with the Secret Service?

256
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:08,448
Five and a half years, sir.

257
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:12,970
I understand you have
a background in Special Ops.

258
00:28:13,053 --> 00:28:17,251
Green Berets, sir.
Unit seven out of Fort Myers, '87.

259
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:21,042
- Ever put your training to use?
- The Gulf, sir.

260
00:28:21,133 --> 00:28:23,852
Anywhere else?

261
00:28:23,933 --> 00:28:27,005
There were some other... covert ops.

262
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:32,731
Under the directorate at the CIA?

263
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:39,089
It's all right, Ted. I'm not on a witch-hunt here.

264
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:42,483
But I do need you to answer the question.

265
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:45,531
Yes, sir. For the CIA.

266
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:51,367
Good. You understand
the gravity of today's situation?

267
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:53,603
Of course, sir.

268
00:28:53,693 --> 00:28:58,528
I guess you've heard that Roger Stanton's
no longer functioning as the head of NSA.

269
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:03,368
- I heard he was arrested.
- He was, under my authority.

270
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:10,529
What I'm about to ask you to do falls outside
the parameters of your Secret Service charge.

271
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:15,448
You won't be able to tell anyone
about this without my direct consent.

272
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:18,047
Are you still with me, Ted?

273
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,249
What would you like me to do, sir?

274
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:26,003
Extract information from Roger Stanton.

275
00:29:27,973 --> 00:29:29,565
I see.

276
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:34,602
If he resists, how far am I permitted to go?

277
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:38,563
Whatever you need to do.

278
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:43,924
Yes, sir.

279
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:57,083
Tony. Richards and Maccabee were shot.
So was Reza Naiyeer. They're all dead.

280
00:29:57,173 --> 00:29:59,084
- What?
- A janitor found their bodies.

281
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,733
I just got off the phone with the LAPD.

282
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:03,804
Are there any suspects?

283
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:08,727
Last time I talked to Maccabee,
she said that Marie Warner had just got there.

284
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:11,088
She wanted to talk to Reza.

285
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:14,131
Marie Warner?
She was there during the shootings?

286
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:20,209
Security cameras show she was the only one
to leave the building in the last 40 minutes.

287
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:32,725
- Bauer.
- It's Tony.

288
00:30:32,813 --> 00:30:37,284
- How's it going over there?
- We got about 10 minutes.

289
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:40,126
- Are you still with Kate Warner?
- Yes, I am.

290
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:44,252
I got some information, but you need
to keep this conversation one-sided.

291
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,722
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

292
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:54,649
Richards and Maccabee have been
shot and killed. So was Reza Naiyeer.

293
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,132
Uh-huh.

294
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:59,842
We have strong evidence
that Marie Warner was the shooter.

295
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:04,089
Yeah, I understand.

296
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:10,282
Has Kate Warner been contacted
by anybody in the last half-hour?

297
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,933
No, she's been with me the entire time.

298
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:14,002
Jack,

299
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,687
I think you have to
treat her as an unknown.

300
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,845
For all we know,
she's working with her sister.

301
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:24,529
I don't think so. Ali's men would've
killed her if we hadn't shown up.

302
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:28,492
If Kate's sister's part of this,
or if she's one of the terrorists,

303
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:31,485
I really don't think Kate knows about it.

304
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:36,044
Jack, that's your call.
I just wanted to give you the information.

305
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,566
OK, thanks.

306
00:31:40,093 --> 00:31:42,084
Was that your office?

307
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:45,204
Yeah.

308
00:31:45,293 --> 00:31:48,922
- Are they still holding my dad?
- Yes, your dad's safe.

309
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:52,528
What about my sister? Is she OK?
Has anyone heard from her?

310
00:31:52,613 --> 00:31:54,490
I don't think so.

311
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:30,688
Excuse me. Bill told me
you're the guy in charge.

312
00:32:30,773 --> 00:32:32,206
I'm the foreman.

313
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:36,571
I need a favour. I need to get something
out of my boyfriend's locker.

314
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:39,645
- Your boyfriend?
- Marko Ashami.

315
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:44,606
- You go out with Marko?
- I did. We got into a fight last night.

316
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:48,686
It's a long story, but the point of it is
we're not going out any more.

317
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:52,243
- That why he didn't show up for work today?
- I guess.

318
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,722
It was a pretty bad fight.

319
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:59,926
And he's got something
in his locker that belongs to me.

320
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:03,892
I can't go opening people's lockers.
You'll have to work it out with Marko.

321
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:09,001
I don't know how well you know Marko, but if
I could've worked it out, I wouldn't be asking.

322
00:33:09,093 --> 00:33:11,766
Please. It's really important.

323
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:15,202
I'm sorry. I can't.

324
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,684
Can't or won't?

325
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:27,326
I'd really show my appreciation.

326
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:32,729
And I'd show it to you first.

327
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,449
What do you mean?

328
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:41,843
- Is this your office?
- Yeah.

329
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:44,049
Does it have a lock?

330
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:17,848
Time is of the essence, Mr Stanton.
Intensity and duration of the electrical current

331
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:22,961
will increase substantially
each time I repeat a question.

332
00:34:23,053 --> 00:34:25,442
Yes, I know the drill, Agent Simmons.

333
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:30,323
What is your agenda, Mr Stanton,
and who else is involved?

334
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:51,889
Who else knew about the bomb, Mr Stanton?
Who have you been working with?

335
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:56,249
I don't know anything about the bomb.

336
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:03,403
Who are you working with, Mr Stanton?

337
00:35:11,213 --> 00:35:14,888
Please, Mr Almeida, just tell me
what is going on with my daughter Kate.

338
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:20,969
- I already told you, Mr Warner. She's fine.
- What is she doing with one of your agents?

339
00:35:24,013 --> 00:35:26,402
Reza Naiyeer is dead.

340
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,884
Oh, God.

341
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:38,367
We just found out. He and two of our agents
were shot and killed at your office.

342
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,691
What about Marie? Is she OK?

343
00:35:51,053 --> 00:35:53,442
Please tell me Marie is OK.

344
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:57,689
Look...

345
00:35:57,773 --> 00:36:01,971
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Mr Warner,

346
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:05,728
but we believe Marie committed the murders.

347
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:17,886
It's a trick. I know it's a trick.
You're trying to trick me.

348
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:32,605
Here they come.

349
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:36,288
All teams, be alert. They're coming out now.

350
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,122
- Can you see him yet?
- No.

351
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:50,329
- Wait a minute.
- Is that him?

352
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:54,048
It could be the one behind those three men.

353
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,806
Just take your time, Kate. Be sure.

354
00:36:57,573 --> 00:36:59,962
I can't see his face.

355
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,884
No, it's not him.

356
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,208
I don't see him. I don't see him!

357
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:26,683
Keep looking. He's gotta be in the crowd.

358
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:33,050
There's the greeter.
Normally he'd be the last one out.

359
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,522
Damm it. Anything on the back exits?

360
00:37:35,613 --> 00:37:38,525
- Negative. No one's gone in or out.
- Damm it!

361
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:41,525
Kate, you would tell me
if you saw him, right?

362
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:44,491
Of course I would. What do you mean?

363
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:50,205
Why are you looking at me like that,
as if I'm suspicious? I didn't see him!

364
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:54,605
Just relax. He must have made you
when you were inside the mosque.

365
00:37:54,693 --> 00:38:00,643
Agent Baker, he didn't come outside.
Give the word to go. Secure the building.

366
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:03,645
Open the gate.

367
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,724
Go! Go!

368
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:12,164
- What's going on?
- Federal agent. I've got a warrant.

369
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:21,491
- I am the imam here. What's going on?
- Calm down, sir. We're federal agents.

370
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:25,452
We received positive identification
of an international terrorist here.

371
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:28,411
- We need to find him now.
- Do you have a search warrant?

372
00:38:28,493 --> 00:38:30,484
Yes, I do, sir.

373
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:35,369
Get back here. Keep her against the wall.

374
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:38,047
- Can you see anything?
- Clear.

375
00:38:44,413 --> 00:38:46,404
Damm it!

376
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:57,281
Put the blanket on him!

377
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:13,369
The clothes match the description.

378
00:39:13,453 --> 00:39:16,843
Teams A and B maintain positions.
We've got Ali.

379
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:20,247
- He's dead, Jack.
- Son of a bitch!

380
00:39:21,613 --> 00:39:24,002
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

381
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:29,244
- CTU.
- This is Jack Bauer. Get Mason on the line.

382
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,324
Ali has killed himself.

383
00:39:55,213 --> 00:39:57,886
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

384
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:04,850
These clothes don't belong to this man.

385
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:08,608
Look at the pants.
They're three inches too short.

386
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:14,802
Maintain secure exits. Ali is still in the
building. Repeat: Ali is still in the building.

387
00:40:29,773 --> 00:40:33,971
