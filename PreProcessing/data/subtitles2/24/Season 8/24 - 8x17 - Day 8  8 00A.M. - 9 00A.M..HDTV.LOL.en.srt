1
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:16,081
Can I assume there is no change

2
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:18,106
in the status
of President Hassan?

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,301
I'm afraid not.

4
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,599
Then he is still being
held by terrorists.

5
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,764
If Hassan dies,

6
00:00:23,832 --> 00:00:25,097
there is no treaty.

7
00:00:25,163 --> 00:00:26,429
If I didn't know better,

8
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:28,427
I'd think you were hoping
for that to happen.

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,625
Jack thinks that someone inside
of CTU is working

10
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:31,859
for the terrorists.

11
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:34,224
Jack recovered Tarin's
cell phone from the crash.

12
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:35,758
If someone did call
and tip him off,

13
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,358
we can get the number off
the memory.

14
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,089
It's Dana's phone.

15
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:40,855
I spoke to Hastings.

16
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:42,619
He cleared me through.

17
00:00:44,452 --> 00:00:45,348
Stay where you are

18
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,947
and keep your hands
where I can...

19
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,947
She just entered
the parking garage.

20
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:57,180
The only reason you've got
any leverage right now is

21
00:00:57,248 --> 00:00:58,848
because President Hassan
is alive.

22
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:00,815
So stop screwing with me!

23
00:01:00,883 --> 00:01:03,313
They are gonna force him
to make a statement,

24
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:05,579
and then they're going
to kill him.

25
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:07,708
Just read the statement,
no more.

26
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:11,406
You will renounce
the peace agreement.

27
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:13,641
I will never do that.

28
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,643
He's stronger than we thought.

29
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,074
Bury him.

30
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,039
I will tell the world
of his crimes.

31
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:20,873
This man is not our president!

32
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,274
He's an arrogant...

33
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:23,808
Jack, looks like Samir's
grabbed him.

34
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,975
We need you to get in there
right now!

35
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,540
I have a visual on Hassan.

36
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:28,975
Ready to engage.

37
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,843
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:04,776
Yes?

39
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:05,876
Excuse me, ma'am.

40
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:07,777
I have Jack Bauer
on the line for you.

41
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,444
Put him through.

42
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,679
Jack...

43
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,947
Madam President,
I don't know what to say

44
00:02:15,014 --> 00:02:17,415
except that I'm sorry.

45
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:19,349
I trust there was nothing

46
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:21,684
you and your team
could have done differently.

47
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:23,618
No, ma'am.

48
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,820
President Hassan was dead
before we even got there.

49
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,187
Then you don't owe me
an apology.

50
00:02:30,255 --> 00:02:32,488
I failed you, ma'am.

51
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:35,690
It was Hassan's choice
to surrender himself

52
00:02:35,757 --> 00:02:37,457
in order to save
American lives.

53
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,592
It was out of your hands.

54
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,260
Don't put this responsibility
on yourself.

55
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:47,495
Madam President, you need to
keep this peace agreement alive.

56
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,229
There can't be any agreement

57
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:51,597
when the IRK is
without a leader, Jack.

58
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:54,465
The hardliners there will take
advantage of the vacuum

59
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:56,967
and-and reverse all the progress
we made with Hassan.

60
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,601
I'm gonna have
to address the delegates

61
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:02,035
in a few minutes
and announce the dissolution

62
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:04,537
of the peace summit,
and, and formally release them.

63
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:06,571
Ma'am, if you give up,
it means they win.

64
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,873
I don't see another choice,
Jack.

65
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,474
I-I wish to God I did.

66
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:14,909
Good-bye, Jack.

67
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,148
What's his condition?

68
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:27,350
He took a round to the shoulder,
another through the abdomen,

69
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,717
but it exited clean.

70
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:30,752
BP looks steady.
Look, we need this guy for questioning.

71
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,920
Is he going to make it or not?
Doesn't look like

72
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:34,688
any vitals were hit.
He'll live. All right.

73
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,456
We'll transport him back to CTU.

74
00:03:36,524 --> 00:03:38,524
Medical will take him for now.

75
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,229
Jack.

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,332
President Taylor is going
to formally announce

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,832
the end of the
peace conference.

78
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:33,701
Jack, you did everything
you could.

79
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:35,769
It wasn't enough.

80
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:39,339
We should get back to CTU.

81
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:41,074
Why?

82
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:42,508
The fuel rods
have been recovered.

83
00:04:42,609 --> 00:04:44,177
The peace conference is over.

84
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:47,513
Everybody who was responsible
is either dead or in custody.

85
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:53,619
Cole.

86
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:56,854
What's the status on Samir?

87
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,289
He's still unconscious,
but the EMTs say he'll make it.

88
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:01,191
Okay, good.
I want you to stay with him.

89
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,392
I'm handing over
complete authority

90
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,127
and responsibility
for his transport to you.

91
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:05,595
Are you heading back to CTU?

92
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,764
No.

93
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:08,433
We're going home. We're done.

94
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,534
Hastings is still
probably going to want

95
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,902
to debrief both of you.

96
00:05:11,969 --> 00:05:13,903
I'm sure he will.
He knows how to find me.

97
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:16,906
I'm sorry it ended up
like this, Jack.

98
00:05:16,974 --> 00:05:19,242
Me, too.

99
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,876
You're a good agent, Cole.

100
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,511
I wouldn't be standing here
without you.

101
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:23,745
Thank you.

102
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,013
I hope everything works out.

103
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:26,815
I'll pack my kit up downstairs.

104
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:36,589
Madam President.

105
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:40,459
The delegates are assembled
in the lounge, as you requested.

106
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:44,595
Let's get this over with.

107
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:49,632
Discontinue the peace summit that was to be

108
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,400
a cornerstone
of her administration.

109
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:54,506
President Hassan apparently
had been kidnapped earlier,

110
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:55,943
and then taken to...

111
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:57,946
Jamot.

112
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,814
On behalf of my country,

113
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:03,314
you have our deepest sympathy
for this terrible tragedy.

114
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,115
Though, on a personal level,

115
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:07,584
I imagine you
have mixed feelings right now.

116
00:06:07,652 --> 00:06:09,252
Beg your pardon?

117
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,121
Hassan had you arrested
without cause

118
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:12,855
during his purge
of suspected enemies.

119
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:15,725
Allowed you to be
brutally interrogated.

120
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,259
I would think you
have little love for the man.

121
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:21,028
President Hassan
was under tremendous duress,

122
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,563
and he lost his way,

123
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:25,532
but I never stopped believing
in what he stood for.

124
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,533
Of course.

125
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:27,901
I meant no offense.

126
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,468
I'm sure you didn't.

127
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:31,035
Excuse me.

128
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:33,704
While we have not learned
the identity

129
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,306
of the terrorist in the video...

130
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:40,209
President Taylor.

131
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:42,145
Minister Jamot.

132
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,947
If you can spare a few moments,
I need to speak with you.

133
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:46,849
I will be happy
to sit down with you

134
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,983
after I have addressed
the other delegations.

135
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,285
I know you're intending
to announce

136
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,719
the end of the peace summit,

137
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,988
but there may be a way
to prevent that from happening.

138
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,622
Before you do anything,

139
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,024
I need you to hear
what I have to say.

140
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,260
All right.

141
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,462
Ma'am, what about the delegates?

142
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,763
Just... just give me a moment.

143
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,498
Let's go in here.

144
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:08,197
Please.

145
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,535
Federal agents mounted
an operation

146
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,971
to rescue President Hassan
from the terrorists

147
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:16,206
that commenced
approximately 30 minutes ago.

148
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:17,841
Yes?

149
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:21,677
Samir's men were all dead,
thanks to the Americans.

150
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:27,147
Samir was the only one left,
but I took care of him.

151
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:28,816
So, there's no connection to us?

152
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,050
We're in the clear?

153
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,885
Maybe not.

154
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:35,522
There was a woman there
who might have recognized me.

155
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,990
What woman?

156
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:40,060
She may be CTU...
I'm not sure... but...

157
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,095
I've seen her face before.

158
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,163
Where?

159
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:45,298
Six years ago,
when we were using

160
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,700
that mobster,
Vladimir Laitanan,

161
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:50,670
to smuggle military weapons
out of the country,

162
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,338
she was with him.

163
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,340
Are you sure it was her?

164
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,976
I don't forget faces.

165
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,444
Where is she now?

166
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,879
In a taxicab,

167
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,712
just ahead of me,
with Jack Bauer.

168
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,546
Bauer?

169
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,548
Are they going to CTU?

170
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:09,549
I don't think so, no.

171
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:12,084
Then, it seems unlikely
she recognized you.

172
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:15,454
Better not to take the chance.

173
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:18,190
I'll take out Bauer, too,
while I'm at it.

174
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:20,559
The Americans believe the IRK

175
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:22,695
were solely behind
the recent attacks.

176
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,931
Killing Bauer and this woman
would only alert them

177
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:26,835
to the fact that others
were involved.

178
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,606
How long before they
discover that it was us?

179
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:31,540
It will take even less time

180
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:33,774
if this woman remembers me.

181
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,511
What are my orders?

182
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:41,614
Continue to follow them...
keep them in sight...

183
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,815
And I'll get back to you.

184
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:12,735
I don't have the words

185
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,138
to tell you and Kayla
how sorry I am.

186
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,811
I know you did everything
in your power.

187
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:26,115
Jamot, I wasn't aware
that you were here.

188
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:29,150
I only arrived a short time ago.

189
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,185
I want you to know that,

190
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:33,420
in our last few hours together,

191
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,555
Omar expressed
his regrets to me,

192
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,691
not the least of which
was his treatment of you.

193
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:41,827
I appreciate that.

194
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:45,564
Mrs. Hassan, I realize
our timing is intrusive,

195
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:48,600
but there's something we need
to discuss privately.

196
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,203
Did you find him,
President Taylor?

197
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:52,138
The man who killed my father?

198
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,772
Samir Mehran.

199
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,240
Yes.

200
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,942
He was badly wounded,
but he'll live to stand trial.

201
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,013
And, believe me, he will pay
dearly for what he's done.

202
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,481
Kayla, darling,

203
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,083
I need to speak
with President Taylor alone.

204
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,151
Give us a few minutes.

205
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,361
What is it that you wish
to talk to me about?

206
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:22,529
Mrs. Hassan, as you know,

207
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,296
for almost a year,
your husband and I

208
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,998
worked to make this
peace agreement a reality.

209
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:29,800
Now, in that time,
I saw the kind

210
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:31,768
of leader he was.

211
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:33,403
He managed
against difficult odds

212
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,271
to bring a fractious
and contentious

213
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,038
parliament together.

214
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,806
But, now that he's gone,

215
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:41,875
your country is going
to be thrown into turmoil.

216
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:44,310
I am aware of the challenges
that we are facing.

217
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,645
Why are you telling me this?

218
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,413
Clearly, someone needs
to take the reigns

219
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,583
of the IRK government.

220
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,958
Someone who believes
in the same ideals

221
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:56,164
and principles as Omar Hassan,

222
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,433
and who shares his strength.

223
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,934
Minister Jamot

224
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,669
believes that that person

225
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:03,604
should be you.

226
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,806
What?!

227
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,007
I'm not the only one
who believes it.

228
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:09,208
I've spoken to our delegation,

229
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:10,910
as well as
with the other members

230
00:11:10,977 --> 00:11:12,144
of our cabinet back home.

231
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:14,612
You represent our best.

232
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,247
Our only real chance

233
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:17,448
to preserve our government

234
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:19,484
and your husband's agenda.

235
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:21,385
You are out of your mind!

236
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,988
I am no politician.

237
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:26,024
But you are a martyr's wife.

238
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:28,193
And history has proven that

239
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,194
to be something
far more powerful.

240
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:32,796
You have always been popular
with the people.

241
00:11:32,864 --> 00:11:35,532
The vast majority
of them want peace.

242
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,434
They will rally around you.

243
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:39,570
The Council of Guardian
will have no choice

244
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:42,639
but to recognize you
as successor to the presidency.

245
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,708
But I have a choice.

246
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:47,045
You assume too much of me,

247
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:49,180
Jamot.

248
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:58,422
I realize that
this is a lot to consider,

249
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,925
especially now while
you're grieving,

250
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:05,262
but without a unifying figure
to hold your country together,

251
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:09,732
everything your husband
worked for will be for nothing.

252
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:20,309
President Taylor, my marriage
to Omar was far from perfect.

253
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:24,379
We had many problems
for a very long time.

254
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:27,414
I know only too well

255
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:29,449
how difficult it is
for a marriage

256
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:32,551
to survive a life in politics.

257
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,987
But through it all,
I never stopped loving him.

258
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,190
Or sharing his desire

259
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,726
for better relations
with the West.

260
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,635
If it is the will of my people

261
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,805
and of my government,

262
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:57,109
I will take my husband's place
at the peace conference.

263
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,345
It will be my honor
to stand with you.

264
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,380
We'll make the announcement
together

265
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,384
from the United Nations.

266
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,093
Mrs. Hassan,

267
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,963
thank you.

268
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,609
She's going to do it.

269
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,578
Oh, that's incredible
news, Madam President.

270
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:26,646
I want every delegate
contacted personally.

271
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:29,115
Tell them to cancel any plans
to leave the country.

272
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,817
We are returning to the UN.

273
00:13:30,884 --> 00:13:31,985
Yes, ma'am.

274
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:33,219
I'll also call CTU

275
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:34,654
and implement those changes
we discussed

276
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,089
if I still have
your permission.

277
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:37,690
That's your decision.

278
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:39,258
Do what you think is best.

279
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,726
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:45,865
Where's Bauer?

281
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,966
Jack left the scene,
took Renee with him.

282
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,635
Hassan's death hit him
pretty hard.

283
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:52,004
Samir's been taken to Medical
to get patched up.

284
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,305
Is he conscious?
Barely.

285
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,440
You let me know the second
he's ready for questioning.

286
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:56,642
All right.

287
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,909
Put him through.

288
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:01,012
CTU. O'Brian.

289
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,747
This is Tim Woods
with Homeland Security.

290
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:04,983
Hold on. I'll put you through
to Mr. Hastings.

291
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,686
Oh, no. Actually, I'm calling
to speak with you, Ms. O'Brian.

292
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:09,388
Me? Are you sure?

293
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:10,990
I know this is
an unusual circumstance,

294
00:14:11,057 --> 00:14:12,591
so I'll get straight
to the point.

295
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:13,959
President Taylor
and the foreign dignitaries

296
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:15,527
are returning to the UN shortly

297
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:17,095
where the president
will announce her intent

298
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:19,330
to move forward with the signing
of the peace agreement.

299
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:20,632
Well, excuse me,

300
00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:22,934
but how can she do that
without President Hassan?

301
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:24,869
I'm not at liberty
to say just yet,

302
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,071
but our immediate concern
is whether CTU is capable

303
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,673
of handling security
for the rest of the process.

304
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,775
It's already been infiltrated
by an enemy agent,

305
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:33,210
compromised more
than once today.

306
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,778
<i>We cannot have
any more mistakes.</i>

307
00:14:34,846 --> 00:14:36,079
Are you suggesting

308
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:38,148
I'm responsible
for those mistakes?

309
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:39,582
On the contrary.

310
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,417
I reviewed the hourly reports,

311
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:43,486
and from what I see,
you've made some astute calls,

312
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:45,321
and have proven
to be very resourceful

313
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,489
throughout this crisis.

314
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:48,224
Okay.

315
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,859
So why are you calling me?

316
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:52,895
I'm relieving Brian Hastings
of his post

317
00:14:52,963 --> 00:14:54,897
effective immediately.

318
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:56,198
We're now in the process

319
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,033
of vetting suitable candidates
to replace him,

320
00:14:58,101 --> 00:15:01,236
but until we find someone,
you'll have provisional command.

321
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:04,706
You're... You're putting me
in charge?

322
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:06,542
For the time being.

323
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,544
I know your record
at CTU's L.A. branch,

324
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,546
and how important you were
during the Sangala crisis.

325
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:11,680
There's nobody in that building

326
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,348
that has more experience
than you do.

327
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,650
Sir, you're making a mistake.

328
00:15:14,717 --> 00:15:15,951
What happened
with President Hassan,

329
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,152
and everything else...

330
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,854
It wasn't Mr. Hastings' fault.

331
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:21,256
Chloe, I don't have time
to debate this with you.

332
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:22,925
Division feels
you are the most qualified

333
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:24,393
to step in, and I agree.

334
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,560
My decision's made.

335
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,396
Now accept it,
and let's move on.

336
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,031
Does Mr. Hastings know?

337
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:31,266
Division's informing him
as we speak.

338
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:34,002
Just try to make the transition

339
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,371
as quick and painless
as possible.

340
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:36,539
I'll be in touch

341
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,774
as soon as the president arrives
at the UN.

342
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,776
Yes, sir.

343
00:15:58,297 --> 00:16:00,298
Come in.

344
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,401
Mr. Hastings?

345
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:06,836
It's okay, Chloe.

346
00:16:06,903 --> 00:16:09,005
I just want you to know,

347
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,107
I don't think it's fair
what they're doing,

348
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:12,508
laying all the blame on you.

349
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:17,546
Everything that happens here
is my responsibility.

350
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:20,049
The successes and the failures.

351
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:24,854
I recruited Dana Walsh
into this agency,

352
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:27,490
so I let the snake
into the garden.

353
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:36,999
I need to review
protocols with you.

354
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:40,369
Let's not waste any time.

355
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:45,970
Did you live here long?

356
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,003
No. Just during my recovery.

357
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:53,305
You know, I still think
I got some coffee around here.

358
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,321
What's her name,
your granddaughter?

359
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:17,490
Teri.

360
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:20,559
Kim named her after her mom.

361
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:30,299
Jack, listen,

362
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:33,835
I know that we've said a lot
of things to each other,

363
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,404
and you've made promises
to me about...

364
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,008
I just

365
00:17:41,076 --> 00:17:43,577
want you to know that I'm not
gonna hold you to them.

366
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,980
It's been

367
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,281
a terrible day, and I know

368
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:48,815
that we-we say things
in the moment, and I just...

369
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:50,050
I don't want you to...

370
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,139
Hello?

371
00:18:23,207 --> 00:18:25,275
Somebody there?

372
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:30,163
Take my briefcase
to Marine One,

373
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:33,031
and tell the Secret Service
I'll be ready to leave shortly.

374
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:34,966
And send Mr. Novakovich in.

375
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:36,468
Yes, ma'am.

376
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:46,512
Mr. Novakovich.

377
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,347
Thank you for seeing
me, Madam President.

378
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:49,615
Not at all.

379
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:52,251
What can I do for you?

380
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,152
I just had a curious phone call

381
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,154
from Tim Woods

382
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:58,723
indicating that you are
intending to move forward

383
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,160
with the peace initiative
with the IRK.

384
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:03,227
That's correct.
May I ask

385
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:04,796
how you propose to do this,

386
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:06,631
considering
their leader is dead?

387
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:08,733
Well, I intended
to answer that question

388
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,735
during my address
to the Assembly,

389
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:12,537
but since you're asking...

390
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:15,373
Dalia Hassan will be signing
the agreement

391
00:20:15,441 --> 00:20:17,142
in her husband's stead.

392
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,078
That's... an interesting idea,
Madam President,

393
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:22,681
but I don't see
how she would have the authority

394
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:24,015
to sign such a document.

395
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,917
She's getting it
from her government now.

396
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,085
Their parliament called
an emergency session

397
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:31,022
to ratify her
as provisional president.

398
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,892
The letter confirming that
is forthcoming.

399
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,494
Madam President,
I appreciate your optimism,

400
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,596
but I don't understand
how you can believe

401
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:40,565
that installing Hassan's widow

402
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,569
as some kind of figurehead
will alleviate our concerns

403
00:20:43,636 --> 00:20:46,005
about the instability
of the IRK government.

404
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:48,474
With President Hassan dead,

405
00:20:48,542 --> 00:20:50,943
the opposition
will only get stronger.

406
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,611
Hassan's death will galvanize
his supporters

407
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,746
and every advocate
of this peace process

408
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:58,082
to endorse her
as his successor.

409
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,984
You can't be certain of that.

410
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,822
Once again, Mr. Novakovich,

411
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,357
you're giving every indication

412
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:08,560
that Russia has no interest
in this peace accord.

413
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:11,496
I'm sorry that you feel
that way, Madam President,

414
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:14,835
but the fact remains
that we are no longer confident

415
00:21:14,902 --> 00:21:17,577
that any meaningful progress
can be made.

416
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:20,228
Respectfully,
my country will be declining

417
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,237
to sign your peace document.

418
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:23,642
Excuse me.

419
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:27,581
Do I need to take this up
with President Suvarov myself?

420
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:30,213
If you like,
but I can assure you,

421
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,115
I have full authority
on this matter.

422
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:35,586
Any decision that I make
represents the formal position

423
00:21:35,653 --> 00:21:37,187
of the Russian government.

424
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,256
Good day.

425
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:57,863
Agent Peters, I need
to see Secretary Kanin now.

426
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,030
Yes, Madam President.

427
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,698
Liberty's on the move.

428
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:03,971
We managed to clear a blockage in
one of your coronary arteries,

429
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,908
and the X-rays show
the heart muscle damage

430
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,342
to be less than we expected.

431
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,745
In other words,
I'm a tough son of a bitch.

432
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:12,415
You're a lucky man, I'll say
that for you, Mr. Secretary.

433
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,584
I guess that means
I can resume my duties.

434
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:16,286
Although the procedure
was noninvasive,

435
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:18,322
I'd prefer it if you
took it easy for a little while.

436
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:20,391
That isn't a no.

437
00:22:21,693 --> 00:22:23,829
Hello, Ethan.
How are you feeling?

438
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:27,299
Well, uh, I've
seen better days.

439
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,735
Would you give us
a few moments, please?

440
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:31,470
Thank you.

441
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:37,236
You heard about Hassan?

442
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:39,036
Tim Woods told me.

443
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,471
He also filled me in
on the IRK plan

444
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,774
to install Dalia Hassan.

445
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,810
What do you think?

446
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:48,813
Her family's well
connected and powerful.

447
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,682
I think it's an inspired idea.

448
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,118
Well, the Russians don't.

449
00:22:53,186 --> 00:22:56,521
Novakovich told me in no uncertain
terms they won't accept her.

450
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:59,390
They're using it as an excuse
to pull out of the signing.

451
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,692
Even if the IRK

452
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,461
has a new leader,
the peace agreement won't stand

453
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:05,397
without Moscow's endorsement.

454
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,266
I need your help, Ethan.

455
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,168
You got the Russians
to the table.

456
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:11,270
What can I do
to keep them there?

457
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:14,507
There may be someone
who can help us here.

458
00:23:14,575 --> 00:23:17,009
But you're not gonna like it.

459
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:18,277
Who?

460
00:23:18,345 --> 00:23:19,944
Charles Logan.

461
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:21,078
Logan?

462
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:23,345
Ethan, you can't be serious.

463
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:24,678
The man's a criminal.

464
00:23:24,744 --> 00:23:26,878
<i>I don't care if he was pardoned.</i>

465
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:29,281
I didn't agree with President
Daniels' decision, either,

466
00:23:29,348 --> 00:23:32,318
but the fact is he's left
several messages at my office

467
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:34,019
over the past hour.

468
00:23:34,087 --> 00:23:36,588
Apparently, he's aware
of the Russians' reticence

469
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:39,691
in signing the agreement;
he's offered his assistance.

470
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:42,593
How could he possibly know about this?
Well, despite

471
00:23:42,661 --> 00:23:44,961
his political downfall,
he's managed to maintain

472
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,729
a uniquely close relationship
with Moscow.

473
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:50,098
His messages indicated
he has information

474
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,399
which might prove useful

475
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:54,102
in keeping the
Russians at the table.

476
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,737
What information?

477
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:58,106
He didn't say.

478
00:23:58,174 --> 00:24:00,876
Allison...

479
00:24:00,943 --> 00:24:03,712
I don't trust this man
any more than you do,

480
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:05,981
but I'd be remiss
if I didn't urge you

481
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:09,183
to at least... hear him out.

482
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:19,193
Okay, listen up,
everyone, please.

483
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:25,099
I've never been very good
at good-byes.

484
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:27,969
But I want to tell you
what an honor it's been

485
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:30,939
for me to have served

486
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:34,009
with each and every one of you.

487
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:37,513
Division is now vetting names

488
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,281
to replace me.

489
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:41,616
In the meantime, Chloe O'Brian

490
00:24:41,684 --> 00:24:43,351
will be in charge, and I'm sure

491
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:46,989
you will show her the same level
of loyalty and commitment

492
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:49,358
that you've all shown me.

493
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:52,695
Thank you.

494
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:05,304
Sir...

495
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:07,540
Aw, don't worry, Chloe,
you can do this.

496
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:08,708
I hope so.

497
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:11,744
I just want to say,
we had a rough start,

498
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:14,280
but I eventually
really enjoyed working for you.

499
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:17,015
Well, I'm happy to say
that I was wrong about you.

500
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,149
If I had listened to
you in the beginning,

501
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,950
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

502
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:22,218
I doubt it.

503
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,986
I'll be at Division debriefing.

504
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:26,893
But I'm available to you
if you have any questions.

505
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,897
Thank you, sir.

506
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:30,398
Good luck.

507
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:31,966
Mr. Hastings.

508
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,501
I have Agent Ortiz on the line.

509
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:34,903
They have a situation
in Medical.

510
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,272
This one's all yours, Chloe.

511
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,711
Ms. O'Brian.

512
00:25:40,779 --> 00:25:42,011
Cole, it's Chloe.

513
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,878
Where's Hastings?

514
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:44,479
He's not here.

515
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:45,884
What happened?

516
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:46,887
Samir's just gone
into cardiac arrest.

517
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:48,188
What?

518
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,690
I need four
milligrams epinephrine

519
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:50,924
and 275 Lidocaine.

520
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,227
I'll be right there.

521
00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:58,130
Clear!

522
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,868
Going again at 360.

523
00:26:08,404 --> 00:26:09,571
Clear!

524
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:21,881
What happened?

525
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,449
I thought his injuries
were not life-threatening.

526
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:24,747
So did I.

527
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,282
Where the hell is Hastings?

528
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,449
He's been removed by Division.

529
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,050
Who's in command?

530
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:32,521
I am... until they find
a replacement.

531
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:34,192
You were with Samir
the whole time?

532
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,594
All the way
from the scene, yeah.

533
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,066
What about at the scene?

534
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:39,869
He may have been out of
my sight for a few minutes.

535
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:42,972
Emergency personnel
were with him.

536
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,241
Look, we got to move his body
to the morgue for an autopsy.

537
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:48,043
Not yet... order
a preliminary toxicology panel.

538
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:49,311
But they'll run a full
panel during the autopsy.

539
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:50,545
I want it done now!

540
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,013
Chloe, he was barely conscious.

541
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,082
He couldn't have taken
something to off himself.

542
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,018
No, but somebody
could have given it to him.

543
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,124
Do what she says.

544
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:05,726
I'll be in Hastings' office...
my office.

545
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:08,228
Let me know when
you find something.

546
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:30,171
A few of the more conservative
members of our delegation

547
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:32,606
may continue to resist you,

548
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:34,607
but... we can...

549
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:36,542
we can persuade them.

550
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,944
Perhaps if I spoke
to them personally.

551
00:27:39,012 --> 00:27:40,211
A very good idea.

552
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:49,385
Miss Kayla,

553
00:27:49,452 --> 00:27:52,654
I didn't get a chance to tell
you how deeply sorry I am.

554
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:55,156
Thank you.

555
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:56,891
Well...

556
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,392
I will see you both

557
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,461
back at the U.N.

558
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:03,232
The U.N.?

559
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,235
I thought you were going home.

560
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:07,169
No, not yet.
There are new developments.

561
00:28:07,237 --> 00:28:09,271
I'll explain them to you
on the way.

562
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:10,672
What is going on, Mother?

563
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,741
Why did President
Taylor and Jamot

564
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:14,843
want to speak with you alone?

565
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:17,479
They have asked me
to consider staying on...

566
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:20,649
to complete your father's work.

567
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:23,318
I don't understand...
what does that mean?

568
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:28,188
Our party wishes to appoint me
as the new president.

569
00:28:30,392 --> 00:28:32,793
What was your answer?

570
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:35,029
You told them

571
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:37,265
you couldn't possibly accept,
not after what's happened.

572
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:38,466
Kayla!

573
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,836
Our country is
on the verge of a coup

574
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:44,172
by the people responsible
for the murder of your father.

575
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,874
Someone must lead.

576
00:28:45,942 --> 00:28:48,544
You can't beat them,
don't you realize that by now?

577
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,045
I don't believe that; I won't.

578
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:52,280
And the greatest blow
I can strike against them

579
00:28:52,348 --> 00:28:53,848
is to sign the peace agreement.

580
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,483
This will be
your father's legacy.

581
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,517
It will be
a death sentence for you!

582
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:58,785
You want peace to live,

583
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:00,554
but all these people want
is anarchy.

584
00:29:00,622 --> 00:29:01,722
Oh, Mother, they'll kill you!

585
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:03,256
Enough!

586
00:29:07,928 --> 00:29:11,796
You are not the only one
who has suffered today.

587
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:14,032
This was not

588
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,935
an easy decision for me,
but it was mine to make.

589
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:21,705
I do not need you
to remind me of the danger.

590
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:24,607
I need you to help me be strong.

591
00:29:26,443 --> 00:29:30,512
Now, pull yourself together...
there is a car waiting for us.

592
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,315
Well, I'm sure the media does
want a response, but I'm not

593
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:47,082
ready to give them one
just yet.

594
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,584
They'll have to wait.

595
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:49,718
All right.

596
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:51,586
Thank you.

597
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:54,154
The press secretary says
the Russians are already

598
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:56,556
leaking to the news channels
their intention

599
00:29:56,624 --> 00:29:58,591
to "reluctantly"
pull out of the talks.

600
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:00,660
They don't like wasting time.

601
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:02,862
Has my guest arrived?

602
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:04,263
Yes, ma'am.
I had Secret Service

603
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:05,931
bring him in
through the freight entrance

604
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:08,500
and then deliver him discreetly
to conference room number three,

605
00:30:08,568 --> 00:30:09,734
as you asked.

606
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:11,235
Thank you, Tim.

607
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:12,703
Yes, ma'am.

608
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,358
Madam President,
let me convey my condolences

609
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:41,426
on the loss of President Hassan.

610
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,895
I know you worked
closely with him.

611
00:30:43,963 --> 00:30:46,464
This must be very hard for you.

612
00:30:46,532 --> 00:30:50,133
Thank you... for your
sympathy, Mr. President.

613
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,768
If you don't mind, I'd
like to talk to you alone.

614
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:57,103
This is my executive assistant,
Jason Pillar.

615
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:59,039
I assure you he can be trusted.

616
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:00,407
Well, forgive me

617
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,375
if I don't give much weight
to your endorsement.

618
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,443
He needs to leave.

619
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:07,582
Will you excuse us, Jason?

620
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,788
Let's get something straight.

621
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:19,091
I agreed to this meeting
only at the behest

622
00:31:19,158 --> 00:31:21,125
of Secretary Kanin.

623
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:24,461
Now, I'm not sure you're
entirely aware of the situation.

624
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,162
My understanding is,
the Russians are

625
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,664
rejecting Dalia Hassan
as a legitimate successor,

626
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:32,134
and as a result, won't sign off
on the peace agreement.

627
00:31:32,202 --> 00:31:33,769
You're well informed.

628
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:36,772
I have close friends in Moscow.

629
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,274
In some ways, people there

630
00:31:39,342 --> 00:31:42,110
appreciate me more than
people in my own country.

631
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:45,914
It wasn't their constitution
you trampled.

632
00:31:45,982 --> 00:31:47,982
The Russians

633
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,551
have been trying to back out
of this agreement from day one.

634
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,986
Do you honestly think
your relationships

635
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:55,688
can change their minds?

636
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:57,423
I'm certain I can.

637
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:59,459
How?
Let's just say

638
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:03,495
I'm going to be able
to exercise some leverage.

639
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,664
What kind of leverage?

640
00:32:05,732 --> 00:32:08,466
If it gets the job done,
does it really matter?

641
00:32:08,534 --> 00:32:10,001
It does to me.

642
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,269
I can promise you

643
00:32:11,337 --> 00:32:12,470
no laws'll be broken,

644
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:14,806
nothing will tarnish you
or your presidency,

645
00:32:14,874 --> 00:32:19,512
but the details really must stay
between me and the Russians.

646
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,918
You and President Hassan
created the framework

647
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,488
for the most significant peace
in a generation, and you got

648
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:32,523
the entire world behind it.

649
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:35,993
To let the Russians tear down
what should be the crown jewel

650
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:37,127
in your administration...

651
00:32:37,195 --> 00:32:39,028
Don't play me.

652
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:40,696
This is about you

653
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:44,199
trying to repair
your reputation.

654
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:46,468
Is that so hard to understand?

655
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:47,903
You participated

656
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:52,209
in a conspiracy to cover up the
assassination of David Palmer.

657
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:53,878
I was trying
to protect the country

658
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:55,847
from an unnecessary trauma...
Don't! You were

659
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:59,250
doing what was best
for yourself.

660
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:03,554
Yes.

661
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:07,393
You're right, Madam President.

662
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,495
You're right.

663
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:10,995
I suppose I've spent
so many years

664
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:13,262
trying to justify my actions

665
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,931
that it's become difficult
for me...

666
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:20,769
to own up to the truth.

667
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:25,941
I made mistakes,

668
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:31,878
terrible mistakes, that stained
the office of the presidency...

670
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:35,817
and for which I will be paying
the rest of my life.

671
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:41,626
But I still can be
of value to my country.

672
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:47,130
I can still do some good.

673
00:33:47,198 --> 00:33:49,966
Look, we both know you wouldn't

674
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:53,402
have called me unless
you were out of options,

675
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,769
so we can continue
to dwell on the past,

676
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:58,871
or you can let me pursue
the only chance you have

677
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:01,340
of resurrecting
the peace process.

678
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,942
Please.

679
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:09,779
Let me help you.

680
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,485
All right.

681
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,154
Thank you.

682
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,391
What do you intend to do first?

683
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,961
Arrange a meeting with
the Russian delegate Novakovich.

684
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,597
Uh, get a message
to him at his hotel.

685
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,266
Tell him that you are sending
over your official emissary

686
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,236
to have a talk with him.

687
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,605
What if he doesn't agree
to this meeting?

688
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,173
Make sure he knows it's me.

689
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,975
He'll agree to it.

690
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:43,947
God help you
if you make me regret this.

691
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,446
O'Brian.

692
00:35:11,514 --> 00:35:14,415
You okay?

693
00:35:14,483 --> 00:35:16,751
Perfect.

694
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:19,120
Promise?
Hmm.

695
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,358
I am so thirsty.

696
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:24,726
Me, too.

697
00:35:24,794 --> 00:35:28,063
Do you want me to get you
something to drink?

698
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,132
Okay.

699
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:35,403
I'll be right back.

700
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,619
Don't move.

701
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,769
Jack, your cell's ringing.

702
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,270
Don't worry about it, let it go.

703
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,013
Hello.
Jack's phone.

704
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,480
Renee, it's Chloe.
I need to talk to Jack.

705
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:26,481
What's wrong?

706
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:27,715
Samir Mehran is dead.

707
00:36:27,783 --> 00:36:29,149
I think he was assassinated.

708
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,652
What do you mean, assassinated?

709
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,054
I ran a preliminary
toxicology report.

710
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:35,856
It showed traces
of an unidentified toxin

711
00:36:35,924 --> 00:36:36,958
in his bloodstream.

712
00:36:37,025 --> 00:36:37,994
Someone must have injected him

713
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:40,665
with it, probably at the scene.

714
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,801
There was,
there was an EMT there.

715
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,169
He looked familiar.

716
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:48,242
There was so much going on,
I-I didn't take much notice.

717
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,978
Familiar? From where?

718
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:52,485
I need you to get
my FBI case files.

719
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:54,154
Get me everything you have
on Red Square.

720
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:55,855
You think he was
from the Russian Mob?

721
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,990
He looked like somebody who
was with Vladimir Laitanan

722
00:36:58,058 --> 00:36:59,792
during the time I was under.

723
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:00,826
That was six years ago.

724
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:01,826
Are you sure?

725
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:03,693
Honestly, no.

726
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:05,325
Just send me the case files,

727
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,524
all the surveillance photos
that were taken,

728
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,189
and I'll see if he's in there.

729
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:10,422
Okay.

730
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:12,156
Jack...

731
00:37:12,223 --> 00:37:13,156
you need to hear this.

732
00:37:13,224 --> 00:37:14,523
Samir...

733
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,860
Renee...

734
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:21,295
Renee!

735
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,101
Renee?
Come on. Come on.

736
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:32,339
Jack.

737
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:33,574
Renee, are you there?
Jack.

738
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:36,544
Don't talk, I'm gonna
get you to a hospital.

739
00:37:36,612 --> 00:37:37,779
Did something happen?

740
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:39,580
Who is this?
It's Chloe.

741
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:40,581
Chloe, it's Jack.

742
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:41,749
Renee's been hit by a sniper

743
00:37:41,816 --> 00:37:42,749
through the window
of my apartment.

744
00:37:42,817 --> 00:37:43,950
We're still taking fire.

745
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:45,518
I need a trauma team
at St. Andrew's now.

746
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:47,086
Hold on, stay with me.

747
00:37:47,154 --> 00:37:48,154
Come on.

748
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:50,289
Let's go.

749
00:38:26,793 --> 00:38:27,795
Keep everybody in the lobby.

750
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:28,797
There's a sniper outside.

751
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:29,998
Call 911.

752
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:31,466
Now!

753
00:38:37,406 --> 00:38:38,706
Move!

754
00:38:44,511 --> 00:38:46,144
She's been shot;
We need to get to the hospital...

755
00:38:46,212 --> 00:38:47,714
St. Andrew's Hospital,
22nd and Ninth.

756
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:58,304
Come on, you can make it.

757
00:38:58,372 --> 00:39:01,341
Wait... just wait...

758
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:07,881
We're gonna make it.

759
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:09,449
We're gonna make it, I promise.

760
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:10,984
Do whatever you have to!

761
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:13,286
We've got to get
to the hospital now!

762
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,225
Come on, come on.

763
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:22,727
I got you, I got you.

764
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,228
I got you.

765
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:25,229
You'll be all right.

766
00:39:25,297 --> 00:39:26,864
We're almost there.

767
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,232
They're a few blocks
from your hospital

768
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,399
and should be there any minute.

769
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,467
Please make sure
she's given priority care.

770
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,501
Thank you.

771
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:33,502
Arlo,

772
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:34,503
pull up satellite.

773
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,704
Isolate the areas

774
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:37,638
between Eighth Avenue
and West 18th Street.

775
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:39,506
What's going on?
Renee Walker was just shot.

776
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:41,875
What?!
Just do what I asked.

777
00:39:41,943 --> 00:39:43,109
Jack said the sniper
was positioned

778
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:44,344
at his apartment at 1145

779
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:45,912
West 18th Street.

780
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,380
Roll back the feed
three minutes.

781
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:48,515
Is she gonna be okay?

782
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:50,317
He's rushing her
to the hospital now.

783
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:51,384
I don't get it.

784
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:53,052
Why would anyone want
to kill Renee?

785
00:39:56,324 --> 00:39:59,159
Help! She's been shot!
There's no exit wound!

786
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:01,528
We got a gunshot wound to
the chest... let's move.

787
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:02,996
What's her pulse?

788
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:05,532
110, respiratory
is still ragged.

789
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,800
Check her carotid.

790
00:40:06,868 --> 00:40:08,434
BP is 80 over 50.

791
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:09,434
Right here.

792
00:40:09,502 --> 00:40:10,635
What do we have?
Five is prepped.

793
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:11,803
We're gonna take care of you.

794
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,273
O.R. five, let's go.
How many gunshot wounds?

795
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,941
One in the chest.
Sir, you need to stay right here.

796
00:40:15,008 --> 00:40:17,042
Is patient typing crossed?
No.

797
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,011
Call the blood bank, send up
four units of O-negative.

798
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:20,779
- Right away.
- Come on, come on, come on.

799
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:53,243
Yeah.

800
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:54,645
Jack, it's Chloe.
How is she?

801
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,480
Not good.

802
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:59,549
We rolled back satellite to
the area around your building.

803
00:40:59,617 --> 00:41:01,285
The shots were fired

804
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:03,790
from an office
across the street.

805
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:06,296
PD reported finding a body
at the scene.

806
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,733
What about the shooter?

807
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:09,838
We don't have anything.

808
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:11,241
We lost him.

809
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:13,610
You were on the phone with her
right before she got shot.

810
00:41:13,677 --> 00:41:14,978
What were you talking about?

811
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:17,180
It's not important right now.

812
00:41:17,248 --> 00:41:18,181
Just...

813
00:41:18,249 --> 00:41:19,282
be with her.

814
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,551
She's in surgery,
Chloe, I can't.

815
00:41:21,618 --> 00:41:22,952
What were you talking about?

816
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,621
I told her what I'm
calling to tell you.

817
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:27,424
Samir Mehran was given a
lethal injection at the scene

818
00:41:27,492 --> 00:41:30,093
of his capture, probably
to keep him from talking.

819
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:32,963
Renee thought she may have
recognized one of the EMTs.

820
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,964
She didn't say anything to me.

821
00:41:35,032 --> 00:41:36,165
She wasn't sure.

822
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:38,801
She didn't think it meant
anything at the time.

823
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:41,304
Where did she say she
remembered him from?

824
00:41:41,372 --> 00:41:43,573
From her days undercover
with the Russian Mob.

825
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,275
She asked me to get her
the Red Square file.

826
00:41:46,343 --> 00:41:47,610
Did you pull up the file?

827
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:49,745
Yes.

828
00:41:52,582 --> 00:41:54,616
Jack?

829
00:41:54,684 --> 00:41:56,417
I gotta get back to you.

830
00:41:59,422 --> 00:42:01,756
I'm sorry, she didn't make it.

831
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:03,559
There was just
too much arterial damage

832
00:42:03,626 --> 00:42:05,328
and blood loss.

833
00:42:05,396 --> 00:42:07,397
I'm very sorry.

834
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:16,398
