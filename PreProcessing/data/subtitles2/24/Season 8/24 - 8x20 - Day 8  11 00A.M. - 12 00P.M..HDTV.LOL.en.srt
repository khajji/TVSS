1
00:00:13,444 --> 00:00:15,845
Mr. Bauer, you are ordered

2
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:18,714
to turn the aircraft around
and return to CTU.

3
00:00:18,782 --> 00:00:19,882
Jack's descending.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,350
<i>Air Force choppers
are in pursuit.</i>

5
00:00:23,253 --> 00:00:25,922
We've lost him.

6
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:28,791
If Jack gets this evidence
and exposes the Russians,

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,293
the agreement is over.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,562
The peace agreement
may not be the only casualty.

9
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:35,031
You covered up
the Russians' involvement.

10
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:36,599
That's grounds for impeachment.

11
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,868
There's still a chance that CTU

12
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,203
will find Jack.

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,772
Even if they do,
the evidence is still out there.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,242
Eventually, it will surface.

15
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,913
You need to control the evidence
by keeping Walsh off the grid.

16
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:52,748
<i>Classify her
as an enemy combatant</i>

17
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:55,485
and incarcerate her
in a private facility.

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,752
I've authorized

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,421
a private interrogation team

20
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,856
to acquire the evidence.

21
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:00,857
Once we have it,

22
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:02,592
she'll be irrelevant.

23
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,727
I can't be a part
of this any longer.

24
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:07,597
Cite my health as the reason
for my resignation.

25
00:01:07,664 --> 00:01:08,998
The president's
ordered your transfer

26
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,166
to an off-site
facility.

27
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:12,702
What do you mean
off-site facility?

28
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:14,370
It's a secure location.

29
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,738
Just do what he says, Dana.

30
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:17,907
Chloe, don't let them do this.

31
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:19,442
- Let's go.
- Please.

32
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,210
They're gonna kill me. Chloe!

33
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:22,645
Chloe, please!

34
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:24,614
You told Bauer
you have evidence.

35
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:26,749
I have got nothing to tell you.

36
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:28,317
There is no evidence.

37
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:30,419
The sooner you tell me,
the easier it'll go.

38
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:31,654
No!

39
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,425
Mobilizing a sting operation
to be led by Agent Ortiz.

40
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:37,994
The target is Jack Bauer.

41
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:41,764
Put your weapons down!

42
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:43,132
I can't do that, Jack!

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,501
Put your weapons down now!

44
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,870
<i>I need you to help me
gain access to Dana Walsh.</i>

45
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:50,673
I am giving you an opportunity
to make this right,

46
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:52,275
to make the people
that are responsible

47
00:01:52,342 --> 00:01:53,876
for everything that
happened today accountable.

48
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:57,280
Chloe said she's in a safe house
a few miles from here.

49
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:58,347
All right, now it's imperative

50
00:01:58,415 --> 00:01:59,782
that they think I
took you hostage.

51
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,851
Get up!

52
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:14,030
And though fate has prevented
my husband from being here today

53
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:17,800
at the culmination
of his life's work,

54
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:22,572
I know that he is watching us
now, looking down and guiding us

55
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,376
as we take the last steps
towards this historic agreement.

56
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:33,516
Finally, I would like
to express my gratitude

57
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:36,919
to President Taylor...

58
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:42,758
Whose integrity
and moral courage

59
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:44,894
have been unshakable

60
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:49,599
during the long course
of these negotiations.

61
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,336
She is someone on whom my
husband built an absolute trust.

62
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:56,872
And I want to make it clear

63
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,676
that her efforts and the efforts
of the United States government

64
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:04,847
to rescue him
were nothing short of heroic.

65
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:09,185
My husband wasn't perfect.

66
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:13,222
None of us is.

67
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:20,997
But he carried a perfect idea
in his heart:

68
00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:24,734
That peace is possible.

69
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:28,671
On this,

70
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,806
the last day of his life,

71
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:35,611
may the world come together

72
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:39,115
and prove that he was right.

73
00:03:43,687 --> 00:03:45,321
What a magnificent woman.

74
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,760
Okay.

75
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,028
Who was that on the phone?

76
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,029
Bledsoe.

77
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,231
It's not the best of news, sir.

78
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:57,366
Dana Walsh isn't being as
cooperative as he'd hoped.

79
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:59,301
Well, what does he expect?

80
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,103
She's a trained enemy agent;
she's not gonna to break

81
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:02,204
at the drop of a hat.

82
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:04,040
Look, I told

83
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,108
President Taylor
what might be necessary,

84
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:07,843
and she signed off on it.

85
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:09,345
Bledsoe's a professional, sir.

86
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,847
I'm confident
he'll come through for us.

87
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:13,883
He better.

88
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,752
Sir, there was one more thing.

89
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,821
Bledsoe wanted confirmation.

90
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,724
About what?

91
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,859
How to deal with Ms. Walsh,
post interrogation.

92
00:04:23,927 --> 00:04:25,761
I thought we settled
that matter.

93
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:27,430
We did.

94
00:04:27,497 --> 00:04:28,931
So why's he asking?

95
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:31,534
Just to double check we're still
committed to the same outcome.

96
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,035
And what did you tell him?

97
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:35,171
We're still committed
to the same outcome.

98
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:40,643
Not that I have any idea
what you're talking about.

99
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:41,777
You understand?

100
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:43,679
Perfectly, sir.

101
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:57,093
Let her up.

102
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,602
I'll give you a little tip.

103
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,437
Take short, shallow breaths.

104
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:10,706
You'll recover faster.

105
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:13,275
And then we won't have so much
downtime between sessions.

106
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,313
It's up to you, you know.

107
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,116
You can stop this
whenever you want.

108
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:22,852
All you have to do is tell
me what I want to know.

109
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,688
I told you
that I was making it up.

110
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:27,423
There is no evidence.

111
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,159
You told Jack Bauer
you had proof that elements in

112
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,360
the Russian government
were behind

113
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:33,329
the assassination
of President Hassan.

114
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,064
I was bluffing.

115
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:36,132
Stalling for time.

116
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,133
There isn't any proof.

117
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,668
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying.

118
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:41,904
We begin again in ten seconds.

119
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,442
Seven, six...

120
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,844
Bring it on, you son of a bitch.

121
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,080
Put her down.

122
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,386
Where's the evidence?

123
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:00,356
Go to hell.

124
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:01,690
Gag her.

125
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,472
* *

126
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:38,694
Okay.

127
00:06:38,762 --> 00:06:40,963
They got two sentries
out in front in a black sedan,

128
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,464
one lookout on the roof,

129
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:45,067
most likely another across the
street, but I couldn't see him.

130
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:47,336
We can access the back of the
building through that alley.

131
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,038
So, once we get Dana,
what then?

132
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,106
As painful as it is,
we got to cut a deal

133
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:52,107
in exchange for the evidence.

134
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:53,375
You mean let her go.

135
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,344
Cole, we both
lost friends today.

136
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,546
And Dana had a hand in that,

137
00:06:57,614 --> 00:06:58,881
but only a hand.

138
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,749
If we can get
the people in charge,

139
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,418
the people that gave the orders,

140
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:04,186
it'll be worth it.

141
00:07:06,323 --> 00:07:07,756
It's Chloe.

142
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:09,491
Answer it.

143
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,826
Otherwise, she'll know
something's wrong.

144
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:12,394
If she doesn't already.

145
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:13,529
Hello.

146
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:14,864
Cole, what's your ETA?

147
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:16,899
Ten minutes.
FDR Drive was a mess.

148
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,434
We're coming up
First Ave instead.

149
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,202
Is Jack with you?

150
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:22,271
Yeah, I got him.

151
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:23,505
He's locked down in the back.

152
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,941
I'm glad we found him
before he got hurt.

153
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:26,942
Or worse.

154
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,943
Yeah.

155
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:29,411
I've known Jack for a long time,

156
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,347
and I've never
seen him like this.

157
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,949
He threatened me;
he's never done that before.

158
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,588
You did the right thing, Chloe.

159
00:07:39,656 --> 00:07:42,625
Thanks for saying that.

160
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:44,360
I'll talk to you
when you get here.

161
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:45,928
Yeah.

162
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:46,929
We're good.

163
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:49,064
She has no idea.

164
00:07:49,132 --> 00:07:50,633
Don't be too hard on her, Jack.

165
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,201
She was only doing
what she thought

166
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,569
was best for you.
I know.

167
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:57,706
Almost forgot.

168
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:58,874
You're gonna need these.

169
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,781
I'm sorry, I just couldn't
take the chance.

170
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:07,950
Son of a bitch.

171
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:09,818
Yeah, I know.

172
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:11,620
You ready?

173
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:12,621
Yeah.

174
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,657
Let's go.

175
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:18,661
Keep your head down.

176
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:28,637
Go.

177
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:38,013
That's right, four hours prior
to the signing ceremony,

178
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:40,582
all available field units
will be redeployed to the U.N.

179
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,152
Mobile HQ is being
set up on the first floor,

180
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:44,586
adjacent to the
high commissioner's offices.

181
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:46,922
Hold on a second;
I got O'Brian on the other line.

182
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,291
Yeah?
Who's the psych officer on duty?

183
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,694
That would be Melissa Anderson.

184
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,395
She did all the
grief counseling last night.

185
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,965
Make sure she's the first person
Jack sees when he gets here.

186
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:57,933
I want a complete eval.

187
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:59,301
You really think
that's necessary?

188
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,804
I wouldn't have
ordered it if I didn't.

189
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:04,306
I'll let her know.

190
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,060
I got a visual.

191
00:09:58,128 --> 00:09:59,695
They got one man on the roof.

192
00:10:09,205 --> 00:10:10,439
Okay.

193
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:14,209
Wait till I get into position,
then you draw them out.

194
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:26,288
All units, this is Command.

195
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:27,289
Please report.

196
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,258
Command, this is unit one.
All clear.

197
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,160
Unit two. Street's clear.

198
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:33,228
Unit three. Back alley's clear.

199
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,197
Command, this is unit four.
Roof's clear.

200
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:36,198
All units, copy that.

201
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,266
Stay alert.

202
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,294
We're clear.

203
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,900
Let's go.

204
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:43,298
* *

205
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:14,429
* *

206
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:45,327
* *

207
00:12:52,945 --> 00:12:54,979
You make that cover.
I'll draw him out.

208
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:07,258
Command, I'm taking
sniper fire on the roof.

209
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:08,759
The building across the street.

210
00:13:08,827 --> 00:13:09,827
I need backup now.

211
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:10,928
Unit four, stand by.

212
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:12,163
I'm sending backup now.

213
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:13,631
Copy that. Hurry!

214
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,533
All units to the roof.

215
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:17,235
Unit four is reporting
sniper fire.

216
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,871
Repeat: all units to the roof.

217
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:21,806
Unit four is under sniper fire.

218
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,759
Go.

219
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:42,894
Go.

220
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:49,100
Command, we're on the roof.

221
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:50,868
It's quiet; there's
no sign of Mullins.

222
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:52,203
Come again?

223
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:54,839
All's quiet, but we can locate
Unit four.

224
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:56,474
Unit four, come in, please.

225
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,309
Where's Dana Walsh?

226
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:04,115
Where is she?

227
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:05,650
Command, Mullins is down, sir.

228
00:14:05,717 --> 00:14:06,984
Last chance.

229
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:08,553
Repeat: Mullins is down.

230
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
First room on the left.

231
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:10,688
Thank you.

232
00:14:11,857 --> 00:14:12,857
Command, do you copy?

233
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:15,059
Command, come in.

234
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:17,161
We're clear.

235
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:20,097
The first room on the left,
I've got it.

236
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:25,870
Put your gun down now!

237
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:26,904
No, you drop your weapon

238
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:28,206
or I'll put a bullet
in her brain!

239
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,674
I don't want to kill you,
but I will if I have to.

240
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:30,841
Put your gun down!

241
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,577
You won't take the shot.
It's too risky.

242
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:33,678
I'll kill her before...

243
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:36,881
Cole, untie her.

244
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:42,119
Cole, now!

245
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:45,156
Take her out the back.

246
00:14:45,224 --> 00:14:47,391
We're gonna get company soon.
Hurry!

247
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:52,530
Cole, have you got her?!
Almost!

248
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,700
I got her!

249
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,668
Move! Move!

250
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,377
Stay covered.

251
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:12,917
Cole, take the stairs now!

252
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:13,985
Jack!

253
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:16,087
Get going!
I'll be right behind you!

254
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:43,040
Chloe.

255
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,308
In a second.

256
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,210
Just finishing rescanning
the field reports.

257
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,545
You need to hear this, Chloe.

258
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,280
Agent Beck just checked in
from the laundry.

259
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,549
He said he's been locked down
for the past half hour,

260
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,217
and only just now managed
to free himself.

261
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,519
What? Apparently, Jack
didn't fall for the trap.

262
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,189
Instead, he reversed the entire
squad and took Cole hostage.

263
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,157
I just talked to Cole.

264
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,859
Beck says Jack had him
at gunpoint.

265
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,096
Devin, pull up the satellite
on the lower East Side.

266
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:06,797
Address:
14633 12th Street.

267
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,033
It's where the private
contractors are holding Dana.

268
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,968
It's where
Jack's on his way to now.

269
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,570
What is going on, Chloe?

270
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,972
He's been two steps ahead of me
the whole time.

271
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,675
He probably knew what I was
gonna do before I did.

272
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,876
Hello, everybody!

273
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,378
Can I have your attention,
please?

274
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,747
Jack Bauer's no longer in
custody of CTU.

275
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:25,650
Agent Cole Ortiz is with him,
most likely as a hostage.

276
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,286
Our priority is
to find them now.

277
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:30,187
Satellite's online,
Ms. O'Brian.

278
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,389
Put it up.

279
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,393
We're too late.

280
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,095
Put the APB back out on Jack,
all agencies.

281
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,264
Get me the White House.

282
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,302
Where are we going?

283
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,171
You tell me. You said
you had a video file

284
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,739
implicating people inside
the Russian government

285
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,308
who are responsible
for Renee's murder.

286
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,809
I want that file.

287
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,545
And I said I'd give it to you
in exchange for immunity.

288
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,248
That deal's off the table.

289
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,349
The president decided
the peace agreement's

290
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,350
more important than the truth.

291
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,685
As far as she's concerned,

292
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:02,787
that file can never see
the light of day.

293
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,522
But I still want it.

294
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,923
What's the new deal?

295
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,592
You give us the file,
we let you go.

296
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,760
Go where, Riker's Island?

297
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,729
Dana, you're a small fish
in all of this.

298
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,698
I'm going after the people
who gave the orders.

299
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:15,700
You give me the evidence,
we'll let you go.

300
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,068
I give you my word.

301
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,469
Your word?

302
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,906
I'm sorry.
I don't believe you, Jack.

303
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,808
Fine.

304
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,543
You think this is a joke?

305
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,478
We'll do it another way.

306
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,594
Get out. Get out!

307
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:44,962
Jack!

308
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,131
Jack, Cole!

309
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,632
Oh!

310
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,403
Tell me where that
file is-- now!

311
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,771
That file's the only thing

312
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,139
keeping me alive!
No, right now

313
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,841
I'm the only thing
keeping you alive.

314
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:59,377
I'm gonna count backwards from three,
and then I'm gonna kill you.

315
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,245
Three! You're really not
gonna let him shoot me

316
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,380
in cold blood, are you, Cole?
Two!

317
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:03,981
Jack!
Back off!

318
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,584
One!
In a safety-deposit box!

319
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:07,885
Where?

320
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,086
First Unity Savings.
Cole knows.

321
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,255
We have a joint account there.
But the box is in

322
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,523
my name, which means I'm

323
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,924
the only one who can access it.
Where's the bank?

324
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,760
Lexington, off East 59th.

325
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:17,661
I had nothing to do
with Renee's death, Jack.

326
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,263
I didn't even know
she was a target.

327
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,732
Put her in the car.
I was in a CTU holding cell!

328
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,267
Put her back in the car!

329
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,703
Damn it! You see what's
happening here, don't you?

330
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,271
He's using you.
Using me? You're using me.

331
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,240
What do you think he's gonna
do once I give him that file?

332
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,142
He's gonna give the evidence
to the press

333
00:18:31,209 --> 00:18:32,276
and expose everyone responsible.

334
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,411
Is that what you think?

335
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:34,612
'Cause I doubt that's
what Jack thinks.

336
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,047
He's gonna assemble
the evidence,

337
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,249
make a list of the guilty,
and then he's gonna execute them

338
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:39,583
one by one, starting with me.

339
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,721
This isn't about the
truth, Cole.

340
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,223
It's about revenge!
Cole!

341
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:49,293
Look, I can't do this!

342
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,570
She's just trying
to get inside your head.

343
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,439
I know that, damn it!

344
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,708
You got something
you want to say to me,

345
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,243
you better say it now.

346
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,346
Were you gonna pull
that trigger?

347
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,083
I need her to think I would.

348
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,655
Yeah, okay.

349
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,487
Mrs. Hassan, please

350
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,856
allow me to offer my condolences
for your loss.

351
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:53,757
Your husband was a great man.

352
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,892
Thank you.

353
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,027
How has news of his death
been received

354
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,329
back in the Islamic Republic?

355
00:19:58,396 --> 00:19:59,730
And do people there

356
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,565
generally support your decision

357
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,068
to take his place
as head of state?

358
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:08,806
I'm confident that most
of my country is behind me.

359
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,040
Those who aren't,

360
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,209
probably never supported
my husband's policies

361
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,410
in the first place.

362
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:16,247
And what are your plans
after the treaty is signed?

363
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:17,448
Right now, I'm concentrating

364
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,350
all my efforts on the pursuit

365
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,452
of finishing what
my husband started

366
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,553
with this agreement.

367
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,190
But I want to return
to Kamistan.

368
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,224
Is this true?

369
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,692
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

370
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,895
The details are sketchy,
but as of 15 minutes ago,

371
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,997
Jack Bauer stormed
the safe house,

372
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,665
overwhelmed security
and took Dana Walsh.

373
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,867
Do we have any idea
where they are?

374
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,037
A hard target search
is under way.

375
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,339
Your note also mentioned
Charles Logan.

376
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,441
Yes, ma'am. He's been calling
and demanding

377
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,243
to speak to you.
He insisted that I interrupt

378
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,279
the press conference.

379
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:50,214
All you'll have to do is
hit redial.

380
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,449
Thank you, Tim.
Excuse me.

381
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,951
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:01,559
...the body be ritually washed
and draped...

383
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:02,960
Hello?

384
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,462
How in God's name could
this have happened?!

385
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,433
Madam President, the important
thing is not to panic.

386
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,036
You assured me that Dana Walsh
would be more secure

387
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:14,738
in the hands
of your private contractors.

388
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,575
We didn't move her out of CTU
solely for security reasons,

389
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:20,010
as I'm sure you remember.

390
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,946
Do you have me on speaker,
Charles?

391
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:25,149
Pick up the damn phone.

392
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,318
Forgive me, I wasn't thinking.

393
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:29,753
Apparently, neither was I.

394
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,222
It's a little late

395
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:32,590
for buyer's remorse,
Madam President,

396
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:37,928
especially because I was
calling with a solution

397
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,831
to our current problem.

398
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,966
Bauer may have Walsh,

399
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:43,601
but he can't have
the evidence yet.

400
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,236
We've still got a chance
to stop him.

401
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,303
How?

402
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,672
By putting somebody inside CTU,

403
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,575
someone whose loyalties
aren't split,

404
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,278
who won't hesitate
to see the mission through

405
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,946
no matter what the cost.

406
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,414
I've already replaced
one director.

407
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,415
I can't replace another.

408
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,717
No, not a new director.

409
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,386
Just someone to supervise
the manhunt for Bauer.

410
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,021
I'm recommending Jason Pillar.

411
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,723
Your aide?

412
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,758
He's Bureau-trained,
Madam President.

413
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,660
He was second in command at DIA

414
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,328
during the Daniels'
Administration

415
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:13,664
and he made a name for
himself in Afghanistan,

416
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:18,202
chasing high-value
targets behind enemy lines.

417
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,338
Of course if you
have a better idea,

418
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,140
I'll gladly take a step back.

419
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,042
Madam President.
Just a second.

420
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,177
What is it, Susan?
Mrs. Hassan is finishing up.

421
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,279
I'm on my way.

422
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,487
Look, I'll tell Tim Woods
that I support you

423
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:37,821
making an operational change.

424
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,891
But that's it, Charles--
no more excuses.

425
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,293
Thank you, Madame President.

426
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,994
And allow me to say that...

427
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,833
No, I understand completely.

428
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:53,170
And I appreciate
your confidence in Jason.

429
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,606
How soon can you leave for CTU?

430
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:56,940
Immediately.

431
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,643
Good. I'll handle the
arrangements on this end.

432
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:24,267
Congratulations, Charles.

433
00:23:24,335 --> 00:23:27,103
You have recast yourself
as the great peacemaker.

434
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:29,272
I appreciate your help in
getting me this far, Mikhail.

435
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,474
So tell me what I'm doing here?

436
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:38,715
I had hoped to have this
conversation in private.

437
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:42,018
This is my attaché
Pavel Tokarev.

438
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,953
You can speak freely.

439
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:46,656
He is more than well
acquainted with the situation.

440
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:49,359
Well...

441
00:23:53,697 --> 00:23:56,366
There's been
an unforeseen problem.

442
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:59,369
Apparently I'm not the only one
who can prove that elements

443
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:01,638
in your government conspired
to undermine the peace process.

444
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:02,906
Meaning?

445
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:04,440
Dana Walsh,

446
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:07,076
the mole you installed
inside CTU,

447
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:08,912
claims to have evidence
to that effect.

448
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:10,146
Not possible.

449
00:24:10,214 --> 00:24:11,814
She was handled

450
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:13,683
with complete deniability.

451
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,618
So you say.

452
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:18,121
But, no one in this room

453
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,490
can take the chance
that she's bluffing.

454
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,825
Now... I tried
to contain this.

455
00:24:22,893 --> 00:24:27,063
I had Ms. Walsh detained
and interrogated.

456
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,999
The problem is, Jack Bauer
just broke her out.

457
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,101
Apparently, he has

458
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:33,670
a personal interest

459
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:37,006
in exposing this evidence.

460
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:38,841
Then you need to stop him.

461
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,811
Surely President Taylor is
motivated to do the same.

462
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,613
She is, to a point.

463
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:45,215
But I know Bauer.

464
00:24:45,282 --> 00:24:48,952
And I can promise you he
will never let this go.

465
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:51,387
And I don't think

466
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:53,890
the president is
willing to do what is

467
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,259
ultimately required.

468
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,695
So you expect me
to kill Bauer for you?

469
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:00,063
We both know

470
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,566
you have the covert assets
here to do the job.

471
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:08,371
Maybe I do--

472
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:12,342
but I don't have the resources
to find him, track him.

473
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:13,743
CTU does.

474
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:17,880
And the man in charge of
the search now reports to me.

475
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:21,851
How would this work?

476
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:28,391
This is a closed-channel phone.

477
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,560
It's impossible to intercept.

478
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:33,096
My man at CTU will use
it to feed your people

479
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:37,333
real-time information
as to Bauer's whereabouts.

480
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:42,071
And they can put an end to this
problem, once and for all.

481
00:26:02,493 --> 00:26:04,694
We have to assume that CTU's
been getting my face out there.

482
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:07,397
You're going to have to take
her into the bank on your own.

483
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,765
I'll stand sentry in the lobby.

484
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:10,300
How well do you know
the layout inside?

485
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,301
Vault's in the back.

486
00:26:11,368 --> 00:26:12,669
Tellers are on one side
of the room,

487
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:14,137
loan officers are on the other.

488
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:16,005
One of them's an old buddy
of mine from high school.

489
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:17,440
He was helping us
line up a mortgage.

490
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:19,042
Okay, you keep her inside your
strike zone.

491
00:26:19,109 --> 00:26:21,277
If she sees an opportunity,
she's going to take it.

492
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,879
You trust her for nothing,
you understand?

493
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,414
I'll be fine, Jack.

494
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:27,617
Okay, let's go.

495
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,787
I know you hate me right now,
but I don't really believe

496
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:32,255
you want to see me executed.

497
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,723
Save it.

498
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:37,060
We both saw how close he came to
pulling the trigger back there.

499
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:38,828
That's just what he
wanted you to think.

500
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:40,897
If that's what he
told you, he's lying.

501
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:43,700
Just like he's lying about what
he's going to do with that file.

502
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:46,235
Jack wants to bring the people
responsible for this to justice.

503
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:48,805
Just like me. Who do you think
these people are, Cole?

504
00:26:48,872 --> 00:26:50,640
They're Russian diplomats
with full diplomatic immunity.

505
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,208
They'll be indicted by
the World Court

506
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,010
and hauled up in front
of the Hague.

507
00:26:54,078 --> 00:26:55,678
You really believe Jack Bauer

508
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,347
wants to trust some toothless
international tribunal

509
00:26:57,414 --> 00:26:59,415
to mete out justice to
the people who killed Renee?

510
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:00,483
Keep going.

511
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:02,719
You're hurting me.
You'll live.

512
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:42,690
Confirm all traffic camera feeds
are being ported through us.

513
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:44,425
Up-res and route everything
through facial recognition.

514
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:47,761
Parameter-matching on
Jack, Cole, or Dana.

515
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:50,898
We don't have anywhere near the
bandwidth to do that citywide.

516
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:54,368
Then job the overflow to NSA.

517
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:57,238
Where are we on setting up
the search grid with NYPD?

518
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:58,672
In process.

519
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,474
They're giving us all
the personnel they can spare,

520
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:01,709
But they're going
on record that,

521
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:03,644
unless we narrow down
the search area,

522
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,580
it's "needle in
a haystack" time.

523
00:28:08,283 --> 00:28:09,483
O'Brian.

524
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:12,219
There's a Jason Pillar
on his way to see you.

525
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:13,888
Pillar?
Yeah.

526
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:15,890
Tim Wood's office
pre-cleared him.

527
00:28:15,957 --> 00:28:17,291
Send him up.

528
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,760
He's already on his way.
He wouldn't wait.

529
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:22,162
Never heard of this guy.
Who is he?

530
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,497
He was second in command at DIA

531
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:24,832
under the Daniel's
administration.

532
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,268
He's been working
the private sector for years.

533
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:30,971
Ms. O'Brian, Jason Pillar.

534
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,073
This is my associate
Eden Linley.

535
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:34,742
Okay.

536
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,143
So why are you here?

537
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:38,012
Frankly, the
White House is unhappy

538
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,281
with the way the manhunt
for Jack Bauer's been handled.

539
00:28:40,348 --> 00:28:41,916
President Taylor's issued
an executive order

540
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:44,018
placing me in charge
of the search from here on.

541
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:46,353
What?! You'll retain your
position as acting director

542
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:47,955
for the time being

543
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:49,690
with authority over all
over CTU operations.

544
00:28:49,758 --> 00:28:51,959
Arlo, give us a minute?

545
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:53,794
You got it.

546
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,197
This doesn't make any sense.

547
00:28:57,265 --> 00:28:58,432
Excuse me?

548
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,000
Why are you here?

549
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:02,102
You have nothing to do
with Homeland Security anymore.

550
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,871
Ms. O'Brian,
all you need to know

551
00:29:03,939 --> 00:29:05,606
is that I'm here under
the president's orders.

552
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:06,874
Well, you're wasting your time.

553
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:08,475
We've done everything
possible to find Jack.

554
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,777
If that were true,

555
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:11,712
then the trap you set
for Bauer would have worked.

556
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,847
It's not that simple.
Instead, you were more concerned

557
00:29:13,915 --> 00:29:15,382
with making sure
he didn't get hurt.

558
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,617
It's all in the hourlies.

559
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:18,118
In fact, the last
operational command

560
00:29:18,186 --> 00:29:20,821
you sent to Agent Ortiz was,

561
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,823
"Remember, non-lethal force."

562
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,658
Not exactly the
appropriate sentiment

563
00:29:24,726 --> 00:29:27,695
when the president told you how
important it was that Bauer be stopped.

564
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,196
The president doesn't want
Jack to be hurt.

565
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:31,498
She knows what he'd done for
this country-- and so do you.

566
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:34,735
What Bauer's doing will destroy
the peace agreement.

567
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:37,605
And the president
cannot let that happen.

568
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:41,809
It's time to take off
the kid gloves.

569
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:44,478
We need all protocols
and encryption keys

570
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:46,313
transferred to us immediately.

571
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:49,183
As well as system overrides
and administrative privileges.

572
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,718
Understood?

573
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:54,221
Ms. O'Brian?

574
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,959
Yeah, understood.

575
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,895
Re-code the all-agency
bulletin on Bauer

576
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:04,531
to "armed and dangerous"
level eight.

577
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:08,435
And change the use of force
guidelines to "unrestricted."

578
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,257
Here we go.

579
00:30:30,325 --> 00:30:31,558
Just make yourselves
comfortable.

580
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:33,727
I'll be right back with
your safety deposit box.

581
00:30:33,795 --> 00:30:35,229
Thanks.
Thank you.

582
00:30:35,296 --> 00:30:37,798
Let's go.

583
00:30:45,907 --> 00:30:47,241
Something funny?

584
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,880
This. You and me--
it's not the way

585
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:54,848
that it was supposed
to turn out.

586
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:57,785
I'm serious, Cole.

587
00:30:57,852 --> 00:31:02,122
Now that this is all over,
you deserve to hear the truth.

588
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,125
It's a little late
for the truth.

589
00:31:05,193 --> 00:31:07,227
If you're even capable of it.

590
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:09,430
You don't have to believe me.

591
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:11,432
I was a kid.

592
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:14,201
A kid with five years
of prison behind me

593
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:15,903
and no future to speak of.

594
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,106
A guy came to see me--
a Russian.

595
00:31:19,174 --> 00:31:23,744
Said that he could
give me a fresh start.

596
00:31:23,812 --> 00:31:27,214
I had absolutely no idea
what I was getting myself into.

597
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:29,483
You could have come clean
anytime you wanted.

598
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:32,619
And go back to jail.
Not a chance.

599
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:35,889
Look, I know that
it's not an excuse,

600
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:38,992
but ever since I met you
I have been trying

601
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,563
to dig myself out
of this mess that I'm in.

602
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,567
You're right--
I don't believe you.

603
00:31:46,634 --> 00:31:49,503
It's why I made that video file,
Cole.

604
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:51,772
I was going to use it
as leverage

605
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,874
to get the Russians
to leave us alone.

606
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:55,008
Us?
Yes.

607
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:57,010
There is no "us," Dana.

608
00:31:57,078 --> 00:31:59,680
There never was.

609
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:02,316
It was a lie from the beginning.

610
00:32:02,383 --> 00:32:04,852
That is not true.

611
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:07,354
Just stop playing me.
It's not going to work.

612
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:09,423
I am not playing you.

613
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:11,692
I loved you.

614
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,999
Here we go-- 14-05.

615
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,801
I'll be outside.

616
00:32:20,869 --> 00:32:22,836
Thank you, Brian.

617
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:29,109
No.

618
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:40,788
You never give up, do you?

619
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,164
You guys all right?

620
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:51,331
Hey, Cole...

621
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:45,085
911. What is your emergency?

622
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:47,387
Hi. I'm at First Unity

623
00:33:47,455 --> 00:33:48,889
Savings Bank on Lexington.

624
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:50,557
There's a guy by the front door.

625
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,726
I-I think I saw
him on the news.

626
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:55,696
I think he has a gun.

627
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:57,097
Oh, my God.

628
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:58,465
He's looking in my direction.

629
00:33:58,533 --> 00:33:59,533
Oh, God!

630
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:26,516
Great. As quickly
as you can.

631
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:27,450
The 911 comm center

632
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,785
just confirmed the call.

633
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:30,620
Bauer was supposedly
I.D.'d by someone

634
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,956
at the First Unity Savings
branch on Lexington.

635
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:34,624
Supposedly?
What do you mean supposedly?

636
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:35,959
It means all we have

637
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:37,560
is the caller's word
that she recognized Jack

638
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:38,661
from the news coverage.

639
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:40,096
We don't have
secondary confirmation.

640
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:42,031
Then get it for me.
Request access to

641
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:43,766
the bank's video
surveillance system.

642
00:34:43,834 --> 00:34:45,301
I've already contacted them.

643
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:46,603
I'm just trying to connect.

644
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,738
Having trouble getting
the CTU comm protocols to work.

645
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:49,906
You, what's your name?

646
00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:51,040
Devon Rosenthal.

647
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,442
Help her.

648
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,043
Don't look at O'Brian.

649
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:55,345
I'm giving you the order.

650
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:56,446
Just follow it.

651
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:58,681
All right,
let's see what's going on.

652
00:34:58,749 --> 00:35:01,751
All right, this is the...

653
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:02,752
Oh, good.

654
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,187
Got it?

655
00:35:08,726 --> 00:35:09,759
Here we go.

656
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:10,927
Full access to

657
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:14,130
the bank's
video surveillance system.

658
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:30,179
We got him.

659
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:32,181
Call NYPD and make sure they
realize the priority here.

660
00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:33,583
And tell them I want to be

661
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:35,251
looped in their
operation in real time.

662
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:37,320
Got it.
Be right back.

663
00:35:48,265 --> 00:35:49,332
Yes?

664
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,567
We found Bauer.

665
00:35:50,634 --> 00:35:51,601
He's at a bank.

666
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:53,603
First Unity Savings
on Lexington.

667
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:55,238
How do you know?

668
00:35:55,306 --> 00:35:58,374
A 911 call confirmed
by video surveillance.

669
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:02,278
Then the police are
already on their way.

670
00:36:02,346 --> 00:36:03,279
Can't help that.

671
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:04,581
But once they have Bauer,

672
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:06,049
I'll find out
where they're holding him.

673
00:36:06,116 --> 00:36:07,750
You'll have to take him out
while he's in custody.

674
00:36:07,818 --> 00:36:09,819
I'll wait for your call.

675
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:16,225
Brown jacket, freeze!
Police!

676
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:17,226
Get your hands up!

677
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:18,661
Get your hands up now!

678
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:19,662
Hands up!

679
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,497
On your knees.

680
00:36:21,565 --> 00:36:23,333
Get down on your knees.

681
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,834
Put your hands
behind your head.

682
00:36:24,902 --> 00:36:26,369
Interlock your fingers,
thumbs out.

683
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:27,704
Do not move.

684
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:31,975
We got him.

685
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,013
Take it easy.

686
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:38,247
You got no chance.

687
00:36:38,315 --> 00:36:39,282
We got units coming in.

688
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:40,383
Shut up!

689
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:42,051
You know who I am?

690
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:44,754
Do you know who I am?!

691
00:36:44,822 --> 00:36:46,055
Yes.

692
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:47,523
I don't want
to kill your partner,

693
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:48,992
but I will if I have to.

694
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:50,493
So here's what we're gonna do:

695
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:52,929
Slowly, you're gonna
put your gun down.

696
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:56,666
Drop your weapon now!

697
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:01,437
Kick it over to me.

698
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,142
I'm sorry.

699
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,287
Call an ambulance.

700
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:19,422
Call an ambulance now.

701
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,491
Tell them
two police officers are down.

702
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:04,487
Don't you move!

703
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:10,860
Slowly... turn around
and head back to me.

704
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:14,030
Now!

705
00:40:19,636 --> 00:40:21,370
What happened to Cole?

706
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:23,573
Did you kill him?

707
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,909
I could never do that.

708
00:40:26,977 --> 00:40:30,112
Where's the evidence?

709
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,614
It's in my pocket.

710
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:33,349
Show me.

711
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,351
Jack, we can make a deal.

712
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:37,220
Show me!

713
00:40:45,662 --> 00:40:49,465
I want you to slowly
put it down on the floor.

714
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:10,119
Jack...

715
00:41:12,422 --> 00:41:15,157
Tell me what I can do.

716
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:21,797
Nothing.

717
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,067
Nothing.

718
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:35,068
