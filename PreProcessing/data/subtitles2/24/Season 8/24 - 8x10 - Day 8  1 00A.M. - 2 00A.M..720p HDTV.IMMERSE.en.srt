1
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,492
I don't want to see either
one of you ever again.

2
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,026
Do we have a deal or not?

3
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:20,897
<i>Yeah, we got a deal.</i>

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,133
I'm going after him.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,134
We're done.

6
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,668
We're just getting started.

7
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,773
Jenny!

8
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:37,180
We need to talk about
you having Tarin arrested.

9
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:39,350
I know you consider
Tarin a friend.

10
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:40,818
We are more than friends.

11
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:43,120
<i>We're in love.</i>

12
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:46,257
You've been carrying
on with this man...

13
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:47,793
behind my back?

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,795
Who are these men, Samir?

15
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,028
These are men I
have recruited.

16
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:53,197
We can't get the rods
out of the country,

17
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,333
so let's use them as
a radiological bomb.

18
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,837
<i>Then we'll show the
Americans how strong we are.</i>

19
00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:04,076
Samir!

20
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:05,278
Over here!

21
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:07,547
There are people chasing me.

22
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:09,081
They have the rods
you are looking for.

23
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,350
I thought you had the rods.

24
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:12,386
They turned against me.

25
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:13,653
Just get me out of here.

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,021
We'll get you out, Mr. Hassan.

27
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:16,489
When things get
this colossally screwed up

28
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:18,758
people look for
someone to blame.

29
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,694
<i>So what
have you got in mind?</i>

30
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:22,696
Renee Walker- she killed
one of our main leads.

31
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:24,364
You're talking about a
woman who put her life

32
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:25,866
on the line when
she didn't have to.

33
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:27,535
Well, someone has to
pay for this, Brian.

34
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:30,338
I'm sending someone over
from Justice- Kristin Smith.

35
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:31,973
She'll take care
of everything.

36
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:35,343
They're setting you up-
don't say another word.

37
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:37,245
It's too late.

38
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:39,180
This is over.
We're leaving now.

39
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:40,181
Hands in the air.

40
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,483
Do it now!

41
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,318
<i>You offering</i>

42
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:44,920
to bring in Farhad? Yes.

43
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:48,357
If you drop the criminal
investigation against Renee Walker.

44
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:51,560
If we do this, Jack, it's
not for one rescue operation,

45
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,029
it's till this whole thing

46
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:55,098
is over and done.

47
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:57,801
Deal.

48
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,918
We're about to transport
him to the embassy.

49
00:02:13,986 --> 00:02:15,586
You have two minutes.

50
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,121
Thank you.

51
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:24,228
Bashir, clear the room.

52
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:26,898
Tarin, did they hurt you?

53
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,400
Not yet.

54
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,736
They won't until they
get me to our embassy.

55
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,504
I tried to reason
with my father,

56
00:02:32,572 --> 00:02:33,972
but he wouldn't listen.

57
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,410
He thinks you're involved in
the conspiracy with his brother.

58
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:40,880
Even after I told him about
us, he doesn't trust you.

59
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:42,448
You told him about us?

60
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:44,552
I hoped it would
change his mind.

61
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:48,054
But if anything, it's made
things worse between us.

62
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:51,524
Come closer.

63
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,065
Listen to me, Kayla,

64
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,500
there is a way out of this.

65
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:02,404
There are a few men still loyal
to me- Bashir is one of them.

66
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,607
He's agreed to help me escape.

67
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:07,842
As soon as he's able, Bashir
will slip me a handcuff key,

68
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,078
and he's placed a gun in
the car for me to find.

69
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:11,112
You won't hurt anyone?

70
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,048
The gun is so I won't have to.

71
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,350
Once I'm free, I
have a place to stay

72
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:16,885
until the Americans
grant me asylum.

73
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:20,356
Kayla... I want
you to come with me.

74
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:23,292
Meet me at the Teodore Hotel.

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,294
Promise me you'll come.

76
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,532
Tarin, we need to go.

77
00:03:47,886 --> 00:03:50,722
Cole, he's dead!

78
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,291
Just go.

79
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,360
What?

80
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,660
Just go.

81
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:58,329
Nobody knows you had
anything to do with this.

82
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,865
It's my fault.

83
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,400
I lied about everything.

84
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:04,036
Who I am, what I've done.

85
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:06,705
I'll call the police.

86
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:09,875
I deserve to take
the blame for this.

87
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,285
What's done is done.

88
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:20,754
We're cleaning this up,

89
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:22,722
and no one's ever gonna
know what happened.

90
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,290
I don't want you involved.

91
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:25,726
I'm already involved.

92
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:29,764
We're gonna strip down his
van so it can't be I.D.'d.

93
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,333
We'll dump the
bodies in the swamp.

94
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:35,437
Hey. Hey!

95
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:38,540
They're scum, Dana, and
no one's gonna miss 'em.

96
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:41,877
You want to go to prison for
the rest of your life? For them?!

97
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:43,512
Get started on the van.

98
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:45,814
I'll go get the other one.

99
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:52,922
Mr. Hastings,
the president's on the line.

100
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,224
Thank you. This is Hastings.

101
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:56,959
Mr. Hastings, I'm
here with Rob Weiss.

102
00:04:57,027 --> 00:04:58,661
I was told you
have urgent news.

103
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,763
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,899
We received a call
from Farhad Hassan.

105
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:02,966
Farhad?

106
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:04,634
Yes. As we suspected,
he was trying

107
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:07,303
to smuggle the nuclear
rods out of the country.

108
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:10,107
The people he's working
with have turned against him.

109
00:05:10,175 --> 00:05:12,443
What do we know?
Well, Farhad believes

110
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,978
they want to use the rods
to construct a dirty bomb

111
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,182
and set it off somewhere
here in New York City.

112
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,184
Why would they do this?

113
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,252
Between Hassan's
crackdowns and CTU,

114
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,088
we've backed them
into a corner.

115
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,757
This is their response.

116
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,092
Do you believe him?

117
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,358
Yes, I do.

118
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:28,893
Farhad is turning himself in.

119
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,296
He's agreed to help
us prevent this attack.

120
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,497
Where is Farhad now?

121
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,632
He's in a warehouse

122
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,601
just outside the city
near Forest Hills.

123
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,137
I've enlisted Jack
Bauer to lock him down.

124
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,205
Now, Madam President,

125
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,973
the men who turned
against Farhad

126
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,176
are covert assets
for the I.R.K.

127
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:44,845
Now, if we can get access

128
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,980
to the I.R.K.
intelligence files,

129
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,816
Farhad may be able to
help us I.D. these men.

130
00:05:49,884 --> 00:05:51,585
It will put us
that much closer

131
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,688
to tracking them down. Those
files are the lifeblood of Hassan's

132
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:56,690
intelligence operation-
he'll never hand them over.

133
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:58,658
Especially in his
current frame of mind.

134
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,194
Hell, the man's gone
off the deep end.

135
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,797
Well, maybe this will
pull him out of it.

136
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:03,965
Tell Hassan we have

137
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:06,033
found his brother and
I need to speak to him

138
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,035
immediately.

139
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,036
And contact

140
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:09,438
Tim Woods at Homeland.

141
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:10,773
Have him put
together a briefing.

142
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,808
<i>I need to exactly
what we're facing</i>

143
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,510
if, God forbid,
this attack happens.

144
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,045
Thank you, Mr. Hastings.

145
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,547
I'll be in the
counsel chamber.

146
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:20,449
Yes, Madam President.

147
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,886
Mr. Weiss.

148
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:24,988
Yeah?

149
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,022
Are we alone?

150
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,123
Yeah. What is it?

151
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:31,661
I want to let you
know that I've decided

152
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,998
not to pursue charges
against Renee Walker.

153
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,199
What?

154
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,200
Why not? I told you...

155
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:38,935
We have a lot
more to worry about

156
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:40,170
right now than blaming Walker.

157
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:41,639
Walker murdered
a valuable lead

158
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:44,008
that might have gotten
us to those nuclear rods.

159
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:45,509
You're not hearing me.

160
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,112
We have a new lead
now- Farhad Hassan-

161
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,348
and that is what
I am pursuing.

162
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,019
You want to replace me as
head of CTU, be my guest.

163
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:55,754
But until you do,

164
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:57,722
stay the hell out of my way.

165
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,525
Hastings, you're
making... I'll let you know

166
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:01,259
when Bauer reaches Farhad.

167
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,509
Okay, Farhad Hassan is located on
the northeast corner of the warehouse.

168
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:18,312
We're gonna have to move
fast, because he's injured.

169
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,081
King, Lynch, you're gonna
go in from the south.

170
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,416
Owen and I will
cover your flank.

171
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,017
Understood. As soon as we've

172
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:26,086
got him locked down, we're
gonna initiate our interrogation.

173
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,287
CTU's gonna upload files on

174
00:07:27,355 --> 00:07:28,288
probable suspects-
I need that

175
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:29,389
available and on a computer

176
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:30,724
as soon as possible. Yes, sir.

177
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,994
Mr. Bauer, we're getting
a call routed through CTU.

178
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,028
It's Farhad Hassan.

179
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,830
Put it on speaker.

180
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,398
This is Jack Bauer. Go ahead.

181
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,666
How close are you?

182
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,401
Ten minutes out. Are you okay?

183
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,838
There's someone here.

184
00:07:44,474 --> 00:07:45,875
They're close.

185
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:47,775
They're looking for me.

186
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:51,013
Please... hurry.

187
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:57,821
Madam President.

188
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:59,756
I'm told you have my brother.

189
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:00,991
What happened?

190
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:02,158
Please.

191
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:07,231
He called CTU

192
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,933
and surrendered himself.

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't understand.

194
00:08:10,568 --> 00:08:12,836
The men that Farhad
was working with

195
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,105
turned against him,

196
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,440
and they have taken
the nuclear rods.

197
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:18,643
Now, he believes that
they intend to construct

198
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,711
a dirty bomb to
attack this city.

199
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,346
Now, apparently,
these men are members

200
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:23,982
of your covert
intelligence operations

201
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,517
here in the United States.

202
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:28,020
I find that hard to believe.

203
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,988
Well, your brother
has no reason to lie.

204
00:08:30,057 --> 00:08:32,292
By turning himself in, he's
facing the death penalty.

205
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:35,260
We have to assume
he's telling the truth.

206
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,297
I need for you to give
us intelligence files

207
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,934
for every asset you
have in this country

208
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:44,137
so Farhad can identify
these terrorists.

209
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:47,140
Mr. President,
I have given you

210
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,776
a great deal of latitude

211
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:50,844
to sort out your
domestic situation,

212
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:53,881
<i>and now there is a
threat to my homeland,</i>

213
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:55,815
and I need your cooperation.

214
00:08:55,884 --> 00:08:58,686
I suggest you turn
Farhad over to me

215
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:00,821
<i>and let my people
question him.</i>

216
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,222
We'll get the
answers you need.

217
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,325
There's no time for thate'a Cm

218
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,127
moving on Farhad as we speak.

219
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,929
They need to
question him on site.

220
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:09,664
I need the files.

221
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:12,567
What you're asking is a
serious breach of our security.

222
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,036
I understand that.

223
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,571
But you need to understand

224
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,274
that if this radiological
attack takes place,

225
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,909
I will be forced to retaliate.

226
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:26,082
You would attack...
my country?

227
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,118
I will have no choice.

228
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,858
I need those files...

229
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:37,060
and I need them now.

230
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:46,136
I'll call my acting
head of security.

231
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:49,073
You'll get the files
in a few minutes.

232
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,975
Thank you.

233
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:16,770
I want you to know,
Tarin, that I don't believe

234
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:18,605
you are guilty of treason.

235
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:21,841
But I have no choice
but to follow orders.

236
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,345
You don't have to
explain yourself, Nabeel.

237
00:10:24,413 --> 00:10:26,614
I would do the same
thing in your position.

238
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,750
I don't hold any
of this against you.

239
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:34,088
Whatever happens to me,

240
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:35,723
you must not blame yourself.

241
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,591
Never forget that.

242
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,394
I appreciate that.

243
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:47,670
Don't move. What
are you doing?

244
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:49,205
Nabeel, give me
your weapon now.

245
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,473
Slowly, two fingers.

246
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,007
Come on.

247
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,380
Driver, pull over here.

248
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:05,189
Remove your seat belts.

249
00:11:05,256 --> 00:11:07,991
Put your hands on
your head, both of you.

250
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:15,332
Get out of the car now.

251
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,934
Don't move.

252
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:18,202
Give me the keys.

253
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:23,975
Put your hands down.
Tarin, don't do this.

254
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:25,977
You'll only make things
worse for yourself.

255
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,046
You know what they'll
do to me at our embassy.

256
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:29,415
It can't be any worse.

257
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,488
It's President Hassan.

258
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,123
Give it to me.

259
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,858
Come on!

260
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:43,829
Let's go. In the back.

261
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:49,002
Open it up.

262
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,371
Take out your cuffs.
Lock yourselves down.

263
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:02,883
Nabeel isn't answering.

264
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,185
Where is he?

265
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:06,287
Transporting Tarin
to the embassy.

266
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:08,022
Keep trying to reach
him on his mobile.

267
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,057
If he doesn't answer,

268
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,627
send a security
team to track him.

269
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:12,995
Yes, sir.

270
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:14,196
And contact Colonel Al Jhanis.

271
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:15,597
Tell him on my authority

272
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:17,666
to give CTU access to
the files they requested.

273
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:19,001
Yes, sir.

274
00:12:33,751 --> 00:12:35,018
Hello.

275
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:36,186
It's me. Where are you?

276
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:37,688
I'm leaving the
U.N. right now.

277
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,256
Is everything all right?

278
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,158
Yes, it worked.
Meet me at the hotel.

279
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:42,726
I'll be there in ten minutes.

280
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:45,229
I love you, Kayla.

281
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,864
I'll see you soon.

282
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:05,618
Go ahead, Mr. Hastings.

283
00:13:05,673 --> 00:13:07,107
Farhad, are you there?

284
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:10,076
Yes, yes, I'm here.

285
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:11,978
Our field team is approaching
the south entrance.

286
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,548
Stay where you are until
they secure the site.

287
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:16,650
He's almost on me.

288
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:18,285
I can't stay here.

289
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:20,555
Do not move until they
lock down that shooter.

290
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:22,457
Do you understand me?

291
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,128
Farhad?

292
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,964
Farhad?!

293
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,633
Farhad, talk to me.

294
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:57,660
Over here!

295
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,299
Medic! Come on! Medic!

296
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,868
JACK: That's him,
that's Farhad.

297
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:05,769
Owen, take your team
and sweep the area.

298
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:07,638
Chloe, we've got Farhad,
but he's been hit.

299
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,106
I need those
files immediately.

300
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:11,042
I.R.K. intelligence
just sent them over.

301
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,110
Good.

302
00:14:20,186 --> 00:14:21,386
Yes?

303
00:14:21,454 --> 00:14:22,654
It's done.

304
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,556
Farhad is no longer a problem.

305
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:25,724
Are you sure?

306
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,260
I shot him twice, but
the police arrived,

307
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,828
and I had to get out of there.

308
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:31,197
You know where to find us.

309
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:32,732
Yes.

310
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,271
Mr. Bauer.

311
00:14:37,338 --> 00:14:39,206
Speak to me. We have two large
caliber slugs to the abdomen.

312
00:14:39,274 --> 00:14:41,475
He's bleeding out. I don't think
he's going to make it to the hospital.

313
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,643
Do whatever you have
to do to stabilize him.

314
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,712
We need to talk
to him now. Go!

315
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:48,248
This is B team.

316
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:51,685
We found their truck, but
there's no sign of the rods.

317
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:08,603
Let me know as soon as
these files are uploaded.

318
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,706
Mr. Hassan, in a few seconds,

319
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:12,875
I'm going to show you
photographs of covert operatives

320
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:14,877
working for your country
within the United States.

321
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:17,012
I need you to identify the
men who stole the nuclear rods

322
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,582
from you. Can you
do that for us?

323
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:19,616
Yes.

324
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:21,518
Are those files uploaded yet?!

325
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:22,953
Almost. Come on!

326
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,454
Blood pressure's dropping.
We've got a rapid heartbeat.

327
00:15:24,522 --> 00:15:25,956
What the hell's happening?

328
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:27,725
He's going into shock.
Give me 20 cc's epinephrine.

329
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,292
You keep that man alive,
do you understand me?

330
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,461
Keep him alive!
Let me do my job!

331
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,137
The telepresence conference

332
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,473
is ready, Madam
President. Thank you.

333
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,949
Good to see you, gentlemen.

334
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,019
Madam President,
Brian Hastings at CTU

335
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,787
has brought us up to speed,

336
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,756
and we're ready to review
some specifics with you.

337
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,091
Good. I'm listening.

338
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,461
If you would refer
to your monitor...

339
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,430
and the diagram of
Midtown Manhattan.

340
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,165
According to CTU,

341
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,068
the stolen nuclear rods have
a maximum explosive yield

342
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:10,270
of 300 pounds.

343
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:11,805
That's enough
radiological material

344
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,540
to contaminate approximately
one square mile.

345
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:15,808
If the device were detonated

346
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:18,545
in a more densely
populated area of Manhattan,

347
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,147
we could be looking
at casualties

348
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:23,083
in the tens of thousands.

349
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:24,585
Dr. Landry?

350
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:27,255
Most of the deaths would be
from severe radiation poisoning.

351
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:29,958
The remainder of the
victims would expire

352
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:31,292
from radiation
induced illnesses.

353
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,594
Primarily leukemia

354
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:33,928
and other cancers.

355
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:36,632
We also have to consider
that the affected area

356
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:37,766
would be rendered
uninhabitable

357
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,268
for approximately 40 years.

358
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:43,171
Obviously a citywide evacuation
is out of the question.

359
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,940
That's right. There are
millions of people on this island

360
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,142
with few points of egress.

361
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,510
It would take days
to get them out.

362
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,745
Not to mention that going
public with this information

363
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,214
would cause mass panic.

364
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:54,051
I agree. We need to keep this
threat from the public for now.

365
00:16:54,118 --> 00:16:58,622
Focus our efforts on making sure
that this attack never happens.

366
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,491
CTU believes the nuclear rods
are still outside the city,

367
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:01,825
so they're fortifying
radiation detection efforts

368
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:03,193
at the bridges and tunnels.

369
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:06,496
We are also hardening
high value targets

370
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:09,199
such as the financial
district, landmarks, subways.

371
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,803
But we can't ignore that the
U.N. may also be a target.

372
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,372
Give the danger, I think we should
evacuate the entire building.

373
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,774
We can resume the conference
from a safe location.

374
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:23,482
All right, inform the
delegates of the situation.

375
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,117
Thank you, gentlemen.

376
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:36,863
CTU has your
brother in custody.

377
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,331
He's been shot.

378
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:39,933
They're trying
to stabilize him.

379
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,571
Yes?

380
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:45,473
Sir, Agent Rahim
is calling for you.

381
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,741
He says he's located Nabeel.

382
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:47,907
Put him through.

383
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:51,479
Mr. President, we found
Nabeel and his driver

384
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:53,047
locked down in the
back of their vehicle.

385
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,715
Tarin has escaped. What?!

386
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,383
Nabeel wishes to
speak to you, sir.

387
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,785
Yes, okay, put him on.

388
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:03,592
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

389
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,660
Tarin had the gun with him.

390
00:18:05,728 --> 00:18:06,928
I don't understand how.

391
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,098
Are you saying somebody
helped him escape?

392
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:10,766
It would seem so.

393
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,267
But Mr. President,

394
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:14,236
there's something
else you need to know.

395
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:19,107
Right after he escaped, I
overheard Tarin on the phone.

396
00:18:19,176 --> 00:18:22,912
I believe he
was speaking to your daughter.

397
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:29,820
Kayla? Are you
sure about this?

398
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:30,821
Yes, sir.

399
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:32,990
It sounded like he
was going to meet her

400
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:35,526
somewhere in the city.

401
00:18:57,384 --> 00:18:59,985
Kayla, call me back.

402
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:02,454
Call me back, Kayla.

403
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,401
Come inside.

404
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:21,675
Oh, thank God,
you're all right.

405
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:27,048
Oh!

406
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:28,950
I contacted an
American lawyer I know

407
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,385
who's an expert at
international law.

408
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,388
He's agreed to meet
us in two hours.

409
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,991
This is such a
terrible situation.

410
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:37,893
Yet I've never felt so happy.

411
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:39,795
I feel the same.

412
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,572
Mm!

413
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:56,045
Mr. Bauer, we did our best.

414
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,647
He didn't make it.

415
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,817
I know you did. Thanks.

416
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:01,685
We swept the area,
sir. It's clear.

417
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:03,087
No hostiles. No trace
of the nuclear rods.

418
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:04,388
Copy that.

419
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:05,755
CTU, this is Bauer.

420
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:07,858
We lost him. Farhad's dead.

421
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:08,993
Damn it.

422
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,527
I still think we've
got another play.

423
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:13,631
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't
confirm that he was killed.

424
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,267
We came up on him too fast.

425
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,235
They don't know how
badly he was wounded.

426
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:18,436
So what are you
proposing, Jack?

427
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:19,871
I'm saying that we use
Farhad as dead bait.

428
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,673
Leak it to the press that
we've got him in custody,

429
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:22,942
and he survived.

430
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,176
We're transporting
him to a local hospital

431
00:20:24,244 --> 00:20:25,444
where authorities are
going to question him.

432
00:20:25,512 --> 00:20:27,046
They'll have to
make a move on him.

433
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:29,048
He knows too much.
Sounds like a Hail Mary.

434
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:30,916
Right now it's the
only play we've got.

435
00:20:30,984 --> 00:20:32,919
But if they make a move on
Farhad, which I think they will,

436
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,287
we'll be waiting for them.

437
00:20:34,354 --> 00:20:36,555
Mr. Hastings, you
said you wanted me in

438
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,391
till this was
resolved. This is it.

439
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,159
We have Hassan's
intelligence files.

440
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,695
We can scan and
cross-reference

441
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:43,030
with facial
recognition software.

442
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:45,432
Maybe spot the terrorists
before they attack.

443
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,034
All right, Jack.

444
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:49,270
It's not exactly
standard procedure

445
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:51,439
ferrying a dead man's
body across the city,

446
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,106
but I'm willing
to give it a shot.

447
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:54,308
We'll figure out
a hospital route

448
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,542
and put a press
statement together.

449
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:56,978
You get ready on your end.

450
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,346
Okay, thank you.

451
00:20:58,414 --> 00:20:59,714
Get that body
ready for transport.

452
00:20:59,782 --> 00:21:01,082
Owen, assemble your men.

453
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,583
Briefing in less than five.

454
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,046
rial one is in position
over the route, sir.

455
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:15,783
Sniper teams have checked
in. They're all in place.

456
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:26,327
Come on, hurry up.

457
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,035
Let's go.

458
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,012
It's over, Dana.

459
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,313
Let's get the other body

460
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:16,314
and get cleaned up

461
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:19,450
before we head back to CTU.

462
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,227
Cole, what about us?

463
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:32,932
I don't know.

464
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:42,943
We have just received word

465
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:45,445
from New York
Counterterrorist Headquarters

466
00:22:45,513 --> 00:22:47,113
that Farhad
Hassan- brother of

467
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:50,116
Islamic Republic of Kamistan
President Omar Hassan-

468
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:52,485
has been found alive.

469
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:55,422
We're told that Farhad
Hassan contacted CTU

470
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,592
a short while ago and agreed
to turn him over to authorities.

471
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:58,593
Farhad is alive.

472
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,161
What?

473
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,329
CTU responded immediately,

474
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,097
but when they arrived,
they found him shot.

475
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,767
No word yet on how
Farhad Hassan sustained

476
00:23:05,835 --> 00:23:07,002
these gunshot injuries,

477
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,705
but we do know that he
is expected to survive,

478
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,273
and he's being transported

479
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:14,009
to St. Julian's Hospital
under heightened security

480
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,978
where he will be
questioned by authorities.

481
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:18,113
This is impossible.

482
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:19,481
Farhad Hassan has been on the
run since early this evening...

483
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:21,216
I shot him twice.

484
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:23,620
But you didn't make
sure he was dead.

485
00:23:23,687 --> 00:23:25,521
I told you I didn't have time!

486
00:23:27,524 --> 00:23:31,561
I'll make this
right. I'll go back.

487
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,663
You're too conspicuous.

488
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,231
Farhad will be
heavily protected.

489
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:36,666
But if Farhad talks,

490
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:39,770
the authorities could find us
before we can build the weapon.

491
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,275
You think we don't
know the implications?

492
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:48,213
We're sending Marcos.

493
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,215
His mother's American.

494
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:51,750
They won't suspect him.

495
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:54,019
He's in the truck
with the rods.

496
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:56,055
The peace treaty
may now be halted

497
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,089
due to a series of
alleged terrorist attacks.

498
00:24:15,877 --> 00:24:17,911
Hello?

499
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:19,246
Mom, it's me.

500
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:21,081
Marcos?

501
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:23,817
Yes. Listen, I
can't talk for long.

502
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:25,285
What is it? Are you okay?

503
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:26,787
I'm fine, Mom.

504
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:29,589
I need you to do
something for me.

505
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:30,625
It's very important.

506
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:32,827
Okay.

507
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:34,128
Okay. What is it?

508
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:37,899
I need you to get up right
now and leave the city.

509
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:38,934
Go to Aunt Shelley's.

510
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:39,935
Aunt Shelley's?!

511
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:41,470
Just do it for me, okay?

512
00:24:41,538 --> 00:24:42,471
Don't ask me why.

513
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:44,172
Leave right now.

514
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:46,107
Marcos,

515
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:47,409
this is crazy...

516
00:24:47,477 --> 00:24:48,744
I'm not gonna
leave the apartment

517
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,579
in the middle of the
night for no reason.

518
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:53,449
There's a reason; I just can't
tell you what it is right now.

519
00:24:53,517 --> 00:24:55,552
Please, Mom, do this for me.

520
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,020
Where are you?

521
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,888
Don't worry about me.

522
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,957
Well, I'm not going
anywhere unless I know

523
00:25:01,025 --> 00:25:02,092
you're all right.

524
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,761
I'll meet you at
Aunt Shelley's,

525
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:04,762
and I'll explain everything.

526
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:07,297
Go, Mom, now.

527
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:11,268
Okay, I'm leaving.

528
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,272
I have to go. I love you.

529
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,118
Are you ready, my friend?

530
00:25:27,354 --> 00:25:28,688
Yes.

531
00:25:28,755 --> 00:25:30,422
Good.

532
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,690
It's time.

533
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,595
You need to keep him
looking alive the entire way.

534
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:39,065
You're all clear on
what you need to do?

535
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,133
Yes, sir.

536
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,768
Jack, it's Hastings. Go ahead.

537
00:25:41,835 --> 00:25:43,269
We've coordinated
with news outlets.

538
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:45,738
They put out the false
report of Farhad's arrest

539
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:46,940
and transport to the hospital

540
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,941
for questioning.

541
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,810
The hook has been baited.

542
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:51,278
Okay. The most
logical place for them

543
00:25:51,345 --> 00:25:52,612
to attack is when
we're en route.

544
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,148
That's where we're gonna
be our most vulnerable.

545
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:56,450
Well, NYPD and SWAT
are mobilizing now.

546
00:25:56,518 --> 00:25:57,785
They're going to be embedded

547
00:25:57,852 --> 00:25:59,620
at strategic points
along the way.

548
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:01,889
They're also securing
St. Julian's Hospital.

549
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:03,625
Copy that. Tell
the support teams

550
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,560
it is imperative that we
take these terrorists alive.

551
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:06,895
They've been briefed, Jack.

552
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:07,896
Okay, we're moving out.

553
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:09,264
You two take the follow van.

554
00:26:09,332 --> 00:26:11,100
Owen, you're with
me in the ambulance.

555
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:12,768
Copy that.

556
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:15,304
Hey, are you all right?

557
00:26:15,371 --> 00:26:16,871
Yes, sir.

558
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:18,706
Look, I
know you and your men

559
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:20,342
have not had a lot
of field experience,

560
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,344
and we have put you in
an extreme situation.

561
00:26:22,412 --> 00:26:24,280
But I promise you,
if we're attacked,

562
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:26,182
every part of this
route is covered.

563
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,084
We've got a lot of
support out there.

564
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,454
I'm fine, Mr. Bauer.

565
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:31,621
Let's do this.

566
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,194
Yeah.

567
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,094
Our delegation is
preparing to head

568
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:07,429
to McGuire Air force Base.

569
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:09,364
We'll be setting up a
temporary ops center there,

570
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:11,833
where we'll be able to
monitor the situation.

571
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:13,002
And the other delegates?

572
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,470
U.N. Security will
coordinate the evacuation.

573
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:16,506
Everything should go smoothly.

574
00:27:18,209 --> 00:27:19,877
Can I get you anything,

575
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:21,011
Madam President?

576
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,080
No, thank you, Rob.

577
00:27:23,148 --> 00:27:24,682
You have done
more than enough.

578
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:26,950
I'm just sorry that
your first few months

579
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:29,486
on the job have
been so challenging.

580
00:27:29,554 --> 00:27:31,589
I wouldn't have had
it any other way.

581
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,827
I'll see you in a moment.

582
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,836
I spoke to one of my aides.

583
00:27:44,905 --> 00:27:47,340
He told me my
brother is... dead.

584
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:49,542
I'm afraid so.

585
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,077
When CTU is finished
with their operation,

586
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:54,547
I would like Farhad's remains

587
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:56,749
to be returned to my country.

588
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,517
Personally, I don't
care where his body rots,

589
00:27:58,585 --> 00:28:01,487
but my mother will
want a proper burial.

590
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,557
I'll see that it's done.

591
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,559
But right now, Mr. President,

592
00:28:05,627 --> 00:28:07,594
we must all evacuate the U.N.

593
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:09,363
I'm not leaving,

594
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:11,399
Madame President.
I'm staying here.

595
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:12,899
I don't understand.

596
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:16,703
My daughter Kayla is missing.

597
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:19,606
Missing?

598
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:23,177
Kayla is romantically involved
with my former head of security.

599
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:25,079
She's run off with him.

600
00:28:25,147 --> 00:28:26,814
Tell me what we
can do to help.

601
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,083
I appreciate that,

602
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:30,886
but my security teams
are searching for her now.

603
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:34,189
I understand how
worried you must be,

604
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:35,957
but there is nothing
that you can do

605
00:28:36,026 --> 00:28:37,292
to help her by staying here.

606
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,129
Please come where
you'll be safe.

607
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,131
I can't, Madam President.

608
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,299
She's somewhere in the city,

609
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:47,237
with no idea that a
nuclear threat exists.

610
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:52,142
I won't go anywhere
until she's been found.

611
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,678
All right.

612
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,782
I understand.

613
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:00,717
I will talk to you very soon.

614
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,253
Thank you.

615
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,232
They're turning
west Sixth Street.

616
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,667
Pulling into the hospital.

617
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,361
Chloe, bring up the
hospital security feed.

618
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:44,698
Get facial recognition
up and running.

619
00:29:50,071 --> 00:29:52,206
CTU, this is Bauer. We're
moving into position.

620
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:54,309
Farhad's body's been
taken to his room.

621
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,847
Let's go!

622
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,219
Secure these doors!

623
00:30:23,374 --> 00:30:25,175
Bring up the exterior cameras.

624
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:17,731
This is Bauer.

625
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,733
Jack, it's me.

626
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,035
Hey.

627
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:22,636
I've been released.
I'm free to go.

628
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:23,938
Good.

629
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:25,607
Chloe told me what you did.

630
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,942
You leveraged Hastings.

631
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:28,577
Said that you would
head up field ops

632
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,245
until this crisis was over

633
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:34,749
in exchange for CTU dropping
any possible charges against me.

634
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:37,486
I didn't ask you
to do that, Jack.

635
00:31:37,554 --> 00:31:39,021
I know you didn't.

636
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:41,189
Look, someone in the White
House is trying to set you up

637
00:31:41,258 --> 00:31:43,292
to take responsibility for
the failure of our mission,

638
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,494
and I couldn't let that happen

639
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:47,663
because you did nothing wrong.

640
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:48,998
You understand me?

641
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:51,467
Renee, you need
to let this go.

642
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,937
You're not responsible
for what's happening

643
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:55,806
Yeah, okay.

644
00:31:55,874 --> 00:32:00,611
Hey, I meant what
I said earlier.

645
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,382
When this is over, I want
to be there for you...

646
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:05,515
with you.

647
00:32:07,353 --> 00:32:08,519
I'd like that.

648
00:32:08,587 --> 00:32:11,256
I'll have a CTU agent
take you to my apartment.

649
00:32:11,323 --> 00:32:13,725
I'll meet you there
when this is over.

650
00:32:13,792 --> 00:32:15,526
All right, Jack.

651
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,298
Look, I'm getting chatter
over the comm. I gotta go.

652
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:21,500
Okay, bye.

653
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:23,869
This is Bauer. Go ahead.

654
00:32:23,938 --> 00:32:25,205
Jack,

655
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:26,839
facial recognition
just picked up a match

656
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:29,275
with the I.R.K.
intelligence files.

657
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:31,277
His name's Marcos Al-Zacar.

658
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:32,344
American-born.

659
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,180
Working undercover
with the I.R.K.

660
00:32:34,248 --> 00:32:35,248
for the last three years.

661
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:36,349
Where is he?

662
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:37,350
Approaching the side entrance.

663
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:38,818
Brown hair, blue scrubs,

664
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:39,953
wearing aÃ© dark-blue jacket.

665
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:41,187
Copy that.

666
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:43,257
Hold on, Jack. he's got
something in his hand.

667
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:44,725
It looks like a
remote detonator.

668
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:46,560
I think he's wearing a vest.

669
00:32:46,628 --> 00:32:49,864
Chloe, can you
disarm it from there?

670
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,866
Possibly, if I can pin
down the detonator model,

671
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,968
I may be able to
scramble the arming code

672
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:55,603
using the transmitter
in the mobile comm.

673
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:57,371
Get on it. Owen,
you've got a man

674
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,508
approaching your position.
He's got brown hair.

675
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:01,810
He's wearing green
scrubs and a blue jacket.

676
00:33:01,878 --> 00:33:04,346
Yeah. I see him.

677
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:05,514
He's our hitter. We believe

678
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:06,649
he's wearing an explosive vest

679
00:33:06,717 --> 00:33:07,784
with a remote detonator.

680
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:08,952
Okay. What should I do?

681
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:11,154
Stay calm and do
whatever he asks.

682
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:12,956
CTU techs are going to try and
disarm the vest from offsite.

683
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:15,290
Okay.

684
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,526
Owen?

685
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:17,794
Owen.

686
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:19,595
You can do this.

687
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:22,231
Just try and slow him
down as much as possible.

688
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,100
We've got you covered
every inch of the way.

689
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,736
Yes, sir.

690
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:32,877
Excuse me. This
is a secure area.

691
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,346
I'm going to need
to see some I.D.

692
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,150
Listen to me very carefully.

693
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,320
I have a bomb.

694
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,690
Give me your weapon right
now, or I'll kill us both.

695
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,661
Your weapon now.

696
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,297
Okay. Okay.

697
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:52,698
Just take it easy.

698
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,567
Slowly.

699
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:56,635
Yeah.

700
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:06,379
Where is Farhad Hassan?

701
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:07,781
Third floor.

702
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,516
Take me to him.

703
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:10,784
Anyone asks who I am,

704
00:34:10,852 --> 00:34:12,452
you say I'm a doctor,
and I'm cleared.

705
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,553
Come on, son.

706
00:34:13,622 --> 00:34:15,289
Okay.

707
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:17,692
Move.

708
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,926
Okay. Go.

709
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,037
Hello?

710
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:46,706
Dalia, it's me.

711
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,042
We need to talk.

712
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:49,843
Don't try to change
my mind, Omar.

713
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:52,179
I told you, I'm leaving.

714
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:53,847
I haven't called
to change your mind.

715
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:57,718
I called because
Kayla may be in danger.

716
00:34:57,787 --> 00:34:58,953
What do you mean?

717
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,389
She's run away with Tarin.

718
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:02,524
They've been
seeing each other.

719
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:03,758
I know.

720
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:07,328
How long have you known?

721
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,264
What difference
does it make, Omar?

722
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:10,899
What kind of danger is she in?

723
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,701
Farhad is dead.

724
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,870
The nuclear material
he tried to acquire

725
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,472
is in the hands
of the terrorists.

726
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,275
They're going to use
it here in Manhattan.

727
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:20,409
No.

728
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,380
How did this happen?

729
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:24,448
I'll explain later.

730
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:26,550
But right now you
need to call Kayla.

731
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:28,618
I've left messages, but
she won't return my calls.

732
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:30,287
But she might talk to you.

733
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,491
Please, Dalia.
She's angry at me.

734
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,293
I had Tarin arrested.

735
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,095
I thought he was part
of the conspiracy.

736
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:42,066
All right.

737
00:35:42,134 --> 00:35:44,068
But Omar, what about you?

738
00:35:44,136 --> 00:35:45,803
Don't worry about me.

739
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:47,806
Just help me
find our daughter.

740
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:50,743
I- I'll try.

741
00:35:55,582 --> 00:35:57,583
Sabira, I need the captain.

742
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:38,393
Chloe, it's Jack. We're
moving to the third floor.

743
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:39,628
Where are we at with the vest?

744
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:41,196
I've identified
the detonator, Jack.

745
00:36:41,264 --> 00:36:43,398
It's German-made, K7 variant,

746
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:45,867
but that model is used in
a lot of configurations.

747
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:46,969
I'm going to need a
visual on the vest.

748
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,704
Copy that.

749
00:36:48,772 --> 00:36:50,139
Owen, it's Jack.

750
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,642
CTU cannot disarm the
vest unless they see it.

751
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:53,810
I need you to get the hostile

752
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,279
underneath one of the
surveillance cameras

753
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,547
and make him show it to you.

754
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,549
I repeat, CTU cannot
disarm the vest

755
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,950
unless they see it.

756
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,653
You ready?

757
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:14,666
Team three, they're
approaching your position.

758
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:32,484
What are you doing?

759
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:34,687
I want to see proof.

760
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,288
Proof of what?

761
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:37,490
A bomb.

762
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:40,727
I don't believe you have one.

763
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:44,164
You don't keep moving,
you're gonna find out.

764
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:49,570
Right now.

765
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:53,707
You want Farhad, you show me.

766
00:37:54,743 --> 00:37:56,844
I said, "Move."

767
00:37:56,912 --> 00:37:59,247
No.

768
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:14,062
Owen did it, Jack.

769
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,397
I've got a visual on the vest.

770
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:17,199
Now, move.

771
00:38:17,267 --> 00:38:20,969
Okay.

772
00:38:22,573 --> 00:38:23,973
We're set in position
near Farhad's room.

773
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,441
Now, what's the status?

774
00:38:25,509 --> 00:38:27,210
It's a DDR configuration.

775
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:29,413
I just need to pull up the
frequency of the receiver.

776
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:30,814
Chloe, you've got
about 30 seconds

777
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:32,383
before they reach that room.

778
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:38,422
Got it.

779
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,524
3.15 gigahertz, standard GSM.

780
00:38:40,592 --> 00:38:41,825
Running it through
the mobile comm now.

781
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:43,527
This'll take a few seconds.

782
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:48,166
Stand by for assault.

783
00:38:54,308 --> 00:38:55,708
On the floor, face down!

784
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:57,310
Do it now!

785
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,476
Don't move!

786
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,479
Come on, Arlo. Hurry up.

787
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:16,596
That's it. It's done.

788
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:18,365
Jack, the vest is disarmed.

789
00:39:18,434 --> 00:39:19,968
Move in. Go, go, go!

790
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,567
It's all right.

791
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:52,836
It's all right.
Lower your weapons.

792
00:39:52,903 --> 00:39:54,571
It's all right.

793
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:57,307
I'm going to put my gun away.

794
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,075
We're not here to hurt you.

795
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,677
We just want to talk.

796
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,813
Stay calm.

797
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:05,016
It's all right.

798
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:08,452
I just want to talk to you.

799
00:40:11,456 --> 00:40:14,025
No. No!

800
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:23,769
He's still moving.
Notify the perimeter.

801
00:40:30,843 --> 00:40:34,212
Do not fire! He's unarmed!

802
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:28,105
This is Bauer.

803
00:41:28,172 --> 00:41:29,840
I'm in the east wing.

804
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,408
Suspect has barricaded himself

805
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:32,876
in some kind of
pressure chamber.

806
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:35,279
I need a team down here now
to help me open the door.

807
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:49,093
Yes?

808
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:50,261
It was a trap.

809
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,763
Farhad was already dead.

810
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:53,799
What? The police were waiting.

811
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,367
They tried to ambush
me, but I got away.

812
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:56,702
Where are you?

813
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:59,204
I locked myself inside
some kind of oxygen chamber.

814
00:41:59,273 --> 00:42:00,373
They can't get in here.

815
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:02,008
At least not yet.

816
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:03,509
You know what you must do.

817
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:04,943
I can't.

818
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:08,180
I- I think they-they
scrambled the arming code.

819
00:42:08,249 --> 00:42:10,016
You need to set
it off manually.

820
00:42:10,084 --> 00:42:11,284
I don't know how to do that.

821
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:12,585
I'll talk you through it.

822
00:42:12,653 --> 00:42:14,721
Can you open the
detonator control?

823
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:17,123
Yeah. I-I think so.

824
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:19,393
Um, it's going
to take a minute.

825
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,794
Work quickly.

826
00:42:20,862 --> 00:42:24,198
You cannot let
them take you alive.

827
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,037
Can you hear me?

828
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:38,146
I just want to talk.

829
00:42:52,757 --> 00:42:54,857
