2
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:17,520
Let's get the other
body and get cleaned up

3
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:18,955
before we head back to CTU.

4
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:21,591
I'm trying to locate an
individual by the name

5
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,593
of Kevin Wade.

6
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:26,296
Kevin's probation
officer just called me.

7
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,964
He has records that
show him calling my cell

8
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:29,766
several times.

9
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,100
Look, you just have
to handle this, okay?

10
00:00:31,168 --> 00:00:32,869
I don't know if I can do this.

11
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:34,938
Lie. Come on, we both
know you're good at it.

12
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,607
Put your hands where
I can see them!

13
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,609
Do not move!

14
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:41,711
Samir, Marcos is
out of the chamber.

15
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:43,713
Hang up right now and
transmit the fail safe!

16
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:46,583
What's happening? What is that?
! Marcos, I don't know

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,518
if I'm gonna be able
to do this in time.

18
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:50,620
How were they gonna smuggle
the fuel rods into the city

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,121
past the radiological detectors?
I don't know!

20
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,857
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name!

21
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:57,093
President Hassan's head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

22
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:04,467
Right now you need to call UN
Security and have them take

23
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:06,336
Mr. Faroush into custody
until we get there.

24
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:08,638
Tarin's not here. Where is he?

25
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:10,106
I don't know.
Somewhere with my daughter.

26
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:12,742
Tarin is working with
your father's enemies.

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,278
You must tell me where you are.

28
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:18,514
The Teodore Hotel, Suite 514.

29
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:19,582
Just stay where you are.

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,451
The police will be there shortly.

31
00:01:21,518 --> 00:01:23,620
I thought we agreed

32
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:25,255
you weren't gonna take
your mother's call.

33
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,657
I'm sorry, my love,
I just didn't want her to worry.

34
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:29,259
Did you tell her where we are?

35
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:30,760
Of course not.

36
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,697
We're arriving at the landing now.

37
00:01:34,765 --> 00:01:38,268
Soon we'll be able to transport
the rods into Manhattan.

38
00:01:38,335 --> 00:01:41,004
Are CTU's radiation sensors down?

39
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,405
Not yet, but we'll be ready.

40
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:56,986
All right, listen up!

41
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:01,257
This is what we know.

42
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:04,727
IRK nationalists are targeting
New York with a dirty bomb.

43
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:05,962
We have one lead:

44
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,765
Hassan's former head of security,
Tarin Faroush.

45
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:11,734
We believe he wants to
disable our defenses

46
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:13,136
so they can smuggle the
bomb into Manhattan.

47
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:14,504
Chloe?

48
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,339
Latest intel is that Tarin is
staying at the Teodore Hotel

49
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:18,675
with President Hassan's
daughter, Kayla.

50
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:20,543
Kayla has been warned by her mother

51
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,978
that Tarin is working
with the terrorists.

52
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,680
She'll be trying to
keep him at the hotel

53
00:02:23,747 --> 00:02:24,881
until our Tac teams arrive.

54
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:26,115
What's our ETA othat?

55
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,151
NYPD is approaching
the staging area,

56
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:30,153
CTU still ten minutes out.

57
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,555
Chloe, you liaise with NYPD.

58
00:02:32,623 --> 00:02:34,057
Actually, Dana is better at the

59
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:37,093
inter-agency protocols than I am.

60
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:38,828
Fine.

61
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:40,830
Jack Bauer's heading Field Ops,

62
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:44,334
Dana's on point with NYPD,
Arlo will run aerial.

63
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:45,902
Let's get to it.

64
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:53,910
All the changes going
on around here,

65
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:55,979
who do I report to exactly,
you or Dana?

66
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,547
What does it matter?

67
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:00,316
I just like to be clear.
The only thing you need to be

68
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:02,986
clear about is that there's
a dirty bomb about to go off

69
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:04,721
in Manhattan, so just do your job.

70
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:09,492
Drone's in position
over the Teodore Hotel

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,362
awaiting your instructions.

72
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:39,087
Kayla, we have to go.

73
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:42,156
Nearly ready.

74
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:48,297
What was that? Are you all right?

75
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:51,567
It was nothing, I'm fine.

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,287
Hello?

77
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:12,922
The Americans got Marcos to talk.

78
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,257
He may have compromised you.

79
00:04:15,325 --> 00:04:17,693
Did the girl receive
any phone calls?

80
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:19,361
Yes, one- her mother. Get out now.

81
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:20,529
And bring her with you.

82
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:21,697
We're moving to the next phase.

83
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:22,998
I'll need a vehicle.

84
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,633
Hamid is on his way.

85
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,306
Kayla,

86
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:33,909
we must go now.

87
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:37,546
Just one more minute.

88
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:39,315
Hurry up, please.

89
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,859
Jack, I'm uploading Tarin
Faroush's file to you now.

90
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:52,061
Copy that.

91
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,363
Okay, I've got it.
We're also gonna need

92
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,999
hotel schematics and access
to their security systems.

93
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,233
Coming to you now.

94
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,402
Target is in room 514.

95
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,738
Hotel security is standing
by to give NYPD access.

96
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:05,407
Jack, Brian Hastings.
What's your ETA?

97
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:06,575
About eight minutes.
Can you patch me through

98
00:05:06,643 --> 00:05:07,810
to our point man at NYPD?

99
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:09,044
We're doing that now.

100
00:05:09,112 --> 00:05:11,714
Name's, uh, Sergeant Amis.

101
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:12,781
Sergeant Amis, Dana Walsh, CTU.

102
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,650
Been waiting on you, Ms. Walsh.

103
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,151
We're in our staging area already.

104
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,486
Go ahead, Jack.

105
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:18,654
Sergeant Amis, Jack Bauer.

106
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:21,490
Our target, Tarin Faroush,
is in room 514.

107
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:23,192
He has a female hostage,
Kayla Hassan.

108
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,728
She's the daughter of
President Hassan of the IRK.

109
00:05:25,795 --> 00:05:27,196
We'll handle him, Mr. Bauer.

110
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:29,698
We'll make sure that girl
doesn't come to any harm.

111
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,100
The priority is to
take Tarin alive.

112
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,267
He's our only lead to a major

113
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:33,302
terrorist threat against New York.

114
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,503
Like I said, we'll handle him.

115
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:35,971
Sergeant, don't
underestimate this man.

116
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,406
He was President Hassan's
head of security.

117
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:38,941
He knows what he's doing.

118
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,076
I want your men to set up a
perimeter and wait for us.

119
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:42,578
We're monitoring hotel security.

120
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:43,746
We'll give you a heads-up

121
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:44,980
if we've got any
action from the room.

122
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,686
Kayla, my friend from
the State Department

123
00:05:50,754 --> 00:05:52,988
is waiting for us! We must go now.

124
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,224
Just one more second, please.

125
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:18,881
Kayla!

126
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:22,851
Kayla!

127
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:26,255
Tarin, what are you doing?!

128
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,823
Stop this game.
We walk out of here right now.

129
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,991
No, I'm not going anywhere.

130
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,025
Just move! Oh, no!

131
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:31,527
Where are you taking me?

132
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:33,095
Believe me, the last thing
I want to do is hurt you,

133
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,329
but I will.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,435
Got movement on the fifth floor.

135
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:40,903
Are you getting this, Jack?

136
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,072
Yeah, someone must've
tipped him off. Sergeant?

137
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,206
Yes, I know, target's on the move.

138
00:06:44,274 --> 00:06:45,340
I'm going in.

139
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:46,475
Negative. We're five minutes out.

140
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:47,776
I want you to hold your position.

141
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:50,179
I'm on the ground, Mr.
Bauer; it's my call.

142
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:51,747
No, it isn't,
this is a CTU operation.

143
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:53,449
I am telling you to
hold your position.

144
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:55,050
I'm going in. Sergeant!

145
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:00,289
Tarin's at the elevators.

146
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,164
Lost picture on the fifth.
Sergeant, target has

147
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:11,967
taken out elevator security
camera and is armed.

148
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:13,635
I am ordering you to stand down.

149
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:14,737
I'm right on him.

150
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:16,071
Sergeant, that was an order!

151
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:25,380
Sergeant Amis, can you hear me?

152
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:26,882
Ser- Chloe, have you got anything!?

153
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,417
Nothing.

154
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:50,439
OFFICER Shots fired, shots fired.

155
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:53,642
We have shots fired.
All NYPD units report status.

156
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,645
Repeat, report status.

157
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:58,280
This is Faulkner. I'm hit.

158
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,282
Amis and Martin are down.
Where's the target?

159
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,317
He's heading toward the fire
escape on the south side.

160
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:03,819
He's got the girl.

161
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:06,622
ESU, this is Agent Ortiz.
Cover the south fire escape now!

162
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:08,190
Medics, men down
on the fifth floor.

163
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:10,359
That doesn't make sense.
What do you mean?

164
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:11,760
Tarin just took out three men.

165
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:12,895
Why's he using the fire escape?

166
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:14,229
He should be heading
down the stairs.

167
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:16,131
Son of a bitch.

168
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,168
NYPD, target is impersonating
an officer; he has the girl.

169
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:21,436
I want you to fall back
and cover all exits.

170
00:08:21,504 --> 00:08:23,939
I repeat, target is
impersonating an officer.

171
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,174
Cover all exits!

172
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:33,215
Chloe, do you see anything?
Nothing.

173
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:36,084
Send us back the drone feed.
Roger that.

174
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,222
Drop the gun!

175
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,423
Put it down! No, no!

176
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:42,457
Drop it now! This is Bellow.

177
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,792
Target's at the Allen Street exit.

178
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,894
He's got the girl.
Chloe, we need that drone feed.

179
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,095
Coming through.

180
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:50,165
There's a cab pulling up.

181
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:52,668
Officer Bellow, behind you!

182
00:08:58,274 --> 00:08:59,541
They're heading for the cab.

183
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:00,876
All ESU, we have

184
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,878
two officers down in the
alley behind the hotel.

185
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,613
Target is moving to Allen Street.

186
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,216
He's escaping in the yellow cab.
Tracking the cab.

187
00:09:07,283 --> 00:09:09,418
Go!

188
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:11,987
Advise all NYPD mobile units,

189
00:09:12,055 --> 00:09:13,488
we cannot lose that vehicle.

190
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:16,091
On it. Taxi's in the
Delancey underpass.

191
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm blind. Do we have traffic cams?

192
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:19,728
Not in the underpass.

193
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:20,829
We're two blocks from Delancey.

194
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,805
Any sign of the cab?
Still in the underpass.

195
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:31,607
The underpass is less
than half a click.

196
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:33,108
Where the hell are they?

197
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:34,910
NYPD mobile units, 90 seconds out.

198
00:09:34,978 --> 00:09:36,945
Go left, Jack, go left right here!

199
00:09:52,362 --> 00:09:54,997
There it is. I got the cab.
I got the cab.

200
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,475
Driver!

201
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,644
I want you to slowly
open your door!

202
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:15,183
Open the door now!

203
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,790
It's empty.

204
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,825
It's empty!

205
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:25,594
Chloe, backtrack drone footage.

206
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:27,429
Trace every vehicle
that left the underpass.

207
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:28,597
Get NYPD to set roadblocks.

208
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:30,332
They were here less
than 30 seconds ago!

209
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,767
Arlo? Got it.

210
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:34,369
We should join the sweep.
No, they're gone.

211
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:36,805
You don't know that.
Yeah, I do, they're gone.

212
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:38,507
Chloe, it's Jack,
I'm gonna need a kidnap

213
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:39,641
and an electronic
intercept package.

214
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,643
Have it meet me back
at the UN. Copy.

215
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,645
I need to talk to President Hassan.

216
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:45,948
That's who the terrorists are
gonna want to contact next.

217
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:47,786
That's why they
kidnapped his daughter.

218
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:09,805
Tarin just called.

219
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,206
He has the girl.

220
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:20,916
Hello.

221
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:23,018
Ahman. Samir,
where are the nuclear rods?

222
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:24,987
They're still outside the city.

223
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,923
We haven't disabled the American
radiological detectors yet.

224
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,926
Then how will you
bring the rods to me?

225
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:33,562
It's been taken care of.

226
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:46,503
Here, Mr. Prady. Thank you.

227
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,872
Give me one moment. Yeah.

228
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,808
We've backtracked through
drone and traffic cam footage

229
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,009
looking for Kayla and Tarin.

230
00:11:52,076 --> 00:11:53,243
Nothing's come up yet.

231
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:54,444
What's Bauer's status?

232
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:55,712
He's two minutes from the UN.

233
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,681
An electronic intercept
team is en route to him.

234
00:11:57,749 --> 00:11:58,982
Keep me informed.

235
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,484
Copy.

236
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,252
Ms. Walsh.

237
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,887
There's a Mr.
Prady here to see you.

238
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:05,522
Says he spoke to you on the phone.

239
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,857
Thank you.

240
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,330
Chloe.

241
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:16,867
Would you mind covering
for me for a few minutes?

242
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:40,924
Mr. Prady.

243
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:42,860
Dana Walsh. A pleasure, Ms. Walsh.

244
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:44,294
It'll be quieter in here.

245
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,430
Mm-hmm.

246
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:49,233
Uh, this is, uh...

247
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,568
this is some impressive facility.

248
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:53,270
What, uh...

249
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:54,938
what is it you do here?

250
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:58,909
Intelligence analyst.

251
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:01,144
Mr. Prady, we've got a
major situation here...

252
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:04,047
I understand. I won't
take up much of your time.

253
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,582
Okay.

254
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,919
It's 3:00 in the morning,
you're 2,000 miles from home.

255
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,487
You mind telling me
what's so urgent?

256
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,889
Yeah. It's about the young man

257
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:15,058
I mentioned on the phone-
Kevin Wade.

258
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,160
This is him right here.

259
00:13:27,538 --> 00:13:29,206
You know him, don't you?

260
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:32,809
Yes.

261
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:39,082
I should have been honest
with you on the phone.

262
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:44,988
I met Kevin a couple
days ago at a bar.

263
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,324
Was there another man with him?

264
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,026
He was traveling

265
00:13:49,093 --> 00:13:51,161
with an ex-con named Nick Coughlin.

266
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:52,863
Bad news.

267
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,400
Done time on robbery,
attempted murder.

268
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,572
No. No, I've never seen him.

269
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:07,978
Okay.

270
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:13,050
So, what happened...
with you and Kevin?

271
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:18,255
Um...

272
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:21,959
we talked for a while.

273
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:24,261
I drank more than I should,

274
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:26,430
and we ended up back in his van.

275
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,198
You had sex with him.

276
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,768
Yes.

277
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:33,937
Do you know where he is now?

278
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:37,908
No. I didn't see him again.

279
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:39,543
The whole thing was a mistake.

280
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,912
Why so?

281
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,749
Because I am getting
married in a few weeks.

282
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,217
It was the pressure.

283
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:48,518
I- I don't know.

284
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:50,754
All the wedding plans.

285
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:52,122
I went out for a drink.

286
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,192
I didn't intend to...

287
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,761
Maybe I did. I don't know.

288
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:00,664
I don't know anything anymore.

289
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:03,166
All that I know is that
if my fiancÃfÂ© finds out,

290
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,568
he will never forgive me.

291
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:06,203
I'm not looking to ruin your life.

292
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,305
I just want to retrieve Kevin

293
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,407
before he gets in more trouble

294
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,776
than violating his parole.

295
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:17,314
I understand.

296
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,216
I... I hope that you find him.

297
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,418
Yeah, thing is, Miss Walsh,

298
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:23,854
I got a call a couple hours ago

299
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:26,690
from my NYPD friend, Tom Hardiman.

300
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,993
Seems like there was a...
a break-in

301
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,628
at a police evidence lockup.

302
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:34,398
Again, bad business.

303
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:36,233
Officer got beaten up,
left in a coma,

304
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,567
but guess whose prints

305
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,370
were on the assault weapon?

306
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,573
Yeah, that nasty SOB,
Nick Coughlin.

307
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,842
Now, what I'm afraid of is...

308
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,111
where Nick is, Kevin is, too,

309
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:50,147
and I really need to find him.

310
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:52,983
And, like I told you,
I only saw him the once.

311
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,218
I have no idea where he is.

312
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:58,922
And you're sure about that?

313
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:04,861
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle
of a national security crisis.

314
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,496
I have to go back to my desk.

315
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,731
Okay. Okay.

316
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,099
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,801
Perhaps, if I talk
to your supervisor,

318
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:14,638
he could let you take
a few minutes off.

319
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,111
Or I could wait here,

320
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,614
stay out of your way
till you have some time.

321
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:26,083
Fine.

322
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,751
You have to stay here, though.

323
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,753
Of course.

324
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,555
Okay. Mm-hmm.

325
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:36,626
I don't understand.

326
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:38,428
The Americans knew where Kayla was.

327
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:40,097
How did they lose her?

328
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:42,032
Before we blame them, remember...

329
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,900
it was our people- our own people-

330
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,570
who kidnapped Kayla,
not the Americans.

331
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,374
Mr. President, CTU is here.

332
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,480
Mr. President, I'm Jack Bauer.

333
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,014
You already know Cole Ortiz.

334
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,649
We deeply regret not being able

335
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:01,118
to find your daughter,
but I promise you,

336
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:02,152
we're going to do everything

337
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,487
in our power to recover her.

338
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:05,655
How did you lose her?
How did that happen?

339
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,290
Tarin had been warned, ma'am.
We arrived too late.

340
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,492
It was your people...

341
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,693
Dalia, please.

342
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:13,763
What do they want with Kayla?

343
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,298
We were hoping you
could tell us, sir.

344
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,934
Tarin Faroush was
your head of security,

345
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,436
meaning he knows
everything that you know.

346
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:20,937
He took your daughter
because he's trying

347
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,772
to leverage something from you.
Do you have

348
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,174
any idea what that could be?

349
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,509
I don't know.

350
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:26,843
Sir,

351
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,845
we believe the kidnappers
will contact you directly.

352
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:31,181
We need to set up monitoring
devices on your phones

353
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:32,415
so we can track their call.

354
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,117
Do what you need to do.
Just, please,

355
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:35,819
get our child back.

356
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:36,887
Dalia.

357
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,054
Please.

358
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:39,189
Thank you.

359
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:40,957
With me.

360
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:46,396
Set up tech here.

361
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,501
Tarin! Don't.

362
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,236
Please.

363
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,706
Don't. Come on.

364
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:59,142
Please.

365
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,653
Do what he says,
and you won't get hurt.

366
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,022
Who is he?

367
00:18:12,089 --> 00:18:13,723
Another traitor?

368
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:23,867
The only traitor is your father.

369
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:27,771
Tie her up.

370
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,474
No.

371
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,610
No. No. No.

372
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:00,565
Do you recognize the number?

373
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,934
There isn't one.
Chloe, we've got a call

374
00:19:03,002 --> 00:19:04,636
coming in on the
mother's cell phone.

375
00:19:04,703 --> 00:19:07,305
We're working on it.

376
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:08,473
Answer it.

377
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,276
Keep them on the phone
as long as possible.

378
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:12,911
Yes?

379
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:15,446
Your husband is a traitor to
the people of the Republic.

380
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:18,349
He alone has made our
actions necessary.

381
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,118
He cannot be trusted.

382
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,686
Where is my daughter?

383
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:23,755
I want to talk to her.

384
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:27,192
Whether you ever see
her again depends

385
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:29,727
on what your husband
does right now.

386
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:30,995
Put him on. Dalia?

387
00:19:31,063 --> 00:19:32,363
They want to talk to you.

388
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:33,598
Here, give me the phone.

389
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,666
We need to be hearing this.

390
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,067
We're still working on it, Jack.

391
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:39,003
Okay, we've got it.
You should have audio.

392
00:19:39,071 --> 00:19:41,072
This is President Hassan.

393
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,874
Who are you?

394
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:44,442
I'm a loyal servant of the Republic

395
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,910
you are trying to destroy.

396
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,946
Now, shut up, Omar, and listen.

397
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:49,647
I want to lk to my daughter.

398
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:52,684
Let me tell you what I want.

399
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,886
File 33.

400
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,089
File 33.

401
00:19:58,157 --> 00:20:00,258
That is the price of your daughter.

402
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:02,360
I don't know what that is.

403
00:20:02,428 --> 00:20:04,028
You had to say that.

404
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,697
Of course.

405
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:08,199
You're a vain man,

406
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:09,701
concerned about appearances,

407
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:12,537
and the Americans are listening.

408
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:15,874
But please...

409
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,910
do not insult me by
saying this again.

410
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:21,713
I won't say anything until
I talk to my daughter.

411
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,548
Fine.

412
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:26,017
If that's what you want.

413
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:28,119
I'm sending you an IP address.

414
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,588
Give it to one of the
people listening in.

415
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,498
Okay, got it.

416
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,709
Don't hurt her.

417
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:54,244
It's me you want.

418
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,484
I told you what I want.

419
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,286
File 33.

420
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,755
I told you-
I don't know what that is.

421
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:06,590
Take me instead.

422
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,599
You have 15 minutes.

423
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,801
No excuses, no stalling.

424
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,736
15 minutes or she dies here,
like this,

425
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:19,870
while you watch.

426
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:21,138
Stop it.

427
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:22,573
Stop it!

428
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:25,109
I'll find the file. Whatever it is,

429
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:26,110
I'll get it for you!

430
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,584
Mr. President,

431
00:21:33,652 --> 00:21:34,952
what is File 33?

432
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,253
Omar! Mr. Bauer,

433
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:39,123
I've got Brian
Hastings on the line.

434
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,793
Yeah.

435
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:44,695
Jack, you know anything
about this file?

436
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,697
No, but I'm standing here
with President Hassan.

437
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,098
I'll put you on speaker.

438
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,200
Go ahead.

439
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,601
Mr. President,
this is Brian Hastings.

440
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:52,703
I have no intel on the
file they're talking about.

441
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,238
Can you tell me what this is?

442
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,642
Sir, they gave you 15 minutes.

443
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,544
If you want to see your daughter again,
you don't have time

444
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:01,812
to waste.

445
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,881
Omar, what is this file?

446
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,493
Show them.

447
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,330
Show them!

448
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,271
Dalia,

449
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:29,273
I'll do anything for Kayla.

450
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:30,774
I would give

451
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:31,775
my own life.

452
00:22:31,843 --> 00:22:33,177
Then give them this file.

453
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:35,246
Sir?

454
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:57,268
Put it up on the screen,
mirror it over to CTU.

455
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:06,844
Hastings, are you seeing this?

456
00:23:06,912 --> 00:23:08,879
Yes, I am.

457
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:10,381
Mr. President,

458
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,616
this file appears to
contain operational details

459
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,219
of all U.S. anti-nuclear defenses.

460
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:16,587
That's correct.

461
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:19,490
Including our radiological
detection arrays.

462
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:22,426
This is highly-
classified DOD material.

463
00:23:22,494 --> 00:23:24,528
I need to know how you got this.

464
00:23:24,596 --> 00:23:26,230
How do you think, Mr. Hastings?

465
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,468
For 20 years, your nation
has threatened mine

466
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,270
with everything from
economic sanctions

467
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,406
to military attack.

468
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:37,641
So we gathered intelligence

469
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,710
and found weaknesses
in your defenses.

470
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,214
We did what any other
country would do.

471
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:45,950
Mr. President,

472
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:48,218
that file shows the fatal flaws

473
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:50,120
of our nuclear
detection capabilities.

474
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:51,956
If the terrorists were to get that,

475
00:23:52,023 --> 00:23:54,191
they could smuggle the
fuel rods into Manhattan.

476
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:55,359
Surely you understand,

477
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:57,394
we cannot let you
give that to them.

478
00:23:57,462 --> 00:23:59,530
We're talking about the lives
of tens of thousands of people.

479
00:23:59,598 --> 00:24:00,764
And what of my daughter?

480
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,701
What of her life?

481
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:07,771
With all due respect, madam,
your family brought this threat

482
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,139
to my country.

483
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:11,575
We're doing the best we can.

484
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:12,876
Jack, you still on?

485
00:24:12,944 --> 00:24:14,612
Yeah, we all are.

486
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:16,647
Jack, we may have a lead
on the daughter's location.

487
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,482
Arlo isolated a subway
noise from the video feed

488
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,818
at the end of the transmission,
cross-referencing it with

489
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:22,252
the real-time train
positions as of this moment.

490
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,021
There aren't a lot of
trains this late at night,

491
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:25,923
especially within the radius that

492
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:28,158
they could have traveled to. They were
heading southeast when they left the hotel.

493
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:29,760
They've got to be
near the F train stop

494
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:30,995
by the Williamsburg Bridge.

495
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:33,263
Copy that. Cole and I
will head down there now.

496
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:35,132
We'll bring Tac from here.
You need me to send a second team?

497
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,568
Yes, and aerial.
Everything you've got.

498
00:24:37,636 --> 00:24:39,503
Have your men ready and assembled
in five minutes. Right away.

499
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:42,239
Mr. President, we're going
to need you to stall them

500
00:24:42,307 --> 00:24:43,674
when they call back. How?

501
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:45,509
We'll set up a fake file
that you can transmit.

502
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:47,177
They'll see through that,
Mr. Bauer.

503
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,179
Eventually, but right
now we just need you

504
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:51,181
to stall them long enough so
we can locate your daughter.

505
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:53,250
Stall them any way you can,
but you need to make this work.

506
00:24:53,318 --> 00:24:54,952
We will do whatever we have to.

507
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,187
Thank you.

508
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:40,197
Tarin.

509
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:41,198
Please, don't say...

510
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,332
Why are you doing this? Please.

511
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,634
Why are you doing this?

512
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:45,636
Please don't say anything more.

513
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,705
Please.

514
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,662
Is there trouble? No.
Why would there be?

515
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:15,532
What's the problem?

516
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,401
They're never going to
hand over that file.

517
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:19,069
They have to. And if they don't?!

518
00:26:19,137 --> 00:26:21,105
Killing her was not
part of the plan.

519
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:22,372
You were willing to die

520
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,807
in Hassan's limousine
earlier today.

521
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,009
You were willing to do
anything for our cause.

522
00:26:26,077 --> 00:26:28,011
I still am.

523
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,346
You assured me your feelings

524
00:26:29,414 --> 00:26:31,915
for this girl would
not get in the way.

525
00:26:31,983 --> 00:26:35,385
So tell me,

526
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:38,155
do I need someone else
to take care of her?

527
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:45,562
No.

528
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,197
Stay strong.

529
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,234
We're almost there.

530
00:27:17,642 --> 00:27:19,743
Arlo, what's the status
on our target area?

531
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:21,478
Still looking at almost
six square blocks.

532
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:23,247
How far out are Jack and Cole?

533
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:24,248
Six minutes.

534
00:27:24,316 --> 00:27:25,482
That leaves us about 30 seconds

535
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,650
to find her.

536
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:27,885
We've got to narrow this down.

537
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:30,187
Where's the second Tac team?
Leaving now.

538
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:32,222
Uh... Dana?

539
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,024
Huh?

540
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:35,092
Who is that?

541
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,631
Nobody.

542
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:44,602
Mr. Prady, this is a secure area.

543
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:46,337
If you're not gonna
wait in holding,

544
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:47,705
I'm gonna have to ask you

545
00:27:47,772 --> 00:27:49,707
to leave. I'm sorry.
I had a question.

546
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:52,142
And I'm in the middle of a situation.
I don't have time.

547
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,677
Well, I wouldn't be bothering you,

548
00:27:53,745 --> 00:27:55,713
but I just got off the
phone with my NYPD friend.

549
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,448
He said I absolutely
have to ask you

550
00:27:57,515 --> 00:28:00,117
about the security cameras at
the police evidence lockup.

551
00:28:00,185 --> 00:28:01,719
Because you know what?

552
00:28:01,786 --> 00:28:03,988
It turns out they malfunctioned

553
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,023
for the exact duration
of the incident.

554
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:09,193
Well, somebody obviously
disabled the cameras.

555
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,694
Well, yeah, but not Nick and Kevin.

556
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:13,864
I mean, a crowbar is about as
high-tech as those two get.

557
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:16,200
Now, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

558
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:19,903
See, I'm thinking that someone
must have helped them.

559
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:29,413
Now, my friend says
that all the raw video

560
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:33,584
from every government facility
feeds right here into CTU.

561
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:35,219
Am I understanding that right?

562
00:28:35,286 --> 00:28:37,187
Yes. He also said-

563
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:39,923
correct me if I'm wrong- that

564
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:42,326
the digital images
are archived every

565
00:28:42,394 --> 00:28:45,029
eight hours, and metadata-

566
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:46,630
is that what it's called,
metadata?-

567
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:48,732
that allows you to trace

568
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,603
the exact source of
any service outage.

569
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:55,973
So, everything I need to
solve this is right here.

570
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:58,275
You can get it for me, right?

571
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:01,412
Mr. Prady, we don't just give
data to people off the street.

572
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,579
Well, now, that's right.

573
00:29:02,647 --> 00:29:03,747
That's right.

574
00:29:03,815 --> 00:29:06,950
You need, uh,
an IDRAN- an Interagency

575
00:29:07,018 --> 00:29:09,586
Data Request Authorization Number.

576
00:29:09,654 --> 00:29:11,822
Yeah, Hardiman gave
me one of those.

577
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,758
He said everything should fit

578
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:17,094
on a 100-gig thumb drive.

579
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:20,097
So is that going to be a problem,

580
00:29:20,165 --> 00:29:21,398
getting that for me?

581
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:28,538
No.

582
00:29:28,606 --> 00:29:30,574
Good.

583
00:29:36,013 --> 00:29:37,414
They reprocessed the subway noise,

584
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,416
managed to narrow
down the search grid.

585
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:39,584
How big?

586
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:40,785
About 12 buildings total.

587
00:29:40,852 --> 00:29:42,253
Apartments, offices, retail.

588
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,454
It's still too much
ground to cover.

589
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:49,726
Agent Ortiz.

590
00:29:49,794 --> 00:29:51,595
Dana?

591
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:54,798
Cole... it's over.

592
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I heard you.

593
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:57,901
The parole officer looking

594
00:29:57,969 --> 00:29:59,603
for Kevin is here at CTU.

595
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,204
Knows about the robbery,

596
00:30:01,272 --> 00:30:02,772
the cameras, everything.

597
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,007
Are you certain?

598
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:05,675
Yeah.

599
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:09,446
He's after the raw feeds.

600
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:12,382
He's got an interagency request.

601
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:17,721
I'm going to give it to him, Cole.

602
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:19,022
I'm sorry to call you.

603
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,223
I just thought

604
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,358
that you should know.

605
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,459
Why don't you wait?

606
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:24,761
Do you hear me?
He knows everything.

607
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:25,996
He'll go to Hastings.

608
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:27,964
Don't do anything.
We'll talk about it

609
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:29,799
when I get back.

610
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,568
I can't wait.

611
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:33,203
If you're here,

612
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:35,905
you'll just get in more
trouble trying to protect me.

613
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:40,176
I can't let that happen.

614
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,582
I love you, Cole.

615
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
Dana? Dana?

616
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:51,621
You got a problem? No.

617
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:53,356
Good, 'cause I need you
to keep your head in this.

618
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:54,357
You understand?

619
00:30:54,425 --> 00:30:56,359
You got it.

620
00:31:00,564 --> 00:31:02,599
Omar.

621
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:05,135
We're running out of time.

622
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:08,038
The technicians have prepared

623
00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:10,106
the file I'll be sending.

624
00:31:10,174 --> 00:31:12,809
But these people who have Kayla-

625
00:31:12,877 --> 00:31:15,145
they won't believe a fake file.

626
00:31:15,212 --> 00:31:16,146
No.

627
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:18,481
But they might believe you.

628
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:22,218
You have a gift, Omar.

629
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:23,953
When you talk, people listen.

630
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:27,157
You need to convince them,
for our daughter.

631
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:30,527
Say whatever you
need to to buy time.

632
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:37,467
I have seen you
move so many people.

633
00:31:37,535 --> 00:31:38,668
You can do this.

634
00:31:38,736 --> 00:31:40,203
I know it.

635
00:31:40,271 --> 00:31:42,706
Yeah.

636
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:44,307
Mr. President?

637
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,776
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:48,011
It's time.

639
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:09,799
The deadline is here.

640
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:11,868
Your father has not responded.

641
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:13,737
You hate him that much,
you would do this

642
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:16,106
to me?

643
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:20,377
Tarin...

644
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:22,445
I don't want to die.

645
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:33,089
Please.

646
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:35,058
Then let us pray

647
00:32:35,126 --> 00:32:37,827
for once your father
does the right thing.

648
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:40,096
Tarin, you can't let them do this.

649
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:41,297
I know you.

650
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,465
Shh.

651
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,267
This is not you.

652
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:45,969
And I know in my heart

653
00:32:46,036 --> 00:32:47,771
that you love me.

654
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:49,773
In my heart I know.

655
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,976
And so I don't understand why...

656
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,080
Nearly there, sir.

657
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:03,586
Okay, the uplink's ready.

658
00:33:10,327 --> 00:33:12,328
Let's go.

659
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:15,932
Stop them!

660
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,968
W- Wait, wait, wait.

661
00:33:23,441 --> 00:33:25,341
Follow me.

662
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:37,787
This way, come on.

663
00:33:37,855 --> 00:33:39,155
My father will help us.

664
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:40,557
He's surrounded by traitors.

665
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:42,625
We have to get to CTU.

666
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:51,634
Here, the number is
in this cell phone.

667
00:33:51,702 --> 00:33:52,702
Call them.

668
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:56,339
Tarin, no, no!

669
00:33:59,877 --> 00:34:02,145
Tarin, no!

670
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:03,780
Tarin!

671
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:04,848
No.

672
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:06,883
Tarin!

673
00:34:35,524 --> 00:34:37,458
Omar, what has happened to her?

674
00:34:37,526 --> 00:34:40,027
Did the Americans stop the call?

675
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,462
I don't know.

676
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,519
Maybe they were afraid we'd
hand over the real file.

677
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,602
They could have gotten
our daughter killed.

678
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,445
Why aren't we seeing anything?
We're not sure.

679
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:58,813
Arlo's been scanning
the audio source.

680
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:01,316
Four minutes ago there
was a spike- very faint-

681
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:02,317
sounded like a gunshot.

682
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:03,518
Did Jack hear anything?

683
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:05,120
No, but he's still a
quarter of a mile out.

684
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,488
Mr. Hastings, you better take this.

685
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:08,356
It's Kayla Hassan- she's in a car,
she's escaped.

686
00:35:08,424 --> 00:35:09,357
What?

687
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:11,192
Go.

688
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,161
Ms. Hassan, Brian Hastings,
Director of CTU.

689
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:15,730
You all right? No, no,
I'm not all right.

690
00:35:15,798 --> 00:35:16,932
I'm driving.

691
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,034
They might be chasing me,
I don't know.

692
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:20,769
Where are you? I don't know!

693
00:35:20,836 --> 00:35:22,203
Track her cell phone;
patch Jack in.

694
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:24,839
Ms. Hassan, we're tracking
your cell phone right now.

695
00:35:24,907 --> 00:35:25,907
Do not turn it off.

696
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:26,975
Just tell us what happened.

697
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,843
They tried to kill me,
but Tarin got me out.

698
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,146
He found a car, but they caught us.

699
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,315
They shot him.

700
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,983
He's dead.

701
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,552
He told me to call CTU,

702
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,754
that it was the only safe place.

703
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:41,523
Ms. Hassan, my name is Jack Bauer.

704
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:43,291
We need to know where
you were being held.

705
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,726
I don't know.

706
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:46,828
Ma'am, look, I know you've
been through a great ordeal,

707
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,930
but please, this is very important.

708
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:51,399
Can you at least try to remember
what the building looked like?

709
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:54,069
It was dark, and it was empty.

710
00:35:54,136 --> 00:35:57,405
It-It had a vault,
like a bank, but abandoned.

711
00:35:57,473 --> 00:35:58,440
Chloe, did you get that?

712
00:35:58,507 --> 00:35:59,841
Got it.

713
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:03,545
You need to tell my father that
Tarin Faroush helped me escape,

714
00:36:03,613 --> 00:36:06,715
that he sacrificed his life for me.

715
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:07,983
We've got the location, Jack.

716
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,952
Republic Commerce Bank,
9621 East Broadway.

717
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,253
It closed a year ago.

718
00:36:12,321 --> 00:36:13,622
It's the only bank on
the grid. Copy that.

719
00:36:13,689 --> 00:36:14,623
We're going to need drone support,

720
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,991
and send a second
team over to the bank.

721
00:36:16,058 --> 00:36:18,126
We got 'em.

722
00:36:18,194 --> 00:36:20,528
Ms. Hassan, we've got you on
First Avenue and East Fifth.

723
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,398
Continue going straight,
I will tell you when to turn.

724
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:24,666
Okay.

725
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:38,546
You two cover this exit.

726
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,615
When the second team gets here,
you send them down.

727
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:42,050
Cole, you're with me.

728
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,486
Let's take the door.

729
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:26,161
Cole.

730
00:37:59,094 --> 00:38:00,028
Chloe, it's Jack.

731
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:02,530
We're in the basement of the bank.

732
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:03,831
There's some kind of tunnel system.

733
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:06,767
I've got the schematics,
I'm seeing it now.

734
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:07,768
We're going to head

735
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:09,804
down a spur southeast
from the vault.

736
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,272
How many exit points?

737
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,474
Two exits- no, three.

738
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,477
Have the drone cover
all the exit points.

739
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,446
Arlo, I'm sending
you my screen now.

740
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,081
Can you get eyes on all the exits?

741
00:38:20,148 --> 00:38:22,717
Yeah, ascending to 5,000.

742
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:50,077
I got movement at the south exit.

743
00:38:51,947 --> 00:38:53,881
I've got four hostiles
approaching Division Street

744
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,216
on foot, heading northeast.

745
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:57,151
You copy? Yeah.

746
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,152
Cole, they double-backed

747
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,453
up top.

748
00:38:59,521 --> 00:39:02,623
Chloe, we're moving to intercept.

749
00:39:02,691 --> 00:39:04,058
Where's Kayla? She's approaching

750
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:06,494
the tunnel entrance now;
she'll be with us in two minutes.

751
00:39:06,561 --> 00:39:08,296
Security is standing by.

752
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:09,697
Good work, people.

753
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,336
Dana...

754
00:39:15,404 --> 00:39:16,604
good work.

755
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:17,672
Thank you, sir.

756
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:22,443
If you'll excuse me
for a few minutes...

757
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:32,653
Targets are heading
north on Orchard.

758
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:34,388
Okay, they're getting
into an SUV, Jack.

759
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,489
Do you copy? Yeah.

760
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:36,791
Just stay with them, we'll follow.

761
00:39:36,858 --> 00:39:38,759
Owen, King, you're coming with us.

762
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:41,595
You take King's vehicle,
you two double-back around Orchard.

763
00:39:41,663 --> 00:39:43,664
Chloe, I've got a shot here

764
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:44,899
for facial recognition.

765
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,168
Send it to me.

766
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:55,676
It's Tarin Faroush.

767
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:58,079
He's supposed to be dead.

768
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,748
Kayla said they shot him.

769
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,859
You did the right thing, Tarin.

770
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:14,862
I know.

771
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:17,831
She will die for a good cause.

772
00:40:25,407 --> 00:40:26,441
Jack, Cole, come in.

773
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:27,709
Go ahead, Chloe.

774
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:28,843
We ID'd one of the targets.

775
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:29,944
It's Tarin Faroush.

776
00:40:30,012 --> 00:40:30,979
Kayla said he sacrificed himself

777
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:32,814
to save her, but he's still alive.

778
00:40:32,882 --> 00:40:35,049
Are you absolutely sure?

779
00:40:35,117 --> 00:40:36,050
Yes.

780
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:37,719
What the hell's going on?

781
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:39,587
The terrorists asked
us to give them a file

782
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:40,655
they knew we would never give them.

783
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:42,056
They never expected us to.

784
00:40:42,124 --> 00:40:43,358
Chloe, you got to
put Hastings on now.

785
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:44,459
I'm on, Jack.

786
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,060
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.

787
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:47,228
The terrorists faked her escape.

788
00:40:47,296 --> 00:40:48,663
They wanted to get her to CTU.

789
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:49,664
For what purpose?

790
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:50,665
What's the best way to disarm

791
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:52,333
New York's radiological defenses?

792
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:53,985
Taking out CTU.

793
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:56,187
There's got to be something in the car,
some kind of a bomb.

794
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:57,922
You need to stop her now.
Where is she?

795
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:00,458
Oh, my God.

796
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:02,293
She's in the tunnel.

797
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:05,096
Security!

798
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,935
Security!

799
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,872
Dana, with me!

800
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,774
Chloe, the car that Tarin got into,
where is it now?

801
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,810
Crossing into Brooklyn,

802
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,278
taking the first exit off
the Williamsburg Bridge.

803
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:21,612
We cannot lose

804
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,815
that car, do you understand me?

805
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,083
Copy.

806
00:41:26,218 --> 00:41:27,385
Stop the car!

807
00:41:27,453 --> 00:41:29,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

808
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,089
Put your hands where
we can see them!

809
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:34,058
Dana, call the bomb squad!

810
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,993
Get out of the car!

811
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:37,995
Take her.

812
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,231
Bomb squad to the tunnel entrance.

813
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,701
Get her away from here.

814
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,802
Hastings, have you
stopped that car?

815
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,471
Not in time, Jack.
Hold on, just hold on.

816
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,208
It's an EMP.

817
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:52,076
It's an EMP!

818
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:54,245
You need to shut down your
systems to protect the drones.

819
00:41:54,313 --> 00:41:55,446
There's no time, Jack.

820
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,051
Get away from the car!
I can move it.

821
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:03,287
Come on, get out of there!

822
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,456
Get out of there!

823
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:14,832
Chloe, can you hear me?

824
00:42:16,135 --> 00:42:17,335
Those drones right now are

825
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,970
our only way of tracking
down those terrorists.

826
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,005
You need to pass
them off to the NSA.

827
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:25,143
Damn it, we're blind.

828
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,577
Chloe, did you cop... Chloe?!

829
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:27,845
What the hell is happening?

830
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:30,581
We need to contact NSA.

831
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,583
The terrorists just took out CTU.

832
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:38,584
