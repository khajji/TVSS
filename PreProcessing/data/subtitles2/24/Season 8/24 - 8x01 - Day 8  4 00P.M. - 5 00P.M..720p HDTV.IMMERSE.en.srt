1
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:43,023
It's him.

2
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:52,592
Damn it.

3
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,997
(over headset): I couldn't get off a shot.

4
00:00:55,065 --> 00:00:56,768
Stand by.

5
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:58,739
We'll get him on the way out.

6
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:19,527
Manuel!

7
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:24,701
Hey, Manny!

8
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:29,607
Manny!

9
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:38,750
Hey, Manny!

10
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:00,514
WOMAN: Yes?

11
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,649
Put Mauricio on the phone.

12
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,719
Victor? Just put Mauricio on!

13
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:04,821
He's dead.

14
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,256
What?

15
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:07,992
Someone shot him in the head.

16
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,661
What the hell is happening?

17
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:32,389
I see him.

18
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:33,924
He's leaving the building.

19
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,393
I'set.

20
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,096
Stop.

21
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,363
SPOTTER: It's not him.

22
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:49,666
He can't be far.

23
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:14,888
Coming at you! Gray sedan!

24
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:41,383
Target is out of range.

25
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,450
Move out.

26
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,889
OPERATOR: 911. What's your emergency?

27
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:54,191
Yes. I want to report a stolen vehicle.

28
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:59,961
License plate SNE15C5.

29
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:08,836
Jack?

30
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,075
Oh.

31
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:18,278
Sweetheart, we already
talked about this, remember?

32
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,946
You're supposed to call me "Grandpa."

33
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:22,648
You don't look like a grandpa.

34
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,751
Couldn't agree with you more.

35
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:28,587
The cartoon I turned on is boring.

36
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:30,656
Okay. We'll find another one.

37
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,628
This is the boldest diplomatic initiative

38
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:37,162
we've seen in a generation.

39
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,631
It could finally lay a
foundation for real peace

40
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,266
throughout the entire region.

41
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,801
Well, you know, Bob, the president's

42
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,069
certainly betting her legacy

43
00:04:44,137 --> 00:04:45,804
on the success of these negotiations...

44
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,473
Grandpa!

45
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,275
This isn't a cartoon!

46
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:50,509
Okay, okay.

47
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,512
*A sloth of bears... âTª

48
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,245
This one! I like this one!

49
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:58,011
*A mob of cows âTª

50
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,112
*A herd of sheep... âTª

51
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:07,150
Yeah?

52
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:09,085
Hi, Dad. Sorry we're late.

53
00:05:09,153 --> 00:05:10,486
They're redirecting everyone around the UN.

54
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:11,988
It's all right. We're doing fine.

55
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,289
How was the zoo?

56
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,690
Well, to be honest with you,

57
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,491
we spent most of our time
just going back and forth

58
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,326
between the black bears and the polar bears.

59
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:20,862
I forgot to mention that she's
going through a bear phase.

60
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:23,664
Well, she certainly knows what she wants.

61
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,433
She reminds me of you.

62
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,800
Well, that's funny.

63
00:05:27,868 --> 00:05:30,069
I always tell Stephen how
much she reminds me of you.

64
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:32,271
Anyway, we'll be there in a few minutes.

65
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:33,438
Okay. Don't worry.

66
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:34,973
We'll meet you in the lobby.

67
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,741
Great.

68
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:39,043
Sounds like they had fun.

69
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,712
They always do.

70
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,613
What's wrong?

71
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,982
We talked to him about moving
to LA the night we got here.

72
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,983
Yeah. He said he'd think about it.

73
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:50,584
Yeah, and he hasn't mentioned
one word about it since.

74
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:51,852
And we leave tonight.

75
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,820
Well, maybe he has to
check with his doctors.

76
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,521
No, they cleared him two weeks ag

77
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,622
He's finished with treatme.

78
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,123
I don't know.

79
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:02,025
My father has been on his own for so long.

80
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,227
Maybe he doesn't know how
to live any other way.

81
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,727
Why don't you just ask him again?

82
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:09,964
My father is not the type
of person you ask twice.

83
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:11,831
If you want, I can do it.

84
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:20,070
<i>REPORTER: Here at e ited Nions,</i>

85
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:22,672
<i>a White House spokesman just confirmed that
Presiden</i>

86
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,040
Taylor and Hassan will be
hoing a joint press conference

87
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:26,441
later this hour.

88
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,344
It is widely expected that
President Hassan will announce

89
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,679
the dismantling of his country's
nuclear weapons program.

90
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:35,718
esident Hassan has stated that
he conside these negotiations

91
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:39,723
a historic success and a new
beginning for his country

92
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,492
and the entire Mideast region.

93
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,897
I believe that that is a
reasonable compromise.

94
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:48,668
Now, Mr. President, let's move
on to the issue of verification.

95
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:52,806
Now, the language in your
latest proposal is vague.

96
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,708
Let me be clear.

97
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:56,343
My country agrees

98
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,011
to abandon the pursuit of nuclear weapons

99
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,947
with full International Atomic
Energy Agency safeguards.

100
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:05,282
But our terms, Mr. President,

101
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,184
were that the inspectors
themselves would be American,

102
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:09,652
not IAEA.

103
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,218
With respect, Madam President,

104
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,751
your side pushed the point,
but we never conceded.

105
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,754
With respect, your side
has refused to negotiate

106
00:07:17,822 --> 00:07:19,689
the point in good faith.

107
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:21,090
Without Americans on the ground--

108
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:22,891
Surely, we're not going
to let the nationality

109
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,025
of a few hundred men--

110
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,693
...verification has no teeth.

111
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,362
So, only the United States can
be trusted, Mr. Secretary?

112
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,598
This is the message that you
sent to the rest of the world

113
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,899
and then you wonder why we
don't want to negotiate.

114
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:35,435
Farhad.

115
00:07:35,503 --> 00:07:37,370
Madam President,

116
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:38,971
please excuse my brother's passion.

117
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,107
He only wants what is best for our country.

118
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:42,810
I understand.

119
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:44,612
But we need to resolve this issue

120
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,812
before we can move forward.

121
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,980
And ideally, before

122
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,416
the press conference, which gives us

123
00:07:50,484 --> 00:07:51,785
less than an hour.

124
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,286
HASSAN: Madame President...

125
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:56,424
what would your Congress say

126
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,392
if my Revolutionary Guard

127
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,461
was stationed on your soil?

128
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:04,230
It's the same with my

129
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,132
National Assembly.

130
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,168
Even if I agreed to this,
they would not ratify it.

131
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:12,237
After all, I'm not a king.

132
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,005
Nor I a queen.

133
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,807
Too bad for both of us.

134
00:08:19,377 --> 00:08:20,844
I'd like to adjourn

135
00:08:20,911 --> 00:08:23,345
and discuss this issue
with our respective teams.

136
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:24,913
Of course.

137
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:39,456
You are aware he was a salesman
before entering politics.

138
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:41,591
Household appliances.

139
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,227
You want to bet he sold
a lot of refrigerators?

140
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,630
Find a way to give him what he wants.

141
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,665
Madam President...

142
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:53,033
You heard me.

143
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:55,470
Try to make the inspections work.

144
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:58,875
This man is a once in a lifetime leader.

145
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:00,176
And he has already

146
00:09:00,244 --> 00:09:02,747
suspended his support for
terrorist organizations,

147
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,449
and privately, he's advocating

148
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,150
for a two-state solution.

149
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:08,919
How much further can we expect
him to stick his neck out?

150
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,569
Hey, come here.

151
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:29,670
Did you name him yet? Bear.

152
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:31,205
"Bear." KIM: There she is.

153
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,507
Go get your mom. Hi!

154
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,577
Hey! I heard that you

155
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,146
and Grandpa were hanging out with the bears.

156
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,314
Then we had ice cream,

157
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,249
but I didn't like mine, so Grandpa

158
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,484
gave me his.

159
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,685
That's nice. STEPHEN: Here, I got her.

160
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,520
Thanks for watching her, Jack. Of course.

161
00:09:51,623 --> 00:09:53,423
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about

162
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,391
what we talked about.

163
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:56,959
And I've made up my mind.

164
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:59,094
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you.

165
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:01,096
Really? Yeah.

166
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:03,131
I got a friend who's got
a private security firm.

167
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:04,432
Said he'd give me some consulting work.

168
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,866
He's also got a place I can rent.

169
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,435
Dad, I don't know what to say.

170
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,403
Come here.

171
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:11,871
You don't have to say anything.

172
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,373
Just give me a ride to the airport tonight.

173
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,707
Wait, you're coming with us tonight?

174
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,041
If it's okay.

175
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,209
Of course. Stephen.

176
00:10:17,277 --> 00:10:19,110
Yeah? He's coming with us tonight.

177
00:10:19,178 --> 00:10:20,745
And I've just got a few more things to pack.

178
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:23,580
I don't have very much.
I can be at your hotel in about an hour.

179
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:25,183
That's perfect. We can get back
and finish packing ourselves.

180
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,584
It'll be all right if I fly back

181
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:27,585
to Los Angeles with you?

182
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:30,587
Yay! Yay!

183
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:32,221
Come on. I'll walk you to the car.

184
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,289
Okay. Let's go.

185
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,259
Yay! I got her.

186
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:42,328
Okay. *We're going in the car. âTª

187
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,368
Get your belt done up...

188
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:57,305
Dad, I am so glad that you're doing this.

189
00:10:57,373 --> 00:10:58,506
Me, too.

190
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,842
I love you. Love you.

191
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,277
Okay, guys, I'll see you in an hour.

192
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,213
TERI: Okay. Bye, sweetheart.

193
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:05,314
TERI: Bye!

194
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:16,294
(gasps, groans)

195
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,336
Good afternoon, everyone.

196
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:40,271
Good afternoon.

197
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,208
All right, just a few things
before we get started here.

198
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:45,877
Presidents Taylor and Hassan
will each make a statement

199
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,012
after they've been introduced

200
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,046
by the Secretary-General.

201
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:49,381
The Q&A will follow,

202
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,649
but I want you to keep your
questions strictly on topic.

203
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:53,083
For obvious reasons, we're all operating

204
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,650
under heightened security measures,

205
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:56,785
so, unless you've been dying to know

206
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:58,220
what a chokehold feels like,

207
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,021
keep your credentials visible at all times.

208
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,388
All right?

209
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,623
That's all for now.

210
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:11,565
Meredith Reed, press.

211
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:13,033
It's invalid.

212
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:14,969
What?

213
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:17,171
It can't be invalid.

214
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,506
Can you double check?

215
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:21,440
I did, ma'am. Your credentials
have been revoked.

216
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,174
Revoked by whom?

217
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,742
I don't have that information.

218
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,911
Okay, this has to be some sort of mistake.

219
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:28,912
You do remember me.
I've been here every day.

220
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,548
Please step aside, ma'am.

221
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,357
I just talked to Secretary of State Kanin.

222
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:47,759
He's agreed to IAEAnspectors.

223
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,393
That's good news.

224
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:51,225
There is a condition attached.

225
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:52,660
They're insisting

226
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:54,895
that the head of the
verification team be an American.

227
00:12:57,598 --> 00:12:59,365
I think we can live with that, don't you?

228
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:01,000
You know where I stand.

229
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:03,703
We've already surrendered too
much in the name of peace.

230
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,605
Surrender is a strong word, Farhad.

231
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:09,307
And what have we surrendered really,

232
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:11,375
apart from our nuclear ambition?

233
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:13,176
Isn't that enough?

234
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,144
Spinning 6,000 centrifuges

235
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,746
is good for political maneuvering,

236
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:19,181
but it's helping to bankrupt our country.

237
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:20,950
The truth is,

238
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,018
we are not the ones being so generous.

239
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:25,920
President Taylor is lifting
economic sanctions,

240
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:28,523
and offering an aid package
worth billions of dollars.

241
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,424
We got everything we wanted, Farhad.

242
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:32,593
As long as it's not a trick.

243
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:38,731
Hello.

244
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,569
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
with something so mundane,

245
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:46,572
but I'm stuck outside.

246
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,974
Stuck?

247
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,639
My press credentials

248
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:52,407
have been revoked.

249
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:53,641
I dI'll take care of it.

250
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,909
Are you sure?

251
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:56,043
Of course.

252
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,211
Thank you.

253
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,413
Will you, uh, will you still have
time for the interview later?

254
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:04,249
Yes. After the press conference.

255
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:05,883
I'm looking forward to it, Mr. President.

256
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:07,717
So am I.

257
00:14:11,054 --> 00:14:13,455
Reinstate Miss Reed's clearance.

258
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:14,989
I was only...

259
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:16,323
Just do it.

260
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:19,493
Omar, people are starting to talk

261
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:20,928
about you and this reporter.

262
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:23,096
And saying what?

263
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:24,965
Miss Reed is a journalist

264
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,767
and she's profiling me for her newspaper.

265
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:28,334
But you have feelings for her.

266
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:29,802
I'm friendly with her.

267
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,170
Think whatever you like.

268
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,440
This woman poses no threat
to me or the peace process.

269
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,410
Not here maybe, but back in our country

270
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,478
you'll be torn apart.

271
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,480
The mullahs will say that you
have been corrupted by the West.

272
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,648
What do you say, Farhad?

273
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:46,249
Have I?

274
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,118
Have I been corrupted by the West?

275
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:50,653
You know I don't believe that.

276
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,522
But you are married.

277
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,859
Dalia hasn't been a wife
to me for a long time.

278
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:58,093
That's no excuse to be reckless.

279
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,328
I've done nothing reckless.

280
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:04,598
I've done nothing reckless.

281
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,001
Just reinstate Miss Reed's clearance now.

282
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,070
I'll see to it.

283
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:39,158
Victor.

284
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,960
What are you doing here?

285
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,794
How the hell did you find me?

286
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,495
I was always resourceful, Jack.

287
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:46,630
That's what you liked about me. Get in here.

288
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:48,898
Take a seat.

289
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:50,500
What happened?

290
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:51,969
I need help.

291
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,069
You need an ambulanc

292
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:54,403
No, no, don't call.

293
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:55,904
That's what he's waiting for.

294
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,073
He's listening to the emergencchannels. Who?

295
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,908
Just listen to me, Jack. I have information.

296
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,576
The best I can do for you, Victor,
is get you an ambulance.

297
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:04,812
I'm out. I don't work for
the government anymore.

298
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,080
Oh, this you're going to want to hear.

299
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:08,083
Why?

300
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,318
Why? Because you're the guy who
always does the right thing.

301
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,587
There's a big hit going down.

302
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:16,721
On who?

303
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:17,722
President Hassan at the UN.

304
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,723
He's getting taken out.

305
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,993
When? Today.

306
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:22,695
Before he can sign this thing with Taylor.

307
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,532
You see? I told you you'd be interested.

308
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,933
How do you know this?

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,067
I'm the one that got the
hitter into the country.

310
00:16:31,135 --> 00:16:32,668
I've been setting him up with what he needs.

311
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:34,102
And then he tried to take you out.

312
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,670
Look, Jack, you're the only one

313
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:37,439
at CTU I ever did business with.

314
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:39,709
I need you to call them, vouch for me,

315
00:16:39,777 --> 00:16:42,045
so I can cut a deal.

316
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:43,280
Come on, Jack.

317
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,681
(groans) Keep your seat.

318
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:46,183
Look, I swear, this is real.

319
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,717
Someone is trying to make sure

320
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:49,186
that this peace agreement does not happen.

321
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,890
I'm not doing anything until
you give me your weapon.

322
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,929
Better not be screwing with me.

323
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,230
I'm not. I swear, I'm not.

324
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:02,698
Who's the hitter? What's his name?

325
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:03,832
Who's the hitter?!

326
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,100
I don't know his name.

327
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:06,701
He's Russian or something. Not good enough.

328
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:08,436
Who is the hitter?! Look.

329
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:12,140
I know how to find him and stop
him before he makes the hit.

330
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,644
But I'm not saying another
word until I make my deal.

331
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,448
You're lucky I'm retired.

332
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,402
This is Cole Ortiz.

333
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:46,069
Move Singer's team to the northeast

334
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:47,737
quadnt, and tell him, from now on,

335
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,273
I want updates every quarter hour.

336
00:17:49,341 --> 00:17:51,574
Get back to me with confirmations.

337
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:53,242
Hastings wants you to
expand the patrol perimeter

338
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,510
around the UN another quarter mile.

339
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:55,711
I'm glad that's what he wants,

340
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,312
but I barely have enough men to cover

341
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,546
the perimeter now.

342
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,815
I'll see if I can get
NYPD to help you cover.

343
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:02,650
Uh, Dana?

344
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,584
My sister--

345
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,718
she said she lt you a couple of messages.

346
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,852
Something about bridesmaids' dresses.

347
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,186
I told her there was probably

348
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,287
something wrong with your voicemail.

349
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,755
I got her messages.

350
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,756
I just haven't had a chance.
These double shifts...

351
00:18:13,824 --> 00:18:15,524
I revised the patrol protocols at the UN.

352
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:16,992
Thought you might like

353
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,493
to take a look at it before
I distributed it. Yeah.

354
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:20,161
Yeah, I do. I will call your sister

355
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:21,329
back, I promise.

356
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:22,963
Thanks.

357
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,802
Damn it, what is the problem?

358
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:32,005
Percussive maintenance?

359
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:33,473
That's what my network apps professor

360
00:18:33,508 --> 00:18:35,175
called it when I hit my computer.

361
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:36,710
Can I help?

362
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:38,545
I just got the revised attendee list

363
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:40,113
for the press conference.
I can't get the facial

364
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,447
recognition done in time.

365
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:43,950
Oh, you're running each
person through individually.

366
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:45,151
You can do them in a batch.

367
00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:47,286
Not if the data's in different formats.

368
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:48,754
Well, that used to be true, but here.

369
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,062
Like I said, there's no reon
to be shy out asking for help.

370
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,197
Okay? Don't worry.

371
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:00,532
You'll catch u You're doing great.

372
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,034
Excuse me.

373
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,702
O'Brian.

374
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,869
Chloe, it's Jack.

375
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,170
Jack.

376
00:19:08,238 --> 00:19:09,872
How's Kim? Did you tell her about LA?

377
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,173
Yeah, but I can't go into that right now.

378
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:12,340
I need to speak to the director.

379
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:14,941
Mr. Hastings is on the phone,

380
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:17,175
and he really doesn't
like to be interrupted.

381
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,509
Well, tell him it's regarding a plot

382
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:19,509
to assassinate President Has

383
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:21,142
See if that ts his attention.

384
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,209
Oh. Okay, hold on.

385
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,184
All right, now,
give me an overlay on the UN,

386
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,685
view from the west.

387
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:38,054
Now, overlay the distribution
of security teams, please.

388
00:19:38,122 --> 00:19:40,923
That looks good.

389
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:44,192
Now, give me a comp with
incident reports and

390
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,761
satellite imaging. Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

391
00:19:46,829 --> 00:19:49,063
Gary, hold on for a second.

392
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:50,998
Jack Bauer's on line three. He says he nds

393
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,900
to talk to you. Bauer?

394
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:54,334
It's about a plot against President Hassan.

395
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,936
I thought you'd want to take the call.

396
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,573
Gary, I'll call you back.

397
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:04,609
Mr. Bauer, thiss Brn Hastgs.

398
00:20:04,677 --> 00:20:06,878
Mr. Hastings, I'm with an
informant that I used to run

399
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:08,346
who's claiming he's got
intel on an assassination

400
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:09,747
attempt on President Hassan.

401
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:11,616
He says it's going to take place today.

402
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:12,783
We've received several ats

403
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:14,118
in regard to the peace conference.

404
00:20:14,185 --> 00:20:15,285
I can only imagine.

405
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,453
My informant's name Victor Aruz.

406
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:17,721
I used him in the Salazar op.

407
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:19,556
You should be able to
pull his file Pull it up.

408
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:21,557
He's been shot in the arm-
he claims byhe assassin.

409
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,892
Look, I don't think

410
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,860
this is something you should take lightly.

411
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:28,630
And what does Mr. Aruz want
in return for his information?

412
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:30,565
CTU protection and immunity.

413
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:33,033
That's a lot to ask, Mr. Bauer.

414
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:34,334
Have you pulled his file yet?

415
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,236
No. JACK: Mr. Hastings,

416
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:39,805
I know this son of a bitch,
and my instinct is telling me

417
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,406
that you need to pay attention to this.

418
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,974
I need more than your instinct, Mr. Bauer.

419
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,478
CTU isn't the organization you knew.

420
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,480
Okay, fine, but understand this:

421
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,081
If anything happens to President Hassan,

422
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,450
I will be obligated to call
President Taylor and tell her

423
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,385
that I tried to provide you with this intel,

424
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:57,087
and you ignored it.

425
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,889
What is taking so long for the file?

426
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:01,157
Sorry. I'm still searching
through the archives.

427
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,492
Mr. Hastings, I need your answer now.

428
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,493
Are you bringing Aruz in or not?

429
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,561
(sighs)

430
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:11,297
Let me talk to him.

431
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:13,765
I'll put you on speaker.

432
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,066
Go ahead.

433
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,768
Mr. Aruz, I'm gonna need some other details

434
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:19,236
to corroborate your story.

435
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:20,870
The hitter took out two of my guys.

436
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:22,071
Manuel Escobar and Mauricio Tellez.

437
00:21:22,138 --> 00:21:23,138
Check with t cops.

438
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:24,973
We will.

439
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,474
Mr. Bauer,

440
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:27,641
where are you?

441
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,142
1145 West 18th.

442
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,243
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.

443
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:32,611
The closest helipad

444
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:35,079
to you is... the 12th precinct.

445
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:36,447
That's five blocks away.

446
00:21:36,514 --> 00:21:37,581
Can you t him there,

447
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,315
Mr. Bauer?

448
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:43,355
Yeah.

449
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:45,157
I'll have a team there in 20 minutes.

450
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:46,993
Make sure you don't use official channels.

451
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,695
We believe the assassin is
monitoring emergency bandwidth.

452
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:50,198
Got it.

453
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:55,303
Gather comm and tactical,
tell them we've got a situation.

454
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:57,372
JACK: Let's go.

455
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:07,646
There you are.

456
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:11,617
Now that doesn't suck.

457
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:12,618
Arlo.

458
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:13,619
Yeah.

459
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:15,387
Come on. Hastings called

460
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:16,822
an emergency briefing.

461
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,056
And if he ever catches you

462
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:19,691
doing that, you're gonna be out of a job.

463
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,026
Be worth it.

464
00:22:21,093 --> 00:22:22,527
I think this mig be love.

465
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:23,527
Now.

466
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:25,295
This is CTU

467
00:22:25,363 --> 00:22:28,364
transferring control of drones A31 and 32

468
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,198
to HS aerial command.

469
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,199
Yeah, roger that.

470
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,733
Offload confirmed.

471
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:34,435
l right, we've got a situation.

472
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:36,970
Cole, I need you to scramble
a chopper for a pickup.

473
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,004
Yeah. I haven't finished distributing

474
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,005
the new patrol parameters.

475
00:22:39,073 --> 00:22:40,306
This is a priority.

476
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:41,507
Who am I picking up?

477
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:42,708
Someone who claims to have intel

478
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:43,742
about a threat to President Hassan.

479
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:46,143
How good is the intel?

480
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,410
Well, according to Jack Bauer, very.

481
00:22:47,478 --> 00:22:48,745
Jack Bauer?

482
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:50,179
He's delivering the informant.

483
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:51,947
Who is Jack Bauer?

484
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:56,885
Location downtown; Chloe's
sending you the coordinates.

485
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:58,386
Take a small team with you.

486
00:22:58,454 --> 00:22:59,854
Torres' people are free.

487
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:02,056
Yes, sir. And I'll need a second
team to secure the landing.

488
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:03,992
One team will be enough. We'll use a drone

489
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:05,494
to protect the ground operation.

490
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,830
Arlo, scramble a drone
alongside the chopper.

491
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:09,498
Full spectrum coverage of the landing zone

492
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:11,902
as well as the air corridor.

493
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,771
Done.

494
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:41,465
We're clear.

495
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:50,706
Dispatch, this is Unit 2354.

496
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,941
DISPATCH: Go ahead, 2354.

497
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,076
Got a plate match on a stolen vehicle.

498
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:58,379
(various overlapping radio communications)

499
00:23:58,446 --> 00:23:59,846
(tuning in):...03 Pontiac.

500
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:06,316
Plate: Sierra, November, Echo,
one, five, Charlie, five.

501
00:24:06,384 --> 00:24:08,017
Got bullet holes in the windshield and body.

502
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,052
That's him.

503
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,152
DISPATCH: Roger that.

504
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,554
What's yr location?

505
00:24:11,621 --> 00:24:14,590
Vee's parked o18th,
just west of Ninth Avenue.

506
00:24:14,657 --> 00:24:16,491
We'll take care of it.

507
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,592
Will you?

508
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,528
Or am I going to have to step in?

509
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:24,765
Now would be the time to tell me.

510
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,599
Aruz is a dead man, sir.

511
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,067
You have my word.

512
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,303
Good.

513
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:57,732
Thank you.

514
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,798
Excuse me, Madam President.

515
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,634
President Hassan accepted our
counterproposals on inspections.

516
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:07,067
That is great news.

517
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,868
By the end of this next session,

518
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,636
we may have a signed agreement.

519
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:14,806
It's an extraordinary
accomplishment, Allison.

520
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:18,743
(sighing)

521
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,179
Is something wrong?

522
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:25,749
I was thinking about Henry.

523
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:29,152
Achieving a comprehensive peace agreement

524
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,454
with the Islamic Republic
was was something that

525
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:33,423
he and I talked about years ago.

526
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:38,562
I wish that he were here
to share the moment.

527
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,434
You surprised?

528
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:46,037
Considering his behavior during the divorce,

529
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,772
yes, I am surprised.

530
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,373
He went out of his way to hurt you,

531
00:25:50,441 --> 00:25:51,407
especially in the press.

532
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:52,975
He was angry, Ethan.

533
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,743
I sent our daughter to prison.

534
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,744
You refused to cover up a murder.

535
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:59,379
Olivia was responsible for what happened--

536
00:25:59,447 --> 00:26:00,681
no one else.

537
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:03,216
Still, if the the situation
had been reversed,

538
00:26:03,284 --> 00:26:05,952
I might've felt the same way as Henry.

539
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:07,753
Sorry if I'm interrupting, but I just talked

540
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:08,887
to Brian Hastings at CTU.

541
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:10,289
What's going on, Rob?

542
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:12,324
They have someone who
claims he's got information

543
00:26:12,391 --> 00:26:14,092
about an assassination plot on Hassan.

544
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,260
How real is the threat?

545
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,528
Real enough to loop you in.

546
00:26:16,596 --> 00:26:18,397
This informant came to
them through Jack Bauer.

547
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:19,732
I thought that

548
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,935
Jack was out of all of this.
How did he get involved?

549
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:23,970
As far as I can tell,
this informant came to him.

550
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:25,939
We'll know more once the
informant signs an immunity deal,

551
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:27,174
provided you authorize it.

552
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:29,009
How secure is the venue
for the press conference?

553
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:30,611
Very. And I just raised the alert level.

554
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,414
But we need to set up a call to
inform Hassan about the threat,

555
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:34,548
ideally before the conference gets started.

556
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:35,715
We can't tell Hassan.

557
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:38,050
<i>Certainly not before the press
conference.</i>

558
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:39,317
Why not?

559
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:41,986
Well, he might scuttle everything,
out of concern

560
00:26:42,054 --> 00:26:43,987
for his own safety. Hassan's a big boy.

561
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:46,322
He's used to taking risks or he
wouldn't be here; you know that.

562
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,990
Plus, if Hassan finds out we knew
about this and didn't tell him,

563
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:50,458
then all the trust we've built up

564
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,159
over the last year goes out the window,

565
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:53,827
and then he'll pull out of talks.

566
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:55,528
And frankly, I wouldn't blame him.

567
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:02,801
I'll think about it.

568
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:04,870
Thank you both.

569
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:12,645
Madam President, I'm telling you,

570
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:13,913
holding this back from Hassan

571
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:15,615
could be disastrous.

572
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:18,017
I said I'd think about it, Rob.

573
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:19,118
Thank you.

574
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,339
Ethan...

575
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:44,843
Listen-- sorry if I went after
you a little hard in there.

576
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,778
Uh, I was just making my point.

577
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:48,847
No need to apologize, Rob.

578
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:50,415
I recommended you to the President

579
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:53,151
<i>because you're not afraid
to speak up.</i>

580
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:55,387
She needs that.

581
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:58,623
Yeah, well, still,
I know I can get carried away; I...

582
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:02,994
Don't worry, kid... I ain't dead yet.

583
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:05,230
I can handle mysf.

584
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:07,899
Even up against you.

585
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:18,377
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

586
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:21,313
Hey, we're almost finished packing.
Are you on your way?

587
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,348
Something came up.
I'm gonna be a little late.

588
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:26,482
How late?

589
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,784
I think I should meet you at the airpo.

590
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:29,785
Is everything okay?

591
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:31,186
Yeah.

592
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,520
Are you sure?

593
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,488
Kim, I promise everything's fine.

594
00:28:34,556 --> 00:28:37,590
Well, Teri is so excited that
you're coming back with us.

595
00:28:37,658 --> 00:28:39,825
Just, uh, let me know
when you're on your way.

596
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,960
Okay, thanks, sweetheart.

597
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:44,363
Keep your eyes open.

598
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,498
The precinct's two blocks away.

599
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:48,232
Let's cut through here. Come on.

600
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:51,601
The FAA's cleared a route and informed

601
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:54,736
all relevant agencies that
we will be in the air.

602
00:28:55,938 --> 00:28:57,438
Good luck.

603
00:28:57,506 --> 00:29:00,009
Aruz's file-- it was in
a proprietary database.

604
00:29:00,077 --> 00:29:01,645
That's why it took so long.

605
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:03,915
Still, that shouldn't have thrown you-
you've been here a month.

606
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,453
Almost a month, and I've had
to relearn the interface

607
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,288
on every major system here;
everything's changed.

608
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:10,690
And you're having trouble adapting,
I understand.

609
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:12,991
But I don't think it's a
question of your intelligence.

610
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,426
Thanks.

611
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:16,061
I think it's ambivalence.

612
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:17,428
Ambivalence?!

613
00:29:17,496 --> 00:29:19,597
I know the only reason
you only took this job

614
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:21,566
was because your husband was downsized.

615
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:24,234
Am I wrong? No!

616
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:25,469
I mean, yes.

617
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,537
Please, just give me a little more time

618
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:29,005
to get up to speed here.

619
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:32,841
Mr. Hastings, I need this job.

620
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:35,609
Fair enough.

621
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:37,711
But I'm all about efficiency, so if your

622
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:38,945
performance doesn't improve,

623
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,479
you may want to rethink working here.

624
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:44,250
Now, I trust this has been clarifying.

625
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,419
Sure.

626
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:48,054
If you really wanted to be more efficient,

627
00:29:48,122 --> 00:29:49,456
why don't you just say

628
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,692
if I don't catch up soon,
I'm going to be fired?

629
00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:00,703
Your flight path is a straight shot

630
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,335
southwest over the river,
and the 12th Precinct

631
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,803
has confirmed that their helipad is clear

632
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,538
and operational.
Comm net and satellite coverage

633
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:07,672
of your flight, both legs,

634
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,107
and full-time aerial from the drone--

635
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:10,841
Why are you looking at me like that?

636
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,143
Like what?

637
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,180
Look, I just want to make
sure nothing's wrong.

638
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:19,348
Nothing's wrong,

639
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:21,315
like I said.

640
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,750
Just be careful, okay?

641
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:25,151
I will be.

642
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:26,285
You ready?

643
00:30:26,353 --> 00:30:28,020
Yeah.

644
00:30:31,256 --> 00:30:34,125
You know, maybe she
should finally set a date.

645
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:35,526
She's getting cold feet.

646
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:36,694
How about you shut up

647
00:30:36,762 --> 00:30:38,863
and just focus on your assignment?

648
00:31:02,086 --> 00:31:03,253
Come on, Victor!

649
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:07,624
Victor? Victor!

650
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:08,959
Stay with me.

651
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:10,493
Victor, stay with me!

652
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:11,661
Stay with...

653
00:31:12,796 --> 00:31:14,964
Damn it.

654
00:31:44,761 --> 00:31:46,528
Stay with me!

655
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,530
We're going to need to recompress the wound.

656
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:13,359
TV REPORTER: If successful,
the agreement could be the beginning

657
00:32:13,426 --> 00:32:15,561
of a real lasting peace in a lon
g-troubled region.

658
00:32:15,628 --> 00:32:18,196
Presidents Taylor and Hassan

659
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:19,998
are scheduled to give their first joint

660
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:22,934
press conference in just
a few minutes, and we'll

661
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,068
carry that live.

662
00:32:24,136 --> 00:32:26,003
In a moment, Christiane Doumany will have

663
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,671
a report on the history of
the many failed attempts

664
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,139
at a Mideast peace,

665
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:32,108
and why this accord may be different.

666
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,378
It's time to go.

667
00:32:37,446 --> 00:32:39,581
Tell your father I'll be right there.

668
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:42,186
I'll wait until you're done.

669
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,490
He doesn't trust me to be on time.

670
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,758
Of course he trusts you.

671
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:59,201
When did you become such a good liar?

672
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,438
You don't have to defend your father, Dalia.

673
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,277
He can take care of himself.

674
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:24,660
You look beautiful, Dalia.

675
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:26,328
And you look handsome.

676
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:32,635
Let's not pretend any more than we have to.

677
00:33:41,513 --> 00:33:43,881
I'm sorry you had to see that.

678
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:45,816
It's not your fault.

679
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:52,358
My dear Kayla.

680
00:33:54,528 --> 00:33:55,995
We should go.

681
00:33:57,031 --> 00:33:58,031
Yes.

682
00:34:27,013 --> 00:34:28,380
Let her through.

683
00:34:42,825 --> 00:34:43,925
Thank you.

684
00:34:43,993 --> 00:34:47,028
I will tell you the same
thing that I told him.

685
00:34:47,096 --> 00:34:49,028
Unless you want to destroy

686
00:34:49,096 --> 00:34:52,829
everything that he's worked for,
stay away from him.

687
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,169
Excuse me, ma'am.

688
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:08,803
President Hassan is on his way.

689
00:35:13,006 --> 00:35:15,006
You're not going to tell
him he's being targeted.

690
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:17,308
Madam President, I'm sorry.

691
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,476
You risk destroying in a
single day all the-- Rob,

692
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:20,910
you've made your point.

693
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:22,144
More than once.

694
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:24,014
And believe me, I don't like keeping this

695
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,850
from President Hassan any more than you do.

696
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,051
Then tell him.

697
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:34,222
Mr. President.

698
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,824
Ladies.

699
00:35:37,393 --> 00:35:39,194
You've met my chief of staff?

700
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:40,194
Of course.

701
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:41,562
Hello, Mr. President.

702
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,665
I haven't had the chance to
thank you for compromising

703
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:46,099
on the verification issue.

704
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:49,669
It was the right thing to do.

705
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:51,338
If you don't mind,

706
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:52,739
I'd like to brief you both

707
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:54,574
on the format of the press conference.

708
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:56,409
The Secretary-General will be introducing

709
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:58,345
you both after some brief remarks.

710
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:00,313
The conference itself
shouldn't take any longer

711
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:02,182
than 25 minutes or so.

712
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,953
Put your hand on it.

713
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:09,339
Let's go.

714
00:36:09,406 --> 00:36:10,873
We're almost there.

715
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:12,275
MAN: Don't move!

716
00:36:12,343 --> 00:36:14,110
Got a call that you two are having

717
00:36:14,178 --> 00:36:15,545
a problem down here. What's up?

718
00:36:15,613 --> 00:36:16,980
Officer, my name is Jack Bauer.

719
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:19,115
I'm transporting this man on behalf of CTU.

720
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:20,416
He's an informant vital

721
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:21,616
to national security.

722
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:23,551
Call it in. Listen to me.

723
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,186
The men that are trying to kill him

724
00:36:25,254 --> 00:36:26,654
are monitoring all emergency channels.

725
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:28,222
Do not let him make that call.

726
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,523
Shut up and get against the Dumpster.

727
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,790
Now!

728
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,225
At least take us into the precinct.

729
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:34,460
We can verify everything there.

730
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:37,296
Get down, now!

731
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,609
Damn it!

732
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:58,815
I'm going to cover you.

733
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,917
Make a run for the door.

734
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,517
You ready? Go! Go!

735
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:08,621
I'm out of bullets.

736
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:13,157
Chloe, it's Jack.
How far out is the helicopter?

737
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:14,458
Two minutes. Jack, what's wrong?

738
00:37:14,526 --> 00:37:15,659
We're under attack.

739
00:37:15,727 --> 00:37:16,993
I need you to put me in touch

740
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:18,194
with whoever's in command of that unit.

741
00:37:18,262 --> 00:37:19,295
Okay. It's Agent Ortiz.

742
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,596
He's the head of field ops.

743
00:37:20,664 --> 00:37:22,364
Is there a problem? Yes.

744
00:37:22,432 --> 00:37:25,433
Mr. Hastings, we have a
situation with the pickup.

745
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,001
Keep going to the roof. Now.

746
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:28,001
Don't stop for anything.

747
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:29,369
Keep going.

748
00:37:31,105 --> 00:37:33,338
Agent Ortiz, you're on with
Jack Bauer. ORTIZ: Roger.

749
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:34,773
What's going on, Mr. Bauer?

750
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:36,174
We're being pursued by two shooters.

751
00:37:36,241 --> 00:37:38,042
There's no way we're going
to make the precinct.

752
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,676
We're in a building on West 21st,

753
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:41,144
three doors in from Ninth Avenue.

754
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,146
We're heaWe're lookingposition
for an alternate pickup.ne.

755
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:47,314
Copy that.

756
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:58,321
Right there-- the roof of that
parking structure might work.

757
00:37:58,389 --> 00:37:59,322
Can you zoom in closer?

758
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:00,323
The satellite's refreshing.

759
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,324
It'll take a minute.

760
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:03,293
I'm moving the drone there now.

761
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,362
There's a parking structure next

762
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:05,396
to the building you're in.

763
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:06,464
Roof looks clear to land.

764
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:07,665
DANA: Did you get that, Cole?

765
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:09,634
Yeah, I see it. Mr. Bauer,

766
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:11,471
looks like you can access that roof

767
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,142
from the eighth floor of
the building you're in.

768
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:14,877
How far out are you? 90 seconds.

769
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:16,246
Copy that.

770
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:17,780
Don't be late.

771
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:23,853
Victor... Victor, listen to me.

772
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:25,721
You got to tell me everything
you know about the hitter,

773
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:26,756
so I can call it in

774
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:28,124
in case we don't make it.

775
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:30,159
If I don't make it,
I don't care what happens.

776
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,695
Get me to CTU.

777
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:36,865
You always were a son of a bitch.

778
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,367
Come on.

779
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:08,066
Come on.

780
00:39:08,134 --> 00:39:09,601
Let's go.

781
00:39:12,005 --> 00:39:13,138
Stay there.

782
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:35,960
Lock down access points to the roof!

783
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:40,231
Where are the hostiles? They're dead.

784
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:43,133
You need to get him out of here.
He's losing a lot of blood.

785
00:39:43,201 --> 00:39:44,801
Cole Ortiz. It's an honor to meet you.

786
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:46,069
Thanks for doing this.

787
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:47,971
Look, Hastings wants to
debrief you back at CTU.

788
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,806
I'm not going back to CTU.
I delivered him, I'm done.

789
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:52,643
No, Mr. Bauer... I got a flight to catch.

790
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,311
That's it?

791
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,547
Get down!

792
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,594
Ortiz, report in.

793
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,195
CHLOE: Agent Ortiz?

794
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,299
Agent Ortiz, what's your status?

795
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:24,703
Agent Ortiz?

796
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:27,505
Jack, come in.

797
00:40:27,573 --> 00:40:29,174
Jack, can you hear me?

798
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:31,809
Anyone, come in.

799
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:40,851
Victor.

800
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:43,486
Victor, Victor, come on.

801
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,187
Stay with me, stay with me.

802
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:46,255
Listen to me.

803
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:47,623
You don't want to die like this.

804
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,958
Do the right thing.

805
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:51,192
Tell me what you know.

806
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:55,594
The hitter has someone on the inside.

807
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,964
Close to Hassan.

808
00:41:00,032 --> 00:41:02,033
Give me a name

809
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:04,235
Give me a name. Give me a name!

810
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,570
Victor...

811
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:07,705
Victor, who's on the inside?

812
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:09,974
Victor!

813
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:11,075
Come on.

814
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:12,778
Come on, come on.

815
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:17,415
No.

816
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:22,554
He's dead.

817
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:32,330
No.

818
00:41:32,397 --> 00:41:33,898
The brother revoked my clearance,

819
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,033
but I had Hassan reinstate it.

820
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:38,469
No, I know.

821
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,605
I know I'm behind schedule.

822
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:42,908
But it'll get done.

9999
