1
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:15,273
As we gather together

2
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:18,409
for this great occasion,
we must not forget

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:22,914
that we all stand in the shadow
of Omar Hassan's

4
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,582
tragic death.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,484
But...

6
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:30,321
the peace agreement we're
about to sign will be

7
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:32,123
his living memorial.

8
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,260
His courage brought us all
to this historic day,

9
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,661
and his vision

10
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:41,432
will continue to guide us
as we move into the future...

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,334
together.

12
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:46,070
So on behalf
of the people of Russia,

13
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:47,805
I extend the open hand
of friendship

14
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:50,608
to my partners in peace:

15
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,976
President Taylor,

16
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:53,811
President Hassan.

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,980
Thank you very much.

18
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,516
(reporters shouting questions)

19
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,184
SECRETARY GENERAL: There'll
be time for questions

20
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,120
after the signing
ceremony. Please, please.

21
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,563
DALIA: If there's
nothing more,

22
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,424
I will see you both
at the signing.

23
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:15,199
It appears I am not the only one
who does not want to be here.

24
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:18,369
Mrs. Hassan is distraught.

25
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:21,239
Understandably- her husband
was killed six hours ago.

26
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:24,208
Is that why she refuses
to look at me?

27
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:28,146
She knows.

28
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,551
A reporter told her
of your complicity

29
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,419
in her husband's murder.

30
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:38,456
Dalia came to me.

31
00:01:38,524 --> 00:01:41,325
And you confirmed
this journalist's allegations.

32
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,494
I told her the truth.

33
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:47,098
And yet, knowing what she knows,
she's still here.

34
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:52,904
Mrs. Hassan understands
the benefits of peace.

35
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,374
Because you helped her
come to that understanding.

36
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,376
Excuse me, Madam President.

37
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:00,244
(speaking Russian)

38
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:06,617
Whatever it was you said
to Mrs. Hassan to keep her here

39
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:09,086
must have been very convincing.

40
00:02:11,123 --> 00:02:13,791
Take your call, Yuri.

41
00:02:16,061 --> 00:02:18,062
(speaking Russian)

42
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,010
Charles.

43
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:35,479
Yuri. We need to talk.

44
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,415
So talk.

45
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:39,483
Uh, it's a
sensitive matter;

46
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,953
something that, uh, that can't
be discussed on the phone.

47
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,221
All right.

48
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,522
SUVAROV:
Come to my suite.

49
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,324
LOGAN:
No. You need to come to mine.

50
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,125
SUVAROV:
Why?

51
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:50,228
LOGAN:
Just trust me, Yuri.

52
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,696
SUVAROV:
Trust you?

53
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,164
I don't need
to remind you

54
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:55,533
that it is in our
mutual self-interest

55
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:58,502
to make sure that certain
secrets stay secret.

56
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,171
Stop talking
in riddles, Charles.

57
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,240
I don't have
time for this.

58
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,508
There's a possible leak
inside of your camp,

59
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,846
<i>which is why we need
to discuss this in my office.</i>

60
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,915
I'll be right there.

61
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:14,919
(phone beeps)

62
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,055
I hope I was

63
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:19,423
convincing enough for you.

64
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,525
You're a world-class liar;
I would have expected

65
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:23,694
nothing else.

66
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,796
What exactly do you
think you're doing

67
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:28,899
by killing Suvarov?

68
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,768
Getting justice
for Renee Walker?

69
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,304
Yes, and for all the other
people that died today

70
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:34,839
trying to protect this country.

71
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:39,076
Now, sit at the desk
and keep the line open.

72
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:42,313
Jack, the audio file you
recorded- we can use it

73
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:43,547
to expose Suvarov.

74
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,016
We can use the CTU servers

75
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,784
to distribute it
to every government agency

76
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,754
and media outlet. President
Taylor's already censored the press.

77
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,355
NSA's putting up firewalls.

78
00:03:51,423 --> 00:03:53,424
Arlo's working on getting
through them right now.

79
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:54,725
The president can't lock down

80
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,794
every media outlet.
(phone ringing)

81
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,828
That's Cole.

82
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:59,096
If I don't answer that,

83
00:03:59,164 --> 00:04:00,631
he's sending a
TAC team in here.

84
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,166
It'll be too late.

85
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,035
I'm gonna finish
what I've started.

86
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:07,972
You've reached
Chloe O'Brian's voicemail.

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,641
Please leave a message.
(phone beeps off)

88
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,710
(indistinct radio chatter)

89
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:21,585
Delta groups, this is base.

90
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,521
Come in, Delta. This
is Delta One. Go ahead.

91
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:25,222
I need you to deploy
all available TAC units

92
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,757
to the 22nd floor
of the Hart Building.

93
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:29,627
I have intel on a possible sniper.
You got I.D. on this hostile?

94
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:31,128
Affirmative.

95
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,596
It's Jack Bauer.

96
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,566
With regard to Bauer, sir,

97
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:38,135
the standing order
is to use lethal force.

98
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,838
The order stands.

99
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,273
Copy that.
We're on our way.

100
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,842
Delta teams two and three,
this is a priority mobilization.

101
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,143
The suspect is Jack Bauer.

102
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,578
Considered armed and dangerous.

103
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,347
Maintain
shoot-on-sight protocol.

104
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,550
TAC AGENT: Copy that. We have
authorization for lethal force.

105
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,424
CHLOE:
Listen to me, Jack. Please.

106
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:01,826
Jack, put down
your rifle,

107
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:03,527
and let me walk you out of here

108
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,363
before they get here.

109
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,832
Killing Pavel and Novakovich
was one thing,

110
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:09,266
but killing Suvarov?

111
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:11,669
The Russians will consider an
assassination of their president

112
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:13,671
on American soil an act of war.

113
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:16,307
He facilitated a terrorist
attack against this country.

114
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,509
<i>That's an act of war.
He's a murderer.</i>

115
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:20,611
You're provoking a war
with a nuclear-armed country.

116
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:21,812
Shut up, Chloe!

117
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,814
Or what?
You're gonna kill me, too?

118
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:27,685
These people need to be stopped.

119
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,120
They need to be
held accountable.

120
00:05:29,187 --> 00:05:30,321
They brought this on themselves.

121
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,655
I don't need to remind you

122
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:32,990
of the collateral damage
you're causing.

123
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,325
Not to mention
the innocent lives

124
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:35,626
that are at stake.

125
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:37,962
(footsteps approaching)

126
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,497
(knocking)

127
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:41,966
Sir, uh, President
Suvarov is outside.

128
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:44,135
He says you're expecting him.

129
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:52,009
Excuse me, sir?

130
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:53,611
Yes.

131
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:56,180
I heard you.

132
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,915
Send him in.

133
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,887
You're gonna start a war
because you lost someone?

134
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,422
This isn't about me.

135
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,791
Renee wouldn't
want you to do this.

136
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:09,260
I said shut up, Chloe!
You know she wouldn't.

137
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,429
She would want you
to use that data card

138
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,930
to get justice.
The last thing

139
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,933
Renee would want is for you
to start a war in her name.

140
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,004
Jack, please, don't dishonor
her memory like this.

141
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:23,941
We should
speak alone.

142
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,109
Yes, of course.

143
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,178
(panting)

144
00:06:35,253 --> 00:06:39,423
This person, the one you say
is leaking information...

145
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:41,492
who is it?

146
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,732
SUVAROV (slowly):
I'm talking to you.

147
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,769
(Jack panting)

148
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:55,406
Okay, we'll do
it your way.

149
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:57,408
But you got to promise me
you'll see this through.

150
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:59,109
Because there's no way I'm
getting out of this building alive.

151
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,878
Jack... You got
to promise me that

152
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:02,112
you will see this through

153
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,515
and that you will do
exactly what I say.

154
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,350
I need to hear it!

155
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,119
I promise.

156
00:07:13,158 --> 00:07:14,992
I'm, uh...

157
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,362
I'm sorry...
for calling you so urgently.

158
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,532
I was, uh, mistaken.

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,569
My concern appeared
to have been unfounded.

160
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:28,706
I- I got a call from my
source just a moment ago.

161
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,909
Um, um...
his information was wrong.

162
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:36,013
I'm so sorry for wasting
your time, Yuri.

163
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,315
Gregor. Vasily.

164
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:49,159
LOGAN:
See you after the signing.

165
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:55,499
Find Pillar.

166
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,003
Sweeping equipment 22nd floor!

167
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:03,140
CHLOE: Jack, the TAC
team's almost here.

168
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,844
I just need to make it
to mobile command.

169
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,914
You won't even get that far; you
won't make it out of the building.

170
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,283
You and Cole found me first
by circumventing CTU.

171
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,585
If Logan hasn't figured that
out yet, he will soon enough.

172
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:17,855
CTU gave you a standing order
with regards to me:

173
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:18,856
to terminate
with extreme prejudice.

174
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:20,624
If you don't shoot me,

175
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,026
that file's not going anywhere.

176
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:24,194
You need to shoot me
and shoot to kill!

177
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:25,496
Point it at me.

178
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:26,764
Point it!

179
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:27,998
And when they come
through the door, tell them

180
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,134
you found me at the sniper
rifle, I turned on you,

181
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,636
and you opened fire. Don't ask
me to do something I can't do.

182
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:34,271
Damn it, Chloe,
pull the trigger!

183
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,873
We are running
out of time.

184
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,508
They are gonna
find us soon.

185
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:38,809
You said you'd do
exactly what I would say,

186
00:08:38,877 --> 00:08:39,810
that you would
follow this through.

187
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:40,811
Now, pull the trigger!

188
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,279
I can't!
Yes, you can,

189
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,280
and you will!

190
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,615
Now, pull the trigger!
No!

191
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:45,716
Damn you, Chloe,

192
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:47,017
pull the trigger!
Jack...

193
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:48,886
We are running out of time!
Pull the trigger!

194
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:50,688
Please don't make me
do this. Chloe, I know

195
00:08:50,755 --> 00:08:52,222
how hard this is for you,
but if you care

196
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,624
about me at all,
you will pull the trigger.

197
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,492
Do it! Chloe,
I'm sorry, I can't.

198
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,760
pull the trigger!
No, Jack!

199
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,195
Pull the trigger!
I'm not gonna do it!

200
00:08:58,263 --> 00:08:59,797
Damn you!
(gunshot)

201
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:03,067
(door bursts open)

202
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:05,536
What happened? He
drew his weapon.

203
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:06,904
I shot him first.

204
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:08,072
Jack Bauer's down
with a gunshot wound

205
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:09,740
to the upper chest.
Send medical to our position.

206
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:12,376
I repeat, Bauer is down.

207
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,350
(phone rings)

208
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:29,985
Chloe, I've been trying
to reach you.

209
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:33,022
Burke's reporting you shot Jack.
I had to. Listen...

210
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,657
I'm on my way there right now.
No.

211
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,659
I need you at
mobile command.

212
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,460
Tell me what's happening.
I have the recording

213
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:39,795
of Logan and Suvarov's
conversation.

214
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:41,030
Jack gave it to me.

215
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,299
If he gave it to you,
why did you shoot him?

216
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:44,900
I'll explain later.
Right now, you need to make sure

217
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,236
that Arlo is ready
to upload that file.

218
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,805
Yeah, okay.

219
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,840
Just...
What's Jack's status?

220
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:53,842
EMTs are working
on him right now.

221
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,711
Is he going to make it?
I don't know.

222
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,713
I'll explain everything
to you when I get there.

223
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:58,881
I'll see you soon.

224
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,731
BURKE:
Ms. O'Brian!

225
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:18,067
NYPD found Mr. Pillar
in the garage.

226
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,269
He was locked in the back
of his SUV.

227
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,371
He wants me to
hold you here. Why?

228
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,039
He's been apprised
of the situation,

229
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:25,507
and he wants
to debrief you.

230
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:27,543
We can do it later at CTU.

231
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:28,978
I'm still running
security here. I'm sorry.

232
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,879
Ms. O'Brian, he was adamant.

233
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,548
I've got to get back
to mobile command.

234
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,184
Ma'am, his authority,
comes from the president.

235
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,619
If you want
to make a call

236
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:38,320
to the White House,
we can do that.

237
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,324
When will he be here?

238
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,493
He's on his way up here now.

239
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:18,861
Hmm, I'm sure it was a terrible
ordeal, Mr. President.

240
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,464
But they told me Bauer's down.

241
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:24,466
It's over.
No. No.

242
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,301
It's not over, Jason.

243
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,303
Bauer has a recording

244
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,272
that implicates me
along with Suvarov.

245
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,674
How do you know?

246
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,343
Because the son of a bitch
played the damn thing for me.

247
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,445
He must've put a bug on me
somewhere

248
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,813
when he attacked the car.

249
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,214
For all I know,

250
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:41,684
he has recorded every
conversation I've had

251
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,018
for the past two hours.

252
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,720
I'm on site now.

253
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,954
I'll recover whatever he's got.

254
00:11:46,022 --> 00:11:47,956
Hey!

255
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:50,426
You're on the line here, too.

256
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,461
If this evidence gets out,

257
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,064
we all go down together.

258
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,965
Yeah, I understand what's
at stake, Mr. President.

259
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,834
I'll call you back when
I have the recording.

260
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,669
Yeah.

261
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:03,372
(exhales forcefully)

262
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,175
Is he stable?

263
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,010
Yes, sir.
Sir,

264
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:09,845
as you requested,
I searched Bauer.

265
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:13,582
We're still combing the site,
but that's what we found so far.

266
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,588
PILLAR:
Are you sure that's it?

267
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,623
BURKE: Like I said, sir,
we're still sweeping.

268
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:24,059
I believe this
phone is yours.

269
00:12:24,127 --> 00:12:26,128
(under breath): Yeah.

270
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,167
It's a, uh,

271
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:33,402
digital recorder, sir,
but it's clean.

272
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,437
There's nothing in it.

273
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,740
Come here.

274
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,243
Excuse us.

275
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:44,046
The data card is missing.

276
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,614
Bauer has a digital file

277
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,449
that poses a threat
to national security.

278
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,585
We need to find it.
Yes, sir. We'll keep looking.

279
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,460
PILLAR:
What happened up here?

280
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,295
He drew his gun
and I shot him.

281
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,730
What more do you
need to know?

282
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,465
Did Bauer give you anything?

283
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,534
What would he have given me?

284
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,035
Bauer had a digital recorder.

285
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,070
The data card's missing.

286
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:09,705
I thought you might
know where it is.

287
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,140
I don't know what
you're talking about.

288
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,209
You didn't see him
stash it anywhere?

289
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:17,546
If I did, I would've taken it
and already logged it

290
00:13:17,614 --> 00:13:19,548
as evidence.

291
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,316
Then you don't mind
emptying your pockets.

292
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:23,986
Um...

293
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,155
I just shot my friend, so...
Unless you want me

294
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,624
to do it for you, I need you
to empty your pockets now.

295
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,559
On what grounds?

296
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:31,827
National security.

297
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,630
Let's go.

298
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,665
(sighs)

299
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:52,581
If I search you,
will I find that data card?

300
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,716
This is ridiculous.

301
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:56,451
Put your hands up here.

302
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,292
I just told you, I shot Jack.

303
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,227
Why would I be helping him?

304
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:08,297
Sorry, Ms. O'Brian, I have
to be absolutely sure.

305
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:29,918
Okay.

306
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:31,987
Hope you enjoyed yourself.

307
00:15:00,717 --> 00:15:03,719
(elevator bell dings)

308
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,028
It's over, Jack.

309
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:15,297
You need to talk to me;
maybe do yourself some good.

310
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:17,366
Where's the data card?

311
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:22,304
(sighs)
Is he stable enough

312
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:23,839
to be treated at CTU
instead of the hospital?

313
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,073
He should be.

314
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,341
He got lucky.
It's a through and through.

315
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:28,010
Through and through.

316
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:29,344
Bullet didn't hit any

317
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:31,113
of his organs or his
arteries. If you're going

318
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,648
to get shot anywhere, that's
where you want it to happen.

319
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:35,317
Son of a bitch!

320
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,753
Get me mobile command.
(mumbling)

321
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,821
What?

322
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,024
You got something
to say to me?

323
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,626
If you've got something to say,
you'd better say it now.

324
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:45,961
Talk to me.

325
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,629
(panting, muttering)

326
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,598
What?

327
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:50,933
(whispering)

328
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,868
(Jack grunting,
Pillar screaming)

329
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:56,038
(screaming continues)

330
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,472
(spits)

331
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,808
(yells)
Get him out of here!

332
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,477
(yells)
Lock down O'Brian!

333
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,912
(groans loudly)

334
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,549
Arlo's ready
to receive the file.

335
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:10,552
Chloe, you need to tell me
why you shot Jack.

336
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,554
Jack said they'd suspect me
if I didn't; He said

337
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,723
my only way out of there with
the evidence is to shoot him.

338
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,725
Medical report said
it went clean through.

339
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:19,895
That no vital organs were hit. You're
telling me you meant to miss them?

340
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:22,798
How did you know
you wouldn't kill him?

341
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,700
I didn't.

342
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:25,734
It's uploading now.

343
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,569
It shouldn't take long.

344
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,805
Chloe...

345
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,673
I just need a few
more seconds.

346
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,975
What's going on?
Just got orders

347
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,309
to lock down Chloe O'Brian.
What orders?

348
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,711
Please step aside.
I'm not going anywhere

349
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:36,778
till you tell me
what's going on.

350
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,313
Sir, we're not going
to ask you again.

351
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:39,681
Step aside.

352
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:42,985
Don't- I order you- stop!

353
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:44,853
I'm ordering you to stop! Don't!

354
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,388
Ms. O'Brian, is this

355
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:47,556
the data card
that Jack Bauer gave you?

356
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:49,191
Yes. You need to listen
to what's on it.

357
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,592
Mr. Pillar will make
that determination.

358
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,927
Pillar is part of the cover-up.

359
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:54,429
That data card will never
make it to evidence.

360
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:55,597
Please!

361
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:56,832
Hold them here.
Don't do this!

362
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:57,866
Burke!

363
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,701
Burke, stop what you're doing!

364
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,103
Think about what you're doing!

365
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,271
Burke, stop!

366
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,109
(phone rings)

367
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:09,144
Pillar.
BURKE: Mr. Pillar,

368
00:17:09,212 --> 00:17:10,812
I locked down O'Brian.

369
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,481
Looks like she was working
with Agent Ortiz.

370
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:13,815
He's in custody, too.

371
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:15,250
Get the data card?

372
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:16,451
Yes, sir.

373
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,719
O'Brian was trying
to upload the file

374
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:18,754
to the main
servers at CTU,

375
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,756
but I stopped
the transmission.

376
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,657
Good work, Agent Burke.

377
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,427
All right, send O'Brian
and Ortiz to CTU lockdown

378
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:26,762
and talk to no one.

379
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,764
Get that data card
to President Logan.

380
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,499
Yes, sir.

381
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,134
Take them to CTU.

382
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:51,995
This is it.

383
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:53,997
(sighs)

384
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:57,834
This is the recording
that Jack Bauer made.

385
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,336
Bauer was working

386
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:03,039
with Chloe O'Brian and a field
agent called Cole Ortiz.

387
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,041
They were planning
to use CTU's servers

388
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:07,077
to disseminate this recording

389
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:10,080
to news organizations,
and-and government officials

390
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:13,083
and watchdog groups
on a massive scale.

391
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:15,085
It almost worked.

392
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:17,821
My people, they never gave up,
and now it's over.

393
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,890
You won.

394
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,493
Congratulations.

395
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,529
Have you listened to this?

396
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:28,231
Yes, yes, but frankly,
it's not worth hearing.

397
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,968
Where is Jack now?

398
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:35,705
He's about to be transported
to CTU under heavy guard.

399
00:18:36,974 --> 00:18:40,277
I realize that this
is a difficult area,

400
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:42,546
but the one thing
we can be certain of

401
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:45,148
is that Jack Bauer will never

402
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:47,117
let this go.

403
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:49,286
No.

404
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:51,388
I don't suppose he will.

405
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:56,393
All great achievements
in state...

406
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,428
are fragile things,

407
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:01,431
Madam President.

408
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:03,967
Especially
in their infancy.

409
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:07,003
They need
to be protected.

410
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:10,006
Our peace agreement-
very vulnerable.

411
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:12,008
As long as Jack Bauer
is out there,

412
00:19:12,076 --> 00:19:14,711
the agreement will
never be safe.

413
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,713
Then we will lock him away

414
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,749
in a black site halfway
around the world.

415
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:22,752
He will find a way,
Madam President.

416
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,654
Mark my words.

417
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:28,391
He will rise out of the
deepest hole in the ground.

418
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,428
He will claw
his way back

419
00:19:31,495 --> 00:19:33,463
from the ends
of the Earth,

420
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:37,033
unless we stop him
before that can happen.

421
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:46,142
Pending approval,
I have taken upon myself

422
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,113
to, uh... put a plan in motion.

423
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,150
Of course you have.

424
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:01,157
I will take your silence

425
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,159
as tacit approval.

426
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:09,900
(door opens)

427
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,569
(Taylor exhales sharply,
door closes)

428
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:17,340
(sighs heavily)

429
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,083
(sniffles)

430
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:29,853
(inserts data card
into laptop port)

431
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,222
A lot of good people
died today,

432
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,623
not just President Hassan.

433
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:38,328
Operatives from CTU, members of
other law enforcement agencies.

434
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,800
Renee Walker.

435
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,138
Who I was
very close to.

436
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,742
These people died today
because President Suvarov

437
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,812
wanted to destroy the peace
treaty for his own interests,

438
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,981
and President Taylor knows
this because I told her,

439
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,050
but she's willing to cover
it up because she believes

440
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:01,818
the peace accord will serve the
greater good. (phone ringing)

441
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,120
She is wrong; it
won't. (sniffles)

442
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:08,625
Yes.

443
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:10,260
Both delegations are here,
ma'am.

444
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:13,797
What about
the secretary general?

445
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,899
He's just outside
in the atrium.

446
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,301
Thank you, Tim.

447
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:22,605
(hangs up phone)

448
00:21:22,673 --> 00:21:23,974
(taps computer key)

449
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,375
(sighs)

450
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:31,648
Lasting peace
cannot simply be political.

451
00:21:31,716 --> 00:21:35,118
It has to be born out of trust
and honesty and understanding

452
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:39,122
and most importantly, a will
on both sides to move forward.

453
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:43,426
Currently,
that will does not exist.

454
00:21:43,494 --> 00:21:45,362
This peace is fraudulent,
and I cannot

455
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,097
in good conscience
allow the people

456
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:50,200
that lost their lives today
to go unspoken for.

457
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:54,104
Kim, you reminded me
of that earlier today.

458
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:56,473
That's who I am.

459
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,644
(Taylor sniffs)

460
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:13,690
(sighs)

461
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,429
Bauer is
being handled.

462
00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:20,497
Is it done?
Yes, sir.

463
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:23,433
All right, then.

464
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,035
(both sigh)
(pats back)

465
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,905
You know, I wasn't sure

466
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,608
the president had the balls
to see this through.

467
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:32,609
Clearly,

468
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:33,610
I underestimated her.

469
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:35,545
We both did, sir.

470
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:37,614
(door opens)

471
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:43,853
Good luck,
Madam President.

472
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,845
This calls

473
00:23:08,913 --> 00:23:10,180
for a celebration.

474
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,115
Huh, a little something
to numb that ear pain?

475
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,616
(chuckles)

476
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,218
What are you
drinking?

477
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:16,920
Whatever you're having,
Mr. President. Yes.

478
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,123
(pouring)

479
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,959
You did well, Jason.

480
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:28,531
You kept your eye
on the prize.

481
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:29,866
Thank you, sir.

482
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:33,503
Here's to, uh, all
the political capital

483
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:35,738
the president is
about to bank

484
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:37,640
downstairs.

485
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,142
And here's
to helping her spend it.

486
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,314
(quiet chatter)

487
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:54,090
(whispering): I keep having to remind
myself that we will be home tomorrow,

488
00:23:54,158 --> 00:23:55,425
and this day

489
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:56,793
will be behind us.

490
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:59,362
(applause)

491
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:24,287
SECRETARY GENERAL: Ladies
and gentlemen, please, please,

492
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:27,223
please take your seats.

493
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,094
Honored delegates

494
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:34,063
and distinguished guests,

495
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:35,398
on behalf of the United Nations,

496
00:24:35,466 --> 00:24:36,799
please allow me
to welcome you

497
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:41,171
to this great occasion
of hope and peace.

498
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:45,175
Today we bear witness
to an extraordinary act

499
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:46,910
in one of the world's
defining dramas.

500
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:48,311
If you would

501
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:51,614
allow me now just to offer a few
private words to those of us

502
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:55,118
that are fortunate enough
to be here now.

503
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:56,519
May we all pledge

504
00:24:56,587 --> 00:25:01,658
to make the spirit
of this moment...

505
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:04,127
a new chapter in the history

506
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:07,797
of all nations.

507
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:10,099
The President
of the United States of America,

508
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,769
please, would you join me?

509
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:17,674
The President
of the Russian Federation

510
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:21,044
and the President of the
Islamic Republic of Kamistan,

511
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:23,846
would you please join me?

512
00:25:37,027 --> 00:25:40,296
Before you is the final draft

513
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,432
of the agreement
that has been negotiated

514
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,835
by you and your representatives
in good faith.

515
00:25:45,903 --> 00:25:47,770
By signing its pages, you commit

516
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,007
your respective countries
to abide by the terms

517
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:55,912
set forth therein, as stipulated
by international law.

518
00:25:57,948 --> 00:26:02,719
President Suvarov, I believe
you are to go first.

519
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,863
(applause)

520
00:26:22,172 --> 00:26:24,474
SECRETARY GENERAL:
President Hassan.

521
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:51,534
(applause)

522
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,564
âª âª

523
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:34,243
(sniffs)

524
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:04,407
âª âª

525
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:21,691
Your husband wanted
me to have this.

526
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,394
I cannot accept it.

527
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:29,465
Madam President,
what are you doing?

528
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,200
What I should have
done hours ago.

529
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:35,671
I urge you to stop
what you are about to do.

530
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,242
Mr. Secretary General,

531
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:42,111
my fellow delegates.

532
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,214
Grave crimes have been committed

533
00:28:45,282 --> 00:28:47,283
in the run-up to this treaty.

534
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,087
I have participated

535
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:52,588
in a conspiracy

536
00:28:52,656 --> 00:28:55,925
to hide those crimes.

537
00:28:57,327 --> 00:29:00,830
Before there can be
a meaningful peace,

538
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:03,232
justice must be served.

539
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,801
(sniffles)

540
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,504
I will be

541
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:11,941
giving a more complete statement
within the hour,

542
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:14,210
but for now,

543
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:17,146
this peace process has come
to an end.

544
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,883
(delegates murmuring)

545
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:34,096
Contact CTU and
have them alert

546
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:35,932
Jack Bauer's
medical transport.

547
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,099
Madam President...

548
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,135
He is about to
be ambushed.

549
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:40,636
Just make the call, Tim!

550
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:42,738
We may already
be too late.

551
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:49,078
Dispatch, this is Tim Woods.

552
00:29:49,146 --> 00:29:50,379
I have an emergency.

553
00:29:50,447 --> 00:29:53,249
The convoy transporting Jack
Bauer is about to be ambushed.

554
00:29:53,317 --> 00:29:55,952
Alert Medical One
immediately.

555
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:58,421
W- do it.

556
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,424
(shuddering)

557
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:03,993
Madam President,
talk to me.

558
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:07,864
Tell me
what's happening.

559
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,500
Ma'am.

560
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:13,135
I have made
a terrible mistake, Tim,

561
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:15,071
one that I can

562
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:19,509
never undo... but I need you
to help me stop it

563
00:30:19,576 --> 00:30:21,511
from becoming worse.

564
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:23,579
Yes, ma'am.

565
00:30:28,218 --> 00:30:29,519
(coughing)

566
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:31,654
DISPATCHER (over radio): Medical
One, this is CTU Dispatch.

567
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,089
(coughing)

568
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:36,425
Medical One, I have a priority
call from Homeland Security.

569
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:38,895
Come in, please.

570
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,029
(Jack groans)

571
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:41,931
(panting)

572
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:45,968
(phone rings)

573
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:48,037
This is Woods.

574
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,143
Thank you.

575
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,915
We didn't make it.

576
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,750
They got Bauer.

577
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,352
(groans loudly)

578
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:11,928
My statement is brief,
and I will take no questions.

579
00:31:13,096 --> 00:31:15,097
Moments ago,

580
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,966
President Taylor
declined to sign

581
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:20,136
the peace accord and excused
herself from the proceedings.

582
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:21,504
She did so after making

583
00:31:21,572 --> 00:31:24,373
allegations of crimes
which she did not specify,

584
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:27,176
and which the United Nations
has no knowledge of.

585
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,279
President Taylor said
that she would come forward

586
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:34,684
within the hour to explain
the reasons for her actions.

587
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:38,354
Until then, please,
direct all queries

588
00:31:38,422 --> 00:31:40,156
to the White House
Communications Office.

589
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:43,125
(phone ringing,
press corps clamoring)

590
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,361
TV REPORTER: President
Taylor herself, after...

591
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,396
(TV turns off)

592
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:49,198
(phone ringing)

593
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:52,234
That's the President
asking about Bauer.

594
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:55,938
(ringing continues)

595
00:31:56,974 --> 00:31:58,107
No.

596
00:32:01,445 --> 00:32:03,045
Let it ring.

597
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:06,515
With due respect, sir,
what good will it do?

598
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:07,817
(ringing continues)

599
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,119
It's over.

600
00:32:10,187 --> 00:32:13,522
Let's not add murder to the list
of charges already against us.

601
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,591
(ringing continues)

602
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,334
You know what, Jason?
You're right.

603
00:32:27,104 --> 00:32:29,372
Go ahead. Pick it up.

604
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:31,407
(ringing continues)

605
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,009
(Pillar clears throat)

606
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,243
PILLAR:
Hello?

607
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:35,411
This is President Taylor.

608
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:37,146
I need to speak
to Charles Logan immediately.

609
00:32:37,214 --> 00:32:38,247
(blow lands)

610
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,316
(groans)
Charles!

611
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,857
This was my last chance,

612
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,925
and Bauer took it away.

613
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:59,669
It's come to this
because of him.

614
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:01,737
(silenced shot)

615
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,310
It's locked.

616
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:11,881
(banging)
Open

617
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,916
the door, Charles!
This is Tim Woods.

618
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,484
I'm with the President
on the 22nd floor.

619
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:17,820
We need the master key
to room 2206 immediately.

620
00:33:17,888 --> 00:33:19,321
(banging resumes)

621
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:21,557
TAYLOR: Damn it,
Charles! Open the door!

622
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:28,998
(gunshot)

623
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:30,599
Madam President,
this way! Now!

624
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:33,536
Tim, I need Logan alive!

625
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:52,537
Can they save him?

626
00:33:52,605 --> 00:33:54,372
They think so,
but Madam President,

627
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,141
they're saying that even if
he regains consciousness,

628
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,477
he's probably suffered
severe brain damage.

629
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:00,746
He knew he was
the only one who could

630
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:03,648
locate Jack.
Not necessarily.

631
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:06,318
CTU's drones have been in the
air for the last four hours.

632
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:08,820
They may be able to back-trace
Jack from the ambush site

633
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:10,255
using archived
surveillance video.

634
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:11,423
Where is Chloe O'Brian?

635
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:12,791
She and Agent Ortiz

636
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:14,259
returned to CTU
about ten minutes ago,

637
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:16,995
under arrest. I want
them released immediately.

638
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:18,330
Tell Chloe to use

639
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:20,665
whatever resources are at her
disposal to find Jack.

640
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:23,101
I've already done that,
Madam President.

641
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,170
Thank you, Tim.

642
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,106
Thank you.

643
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:34,613
EDEN:
Let go of me!

644
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,414
O'Brian, you have no authority.

645
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:37,682
I don't know what you
think you're doing.

646
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,317
Shut up and keep moving.
What the hell

647
00:34:39,385 --> 00:34:41,286
is going on?

648
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:42,921
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

649
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,322
President Taylor
didn't sign the agreement.

650
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,091
She backed out at the last
minute, but she had already

651
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,959
ordered the hit on Jack.
Did she call it off?

652
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:49,494
She tried, but his
ambulance has

653
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:51,696
been ambushed. She has no
way of contacting the hitters.

654
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:53,765
How does she even know Jack's
still alive? She doesn't.

655
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,200
She's had everyone
cleared from the floor

656
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:56,935
except for you, me and Arlo.

657
00:34:57,003 --> 00:34:58,870
Arlo's redirecting the drone
to over the ambush site.

658
00:34:58,938 --> 00:35:01,773
We just got police reports
of an incident downtown.

659
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:03,275
CTU convoy ambushed,

660
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:04,943
three agents wounded,
but they didn't find

661
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:07,179
Jack's body on site. Can
you pull up archived video

662
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:09,881
of the same location?
Already on it.

663
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,321
COLE:
When did this happen?

664
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:18,056
ARLO:
Five minutes ago.

665
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:20,625
Shuttle forward.

666
00:35:24,397 --> 00:35:25,831
Come on, Arlo.
Give me something.

667
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,065
Okay, 30 seconds ago,

668
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:29,334
the van pulled off of Delancey.

669
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:30,502
Damn it.
What?

670
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,636
Lost it under
the Williamsburg Bridge.

671
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:34,039
Go to real time.

672
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:40,111
âª âª

673
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,484
ARLO:
That's it. That's the van.

674
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:48,253
Have NYPD send all units
to the vicinity.

675
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:49,321
They're never going

676
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,556
to make it in time.

677
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:53,592
Um...

678
00:35:56,128 --> 00:35:59,064
Okay, uh, hold on.

679
00:36:01,968 --> 00:36:04,402
Prepare for departure run-through
with Team B in 20 minutes.

680
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,737
I got this!

681
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:07,205
Come on.

682
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:08,573
Turn around.
Turn around.

683
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:11,276
Down on your knees.

684
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:15,247
(panting and groaning quietly)

685
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:17,215
I know who you are.

686
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:19,684
So I'm going to make this,

687
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:21,419
uh, quick and clean.

688
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:25,657
Am I supposed to say thank you?

689
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,297
(grunting)

690
00:36:37,103 --> 00:36:39,938
Stand down! Stand down!

691
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:05,630
I really don't want to do this,
but orders are orders.

692
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:08,166
It's all right.

693
00:37:10,336 --> 00:37:12,370
Pull the trigger.

694
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,640
Sir!

695
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:16,942
Wait! Hold your fire!

696
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:24,582
It's President Taylor.

697
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,884
I don't have positive
confirmation,

698
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,118
but it sounds like her.

699
00:37:27,186 --> 00:37:28,420
She says CTU
has a drone overhead.

700
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:30,989
They're got a directed
microwave signal.

701
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:33,658
That's how they got
through to the phone.

702
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,201
Madam President?

703
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:45,704
I am ordering you
to release Jack Bauer

704
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:47,872
immediately!
Ma'am?

705
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,107
You heard me!

706
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:52,877
You and your men are
to leave Mr. Bauer where he is.

707
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:56,047
Stand down and withdraw
outside the west gate

708
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:58,149
until the FBI arrives.

709
00:37:58,217 --> 00:38:01,186
If you have any thoughts
of fleeing before then,

710
00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:03,788
the drone is equipped
with two AGM-114

711
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:06,491
Hellfire missiles. I will
not hesitate to use them.

712
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,460
Are we clear?
Yes, ma'am.

713
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,595
Now, put Mr. Bauer on the phone.

714
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,401
Uncuff him.

715
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,937
Sir?
I said, "Uncuff him."

716
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,476
(handcuffs unlocking)

717
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:26,544
(panting)

718
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,684
You're ordered
to stand down and evacuate.

719
00:38:32,752 --> 00:38:34,886
We're rolling up
and evacuating.

720
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:36,888
Let's get in the van.

721
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:39,557
Let's move. Now.

722
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,694
The President wants
to talk to you.

723
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:58,710
TAYLOR (over phone):
Jack?

724
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:00,545
You should've
let them kill me...

725
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:05,550
...'cause I'm not going
to quit until this is over.

726
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:07,252
It is over.

727
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:12,057
I withdrew 15 minutes ago from
the signing of the peace treaty.

728
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:15,927
Within the hour,
I will tell the world

729
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:17,729
what happened today.

730
00:39:17,797 --> 00:39:20,231
I will tender
my resignation

731
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:23,068
and remand myself
to the attorney general...

732
00:39:23,135 --> 00:39:25,537
and face the consequences
of my actions.

733
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:29,841
Unfortunately, you will
have to do the same.

734
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:35,213
I wanted this peace
so badly, Jack.

735
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:37,882
And for that, I have betrayed

736
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,652
every principle
that I have ever stood for.

737
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:44,689
And I betrayed you.

738
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:48,526
If I had listened to you,

739
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,261
none of this
would have happened.

740
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:55,266
We've both made mistakes we're
going to have to live with.

741
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:58,336
I would give anything
to take back the time.

742
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:01,806
But all I can do is tell you

743
00:40:01,874 --> 00:40:04,175
to leave the country
while you still have a chance.

744
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:08,580
The Russians will
be coming after you.

745
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:10,381
And so will we.

746
00:40:13,486 --> 00:40:15,653
Jack, I am so sorry.

747
00:40:19,992 --> 00:40:22,794
I don't know what else to say.

748
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:42,881
âª âª

749
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:54,092
(phone ringing)

750
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,827
Jack?

751
00:40:55,895 --> 00:40:57,295
Chloe, the president just told
me what was happening.

752
00:40:57,363 --> 00:40:58,963
She said she was going
to give me a little time

753
00:40:59,031 --> 00:41:00,165
to try and get
out of the country.

754
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:02,200
I know. I was on the call.
My daughter...

755
00:41:02,268 --> 00:41:04,969
her family- they're going
to try and use her to get to me.

756
00:41:05,037 --> 00:41:06,171
I'll make sure
they're protected.

757
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:08,840
No. Chloe, you've got
to promise me.

758
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:10,341
You've got to promise me
you'll keep them safe.

759
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:12,343
I'll make sure they're
protected. I promise.

760
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:15,013
How much time
do you think I've got?

761
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,648
I don't know.

762
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:18,583
I'll get you as much time
as I can.

763
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:21,452
Chloe...

764
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:24,923
What?

765
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:31,429
When you first came to CTU...

766
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,803
I never thought
it was going to be you

767
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,873
that was going to cover
my back all those years.

768
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:44,209
And I know that everything
that you did today

769
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:46,778
was to try and protect
me. I know that.

770
00:41:52,918 --> 00:41:54,085
Thank you.

771
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:00,925
Good luck, Jack.

772
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,395
Yeah...

773
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:22,313
Bring the drone
back to the base.

774
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:24,315
Whatever happened here
didn't happen.

775
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,384
Understand?

776
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,373
Shut it down.

777
00:42:52,377 --> 00:42:55,366
