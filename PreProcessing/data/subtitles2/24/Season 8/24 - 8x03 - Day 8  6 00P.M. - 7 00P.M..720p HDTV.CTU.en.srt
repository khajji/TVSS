1
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:18,490
Tell me what you know.

2
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:21,126
The hitter has someone on the inside.

3
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:23,262
Victor Aruz told me right before he died

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,830
that the assassin's working
with someone very close

5
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:26,065
to President Hassan.

6
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:28,067
Someone hacked into the U.N. database.

7
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:29,301
They downloaded the security protocols,

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,003
the schematics to the U.N.

9
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,472
and Hassan's personal itinerary.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,807
<i>Did you get a name?</i>

11
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:36,575
The computer's owner is listed as

12
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:38,644
Meredith Michelle Reed.
She's a reporter.

13
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:40,475
Applied for security
clearance at the U.N.

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,648
We got a match.

15
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:42,991
Everybody move back!

16
00:00:43,026 --> 00:00:44,283
Move back!

17
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:45,484
Mr. President.

18
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:49,488
I can't believe she's part of this.

19
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:51,390
<i>If this affair becomes public,</i>

20
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:53,191
it will destroy your credibility

21
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,960
and everything that you've worked for.

22
00:00:55,028 --> 00:00:56,461
I just spoke to my brother.

23
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,963
I told him to deny the affair.

24
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,632
The reporter's claims
need to be discredited.

25
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,836
CTU needs to continue to think
she's my contact on the inside.

26
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:06,572
We might have the wrong person.

27
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:09,107
We've been scanning through
the traffic cam footage

28
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:10,742
from outside Meredith
Reed's apartment building.

29
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,778
This man was going into
the service entrance.

30
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:14,179
What if he went through her apartment

31
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:16,715
and used her laptop to
break into the servers?

32
00:01:16,783 --> 00:01:18,584
He hailed a cab when he left.

33
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,619
See the medallion?
Phone the cab company.

34
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:21,920
Find out where it went.

35
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:28,760
Hands in the air now! Against the wall!

36
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:31,096
<i>Chloe tracked the man in the
surveillance photo</i>

37
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:32,798
to a second location.

38
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:34,533
We didn't think you'd follow
through with an investigation.

39
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:35,601
So you had no choice

40
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,069
except to steal weapons from the armory.

41
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:39,304
Would you follow through with
an investigation if I'd asked?

42
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:40,539
I'm not debating this anymore.

43
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:41,740
You want to waste your time

44
00:01:41,808 --> 00:01:43,742
chasing ghosts, knock yourself out.

45
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,777
Hello?

46
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:48,380
"Dana Walsh." I like that.

47
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:50,115
I told you to stop calling me.

48
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,217
<i>Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny.</i>

49
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:55,087
You must be mistaking
me for someone else.

50
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:57,189
That's funny 'cause you
sound a lot like this girl

51
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:59,458
I used to know from Rock
Springs named Jenny Scott.

52
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:02,394
Hey, Mike, what's going on?

53
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:03,929
Mind if I come in?

54
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:06,131
Oh, Mikey.

55
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,734
Call Captain Ravello.

56
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:11,637
Tell him you're sick,
and I'm filling in for you.

57
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:13,538
Now listen, you son of a bitch,
there's no way...

58
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:15,874
What's the matter with you?!

59
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:18,577
Next time I won't miss the bone.

60
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,181
Make... the call.

61
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:31,957
This is Hastings.

62
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,291
<i>Tell me you've gotten something out of</i>

63
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:34,926
<i>- that reporter you arrested.
- No, sir.</i>

64
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,061
<i>I'm continuing to press her,</i>

65
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,262
<i>but she's maintaining her innocence.</i>

66
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,097
She's a co-conspirator
in an assassination plot.

67
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:40,465
Of course she's gonna deny it.

68
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:41,733
Listen, I need to be able

69
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:43,101
to tell the president
we're making progress

70
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,436
toward averting this threat.

71
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:45,771
Sir, right now our only course is

72
00:02:45,838 --> 00:02:48,106
to go after Meredith Reed with
the evidence we have in hand.

73
00:02:48,174 --> 00:02:49,741
Our top analyst is decrypting a file

74
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:51,076
we obtained from her laptop.

75
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:53,211
We're hoping it
provides the intel we need

76
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,579
about the assassin she's working with.

77
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,148
Well, it'd better provide something

78
00:02:56,215 --> 00:02:58,483
because if your people fail,
and President Hassan is killed,

79
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,152
this peace process dies with him.

80
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,920
Do you understand me?

81
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:03,255
I understand your concern, Mr. Weiss,

82
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:05,924
but I assure you we're
on top of the situation.

83
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:07,959
I've dispatched tactical personnel

84
00:03:08,027 --> 00:03:10,228
to liaise with U.N. security forces

85
00:03:10,296 --> 00:03:12,497
and stepped up the alert
with NYPD at the perimeter.

86
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:14,633
Fine. I'll have that
to tell her at least.

87
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,768
Let me know when that file is decrypted.

88
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:31,883
Dana, you got a minute?

89
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:33,885
I thought you were on
your way to the U.N.

90
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:36,188
I am. What's the status
on that file decryption?

91
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:37,522
We I.D.'d the cipher.

92
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,191
It's a standard Issacs-Adler algorithm.

93
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:41,026
Requires a 12-character decryption key

94
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:43,028
to unlock the data.

95
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:46,031
The search cycle has identified
two characters already.

96
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:48,366
Should have the rest in
about 30 or 40 minutes.

97
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:49,701
Why do you ask?

98
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,804
Jack Bauer just caused a
big scene with Hastings.

99
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:56,341
He thinks Meredith Reed
may have been framed.

100
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,678
He must have gotten that from Chloe.

101
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:00,946
I thought that she'd dropped it.

102
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:02,047
Apparently not.

103
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,482
She has surveillance of someone exiting

104
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,016
Reed's apartment building.

105
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:06,184
Jack thinks this same person

106
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:07,552
may have planted the encrypted file

107
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,920
- on Reed's computer.
- You believe that?

108
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:11,056
I'm not sure.

109
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:12,557
If that evidence was planted,

110
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:15,193
the file you're decrypting
is irrelevant at best;

111
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:16,695
at worst a misdirection.

112
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:20,832
Cole, I traced the U.N.
breach to Reed myself.

113
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,334
The biometric scans of her interrogation

114
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,002
all indicate that she's withholding.

115
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,071
I just don't see a frame here.

116
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:27,272
I hope you're right

117
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,407
because Jack's going after
this guy on his own.

118
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,376
Hastings sanctioned that?

119
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:33,111
Not exactly.

120
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,380
Agent Ortiz? We need to move out, sir.

121
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:36,848
Be careful.

122
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,283
Don't worry.

123
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:50,195
<i>Okay, I'm at the corner of
Broadway and West 23rd</i>

124
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,264
in Queens. Any location on the suspect?

125
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,899
Negative. I talked to
the cab driver directly.

126
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:56,635
All he remembers is dropping
the fare at the corner.

127
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:58,270
Nothing shows up in the aerial archives.

128
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:00,005
Chloe, I need something to go on.

129
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:01,139
I know. I've been searching

130
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:02,541
for private security
cameras in the area.

131
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,376
Not all of them are registered.

132
00:05:04,443 --> 00:05:06,778
Without the serial numbers,
I don't have access to them.

133
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:08,914
Okay, I'm gonna get out
and look around on foot.

134
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,682
Maybe we'll get lucky. Stay on the line.

135
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:16,188
It's all right, Mags.

136
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:18,557
It's gonna be okay, right?

137
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:21,326
Keep your hand on the
table where I can see it.

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,067
Who the hell are you?
You're not a cop.

139
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,710
How did you manage
to fool everybody, Mikey,

140
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,779
or whatever the hell your name is?

141
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:45,417
Talk to me,

142
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:47,352
you son of a bitch!

143
00:05:57,163 --> 00:05:58,496
Shh-shh-shh.

144
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:04,569
Look,

145
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:08,440
I don't want to hurt
you, Jim, or Maggie.

146
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:11,810
I am just doing my job.

147
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:24,923
This is the captain calling back.

148
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:28,827
Just say what I told you to say.

149
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:30,428
Please don't make me do

150
00:06:30,496 --> 00:06:32,631
anything I don't want to do.

151
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:34,432
Okay?

152
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,335
Yeah.

153
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:41,740
Hello.

154
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,141
Koernig, Captain Ravello. What's up?

155
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,443
Uh, yeah, Captain,

156
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:48,346
sorry to drop this on you last-minute.

157
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,181
I just came down with some kind of bug.

158
00:06:50,249 --> 00:06:51,316
I got to take a sick leave.

159
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:52,417
You could have told me earlier, Jim.

160
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,752
You're due at the U.N. in 20.

161
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,553
Yeah, I know. It's okay.

162
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:58,423
I asked Mike Farmer to
cover my shift for me.

163
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,091
Farmer's already on in the morning.

164
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,927
He said he doesn't
mind working a double.

165
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:03,561
I guess he could use
the time-and-a-half.

166
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,964
Anyway, I already told
him he could use the bike

167
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,499
that I pulled from the motor pool.

168
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:08,967
All right, Sergeant.

169
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:11,136
I'll take care of the paperwork.
Look, you tell Mike

170
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:13,305
to get his butt to Midtown.
You got that?

171
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:15,206
<i>Get better, will ya?</i>

172
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,145
Yeah.

173
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:27,085
You did well.

174
00:07:27,153 --> 00:07:29,421
I did what you wanted me to do,

175
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:31,423
all right, so...

176
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,124
Do what you got to do

177
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:35,393
and leave us alone.

178
00:07:40,933 --> 00:07:44,302
We're not gonna make
any trouble for you.

179
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,712
You still there?

180
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,879
<i>Jack, go ahead.</i>

181
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:56,548
Hold on. Hold on.

182
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:59,384
Okay, I got two security
cameras overlooking

183
00:07:59,452 --> 00:08:01,486
the park, one pointing
straight at the corner.

184
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:03,421
I'm gonna get you the serial numbers.

185
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,126
Hey, man, what you doing?

186
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:11,129
Chloe, I got to get back to you.

187
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:12,897
What's up? You lost, man?

188
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:13,999
Actually, I am.

189
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,234
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

190
00:08:16,302 --> 00:08:18,303
Well, unless you a cop,
I suggest look somewhere else,

191
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:19,471
'cause this is our court.

192
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:21,072
We don't like strangers on it.

193
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,508
I ain't a cop, and I'm not
looking for a problem.

194
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:24,943
My friend was let off on that corner

195
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,244
by a cab 20, 25 minutes ago.

196
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:29,881
I guess you didn't hear
what I'm saying, did you?

197
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:36,654
I've got a hundred bucks;

198
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,923
anybody can tell me if
they've seen this guy.

199
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:42,093
Anybody?

200
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:45,430
I seen him.

201
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:47,565
Yo, shut up, Jay!

202
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,200
What was he wearing?

203
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:51,069
Green coat, black shirt.

204
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:52,504
Where'd he go?

205
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,672
That light blue house over
there across the street.

206
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,908
I seen him go up the steps to the stoop.

207
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:59,110
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

208
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:09,087
Yo, man, what you doing, Jay?!

209
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,655
You don't even know what's going down.

210
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:13,191
Man, I don't know about you,
but I got a hundred dollars.

211
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:14,492
It's your play. Let's go.

212
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,161
Man, I'm about to take
that hundred dollars.

213
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:17,295
Give me the ball, man.

214
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:50,755
<i>All right.</i>

215
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,531
<i>Jim!</i>

216
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,035
Hello. Jack?

217
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:07,071
<i>Got a call from one of your neighbors.</i>

218
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:09,207
Jim?

219
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,409
Hello, Jack?

220
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:14,179
Jack, what's happening?

221
00:11:14,246 --> 00:11:15,480
Are you there...?

222
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:21,719
Put the weapon down now. Do it.

223
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:24,055
My name is Jack Bauer.

224
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:25,390
I'm working on behalf of CTU.

225
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:26,791
I'm investigating a threat
to the peace conference

226
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:29,218
at the U.N. If that's true,
drop your weapon.

227
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,128
I can't.

228
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:32,096
The man I'm pursuing killed
two people in this house.

229
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:33,631
If I lower this weapon,
I'll be sidelined.

230
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:34,632
That can't happen.

231
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,438
What are you doing? He's down.

232
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,506
Son of a bitch is a cop killer.

233
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:45,376
John, stop! We got to call this in.

234
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:46,611
Not yet we don't.

235
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,949
Help me get him in.

236
00:11:53,018 --> 00:11:55,052
Come on! Help me get him in!

237
00:12:11,262 --> 00:12:12,662
So where are we?

238
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,298
As of right now, we've got
half the decryption key.

239
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,466
That's all?

240
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,034
Can't we accelerate the program?

241
00:12:18,102 --> 00:12:20,670
It's already running at capacity, sir.

242
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:22,572
- Mr. Hastings.
- Sir, we just found this

243
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,040
among Meredith Reed's personal effects.

244
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,275
It's a dedicated key card,

245
00:12:25,343 --> 00:12:27,077
United Nations issue.

246
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:28,111
Issued to who?

247
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:29,312
President Hassan and his family.

248
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,082
It accesses their private residence.

249
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,350
We got her.

250
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,153
Dana Walsh.

251
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:38,555
Ms. Walsh, this is security

252
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:41,057
at Perimeter Gate 9. You have a visitor.

253
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,058
A visitor?

254
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,127
A Mr. Kevin Wade.

255
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:46,396
Says he's a friend of yours.

256
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,640
Ms. Walsh?

257
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:01,011
Tell him I'll be right there.

258
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,794
So this, uh... this CTU...

259
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:52,696
some kind of government deal, huh?

260
00:13:52,763 --> 00:13:54,597
Law enforcement?

261
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:55,999
Ms. Walsh is on her way.

262
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,668
Thanks.

263
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:11,548
Hey, Dana.

264
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:14,451
Look at you, all pressed and pretty.

265
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:20,657
I think I like you as a blonde.

266
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:21,758
What are you doing here?

267
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,593
I thought I told you to leave me alone.

268
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:25,362
And I told you not to
hang up on me, Jenny.

269
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,130
Don't.

270
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,698
Don't call me that.

271
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,735
Oh, you... you... you
want me to play along?

272
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,236
Okay, I'll play along.

273
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,171
But I'm not going to let you pretend

274
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,207
that you don't know me.

275
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:38,575
Fine.

276
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,912
You found me, so now what?

277
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,616
You think we're just going
to pick up where we left off?

278
00:14:46,684 --> 00:14:48,918
Why not?

279
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:50,520
We had a good thing going.

280
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:51,688
No.

281
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:52,989
No, we didn't.

282
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:55,658
I was naive, and I let
myself be taken in by you.

283
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:56,893
I am not that person

284
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:58,828
- anymore.
- Yeah?

285
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:05,101
CTU.

286
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,003
Senior Data Analyst.

287
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,973
Well, sounds like an important job.

288
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,109
I'm thinking you
always were the smart one.

289
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:16,379
How the hell did you pull this off?

290
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:19,115
What, you steal a dead girl's
birth certificate or something?

291
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,418
Look, I have money.

292
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,154
Not a lot, but some.

293
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,855
If that's what it'll take.

294
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:31,461
If you really still care about me,

295
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,197
you'll leave me alone.

296
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,302
Say my name.

297
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,538
What?

298
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,376
If you're gonna beg,

299
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,244
I want to hear you say my name.

300
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,814
Just like you used to.

301
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,587
Kevin.

302
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,456
Say, "Please, Kevin."

303
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,964
Please... Kevin.

304
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,165
There's my bad girl.

305
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,000
Damn it! What do you want from me?!

306
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,536
A place to crash for starters.

307
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,939
- I'm getting a little tired of living out of the van.
- No, that is not gonna happen.

308
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:20,343
Yeah? Well, now you don't want me...

309
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,078
to tell everyone you work with

310
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:24,180
your little secret now, do you?

311
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,649
You see, I don't want to do that.

312
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,252
Come on.

313
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,221
It'll be fun having me around.

314
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,656
It'll be just like old times.

315
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:36,693
You'll come home...

316
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,530
...and we'll catch up.

317
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,301
Fine, fine.

318
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,476
You can stay the night.

319
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,512
I want you out tomorrow.

320
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:04,487
Whatever you say.

321
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:07,123
Do you want my address?

322
00:17:08,893 --> 00:17:10,493
I already got it.

323
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:29,012
I'm going to ask you again, Ms. Reed,

324
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,282
and this time I want an answer.

325
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:35,652
Now we know that this key card
was issued to President Hassan

326
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,820
and his family at the U.N.

327
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:39,155
I want to know

328
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,857
where you got it.

329
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:43,092
I'm not saying another word
until my attorney gets here.

330
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,762
You're already looking
at a life sentence

331
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,197
in a federal penitentiary.

332
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,364
So if this plot succeeds

333
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:49,465
and Hassan dies,

334
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:52,702
I promise you the death penalty.

335
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,938
If you give me the name of the assassin,

336
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:57,340
maybe we can cut a deal.

337
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:00,944
- I told you I don't know anything.
- You know who you stole

338
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:02,278
his key card from.

339
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:03,947
I didn't steal it.

340
00:18:04,014 --> 00:18:05,848
Then you manufactured it,
cloned it somehow!

341
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:06,849
No.

342
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:07,951
And used it to gain access

343
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:09,953
- to the U.N. security data.
- I, I...

344
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,321
Where did you get it?! Tell me!

345
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:12,922
He gave it to me.

346
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,524
Who?

347
00:18:16,193 --> 00:18:17,393
Who?!

348
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,528
Omar.

349
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,434
Omar gave it to me.

350
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:26,336
President Hassan?

351
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:28,638
Why would he do that?

352
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,543
So I could have access
to his private residence

353
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:37,113
when he wanted to be alone with me.

354
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:38,448
You really expect me to believe

355
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,782
that you're involved with him?

356
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,852
Believe what you want. It's the truth.

357
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:47,090
This is Hastings.

358
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:48,625
Put me through to Rob Weiss

359
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:49,859
at the U.N.

360
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,194
What are you doing?

361
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,263
I need to speak with President Taylor

362
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,365
to get permission to
talk with Omar Hassan.

363
00:18:55,432 --> 00:18:59,168
Now if there's something you
want to say to me, Ms. Reed,

364
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:01,137
now is the time to say it.

365
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,639
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Hastings.</i>

366
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,374
<i>Mr. Weiss is in a closed session,</i>

367
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,409
<i>but they're expecting to break shortly.</i>

368
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,977
All right, just relay the message

369
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:10,380
<i>to have him call me
back as soon as he can.</i>

370
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:12,649
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:15,218
Looks like you have a bit more time

372
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:18,221
<i>to reconsider your story.</i>

373
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,757
You let me know when
you're ready to change it.

374
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:34,537
Mr. Hastings, I need your help.

375
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:36,339
I've lost contact with Jack.

376
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,007
He called me 15 minutes ago.
We got cut off.

377
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,342
I haven't been able to reach him since.

378
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,211
This is your operation,
Chloe... yours and Bauer's.

379
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,247
I don't see why this
should be my concern.

380
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,115
He could be in some kind of trouble.

381
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:47,517
You need to send for backup.

382
00:19:47,584 --> 00:19:49,686
Even if I wanted to,
we don't have the manpower.

383
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,721
I dispatched all field
personnel to the U.N.

384
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,789
for Hassan's protection.

385
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,123
I watched the interrogation.

386
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:55,725
I heard what Reed said about
her affair with Hassan.

387
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:57,560
If that's true, it supports
our idea that she was framed.

388
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:58,895
And how do you figure that?

389
00:19:58,962 --> 00:20:00,063
Because it explains why

390
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,864
the biometrics registered her deception,

391
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,599
and why the real insider

392
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,035
within Hassan's camp chose her
to divert our investigation.

393
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:08,071
Reed is lying.

394
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:09,238
There is no affair.

395
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:10,406
But what if there is?

396
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,743
If President Hassan
corroborates Reed's claim,

397
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:15,712
will you consider sending
units to find Jack?

398
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:17,513
All right, fine.

399
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:19,982
<i>Just so you can hear for yourself,</i>

400
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,584
<i>I'll have someone alert you</i>

401
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:23,486
when Hassan calls me back.
Is that good enough?

402
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:26,789
No, but it's better than nothing.

403
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,600
That couple you murdered upstairs

404
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,402
were friends of mine, dirtbag.

405
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,970
Good people.

406
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:43,973
- Mazoni, you can't do this.
- No, what I can't do

407
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,442
is watch another creep like
this walk on a technicality,

408
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,544
or because some lawyer
didn't file the right papers

409
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:49,746
to the right clerk.

410
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:53,649
- John!
- I've seen it happen more times than I can count.

411
00:20:53,717 --> 00:20:55,752
You're new here, Phil. You don't know.

412
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,420
Wait till you spend
15 years of your life

413
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:58,755
grinding your teeth in this job.

414
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,623
You talk to me then.

415
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:02,692
What about that thing he said?

416
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,128
- About him working with CTU?
- Did we find credentials on him?

417
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:09,132
- No.
- That's because he is a lying piece of garbage.

418
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,235
This was a home invasion robbery.

419
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:13,536
Where nothing was taken.

420
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:16,205
Because we showed up!

421
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:18,141
Look, you got a problem with
what I'm doing here, Phil?

422
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,444
Then go upstairs and
wait till I'm finished.

423
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,346
Go. Now!

424
00:21:25,816 --> 00:21:28,351
And remember, you don't call this in

425
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:29,752
until I say so.

426
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,953
You stick to the story.

427
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:32,355
He was resisting arrest.

428
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,556
You got that?

429
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:38,661
You got that?

430
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:43,366
Just, uh... don't kill him.

431
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:44,700
I'll do my best.

432
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,505
Hey, Farmer, what are you doing here?

433
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:51,340
Koernig called in sick.

434
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:52,508
Stomach thing.

435
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:53,876
No kidding?

436
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:55,978
I talked to him this morning.
He was feeling fine.

437
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,980
Probably a few too many at lunch.

438
00:21:58,048 --> 00:21:59,882
<i>...continue to receive
real-time updates at the U.N.</i>

439
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,984
CTU is confirming the link

440
00:22:02,052 --> 00:22:03,519
between the Stinger missile attack

441
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:06,322
and the assassination plot
against President Hassan.

442
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,192
In response, we're gonna push
the traffic perimeter out

443
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,294
another six blocks and
close the Queensboro Bridge

444
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:13,863
<i>in both directions until noon tomorrow.</i>

445
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:15,865
Now, roadblock assignments
are on pages two and three

446
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:17,366
of your briefing packets.

447
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:19,368
Go ahead and double-check those now.

448
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:23,906
CTU has also arrested an
individual inside the U.N.

449
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,842
who we believe is a part of the plot.

450
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,844
Hopefully, this will yield
some information

451
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,645
about the assassin himself.

452
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:33,015
Until then, we have to assume
that he could strike at any time

453
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:35,351
and will stop at nothing
to achieve his objective.

454
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:38,354
He's already killed five
people that we know of,

455
00:22:38,422 --> 00:22:41,257
including two CTU agents.

456
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,693
Whoever he is, he's a professional,

457
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,196
which means everyone is to be
on high alert at all times.

458
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:51,067
History is happening upstairs, people,

459
00:22:51,134 --> 00:22:53,069
and it's on our watch.

460
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,878
Our position remains unchanged,
Madam President.

461
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:12,020
We will not allow NATO
to transit supplies

462
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:13,588
to Afghanistan through our territory.

463
00:23:13,656 --> 00:23:15,924
What about non-military supplies?

464
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:19,928
It is our belief that
any NATO deployment

465
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:22,096
in the region, military or otherwise,

466
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:26,301
will lead to more extremism, not less.

467
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:32,774
Mr. President...

468
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,843
uh, my director

469
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,377
of Counterterrorism here in New York

470
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:38,246
is requesting to speak
to you on the phone.

471
00:23:38,314 --> 00:23:40,215
Now?

472
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,217
It's an urgent matter.

473
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:44,252
It's relating to the reporter
who was arrested earlier.

474
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,422
Mr. Weiss will escort you
to the conference room.

475
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:51,226
That is, unless you have any objections.

476
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,595
No, not at all.

477
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:55,763
This way, Mr. President.

478
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,641
Do I have to remind
you of our conversation?

479
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,077
Omar, you must deny your
involvement with this woman.

480
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:11,746
She has a name, Farhad.

481
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:14,282
And I still can't believe that
she can be part of this plan.

482
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,284
That should not be your
chief concern right now.

483
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:18,953
If word of this affair gets out,
not only is your

484
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:23,491
political career over,
but so is the peace process itself.

485
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,727
You know what you have to do.

486
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:35,370
- Thank you.
- Mr. President.

487
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:41,910
Hello?

488
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:44,245
Mr. President,
this is Brian Hastings at CTU.

489
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:47,015
I appreciate you getting back to me.

490
00:24:47,082 --> 00:24:49,183
What can I do for you, Mr. Hastings?

491
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:50,418
Well, sir, I have a matter

492
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:52,754
of some delicacy to discuss with you.

493
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,322
- Go on.
- Thank you, sir.

494
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,957
I know that your time is valuable,

495
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:57,458
so, I'll come right to the point.

496
00:24:57,526 --> 00:25:00,495
I understand Meredith Reed
is writing an article on you

497
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:01,896
<i>for the Sunday Magazine.</i>

498
00:25:01,964 --> 00:25:03,264
Yes, that's correct.

499
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:06,000
Do you know of any reason
she would be in possession

500
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:08,736
of a key card to your
residence at the U.N.?

501
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,004
Key card?

502
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:11,673
Yes, sir.

503
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,775
She claims that she got it from you.

504
00:25:13,842 --> 00:25:16,244
And that your
relationship with her is...

505
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:19,213
perhaps more than professional.

506
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:26,187
Mr. President?

507
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:31,092
Is there anyone listening to
our conversation, Mr. Hastings?

508
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,393
<i>Are we being recorded?</i>

509
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:33,728
No, sir.

510
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:36,164
I'm speaking to you on a secure line.

511
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:38,800
Then I will tell you what Ms.
Reed said is true.

512
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:40,201
Omar!

513
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,436
What are you doing?!

514
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:42,971
Sir, are you confirming

515
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,506
a romantic involvement
with Meredith Reed?

516
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:47,842
Mr. Hastings, I trust
your complete discretion

517
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,179
in this matter.

518
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:53,114
And I'm sure you
understand the ramification

519
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:54,816
if what I'm telling you

520
00:25:54,883 --> 00:25:56,150
becomes public knowledge.

521
00:25:56,218 --> 00:25:57,619
Yes, sir, I understand.

522
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,487
I gave Ms. Reed this key card

523
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:01,923
for reasons I'm sure are clear to you.

524
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:04,192
I'm telling you all this
in the interests of justice

525
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:05,526
because I'm convinced

526
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:08,363
that Ms. Reed is not
part of this conspiracy.

527
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,331
Excuse me for asking, sir,

528
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:12,367
but are you basing that
certainty on anything

529
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:13,968
other than your personal feelings?

530
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:17,071
No, I suppose not.

531
00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:20,341
I see.

532
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:22,010
Well, thank you for your candor,
Mr. President.

533
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:24,412
I assure you that nothing we discussed

534
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,481
will be disclosed from this office.

535
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:27,949
I appreciate that, Mr. Hastings.

536
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,484
Good-bye, then.

537
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:30,852
<i>Good-bye.</i>

538
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,221
Have you any idea what you've done?

539
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,523
The honorable thing.

540
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:45,299
You said you'd send
backup to Jack's location.

541
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,502
I said I'd consider it, and I have.

542
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,504
Confirmation of the affair does
not prove Reed's innocence.

543
00:26:49,571 --> 00:26:51,973
For all we know, it's a
ploy she used to gain access

544
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:55,176
to the U.N. security files,
Hassan's itinerary.

545
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:56,611
In the meantime, Jack's still missing.

546
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,845
He's not missing.

547
00:26:57,913 --> 00:26:59,280
You lost contact.

548
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:01,349
His phone battery may have died.

549
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,318
Or more likely, he's in an
area with bad cell reception.

550
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:06,554
There's pockets of them all
over the five boroughs,

551
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:09,190
which you would have known
if you were from around here.

552
00:27:09,258 --> 00:27:11,392
Fine, if you're not sending someone,
I'll go myself.

553
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,261
No, you won't!

554
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:14,662
Your concern for your friend

555
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,863
is admirable,

556
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,498
but that file we got
off Reed's laptop...

557
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:19,867
it's almost decrypted,
and depending what we find,

558
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:21,436
I'm going to need you here.

559
00:27:21,503 --> 00:27:23,538
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

560
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:26,107
Now, earlier today,
you suggested that I speak to you

561
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:28,676
more clearly and directly.

562
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:31,045
You leave the building, you're fired.

563
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:34,315
Is that clear and direct enough for you?

564
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,036
Hello?

565
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:56,270
We have a problem.

566
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:57,572
My brother confessed to the affair.

567
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,874
I don't know if the
frame's going to hold.

568
00:27:59,942 --> 00:28:03,244
That's unfortunate.

569
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:04,679
Don't you understand?!

570
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:06,114
CTU won't believe the file you uploaded

571
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:07,448
to Reed's computer is genuine.

572
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:09,784
<i>I agree it isn't ideal,</i>

573
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:13,621
but they will still have to act
on what they find in any event.

574
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:17,058
There's no reason to
diverge from the plan.

575
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:20,294
But you need to remain
calm and play your part.

576
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:21,629
How much longer?

577
00:28:21,697 --> 00:28:24,632
I promise you.

578
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,403
<i>Your brother will be dead
before the hour is out.</i>

579
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,966
Don't move!

580
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,576
Drop that! Now!

581
00:29:18,644 --> 00:29:21,246
Officer, everything I
told you before is true.

582
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:22,747
My name is Jack Bauer.

583
00:29:22,815 --> 00:29:24,300
- I'm a former federal agent.
- He's lying, Phil!

584
00:29:24,317 --> 00:29:25,517
Shoot the son of a bitch!

585
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:26,919
He broke my damn rib!

586
00:29:26,987 --> 00:29:28,687
Contact Chloe O'Brian at CTU.

587
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,389
She'll verify my identity and the
threat to the peace conference.

588
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:31,390
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him already!

589
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,025
Sit back down, John.

590
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:34,526
You want to be pointing that gun

591
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:37,062
- someplace else.
- I said don't move, either of you!

592
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,497
What the hell? I'm your partner!

593
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:39,832
No, this has gone far enough.

594
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,033
I'm calling it in.

595
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:42,368
You don't want to do that.

596
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:43,569
Come on, Phil. Put the phone down.

597
00:29:43,637 --> 00:29:44,870
Let's talk about this.

598
00:29:44,938 --> 00:29:47,840
Shut up!

599
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:49,608
This is Patrolman Phillip Lu.

600
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:52,111
I need to talk to Lieutenant Sell.

601
00:29:52,178 --> 00:29:53,912
The officer upstairs has to be

602
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,582
- connected to the assassination plot.
- Oh, you happy now?!

603
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,716
- You hearing what he's saying about Koernig?
- All I'm saying is

604
00:29:57,784 --> 00:29:59,051
that there's a connection.

605
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,219
We need to find out what it is.

606
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:01,887
Both of you, shut the hell up!

607
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:04,056
Lieutenant, sir.

608
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:06,325
I'm at the scene of a double homicide.

609
00:30:06,393 --> 00:30:07,893
One of the victims is a cop,

610
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:11,063
a James Koernig out of Midtown Center.

611
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:12,631
No, it's definitely murder.

612
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,299
Him and his wife.

613
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:16,301
We got a suspect in custody.

614
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:19,204
11447 Broadway. Cross street is Astoria.

615
00:30:19,272 --> 00:30:22,875
Ask him what Officer Koernig's
assignment was today.

616
00:30:22,942 --> 00:30:25,911
Please, innocent lives are at stake.

617
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:28,247
What have you got to lose?

618
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:30,683
And, sir?

619
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,318
I need a lookup on
Koernig's duty assignment.

620
00:30:33,386 --> 00:30:37,022
Yeah, transfer me over.

621
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:47,466
- You screwed up.
- What?

622
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:48,934
Yeah, surprised me, too.

623
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:50,569
You forgot to upload a
Rijndael filter to my system.

624
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:53,138
Without it, I can't break
the last encryption layer

625
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:54,973
on the file remnant you gave me.

626
00:30:55,008 --> 00:30:56,575
I'm sorry. I will upload
it to a disk for you now.

627
00:30:56,643 --> 00:30:58,410
Or I can just do it at your station.

628
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:00,979
Okay, fine.

629
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:07,386
Everything okay?

630
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:08,821
What do you mean? I don't know.

631
00:31:08,888 --> 00:31:10,989
It's not like you to make mistakes.

632
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:12,891
You seem a little distracted.

633
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,393
Wedding jitters, maybe?

634
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:15,627
No.

635
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:18,163
Just asking.

636
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,898
And Cole's a nice enough guy.

637
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:22,301
But I could see how you could
start having second thoughts.

638
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,636
I've always been curious
to know what you two

639
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:27,072
- find to talk about.
- Drop this, Arlo. I am not in the mood.

640
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,841
Hey, I don't mean anything by it.

641
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:30,342
All I'm saying is that
you and the boy scout

642
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,145
aren't exactly intellectual equals.

643
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:35,280
Or is that what makes him your type?

644
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,450
See now, you and me, for instance,

645
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:39,752
we have a lot in common.

646
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,321
We speak the same language.

647
00:31:42,388 --> 00:31:44,590
Mostly techno-jargon granted,
but hey, it can always lead

648
00:31:44,657 --> 00:31:46,158
- to something much deeper.
- Damn it, Arlo!

649
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:51,396
That's it.

650
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:53,465
We've got it.

651
00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:59,738
Whoa. Is that what I think it is?

652
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,740
Yes.

653
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:04,243
Finish decrypting your fragment
and put it up on the screen.

654
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,944
I've got to go tell Hastings.

655
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:07,780
<i> I don't care what he's demanding.</i>

656
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:10,315
Tell Ms. Reed's lawyer
he's going to have to wait.

657
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:12,651
We can hold his
client for up to 18 hours

658
00:32:12,719 --> 00:32:14,253
before formatly charging her.

659
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,455
- Sir?
- I have to go.

660
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:18,824
We've broken the encryption
code on Reed's file.

661
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:21,293
The primary file
component's up on screen.

662
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:24,296
Arlo's waiting for a second
piece to finish rendering.

663
00:32:24,364 --> 00:32:25,531
So, what am I looking at?

664
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,499
Construction plans for work carried out

665
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:29,535
at the United Nations eight months ago.

666
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:31,403
- The U.N.? Are you sure?
- Positive.

667
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:34,506
Two I-beams were retrofitted
to provide structural support

668
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,175
for additional interpreters' booths.

669
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:38,710
- There and there.
- That looks like

670
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:40,012
- the Council Chamber.
- It's directly below it.

671
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,815
The decryption's just about complete.

672
00:32:42,882 --> 00:32:45,818
It's loading to the main screen now.

673
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:51,557
It looks like a schematic
for an incendiary.

674
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:52,558
A bomb.

675
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,792
Pulse-detonated,

676
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,327
modified to fit between the I-beams.

677
00:32:55,395 --> 00:32:58,096
Sir, judging by the
size, that's big enough

678
00:32:58,164 --> 00:33:00,232
to drop the entire Security Council

679
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,366
into the East River.

680
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:03,168
Get me Cole and Manners at the U.N.

681
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:05,137
All stations!

682
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:06,338
We're implementing protocols

683
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:08,140
for an immediate evacuation

684
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,275
of the United Nations building!

685
00:33:10,343 --> 00:33:11,577
We are Code Red.

686
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:14,479
I repeat: this is not a drill.

687
00:33:14,547 --> 00:33:15,614
We are Code Red!

688
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:16,682
Mr. Hastings, you need to consider

689
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:18,016
the possibility that this intel is fake

690
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:19,818
and why they wanted us to find it.

691
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:21,086
I'm not taking any chances.

692
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:22,120
Sir, I've got Cole and
Manners on the line.

693
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:24,456
Gentlemen, we have intel

694
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,325
from the decrypted files

695
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:27,593
that an incendiary
device has been placed

696
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,728
directly below the Council Chamber.

697
00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:31,597
S... Sir, I don't see how that's possible.

698
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:32,598
This building's been

699
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:33,599
vetted for weeks.

700
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:34,600
U.N. security have swept the

701
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:35,601
area thoroughly and repeatedly.

702
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:36,668
Then they missed it.

703
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:37,803
Mr. Manners,

704
00:33:37,871 --> 00:33:39,037
you need to implement

705
00:33:39,105 --> 00:33:41,373
evacuation protocols immediately.

706
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:44,243
Cole, I want you on President
Hassan, personally.

707
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,310
Yes, sir.

708
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:48,513
Hey! You, you, with me! Let's go!

709
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:53,485
Ladies and gentlemen,
forgive the interruption.

710
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:54,887
Your attention, please.

711
00:33:54,954 --> 00:33:56,188
We are evacuating

712
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:59,057
immediately due to
a possible bomb threat.

713
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:00,659
Security personnel will be receiving

714
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:03,729
protocol confirmation on
designated channels momentarily.

715
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:06,298
Evacuation will proceed out these doors

716
00:34:06,366 --> 00:34:08,000
and down to underground parking level B.

717
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,636
Please, speak only with your designated handlers.
- Omar...

718
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:11,837
Everything will be fine,
Madam President.

719
00:34:11,905 --> 00:34:13,005
Madam President,

720
00:34:13,072 --> 00:34:14,539
you and Secretary Kanin
need to move now.

721
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:17,242
President Hassan, if you'll follow me.

722
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,515
Traffic control, I need route
lockdown for northern exodus.

723
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,783
All units confirm.

724
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,121
<i>Unit 2 in position.</i>

725
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:31,223
<i>Unit 3 in position.</i>

726
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,325
<i>Unit 4 in position.</i>

727
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:35,527
Unit 5 in position.

728
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,010
Where are my wife and daughter?

729
00:36:00,078 --> 00:36:01,411
They're coming down the
east stairwell now, sir.

730
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,714
<i>No more than two minutes behind you.</i>

731
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:05,182
I won't leav without them.

732
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,651
Mr. President, with all
due respect, my orders are

733
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,986
to evacuate you now.

734
00:36:09,053 --> 00:36:11,488
Omar, I'll wait and go
with them. Don't worry.

735
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:12,522
I'll make sure they're safe.

736
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,558
Tarin, get my brother out of here.

737
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:24,601
<i>All right, evac tunnel B! Move!</i>

738
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:41,018
Yes?

739
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:42,519
He's in the third car.

740
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:44,621
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now.

741
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,691
<i>Vehicles are in transit.</i>

742
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:49,693
<i>Current location: evac tunnel bravo.</i>

743
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:54,197
<i>Second Avenue teams should
have a visual in five minutes.</i>

744
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:59,169
- Uncle!
- Where's Omar?

745
00:36:59,237 --> 00:37:00,937
He went ahead. We'll take the next car.

746
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:02,973
Is it true there's a bomb?

747
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,808
It's just a precaution, Kayla.
Don't worry.

748
00:37:04,876 --> 00:37:05,976
Everything's going to be fine.

749
00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:07,611
Right this way.

750
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,979
Okay. Let's be quick.

751
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:11,048
Hurry.

752
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:15,018
The guy who took his place?

753
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,486
What was his name?

754
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:17,688
Mike Farmer.

755
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:18,755
Thanks.

756
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:25,162
Come on. Get out.

757
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:31,535
You were right.

758
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:34,271
There is a connection.

759
00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:36,540
Sergeant Koernig was on
the U.N. security detail.

760
00:37:36,607 --> 00:37:38,608
He called in sick about 45 minutes ago.

761
00:37:38,676 --> 00:37:40,410
He was forced to make that call.

762
00:37:40,478 --> 00:37:42,079
You said someone replaced him?

763
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:44,281
A patrolman named Mike
Farmer from the same unit.

764
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,549
That's your assassin.

765
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:47,718
Officer, you need to let me call CTU,

766
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:49,753
and I need to get to
the U.N. immediately.

767
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:52,989
Officer, this is going down now.

768
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:54,358
You can either stand
here and do nothing,

769
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:55,559
or you can help me stop it.

770
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:59,196
Make the call.
I'll drive you to the U.N.

771
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:00,630
Thank you.

772
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:07,771
Where the hell you think you're going?

773
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,905
He can't leave!

774
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:10,240
He's a material witness!

775
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:33,163
<i>Jack, where have you been?</i>

776
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:34,364
Chloe, please just listen to me.

777
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:35,732
The assassin killed a police officer

778
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,401
and took his place in
the U.N. security detail.

779
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:39,136
I need to alert Agent Ortiz immediately.

780
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:40,704
Okay. I'll patch you through.

781
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:42,105
He's in the middle of evacuating Hassan.

782
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:44,107
Evacuating him? Why?

783
00:38:44,175 --> 00:38:46,777
Hastings' orders.
The evidence in Reed's computer

784
00:38:46,844 --> 00:38:47,811
indicated that there's a bomb

785
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:48,912
in the building.

786
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,180
Where's Hassan now?

787
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:51,982
Hassan's motorcade is
heading up the ramps

788
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:54,084
in the parking garage,
about to pull out onto Second Avenue.

789
00:38:54,152 --> 00:38:56,420
<i>- Chloe, it's Cole.
- Hang on. I've got Cole.</i>

790
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,655
Agent Ortiz, you're on with Jack Bauer.

791
00:38:58,723 --> 00:38:59,956
What's going on, Jack?

792
00:39:00,024 --> 00:39:01,691
Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now!

793
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:02,926
What are you talking about?

794
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:04,428
The assassin is part of
the evacuation detail.

795
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:06,463
He's posing as an NYPD officer.

796
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:07,864
There is no bomb in the U.N.

797
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:09,299
They're just trying to lure
him out of the building.

798
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,734
Did you tell Hastings about this?

799
00:39:10,802 --> 00:39:12,335
We don't have time.
You need to stop the motorcade

800
00:39:12,403 --> 00:39:14,438
before it hits the street.

801
00:39:14,505 --> 00:39:16,506
It's too late. Hassan's car
just exited the tunnel.

802
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:18,675
Cole, you need to stop that
car or Hassan's a dead man.

803
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:22,479
Cole?

804
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,821
Whose vehicle is that?

805
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,824
It's Cole, sir.

806
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,259
Cole,

807
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:37,694
<i>what the hell are you doing?</i>

808
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,029
Cole!

809
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,018
Cole!

810
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:07,157
What was that?

811
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:09,125
What happened?

812
00:40:09,193 --> 00:40:11,528
Cole, can you verify? Was Hassan hit?

813
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,235
