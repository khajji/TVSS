1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,400
Previously on 24

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,370
Cole, he's dead.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,080
Just go. Nobody knows you had anything to do with this.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,030
I don't want you involved.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,260
I'm already involved.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,360
We're cleaning this up,

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,930
and no one's never gonna know what happened.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,130
They're scum, Dana,

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
and no one's gonna miss 'em.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,180
Kayla may be in danger.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,670
She's run away with Tarin.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,440
She's somewhere in the city

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,280
with no idea that a nuclear threat exists.

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,440
And, Omar, what about you?

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,770
Don't worry about me.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,440
Just help me find our daughter.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,140
Come inside.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,410
They have the rods you are looking for.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,910
I thought you had the rods.

20
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,640
They turned against me.

21
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,340
I can help you find them.

22
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,010
Just get me out of here.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,140
You find Farhad?

24
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,310
Still looking.

25
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,510
He won't get far.

26
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,740
Medic! Come on! Medic!

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,940
I need you to identify the men who stole the nuclear rods from you.

28
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,740
Can you do that for us? Yes.

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,380
Blood pressure's dropping. We got a rapid heartbeat.

30
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,040
We lost him. Farhad's dead.

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,380
Damn it!

32
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,740
Whoever shot Farhad couldn't confirm that he was killed.

33
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,440
I'm saying that we use Farhad as dead bait.

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,670
Leak it to the press

35
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,280
that we've got him in custody, and he survived,

36
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,970
and they'll have to make a move on him.

37
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,510
Tell the support teams it is imperative that

38
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,770
we take these terrorists alive.

39
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,770
Go! Go!

40
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,710
It's all right.

41
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,210
We just want to talk to you.

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,610
No. No!

43
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,770
He's still moving. Notify the perimeter.

44
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,410
It was a trap.

45
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,770
Farhad was already dead.

46
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,670
I locked myself in some kind of oxygen chamber.

47
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,770
They can't get in here.

48
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,210
You know what you must do.

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,410
I can't. They scrambled the arming code.

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
You need to set it off manually.

51
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,970
You cannot let them take you alive.

52
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,970
Can you hear me?

53
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,290
The following takes place between 2:00 A.M. and 3:00 A.M.

54
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,610
What's the status?

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,540
The hyperbaric chamber is one-inch steel all around.

56
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,120
Hermetically sealed, air and power systems are internal.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Also, its atmosphere is most likely oxygen-enriched.

58
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,550
Anything we use to blow the door

59
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,120
could ignite a fire inside.

60
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,420
How long will it take to cut in?

61
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,980
We need to use a low-speed drill to avoid sparks.

62
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,220
How long?

63
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,350
Best estimate-- 40 minutes,

64
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,520
unless you want us to push the risk.

65
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,050
I can't take the chance. We need him alive.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,580
Agent Bauer, the techs have got the internal cameras online.

67
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,750
We have eyes on him.

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,920
What about the intercom?

69
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,050
The intercom's still down

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,650
from when he shorted out the locking mechanism.

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,420
- And the bomb techs say we have a bigger problem. - What?

72
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,450
They assumed that once we jammed the signal to the detonator,

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,320
it'd be impossible for the suspect to explode the vest.

74
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,850
Turns out that may not be the case.

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,080
He's reconfiguring the circuits.

76
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,580
Yeah. The detonator's

77
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,680
German military, so our guys are familiar with it.

78
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,950
The end-around he's sketched out here will work.

79
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,080
What's the timeframe?

80
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,420
Well, it depends on how fast he works.

81
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,080
He needs to reset four circuits.

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,950
That LED light indicates he's already completed one.

83
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,120
When he wires the other three,

84
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,880
he'll be able to explode the device at will.

85
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,580
The only upside is the chamber will contain the blast.

86
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,750
No one else will be hurt.

87
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,080
He's not trying to hurt anybody.

88
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,850
He's trying to make sure we don't take him alive.

89
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,080
Get that intercom up and running.

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,880
- I need to talk to him as soon as possible. -Yes, Sir.

91
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,770
This is Bauer. Let me speak to Hastings.

92
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,360
Right away, sir

93
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,270
Mr.Hastings, Jack Bauer on the line.

94
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,050
So, what have you got, Jack?

95
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,650
It looks like our suspect might be able to get

96
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,050
the detonator working before we can get to him.

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,520
Owen will fill you in on the details.

98
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,120
Right now, I need to know everything you've got on him.

99
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,780
I'm just pulling up the information now, Jack.

100
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
It took a while to get it from Hassan's intelligence people.

101
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,280
Just give me the overview.

102
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,450
Okay, Marcos Al-Zacar was born here,

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,750
raised in East Harlem.

104
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,450
Mother's American, father was from the IRK--

105
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,620
That's where Al-Zacar got his politics from.

106
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,050
His father was a professor known to be highly critical

107
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,820
of American foreign policies,

108
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,050
suspected of connections with extremists.

109
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,020
He was imprisoned by Wayne Palmer's administration

110
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,350
for four months.

111
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,080
Although the charges were eventually dropped,

112
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,850
he was unhireable after that.

113
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,720
Almost a year later, he committed suicide.

114
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,320
That must have been what triggered Al-Zacar.

115
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,550
He started spying

116
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,080
on America for the IRK two months after that.

117
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,420
What about the mother?

118
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,050
Checking current records.

119
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,580
According to motor vehicle and utility records

120
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,720
she's still in East Harlem.

121
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,880
4211 East 117th Street.

122
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,850
Find her and get her here as soon as possible.

123
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,580
We're on it, Jack. Keep us posted.

124
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,650
Copy that.

125
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,420
We have to assume the people building this dirty bomb

126
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,750
want to hit a high-value target here in Manhattan.

127
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,050
But first, they've got to get it on the island.

128
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,050
- We should shut down the city? - No.

129
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,520
We want them to make the attempt

130
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,880
to move the radiological materials.

131
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,950
It's our best chance of catching them.

132
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,380
First, we have to make sure

133
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,020
that all of our radiation sensors are strictly monitored

134
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,350
at all crossings.

135
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,780
Arlo, that goes for the drone sensors, too.

136
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,050
Yes, sir.

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
That's all.

138
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,780
Cole?

139
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,080
We went over this.

140
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,080
All we have to do is act natural.

141
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,650
Keep our heads.

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,550
You'll be okay.

143
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,450
I am not worried about me.

144
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,750
You can't really be this calm after what just happened.

145
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,450
You've never broken a law in your life.

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,880
Cole.

147
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,320
What do you want me to say?

148
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,720
I don't know! Anything. Tell me you hate me.

149
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,980
Tell me that you'll never forgive me for lying to you.

150
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,080
We're not doing this now.

151
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,750
- I told you to walk away... - Not now!

152
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,920
We're in the middle of a radiological threat.

153
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,780
We got jobs to do.

154
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,650
When it's over, then we'll talk.

155
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,980
Look, I can't promise things are going back to the way they were.

156
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,450
But I wouldn't have done what I did if I didn't still love you.

157
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,050
You two have holy hell to answer for.

158
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,780
- Sir, I'm sorry. I can explain... - Save it.

159
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,580
If you were following up a lead,

160
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,080
you should have been updating me every 20 minutes.

161
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,520
You broke protocol.

162
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,680
The lead didn't pan out. Witness proved to be unreliable.

163
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,080
But you're right, sir, there's no excuse.

164
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,680
I should have called in.

165
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,650
And you were supposed to be servicing a faulty relay station.

166
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
Yet I see you found time to change your clothes.

167
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,820
Look. I don't know what's going on with you two

168
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,980
and, frankly, I don't care.

169
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,550
If we weren't at high alert,

170
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,650
and you weren't the best at what you do,

171
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,020
you'd both be out on your asses for this.

172
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,980
I'm going to ask you once.

173
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,580
Whatever it is, are you finished?

174
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,020
- Yes, sir.  - Good.

175
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,880
Walsh, until further notice,

176
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,680
you will answer to Chloe O'Brian.

177
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,680
She will fill you in on what she needs from you.

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,050
Bauer has a situation at St. Julian's Hospital.

179
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
I need you to assemble a team,

180
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,450
pick up an Elaine Al-Zacar from East 117th

181
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,920
and take her to him.

182
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,980
- Is she a hostile?  - Unclear.

183
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,580
Arlo will fill you in on the details.

184
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,050
- Yes, sir.  - How you perform

185
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,020
from this point will determine whether or not you salvage your careers.

186
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,080
Now, get to work.

187
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,350
Yes?

188
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
I'm in place.

189
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,050
I've managed to tap into the hospital's security cameras.

190
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,780
But we can only pick up audio in the hallway outside the room.

191
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,420
CTU has set up a command center there.

192
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,780
Can you see Marcos?

193
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,580
Yes. He's still working on the detonator.

194
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,050
Are you able to gauge his progress?

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,650
He already has one of the four circuits reconfigured.

196
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,050
We're arriving at the landing now.

197
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,650
Soon we'll be able to transport the rods into Manhattan.

198
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,480
Are CTU's radiation sensors down?

199
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,050
Not yet. But we'll be ready.

200
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,050
Call me when Marcos is dead.

201
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,460
Port Authority's reporting

202
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,090
no hits on the radiation sensors at the Holland,

203
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,830
Midtown and Lincoln Tunnels.

204
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,360
I don't see any stream updates for the GW,

205
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,860
Brooklyn or Queens crossings.

206
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,990
What the problem?

207
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,860
MTA's providing that feed

208
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,890
on a dedicated sublink to prevent a server overload.

209
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,830
You can access it yourself on the system's Ethernet port.

210
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,460
So there's really no problem.

211
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,190
There's no way I could have known that

212
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,260
since you didn't put that in your hourlies.

213
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,960
Right. I will do that next time.

214
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,360
I know this must be hard for you, having to report to me

215
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,890
since you've been demoted.

216
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,460
It's okay, Chloe, I deserved it.

217
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,230
Yeah, you did.

218
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,760
I just want you to know I'm actually glad you didn't get

219
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,090
fired or anything and...

220
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,490
Hang in there.

221
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,460
Thank you. I appreciate that.

222
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,890
Where are we on aerial detection?

223
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,330
I've got drones covering every inch of the waterfront

224
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,760
with their radiation detectors cranked up.

225
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,490
If they try to bring the fuel rods

226
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,290
into the city by boat, we'll spot them.

227
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,790
Easily.

228
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,460
Look, I know you probably hate my guts right now,

229
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,960
but I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry.

230
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,830
For telling Cole about you and that other guy.

231
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,960
I mean, you were definitely messing up,

232
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,530
and with the threat of those rods out there...

233
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,530
Don't worry about it, Arlo.

234
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,790
So is he gone?

235
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,160
Who?

236
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,460
You know.

237
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,690
The other guy.

238
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,190
Yeah.

239
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,460
Yeah, he's gone.

240
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,130
So, you and the Boy Scout are okay?

241
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,460
We'll get through it.

242
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,130
I'm glad.

243
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,390
But if for some reason

244
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,730
- that changes...  - I know.

245
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,860
Meaning, if you ever decide you want to trade up...

246
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,760
I got it.

247
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,430
Sir, we got the intercom to the chamber working.

248
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,860
You should be able to talk to the suspect.

249
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,050
Good. Tell CTU I'll keep my comm up

250
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,930
So they can monitor.

251
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Yes, sir.

252
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,460
Marcos, my name is Jack Bauer.

253
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,930
I'm working with CTU.

254
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,290
I know the original plan was

255
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,760
to smuggle the fuel rods back to the IRK to reconstitute

256
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,490
their nuclear program.

257
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,390
So I'm just guessing

258
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,490
that helping to deliver a dirty bomb to New York City

259
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,290
which will cost the lives of tens of thousands

260
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,060
of innocent people isn't exactly what you signed on for.

261
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,060
But the truth is if you do this,

262
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,730
you'll be killing the IRK.

263
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,830
By bombing New York City, you're going to force

264
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,930
President Taylor to retaliate, and she will, hard.

265
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,960
You can't possibly want that.

266
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,490
It doesn't matter what I want.

267
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,190
This so-called peace agreement,

268
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,290
it's just Hassan signing away my country's ability to defend itself,

269
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,490
its independence.

270
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:59,330
He's surrendering without a fight.

271
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,460
But there are a lot of people in his own government

272
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,290
who are not willing to do that.

273
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,990
Marcos, you can't win this fight.

274
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,460
The IRK will sustain massive casualties because of this.

275
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,930
Because of you.

276
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,690
Not because of me.

277
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,130
America will be the one dropping all the bombs.

278
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,830
No, son.

279
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,460
The eyes of the world will hold you responsible

280
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,430
for the innocent lives taken in New York City.

281
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,830
No, don't think you can take the moral high ground with me.

282
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,430
The arrogance of this country.

283
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,890
That it feels it can dictate to the rest of the world

284
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,830
who gets... who gets to have nuclear weapons,

285
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,230
while it insists on keeping my people in the Dark Ages.

286
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,230
You keep saying "Your people, your country."

287
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,490
Marcos, I read your file.

288
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,390
You were born here. You're an American citizen.

289
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,930
Your father is from the IRK.

290
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,490
You leave my father out of this!

291
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,830
What happened to your father was unfair and tragic,

292
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,890
but this is no way to honor his memory.

293
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,890
Please, you can still do the right thing here.

294
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,490
You can help me stop this from happening.

295
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,830
All you have to do is open the door.

296
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,290
Please, I'm begging you.

297
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,430
You're not going to get me to change my mind.

298
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,160
I came here prepared to die.

299
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,330
And that's what's going to happen.

300
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,730
Marcos.

301
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,390
Marcos.

302
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,160
Please, just talk to me.

303
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,730
Marcos!

304
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,890
Marcos!

305
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,860
Yes, of course. I understand.

306
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,560
We'll see you soon.

307
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,760
Thank you.

308
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,690
Your friend at the State Department--

309
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,460
you trust he can do what he says,

310
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,360
give us asylum?

311
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,060
Yes.

312
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,690
He says with what your father has been doing--

313
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,160
ordering unlawful arrest and torture--

314
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,860
U.S. Law will consider us political refugees.

315
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,560
But you have to understand,

316
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,130
asylum will not be granted overnight.

317
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,260
Well, how long are we talking about?

318
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,160
A year, maybe 18 months.

319
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,490
But as soon as we file the application,

320
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,790
we are protected by the law.

321
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,490
Your father cannot touch us.

322
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,790
You know that I will not be able to work here legally

323
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,690
until asylum has been granted.

324
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,660
I have some savings.

325
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,060
But I will not be able

326
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,730
to give you the life that you have been used to.

327
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,730
Oh, you know I don't care about any of that.

328
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,690
One minute.

329
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,530
Oh... my mother again.

330
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,730
- I really should answer it.  - Kayla.

331
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,860
No, she deserves to know I'm all right.

332
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,090
Give that back to me!

333
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,860
- Please.  - You know what? You can call her

334
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,330
when the lawyer has filed the application.

335
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,860
We must wait until then.

336
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,790
Bye-bye.

337
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,260
Kayla, it's me again.

338
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,830
Darling, I need to talk to you.

339
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,460
Your father told me something terrible

340
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,430
may be happening here in New York.

341
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,860
Please, call me back as soon as you

342
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,730
get this message.

343
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,260
I still can't reach her.

344
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,860
Thank you for coming back.

345
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,430
Our daughter is missing.

346
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,190
I'm not leaving until I know she's all right.

347
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,560
We'll find her, Dalia.

348
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,260
Nabeel told me you had Tarin arrested.

349
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,060
I didn't know who I could trust.

350
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,830
So you started arresting people from inside your own delegation?

351
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,160
What possible evidence could you have gathered so quickly?

352
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,160
- I had to do something. - But Tarin?

353
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,790
He's one of your most loyal men.

354
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,390
So was my brother.

355
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,090
Or so I thought.

356
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,390
Until he tried to have me killed and destroy my government.

357
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,090
If you continue to act the way you have been,

358
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,230
you will have done the job for him.

359
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,630
Have you told the police?

360
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,690
I've been trying to deal with it on my own.

361
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,860
But it's time to get them involved.

362
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,360
Dalia, I'm sorry.

363
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,660
As you should be!

364
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,330
This city is under attack!

365
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,490
Our daughter is god knows where!

366
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:10,490
You drove her away with your suspicion

367
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,590
and your paranoia!

368
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,660
How could you, Omar?

369
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,490
How could you have lost your way?

370
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,790
Dalia.

371
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,660
You're right.

372
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,830
I have.

373
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,630
I have. I see that now.

374
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,060
And I'll make changes.

375
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,160
I'll do everything in my power to find her.

376
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,690
And get her safe.

377
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,860
You have my word.

378
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,430
I am sorry.

379
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,760
Dalia, I'm sorry.

380
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,630
Who is it?

381
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,630
Elaine Al-Zacar?

382
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,790
What do you want?

383
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,130
My name is Cole Ortiz.

384
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,460
I'm an agent with CTU.

385
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,360
I need you to open that door, ma'am.

386
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,030
I don't understand. What's this about?

387
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,630
Your son, Marcos.

388
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,960
Marcos?

389
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,590
Ma'am, you're either going to open that door

390
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,430
or I'm gonna break it down. Now!

391
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,730
Go!

392
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,730
Put your hands in the air, now.

393
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,730
Mrs. Al-Zacar, are you aware of where your son is right now?

394
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
- Not at the moment. - How much do you know

395
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,460
about his activities on behalf of the IRK?

396
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,230
I know that he

397
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,530
communicates with family there, if that's what you mean.

398
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,130
You going somewhere?

399
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,490
I was just about to leave to my sister's house.

400
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,690
You do that a lot, take trips

401
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,390
to visit relatives at 2:30 in the morning?

402
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,560
No, I don't. I can explain.

403
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,590
Marcos called me about an hour ago.

404
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,530
He told me to leave the city.

405
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,490
He said he needed me to meet him at my sister's house in Pennsylvania.

406
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,530
- He didn't tell you anything else? - No.

407
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,660
I swear.

408
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,260
Ma'am, right now your son's

409
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,790
barricaded himself at St. Julian's Hospital,

410
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,560
trying to blow himself up with a suicide vest.

411
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,860
Oh, my God. No!

412
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,790
I need you to come with me to St. Julian's-- ma'am.

413
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,460
We don't know how much longer we have till your son can activate

414
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,090
the explosives. we have to go.

415
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes?

416
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,010
Sir, Cole just checked in.

417
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,640
He's got Al-Zacar's mother and he's en route

418
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,270
- to St. Julian's now. What's his ETA?

419
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,110
Less than ten minutes.

420
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
All right, then. Thank you.

421
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,040
Sir, I would like to apologize again

422
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,270
for leaving my post. I know that I let you down.

423
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,070
Yes, you did.

424
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,940
I brought you in and gave you this promotion

425
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,270
because I saw something in you, not just your skill,

426
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,610
which is considerable.

427
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,970
But an ability to adapt to any situation,

428
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,840
drive to be better,

429
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,310
attributes that make you a good leader.

430
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,770
Or did I misread that?

431
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,640
No, sir.

432
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,310
So we can chalk up the last several hours

433
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,310
to a serious lapse in judgment?

434
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,310
- What I was... - Look.

435
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,070
I don't want to lose you or Cole.

436
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,640
You're both valuable,

437
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,210
but everyone is replaceable.

438
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,670
I screwed up and I'm willing to accept the consequences.

439
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,110
I know that Cole feels the same way.

440
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,810
Thank you, sir.

441
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,240
Hello?

442
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,740
Can I ask who I'm speaking with?

443
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,170
Excuse me?

444
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,170
Would you mind telling me your name, please?

445
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,040
This is Dana Walsh. Who is this?

446
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:09,940
Forgive me, Miss Walsh, for calling at this ungodly hour.

447
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,170
I actually expected to leave a message.

448
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,640
I'm sorry if I woke you.

449
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,070
No, no, that's okay. I'm actually at work.

450
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,640
What is this regarding?

451
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,240
Well, my name's Prady. I'm with the Department of Corrections

452
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,740
down in Little Rock.

453
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,540
I'm trying to locate an individual

454
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,670
by the name of Kevin Wade.

455
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,910
I-I'm sorry.

456
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,910
Who did you say that you were again?

457
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,240
Bill Prady. I'm a probation officer.

458
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,670
Mr. Wade is one of my charges.

459
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,170
Do you know him?

460
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,640
No, no. I don't think that I do.

461
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,840
Well, that's peculiar since he dialed this number

462
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,270
a few days ago from a motel room in Queens.

463
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,670
Probably just a misdial.

464
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,170
No. Dialed this number more than once,

465
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,940
and some of the calls lasted more than a couple of minutes.

466
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,570
Look, Mr. Prady, I am really busy right now.

467
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,810
I work for CTU and we are in the middle of a crisis.

468
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,040
Well, I completely understand. I've heard the news.

469
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,240
But since we're both awake,

470
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,870
I wonder if I could meet with you in person.

471
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,340
You mean now?

472
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,240
Well, I got an early flight to Little Rock in the morning,

473
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,510
so, yeah, it'd pretty much have to be now, ma'am.

474
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,110
I'm sorry. I-I don't really understand

475
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,810
why this is so pressing.

476
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,240
Well, Miss Walsh, I've grown kind of fond

477
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,740
of young Kevin, and the longer it takes me to find him,

478
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,240
the harder it'll be for me

479
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,910
to keep him from going back into prison.

480
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,010
I don't really see how I can be of any help.

481
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,740
Yeah, well, maybe not.

482
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,670
But we can determine that when we speak.

483
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,010
Like I said, it won't take long.

484
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,710
Look, if it'll smooth things over,

485
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,240
I could call your supervisor.

486
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,710
No, no. That won't be necessary.

487
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,110
I'm sure that I could spare a few minutes for you.

488
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,970
Thank you, ma'am. That would be super.

489
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,170
Tell you what. Let me just pull over,

490
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,940
and I'll get your address. All right?

491
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,570
Of course.

492
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,810
Sir, according to the bomb techs, he's close.

493
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,510
Getting that third circuit active was the toughest part.

494
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,110
The fourth is only a matter of rerouting the firing circuits.

495
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,240
What's the time frame?

496
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,710
Ten minutes, maybe less.

497
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,640
How much longer is it going to take them to drill through?

498
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,240
Too long. They're not going to make it.

499
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,240
Get her some water.

500
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,240
Take care of that.

501
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,240
Did she resist?

502
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,940
Not once I told her her boy had explosives

503
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,610
strapped to him and was going to blow himself up.

504
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,970
She had a packed suitcase, Jack.

505
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,710
So he cares enough about her

506
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,810
to make sure she got out of town.

507
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,970
What else does she know?

508
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,170
Nothing, as far as I can tell.

509
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,170
And I didn't tell her anything more.

510
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,870
Okay, good.

511
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,670
Mrs. Al-Zacar, my name is Jack Bauer.

512
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,140
I'm in charge of field operations here.

513
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,510
- Where is he? - I'm going to take you to him.

514
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,170
- I want to see him. - I'm going to take you to him.

515
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,840
Please sit down. I need you to fully understand the situation.

516
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,110
Please.

517
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,170
This is Ortiz.

518
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,740
Cole, it's me.

519
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,240
Kevin's probation officer just called me.

520
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,970
He's in New York, trying to track down Kevin.

521
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,240
I can't talk to you about this now.

522
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,710
We're in the middle here.

523
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,510
Listen to me. I told him I didn't know who Kevin was,

524
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,240
but... he caught me in the lie.

525
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,710
He has records that show him calling my cell several times.

526
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,870
Cole, this probation officer is on his way here.

527
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,510
Look, you're going to have to figure out a reason

528
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,710
why he had your number.

529
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,170
I don't know if I can do this.

530
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:44,780
What, lie?

531
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,540
Come on, we both know you're good at it.

532
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,270
Sorry.

533
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,640
Look, you just have to handle  this. Okay?

534
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,070
All right?

535
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,610
Yeah.

536
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,810
Let me know what happens.

537
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,010
I got to go.

538
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,210
I can't believe this is happening.

539
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,570
You need to believe it.

540
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,110
The men your son is working with

541
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,870
intend on detonating a radiological bomb

542
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,210
somewhere in Manhattan.

543
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,930
That's why your son tried to get you out of the city.

544
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,280
Marcos has been an agent for the IRK,

545
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,430
spying on this country

546
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,740
since your husband died.

547
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,170
We have proof of that.

548
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,210
And now he's going to kill himself

549
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,670
in order to protect this plot

550
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,470
unless you can convince him otherwise.

551
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,240
What do-what do I say to him?

552
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,200
Whatever you have to,

553
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,570
to get him to stop rearming that vest, and open the door.

554
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,240
We need him to open the door.

555
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,640
Do you understand?

556
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,110
If he does that,

557
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,140
then what happens to him?

558
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,940
He'll be alive.

559
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,240
If he cooperates with us, I promise you,

560
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,970
I will do everything I can to help him.

561
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,570
I give you my word.

562
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,540
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we need to do this now.

563
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,610
We need the room.

564
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,140
Now.

565
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,670
It's definitely her.

566
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,210
Marcos's mother.

567
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,010
You recruited him, Ali.

568
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,210
You know him better than anyone.

569
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Will she be able to talk him down?

570
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,770
He's loyal to our country.

571
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,040
I don't think so.

572
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,510
Marcos?

573
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,140
Marcos, it's me.

574
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,040
Mom, what are you doing here?

575
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,870
Marcos, you have to stop this.

576
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,610
This is crazy.

577
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,710
You son of a bitch!

578
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,210
Leave us alone!

579
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,170
You leave us alone!

580
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,070
Marcos, talk to me.

581
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,960
Oh, my God, Mom.

582
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,810
I told you to get out of the city.

583
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,170
I told you to go to Aunt Shelley's.

584
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,670
Why didn't you listen to me?

585
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,210
I'm listening now.

586
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,910
You told me that you were going to meet me there.

587
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,070
I believed you.

588
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,810
I was trying to protect you.

589
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,810
From a terrorist attack?

590
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,740
That's what they say that you're involved in here.

591
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,210
Something that's going to kill many, many people.

592
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,610
Marcos, tell me that's not true!

593
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,770
Tell me!

594
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,670
Marcos, why?

595
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,970
You ask me that?

596
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,610
After what this country did to Dad?

597
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,640
Marcos, I loved your father. You know I did.

598
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,640
But he was a complicated man,

599
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,910
and especially when it came to his politics.

600
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,010
But he never condoned violence of any kind, Marcos.

601
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,170
Never.

602
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,840
He would agree with what we're doing.

603
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,470
You really think that?

604
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,210
He hated America.

605
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,770
And yet he came to America.

606
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,140
He married an American.

607
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,470
He had an American son.

608
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,070
Honey, nothing is as simple as you're making it out to be.

609
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,210
Mr. Hastings.

610
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,540
I've registered a 12% degradation in the hospital's

611
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,070
security feed.

612
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,170
Can you boost the signal?

613
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,570
You're missing the point.

614
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,040
The indications are someone's tapped into the feed.

615
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,370
They can see everything we can.

616
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,970
I'll see if I can trace it.

617
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,210
I wish I'd done more.

618
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,740
I wish I'd helped you

619
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,640
deal with your grief and with your anger.

620
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,870
No, don't put this on yourself.

621
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,710
You couldn't have done any more

622
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
or been a better mother.

623
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,240
She's almost got him.

624
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,470
Jack, do you copy?

625
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,240
Yeah, Chloe. Go ahead.

626
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,970
The video feed has been compromised.

627
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,270
You're being surveilled.

628
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,240
Copy that. I'll take care of it from here.

629
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,070
Owen, how long will it take to disconnect the video system?

630
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,240
30 seconds.

631
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,810
- Get on it. - What's going on, Jack?

632
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,540
Someone else is watching.

633
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,040
Mom...

634
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,270
I know what they want you to do.

635
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,270
But it's too late for that.

636
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,270
Don't say that.

637
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,370
You can still turn yourself in.

638
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,310
We'll hire the best lawyers, whatever it takes.

639
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,840
I'll be with you every step of the way.

640
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,040
I promise that.

641
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,640
I'm sorry.

642
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,270
Marcos, I'm-I'm begging you.

643
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,270
Mom, listen to me.

644
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,570
You got to be strong now.

645
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,170
Damn it. No.

646
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,140
Marcos, please. You're all I have.

647
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,240
Please don't do this.

648
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,240
I love you so much.

649
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,970
- I'm sorry. - It's over. Get her out of there.

650
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,070
- I'm sorry. - Now! Move!

651
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,240
Marcos, No! No!

652
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,140
No! Marcos, no!

653
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,240
No! No!

654
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,170
Samir, I just lost picture.

655
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,570
Is his mother still in the room?

656
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,240
No, but he's still in there with one of the agents.

657
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,870
You detonate that vest,

658
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,870
your mother dies, too.

659
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,710
What did you say?

660
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,810
You heard me.

661
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,740
I'm going to make sure your mother's in Manhattan

662
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,540
when that dirty bomb goes off.

663
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,610
You don't even know what the target is.

664
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,240
I'm not talking about her dying during the explosion.

665
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,510
I'm going to personally escort her to the blast site,

666
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,710
so she's exposed to the radiation.

667
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,770
I don't believe you.

668
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,610
You wouldn't do that. You're a federal agent.

669
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,470
Truth is, I'm not, really.

670
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,940
Well, not anymore.

671
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,210
I'm more of a specialist that they brought in for today.

672
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,510
If you knew who I was,

673
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,240
and things I've done before in my life,

674
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,270
you would know that I'm not bluffing.

675
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,070
So, go ahead.

676
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,310
Blow yourself up into a million pieces.

677
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,610
First thing I'm going to do is I'm going

678
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,270
to make your mother come in here and clean it up.

679
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,270
And then I'm going to take her to the blast site.

680
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,240
Do you know how long it takes a human body

681
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,940
to absorb a lethal dose of cesium 137?

682
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,270
Five seconds.

683
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,270
Followed by 12 days of pain

684
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,810
that's so agonizing, morphine can't even touch it.

685
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,870
You got a decision to make.

686
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,240
Make it carefully.

687
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,540
You're not gonna hurt my mother.

688
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:08,440
I am done playing with you.

689
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,110
You look into my eyes.

690
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,370
Look in my eyes!

691
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,740
You think I'm joking.

692
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,210
What happens to your mother is because of you.

693
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,610
Only you.

694
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,610
If I open the door and I come out,

695
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,310
you promise you won't hurt her?

696
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,470
You promise you'll leave her alone?

697
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,210
I give you my word.

698
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,860
Cole, I've got some action on the door.

699
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,070
Put your hands up now!

700
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,560
Walk towards me!

701
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,900
Move!

702
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,970
Down on your knees!

703
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,230
Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers!

704
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,030
Don't you move!

705
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,800
Cole, I got four lights on.

706
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,300
Damn it!

707
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,600
Cole, I got four lights on!

708
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,700
We need bomb techs now.

709
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,950
The suspect's come out of the chamber,

710
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,270
but he's managed to arm the vest.

711
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,470
I repeat, he has armed the vest.

712
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,970
We need bomb techs here to disable it now!

713
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,070
Samir, Marcos is out of the chamber.

714
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,900
- What?! - They must have talked him out of it,

715
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,940
but he's rearmed the vest.

716
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,470
You're sure? He's still wearing it?

717
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,600
Yes, I think so.

718
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,530
Hang up right now and transmit the fail-safe.

719
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,630
Let's move!

720
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,490
Keep you men back! I know the circuit pattern!

721
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,950
I'm looking for four common leads before I can disarm it.

722
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,050
What's happening?! What is that?!

723
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,490
Cole, they must have triggerd a fail-safe.

724
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,620
Get you men back now.

725
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,620
Move! Move! Move!

726
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,150
Get this off of me!

727
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,990
I'm gonna try! Just stay calm!

728
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,790
Mom!

729
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,650
Get her out of here now!

730
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,990
Marcos, I might not be able to do this in time.

731
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,220
I need to know what the target is.

732
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,020
I don't know.

733
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,620
How are they gonna smuggle the fuel rods into the city

734
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,070
past the radiological detectors?

735
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,200
I don't know, I swear!

736
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,570
Who does?!

737
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,470
Give me a name.

738
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,910
Damn it, Marcos, give me a name!

739
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,910
President Hassan's head of security Tarin Faroush!

740
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,040
Tarin Faroush. Did you get that, Cole?

741
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,540
Copy! Come on.

742
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,370
Come on. Come on.

743
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,210
One more.

744
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,840
I'm not gonna be able to do this in time.

745
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,740
You tell my mother I'm sorry.

746
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,740
Jack? Jack, do you copy?

747
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,090
CTU, this is Jack.

748
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,230
Marcos is dead.

749
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,960
I'm gonna need to speak to President Hassan.

750
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,960
Commissioner, I appreciate that your NYPD's overburdened,

751
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,490
but I would ask you to do whatever you can

752
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,190
to have my daughter's picture circulated.

753
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,790
Please keep me posted

754
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,920
if you get any information regarding her whereabouts.

755
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Yes.

756
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,200
Thank you.

757
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,140
Sir, CTU is routing a call to you.

758
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:09,040
From whom?

759
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,340
Jack Bauer.

760
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,100
Yes, Mr. Bauer? This is President Hassan.

761
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,270
Mr. President, I was told you were briefed

762
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,100
on the situation at St. Julian's Hospital.

763
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
I was.

764
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,570
Sir, the suicide bomber is dead.

765
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,270
His explosive vest was remotely detonated.

766
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,770
Then you have no leads.

767
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,170
No, sir, we actually do.

768
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,600
Before the suspect was killed,

769
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,970
he identified your head of security,

770
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,900
Tarin Faroush, as a co-conspirator.

771
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,200
Tarin?

772
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,540
Are you sure about this?

773
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,170
Yes, sir. Right now you need to call UN security

774
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,170
and have them take Mr. Faroush into custody until we get there.

775
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,740
That won't be possible, Mr. Bauer.

776
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,870
Tarin's not here.

777
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,070
Where is he?

778
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,670
I don't know. Somewhere with my daughter.

779
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,200
Excuse me?

780
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,300
They are in love...

781
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,270
so I've learned.

782
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,270
Mr. Bauer, I suspected Tarin hours ago,

783
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,200
and had him arrested for questioning.

784
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,370
He escaped while being transported to our embassy.

785
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,770
Kayla believed he was innocent,

786
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,740
and has, apparently, run away with him.

787
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,440
Do you have any idea where they might be?

788
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,570
- None. - Can you contact your daughter?

789
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,370
My wife has made several attempts,

790
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,670
but she isn't answering her phone.

791
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,870
Sir, you need to keep trying.

792
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,570
Right now Mr. Faroush is our only lead.

793
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,900
I'm going to jump in the shower.

794
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,270
Hello, Mother.

795
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,340
Kayla?

796
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,740
I have her.

797
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,740
- Mr. Bauer, - Darling, are you all right?

798
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,470
we have Kayla on line with her mother.

799
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,530
Oh, I'm fine, Mother.

800
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,200
Mr.President, you need to get me an address.

801
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,870
I'm sorry I've been ignoring your calls,

802
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,070
but I know Father has put you up to this.

803
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,270
- Where are you? - You know I can't tell you that.

804
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,270
Is Tarin with you?

805
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,970
Not at the moment, no.

806
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
He doesn't want me to speak to anyone.

807
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,340
Kayla, listen to me, you are in danger.

808
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:16,070
Tarin is working with your father's enemies.

809
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,600
That's not true.

810
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,940
It's Father's paranoid delusions.

811
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,940
It isn't.

812
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,170
CTU just called to confirm.

813
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,000
They're on the line with your father now.

814
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,900
I don't believe you.

815
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,440
Kayla, please.

816
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,300
You know I loathed your father's behavior

817
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,940
and the way that he's handled everything.

818
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,240
I wouldn't be telling you this

819
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,970
unless I believed it, too.

820
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,070
Not Tarin.

821
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,000
It has to be a mistake.

822
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,770
Then we'll sort it out together.

823
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,940
But you must tell me where you are.

824
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,140
Kayla!

825
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:57,970
The Teodore Hotel, suite 514.

826
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,170
The Teodore, suite 514.

827
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,940
- Mr. Bauer. - Kayla, darling, just stay where you are.

828
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,400
The police will be there shortly.

829
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,300
They are at the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.

830
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,870
Thank you, sir.

831
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,640
I promise I'll call you once the Americans give us asylum.

832
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,770
Please don't tell Father we spoke.

833
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,670
- Kayla? - I love you, too. - Hello?

834
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,840
I thought we agreed

835
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,500
you weren't gonna take your mother's call.

836
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,340
I'm sorry, my love. I just didn't want her to worry.

837
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,000
Did you tell her where we are?

838
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,240
Did you?

839
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,770
Of course not.

840
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,700
Do you think I'm stupid?

841
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,140
You know I could never think such a thing.

842
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,800
You are perfection.

843
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,100
Now come on. We must get dressed.

844
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,200
Where are we going?

845
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,470
Where do you think?

846
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,540
To formally request our asylum.

847
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,170
At this hour?

848
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,240
My friend at

849
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,240
the State Department made the arrangements.

850
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,440
But I'm exhausted.

851
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,370
We haven't even slept.

852
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,000
I suppose you blame me for that, huh?

853
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,870
Well, then... can't we have

854
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,740
a little more time together?

855
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,870
No. Come on.

856
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,540
You must get dressed.

857
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,700
Why don't you just get dressed here?

858
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,070
I'm just gonna clean up first.

859
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,640
He's in the Teodore Hotel, suite 514.

860
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,540
And Kayla's... Kayla's with him.

861
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,270
Our men are clearing out now. It's all yours.

862
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,600
Where are we?

863
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,140
I could have a Tac team at the Teodore in 20 minutes.

864
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,640
No, NYPD can get there faster.

865
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,970
I want your men to set up a perimeter

866
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,140
and wait until we get there.

867
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,300
If any of your men

868
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,740
happen to come in contact with the suspect,

869
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:58,900
it is imperative that they know

870
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,440
we need to take him alive. Let's go.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
