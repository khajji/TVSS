1
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,300
You know I have the fuel rods.

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,930
But I have no desire to harm innocent Americans.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,430
And yet you're threatening them with a bomb.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,860
What I'm asking for is simple.

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,300
Turn over President Hassan.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,300
That will never happen.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,560
You have exactly one hour to change your mind.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,230
We have an out here.

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,900
I think we should take it.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,660
Give in to the demand

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,430
to turn over President Hassan?

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,600
I will not sell him out to the very terrorists

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,760
that we are determined to defeat.

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,930
What are you suggesting?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,260
A covert action.

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,800
We deliver Hassan to the terrorists, but make it look

17
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,260
like they took him hostage.

18
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,630
I'm begging you.

19
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,060
Don't do this.

20
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,960
Don't betray your president.

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,800
Ethan?

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,200
All right.

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,730
My God! Call 911.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,460
We wait to acquire Hassan before calling an ambulance.

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,660
Understand?

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,530
Take the weapon off now!

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,260
A dirty bomb will be detonated in New York

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,900
unless we deliver Hassan to the terrorists.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,700
Does the president know about this?

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,560
She's refusing to deal with the terrorists.

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,100
This is General Brucker's operation.

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,630
- Get up.  - What are you doing?

33
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,860
This is on you now.

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,000
You have to deliver Hassan to the terrorists.

35
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't take orders from anybody

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,160
but the president of the United States.

37
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, move.

38
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,730
Are the Americans handing over Hassan or not?

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,230
The only information we have

40
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,930
is that he's being transported to McGuire Air Force Base.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,060
So, President Taylor doesn't intend to give him up.

42
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,960
- Tarin.  - Yes?

43
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,530
The president has not responded.

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,830
Start the countdown.

45
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,330
The NYPD will handle hazmat and triage;

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,300
the National Guard will control the streets;

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,100
and I've got an army battalion standing by.

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,360
Well, a dirty bomb is about to go off in Manhattan, Commander.

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,760
I'd plan for mass panic.

50
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,930
Ethan Kanin is dying back there. We need

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
- to get him medical help.  - We will.

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,030
- I mean now.  - No, not until our team comptes its mission.

53
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,700
When we have the bomb, then we'll get your friend help.

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,560
Madam President.

55
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,800
Carry on.

56
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,330
General, what's our status?

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,660
Well, the civilian first responders

58
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,360
are positioning for rapid deployment,

59
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,330
and we've got army support available as necessary.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,860
At this point, only command level knows

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,960
we're anticipating a radiological device,

62
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,060
but people on the ground

63
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,630
are quick to connect the dots.

64
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,330
- Word will get out.  - Yeah. I'd like to get ahead of that.

65
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,060
I've drafted an address

66
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,300
for the networks, Rob, I need you to look at it.

67
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,900
And I'd like Ethan to read it, too.

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,430
He wasn't in his office. Do you know where he is?

69
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,260
I'll go find him.

70
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,460
Less than ten minutes.

71
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,700
Dear God, this bomb cannot go off.

72
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,400
I'm sorry, Madam President, but we have to prepare

73
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,830
for the worst.

74
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,900
What are the latest casualty figures?

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,160
Median scenario shows 58,000 dead over three days

76
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,860
due to the bomb and ensuing panic.

77
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,060
But who knows?

78
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,760
Maybe we'll get lucky.

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,700
Let me know the second President Hassan arrives.

80
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,560
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,400
This is not right.

82
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,960
My life for so many others.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,530
It's not right.

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,200
President Taylor doesn't see it that way.

85
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,030
She knows I would never have gone along with this decision.

86
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,360
That's why she kept me out of it.

87
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,230
You are more than just one life, Omar.

88
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,000
You are the best hope

89
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,160
of ending a war that has lasted for decades.

90
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,500
You must understand President Taylor

91
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,660
trying to protect that.

92
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,160
This is not acceptable... not like this.

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,930
Get in here.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Get down.

95
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,460
What are you doing?

96
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,700
He's slowing us down.

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,900
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
His injuries aren't lethal.

99
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,560
Jack, I need to talk to you.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,060
What?

101
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,800
Hassan isn't happy about Taylor's response

102
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,060
to the ultimatum.

103
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,660
Doesn't matter. It doesn't affect our mission.

104
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,600
He's a head of state, Jack. Maybe it should.

105
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,730
It's not our call. If he wants

106
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,860
to take it up with President Taylor,

107
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,000
he can do it when he sees... 

108
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,360
- Mom!  - What?

109
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,360
- Throw your gun down.  - Omar, what are you doing?

110
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,030
Mr. President. 

111
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,730
Kick it to me.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,400
Omar, have you lost your mind?

113
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,960
You, outside!

114
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,160
Back up inside!

115
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,900
Sir, you do not want to do...

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,730
Just shut up and move it inside!

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm giving you what you want.

118
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,900
Here, take the gun.

119
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,160
Omar, what are you doing?

120
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm sorry, Dalia.

121
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,130
My life for tens of thousands?

122
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,460
- I couldn't live with that.  - Omar, don't.

123
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,160
You can't give yourself up.

124
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,860
I have to.

125
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,260
What if they're lying?

126
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,700
What if they blow up the bomb anyway?

127
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,700
At least I've tried to stop the attack, and I've failed.

128
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,260
But if I don't even try...

129
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,060
Father, please.

130
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,660
You stay here with Kayla. I'll send someone

131
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,260
- from our delegation to pick you up.  - No.

132
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,200
No. I won't leave you.

133
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,730
- Dalia, do as I say. Do as I say!  - If you want me to stay here,

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,360
then you better lock me in that room

135
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,930
because I won't let you walk to your death!

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,230
- I won't leave you!  - Dalia, I said do as I say!

137
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,030
- No!  - Back in the room!

138
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,260
Now! In the room!

139
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,260
We've got less than five minutes. We got to move.

140
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,100
Mr. President!

141
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,460
Mr. President, you can't trust him!

142
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
You can't trust him!

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,760
Come on.

144
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,930
These people owe you their lives, sir.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,430
You're doing the right thing.

146
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,730
Excuse me.

147
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,100
Do you have the package?

148
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,360
Yes.

149
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,900
You're cutting it damn close. You know that?

150
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,530
Yeah, there were complications.

151
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,360
Jack Bauer found out about our operation.

152
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,030
He's no longer a problem.

153
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,700
Casualties?

154
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,200
The entire unit.

155
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,830
Everyone but me.

156
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,260
Sir, you need to know

157
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,130
that President Hassan is cooperating with us.

158
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
He's here by choice.

159
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,360
Well, what are you saying?

160
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,330
That he would have given himself up?

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,130
Yes, sir. We got to move.

162
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,730
All right. Stay on the line.

163
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,260
Weiss.

164
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,730
Look at him. He'll be dead soon

165
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,130
if we don't do something.

166
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,930
Yeah, along with half of New York. Bishop's on the line.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,360
He's got Hassan. Get ready to make the call.

168
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,160
Bishop, we're live. You there?

169
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,200
- Yes, sir.  - All right, we got less than two minutes. Do it.

170
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,160
- Yes.  - This is Rob Weiss,

171
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,330
President Taylor's chief of staff.

172
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,630
Do you have Hassan?

173
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,860
Yes, and we're prepared to make the exchange.

174
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,200
Prove it.

175
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,660
Uh, Bishop, put him on.

176
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,860
He wants to talk to you.

177
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,260
This is President Hassan.

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,100
I'm prepared to give myself up

179
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
if you stop the bomb.

180
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,960
So, President Taylor changed her mind.

181
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,000
No. She wasn't willing to meet your demands.

182
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,260
I am.

183
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,930
But I need assurances.

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,460
- Assurances?  - Yeah.

185
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,730
That the exchange will...

186
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,130
The exchange will happen exactly as you're told.

187
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,730
What you'll do is exactly what I say.

188
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,360
Damn it. We did what you asked.

189
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,960
Quit stalling. We're running out of time.

190
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,500
He cut us off.

191
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,900
A minute and a half till the bomb goes off.

192
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,030
Yes?

193
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,330
Tarin...

194
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,360
stop the bomb.

195
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,830
Hassan will be arriving there shortly.

196
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,860
You know what to do.

197
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,830
Yes, all right.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,730
Bomb was supposed to go off four minutes ago.

199
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,830
There's no report

200
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,400
of an explosion anywhere on the island.

201
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,930
Arlo, what's happening on the ground?

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,030
Sweep teams are still looking everywhere. No luck.

203
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,930
According to the deadline we've been given,

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,960
we're on borrowed time.

205
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,730
The bomb is still out there,

206
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,530
still a threat.

207
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,260
We may have caught a break here.

208
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,160
Let's use it.

209
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,360
O'Brian.

210
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,930
Chloe, it's Jack. I need your help.

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,130
Reception is terrible.

212
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,330
I can barely hear you.

213
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
- Can you hear me now?  - Yes.

214
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,160
President Hassan is trying to hand himself over to the terrorists.

215
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,360
That's why the bomb didn't go off.

216
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,260
No one here knows that.

217
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,130
And no one else can until I talk to the president.

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,230
What's going on?

219
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,060
Chloe, I don't have time to explain.

220
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,730
Please, just contact Tim Woods.

221
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,400
He can get me a clean line to the president.

222
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,760
But no one else can know that I'm calling.

223
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,260
Do you understand?

224
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,230
I'll call you right back.

225
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,460
Who was that?

226
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,000
Search team.

227
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,260
Requesting updated grid assignments.

228
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,900
Do you need some help?

229
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
I'll ask if I do.

230
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,330
We're clear!

231
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,430
Keep them up here on the landing.

232
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,260
Nothing.

233
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,100
I need you to get them back to President Taylor.

234
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,300
What about you?

235
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm going to say behind and look for Hassan.

236
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,960
Ma'am, I just got off the phone with CTU.

237
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,200
They're going to help me find your husband.

238
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,900
But right now it's not safe here for you.

239
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I want you and your daughter

240
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,230
to continue on to the Air Force Base.

241
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,500
Agent Walker will help you get there.

242
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,160
She can be trusted completely.

243
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,130
Mr. Bauer, my father, he did

244
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
- what he thought was best.  - I know he did.

245
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,460
We're gonna do everything we can to get him back,

246
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,900
but right now we need to move.

247
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,600
Let's go.

248
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,000
Jack, he gave himself up willingly.

249
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,460
Maybe we should just let this happen.

250
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,100
I already told you, it's not our call.

251
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,500
President Taylor asked me to protect him.

252
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,760
That's what I'm gonna try and do.

253
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,760
So, please, just get them to the Air Force Base.

254
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,730
Taxi!

255
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Come on.

256
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,100
This is Bauer.

257
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,430
I got a secure line.

258
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,000
Good. Chloe, I need you to do something else for me.

259
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,930
I'm on Seventh Avenue between 53rd and 54th.

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,360
There's a security camera mid-block.

261
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,630
I want you to see if you can get a feed and roll it back.

262
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,300
President Hassan was standing here less than ten minutes ago.

263
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,400
I'll check.

264
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Seven minutes past the deadline.

265
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,230
Do we have any idea why the bomb didn't go off?

266
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,560
No, Madam President.

267
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,830
We're polling our civilian counterparts,

268
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,860
trying to determine that.

269
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,860
Maybe it's like you said.

270
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,460
We got lucky.

271
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,230
Well, at the moment it certainly looks that way.

272
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,330
What about President Hassan?

273
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,760
When will he arrive?

274
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,700
Well, his transport was a Secret Service operation, ma'am.

275
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,230
- I'm not really in the loop.  - I'll look into it.

276
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,900
No, I'd rather you find Ethan.

277
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,500
- I'll page him.  - No,

278
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,700
not page him, find him.

279
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,200
I need him here.

280
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,960
Please.

281
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,860
Yes, ma'am.

282
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,060
- Madam President?  - Yes?

283
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,400
It's an urgent call from Homeland for you.

284
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,400
Excuse me.

285
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,060
This is President Taylor.

286
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,530
Madam President, this is Jack Bauer.

287
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,730
Please don't say my name

288
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
or react openly to what I'm about to tell you.

289
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,860
Yes.

290
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,500
President Hassan is no longer in my custody.

291
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,830
He got away

292
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,600
and he's trying to hand himself over to the terrorists.

293
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,100
That's why the bomb didn't detonate.

294
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,860
I'm afraid I don't understand.

295
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,760
Madam President, you're being betrayed by General Brucker.

296
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,100
40 minutes ago we were attacked by mercenaries

297
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,360
under his command.

298
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,560
Go on.

299
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,860
We managed to fight off the attack,

300
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,860
but President Hassan turned himself over to one of them

301
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,930
in an effort to stop the bomb from going off.

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,230
As we speak,

303
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,760
they're preparing to hand him over to the terrorists.

304
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,060
I'm assuming that that is still something

305
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,630
that is unacceptable to you.

306
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,930
That is correct.

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,400
Madam President, General Brucker is in charge

308
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,560
of this operation.

309
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,400
He's in communication with the terrorists.

310
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,860
I need to know

311
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,100
where the exchange is gonna take place.

312
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,300
- Ma'am, you need to confront him now.  - I understand.

313
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,460
As soon as you have anything, please contact CTU.

314
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,660
I will.

315
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,730
Thank you, ma'am.

316
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,230
Come with me, please.

317
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,360
Chloe, it's Jack. You still there?

318
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,360
- I'm here.  - What do you got?

319
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,130
Got the security camera feed you were talking about.

320
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,300
Hassan got into a black SUV at 6:08 with one other guy.

321
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,560
That's got to be the merc he handed himself over to.

322
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,130
They were headed west on 53rd Street.

323
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,960
I was able to trace them until they turned north

324
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,300
- on Tenth Avenue.  - Okay, good work.

325
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,300
Redirect the satellites to the Upper West Side.

326
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,860
I'm on my way.

327
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,300
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

328
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,000
Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey!

329
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,430
What now?

330
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,960
Who's this?

331
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,300
Listen carefully.

332
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,300
Hand the phone to the driver.

333
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,300
Tarin.

334
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,300
It's you, isn't it?

335
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,700
Hand it to him now.

336
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,730
He wants to talk to you.

337
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,200
It's Bishop.

338
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,730
Okay, Bishop,

339
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,160
this is what you need to do.

340
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,100
Listen to my instructions and follow them.

341
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,130
Step out of the car, leaving the keys in the ignition.

342
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Take the phone with you. Do it now.

343
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,600
Walk toward the intersection.

344
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,360
When the light changes, I want you to cross the street.

345
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,200
Stay inside the crosswalk.

346
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,360
Where's the bomb?

347
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,300
Just do what I say.

348
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,130
The deal was Hassan for the bomb.

349
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
The light's changed. Bishop, move.

350
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,560
Where is it?

351
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,030
Just do what I say.

352
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,930
Shut up. Listen.

353
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,460
Stop now.

354
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,460
Don't turn around or you get nothing.

355
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,530
Stand there and wait.

356
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,100
Turn around.

357
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,660
Walk toward the newspaper stand. Look down.

358
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,730
Show me your hands.

359
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,500
Hands!

360
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,130
On the dash.

361
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,360
Where's the bomb?

362
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,800
Where is it?

363
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,500
Where is he?

364
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,530
The General's in Mr. Kanin's office.

365
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
With Ethan?

366
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,130
We're not sure. No one's seen him in nearly an hour.

367
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,300
Ma'am, there's something you need to know.

368
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,330
Your chief of staff is with the General.

369
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,330
They appear to be in on this together.

370
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,000
Are you saying Rob Weiss betrayed me, too?

371
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,030
I'm afraid so.

372
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,200
Okay, do it.

373
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,200
Don't move.

374
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,700
Hands where we can see them!

375
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,360
Up!

376
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,060
Call medical.

377
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,200
Against the wall, hands behind your head.

378
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,100
Madam President, you need to see this.

379
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,700
Oh, my God.

380
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,400
Is he still alive?

381
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,530
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,900
He's had a serious cardiac event.

383
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,160
Get him out of here!

384
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,430
No! You stay.

385
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,600
Where is President Hassan?

386
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,760
Damn you, Rob.

387
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,960
Where is he?

388
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,860
I don't know.

389
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,560
Don't lie to me!

390
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,460
Tell me where he is.

391
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,030
No, ma'am, I cannot.

392
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,960
And if it makes any difference,

393
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,900
this was not an easy decision.

394
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,900
It makes no difference at all.

395
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
It wasn't your decision to make.

396
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,960
With all due respect,

397
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,160
you were not elected to sentence tens of thousands of Americans

398
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,830
to death.

399
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,830
Is that how you justify this?

400
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,830
You have sold out a peace

401
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,100
I committed this administration to.

402
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,100
I've protected New York

403
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,760
and given you plausible deniability

404
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,130
in an impossible situation.

405
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,630
I don't want deniability. I want Hassan!

406
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,400
We are on the verge of a peace

407
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,900
that has eluded this planet for 50 years,

408
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,160
and you are throwing it away!

409
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,460
Tell me where he is.

410
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,500
The charge is treason.

411
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,500
It carries the death penalty,

412
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,830
and so help me God, I'll throw the switch myself.

413
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,800
Tell me where he is.

414
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,530
It's not too late. 

415
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,630
It is too late.

416
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,660
They have Hassan.

417
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,430
We have the bomb.

418
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,660
The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd.

419
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,900
We'll get NEST team there as soon as possible.

420
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,360
Damn you, Rob.

421
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,360
Really, Madam President?

422
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,360
New York City is safe.

423
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,230
Take him away!

424
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,000
Your attention, please.

425
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,060
I've just spoken with the president

426
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,100
at McGuire.

427
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,100
Rogue operatives have handed Hassan over to the terrorists.

428
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,300
In return, they got the location

429
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,800
of the dirty bomb: 93rd and Amsterdam.

430
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,930
Jack Bauer and NEST are already on-site and disarming the bomb.

431
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,660
Our focus is to recover President Hassan.

432
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,430
I've got satellite feed at 93rd, sir.

433
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
Okay, looks like we're back in business.

434
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,530
Put it up on-screen, Arlo.

435
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,300
We know that President Hassan was handed over

436
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,460
at that location approximately ten minutes ago.

437
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,100
NSA feed only gives us still images.

438
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,330
We might have missed him.

439
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,060
We didn't. There's Bishop's SUV.

440
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,960
Okay,

441
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,260
they've got to be close; find them.

442
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,160
Someone's approaching the SUV.

443
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,260
Any idea who that is?

444
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,130
I can try to clean up the image.

445
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,130
Lost it.

446
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,330
They were heading east.

447
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,830
We can backtrack through the traffic cam footage.

448
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,030
I want you and Dana to find

449
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,260
that vehicle. As soon as you reacquire it,

450
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,260
let Jack know.

451
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,300
Dana, where are you going?

452
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,630
Hastings wants us to do this.

453
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
I was thinking I would reroute some of the servers.

454
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,100
Not now.

455
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,000
It'll give us more processing speed.

456
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,800
We can work with what we have. Let's get going.

457
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,330
Okay.

458
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,030
Those are the rods we were looking for, sir,

459
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,060
packed in enough C4 to irradiate half of Manhattan.

460
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,300
Okay, as soon as they're extracted,

461
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,530
I want you to contact CTU.

462
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,830
Thanks. Yes, sir.

463
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,460
I want him transferred back to holding in medical.

464
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,900
Contact Hastings as you're en route.

465
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,260
So it's real.

466
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,300
A dirty bomb.

467
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,000
Yeah.

468
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,930
Then we succeeded.

469
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,330
We saved Manhattan.

470
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,500
You betrayed your president and your country.

471
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,600
Get him out of here.

472
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,830
This is Bauer. Go ahead.

473
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,830
Jack, it's Chloe.

474
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,100
We've got Hassan's location.

475
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,700
He's heading north on Amsterdam in a black SUV.

476
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,260
- How far north?  - About...

477
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,400
- 30 blocks ahead of you.  - Jack, the president wants us

478
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,260
to do everything we can to recover Hassan.

479
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,730
She wants you to lead the operation.

480
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,200
How many men are with him?

481
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,800
- We think only one... the driver.  - Okay, Chloe,

482
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,330
I need you to find me a suitable ambush point.

483
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,260
I want clean lines of fire from rooftop and street level.

484
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,530
In order to protect Hassan, we need to take the vehicle

485
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,030
and the driver out at the same time.

486
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,560
Tac teams are standing by, Jack.

487
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,930
- Is Cole with them?  - No, on his way back.

488
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,260
We expect him here any minute.

489
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,930
Then he's going to have to quarterback this op from CTU.

490
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'll get you real-time updates

491
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,760
on the position of Hassan's vehicle.

492
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,660
Copy that.

493
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,030
Cole's back.

494
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,300
I'll go get him.

495
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,030
Yes?

496
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,130
Hello?

497
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,830
I'm so glad you're back.

498
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,630
Yeah, me, too. I heard we recovered the bomb.

499
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,030
Only 'cause Hassan gave himself up to the terrorists.

500
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,660
Jack's putting together an intercept operation right now.

501
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,660
He wants you to run it from here.

502
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,660
All right, you'd better bring me up to speed.

503
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,660
What happened to that probation officer

504
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,000
that was sniffing around?

505
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,660
I convinced him I didn't know anything; he left.

506
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,100
That's good.

507
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,100
Yeah, it's good.

508
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,260
Hey.

509
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,600
We're going to get through this, you and me.

510
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,130
We will.

511
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,930
We should go.

512
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,200
You don't have to do this, Tarin.

513
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,500
You can pull over right now, stop the car.

514
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,500
Believe me, I want to do this.

515
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,400
If you hate me so much, stand against me at home.

516
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,500
Join the opposition.

517
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,600
Fight me openly, honorably.

518
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,060
I don't need to fight you, Hassan.

519
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,130
You have already lost.

520
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,460
So tell me, what's the plan?

521
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,700
You'll put me on trial?

522
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,430
A dark room and a video camera, I suppose.

523
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,660
A man hiding behind a mask...

524
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,500
will read a list of my crimes

525
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,630
and cut off my head with a sword.

526
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,630
The world will be impressed.

527
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,960
You've done worse in your prisons.

528
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,460
Whatever I did...

529
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,360
I did to unite our country, to make us stronger.

530
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,660
That's a lie!

531
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,500
You just wanted to hand us over to the Americans.

532
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,600
No.

533
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,000
I wanted us to rejoin the world.

534
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,530
I wanted us to have peace.

535
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,700
You wanted the cover of Time magazine.

536
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,530
You think I don't know you,

537
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,030
Omar.

538
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,230
I watched over you

539
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,760
day and night, remember, watched over you

540
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,400
while you betrayed your own wife with a Western whore.

541
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,660
You care for nothing

542
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,260
but yourself.

543
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,230
Yes.

544
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,500
Yes, I've made mistakes...

545
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,900
but believing in peace was not one of them.

546
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,300
Think whatever you like.

547
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,660
You won't be around to find out.

548
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,740
Madam President

549
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,030
Just, just a moment.

550
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,130
They're going to treat you on the base hospital.

551
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,260
But then I want you right back here.

552
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,460
That's an order.

553
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,400
Excuse us just a moment.

554
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,960
You have always been true to me, Ethan.

555
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,160
I need you now.

556
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,600
Hurry back.

557
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,660
Take good care of him.

558
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,300
Madam President, Mrs. Hassan and her daughter have just arrived.

559
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,260
Thank you, Susan.

560
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,700
I am

561
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,560
so relieved you're both safe.

562
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,630
Thank you, Madam President.

563
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,630
Do you know what is happening with my husband?

564
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,000
We do.

565
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,100
He is in the hands of the terrorists,

566
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,930
but we're tracking him on satellite.

567
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,130
We're going in now

568
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,230
to monitor the rescue effort.

569
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,230
Do you want to join us?

570
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,430
Yes.

571
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,960
All right.

572
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,160
If you will,

573
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,860
go on in the situation room,

574
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,830
and, and I'll be there in a minute.

575
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,630
Thank you. Thank you.

576
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,630
I didn't expect to see you again, Ms. Walker,

577
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,260
but in these last few hours,

578
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,330
I have learned how few people I can really trust.

579
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,400
I am glad you're here.

580
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,830
Thank you, Madam President.

581
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,700
But I think I'd be of more use at CTU.

582
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,060
Of course.

583
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,060
Susan will arrange a car for you.

584
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,130
Thank you, ma'am.

585
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
Thank you.

586
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,160
Jack Bauer and CTU are running the operation.

587
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,500
We expect the intercept to occur

588
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,660
in a few minutes.

589
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,060
Okay.

590
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,760
Ma'am, satellite feed's coming in from CTU.

591
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,300
Jack, Hassan's vehicle just crossed 130th.

592
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,330
I'm at 110th Street.

593
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,760
Do we have an ambush point yet?

594
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,100
Yes, intersection of 161st

595
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,100
and Amsterdam.

596
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,530
Who we got for the take-down team?

597
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,830
I have a special ops unit moving into position.

598
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,100
We'll trigger the traffic lights

599
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,530
to stop the vehicle at the intersection,

600
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,760
then heavy machine gun fire into the engine block

601
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,600
to disable it, snipers to take out the driver.

602
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,600
That leaves you

603
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,730
- to reacquire Hassan.  - Good.

604
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,030
What's our perimeter look like?

605
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,830
Bridges and tunnels were closed earlier this morning.

606
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,000
That means Riverside Drive is shut down, too.

607
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,900
He can only use Amsterdam.

608
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,100
What about cross streets?

609
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,760
We got 'em all covered from 140th Street on.

610
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,930
As long as we don't spook him,

611
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,130
he'll drive straight into the ambush.

612
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Copy that. Leave this line open

613
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,900
in case there are any changes in the route.

614
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,860
- You got it.  - What's our timing?

615
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,700
Given traffic flow, Tarin should hit the intersection

616
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
- in eight minutes.  - I can use traffic lights

617
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,400
to slow him down if Jack hasn't caught up.

618
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,860
Fine, I'll let the president know.

619
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,960
Cole, I'm seeing some fluctuations

620
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,400
in the carrier signal on the subnet.

621
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,430
What's that mean?

622
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,930
It might be a problem with the trunk line.

623
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,930
We can't afford

624
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,530
another dropout with the satellite feed.

625
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,060
That's how we lost the rods in the first place.

626
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,600
Chloe, what's the status of your workaround on the trunk line?

627
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,700
It's working fine if you ask me. Do you need me to check it?

628
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,730
No, we need you here.

629
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,400
I can check it if you can watch my screen,

630
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,100
- Chloe.  - Okay.

631
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,500
Thanks, Dana.

632
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,630
Arlo, what are you doing here?

633
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,630
I could ask you the same.

634
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,660
Cole asked me to check on the trunk line.

635
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,760
Except the trunk line's over here.

636
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,200
I can do it from here also.

637
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,760
I set up this system, you know.

638
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,830
Right.

639
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,400
Sorry.

640
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,730
Then maybe you can explain why they keep going down.

641
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,100
We were hit with a massive electromagnetic pulse.

642
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,930
It's a miracle we managed to get anything

643
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,900
up and running again as fast as we did.

644
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,230
So, what are you doing now?

645
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,200
I'm running a diagnostic on the trunk line.

646
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,500
Why were you looking at a map of Manhattan

647
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,400
if you're running an internal diagnostic?

648
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,860
I was checking the progress of the operation.

649
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,560
How I do my work is none of your business, Arlo.

650
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,230
Actually, given that I've been having

651
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,830
to cover for you the entire night,

652
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,300
I think it is my business.

653
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,230
Fine.

654
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,200
You want to check up on me, go ahead.

655
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,660
You're really going to do this.

656
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,060
Yeah, I am.

657
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,730
So, where are the diagnostics?

658
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,860
In the systems folder, where they always are.

659
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:12,200
No, I mean... where on your screen?

660
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,100
Thought you said you were working on this.

661
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,030
I wasn't using diagnostics.

662
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,660
I was monitoring the voltage fluctuation

663
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,000
in the trunk line directly.

664
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,360
Really. How?

665
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,760
I thought you knew everything.

666
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,230
- Yeah.  - Arlo, where are you?

667
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,330
Hastings's been looking for you.

668
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,460
Yeah, I'll be right down.

669
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,400
Hastings wants me on the floor.

670
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,730
I'll leave you to do whatever you're doing.

671
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,260
Don't push it, Arlo.

672
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,400
Yes.

673
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,030
CTU is following you.

674
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,560
Where? Where are they?

675
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,760
They're all over you.

676
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,330
There's an ambush set for 161st.

677
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,660
I'm nearly there.

678
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,100
Why am I only hearing this now?

679
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,260
Look, I am already doing far more

680
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,730
than I've been paid to do.

681
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,500
You need to calm down.

682
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,060
We knew this might happen.

683
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,830
Can you find me an exit?

684
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,830
There's one between 158th and 159th.

685
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,000
- parking garage.  - 158th, 159th.

686
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,400
Is everyone ready for this?

687
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,900
I will let Samir know, and then it is up to him.

688
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,130
It's only a matter of time

689
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,110
before this gets traced back to me.

690
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,440
I need you to get the hell out of there when I still can.

691
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,830
Hassan is crossing over 148th Street.

692
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,400
I'm activating signals up to 160th.

693
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,330
You took your time.

694
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,830
I'm sorry. It got complicated.

695
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,230
Is the trunk line going to hold?

696
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,030
Yeah, I think so.

697
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,300
Then we keep going.

698
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,900
What's our timing, Chloe?

699
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,300
Intercept: four minutes.

700
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,300
Jack, do you have a visual on Hassan yet?

701
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,400
- Negative.  - He's five blocks ahead of you, Jack.

702
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,860
Roger that. Tac teams in position?

703
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,660
- They're good to go.  - Okay, nobody move

704
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,730
until Hassan's vehicle is stopped in the intersection.

705
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,630
What are you looking for?

706
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,330
We are being followed, aren't we?

707
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,830
Shut up.

708
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,760
That phone call... it's a warning.

709
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,360
CTU is onto you.

710
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm not afraid of CTU.

711
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,100
Why are you looking over your shoulder

712
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,030
- all the time?  - I said shut up!

713
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,360
Tarin, it's not too late.

714
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,500
Give yourself up.

715
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,430
Give yourself up, and I'll speak for you.

716
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I won't warn you again.

717
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,860
You're on an island here.

718
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,260
There's no way out.

719
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,700
They'll find you.

720
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,060
Yes, they will.

721
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,400
Soon enough.

722
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,830
Damn it. They've made us. He's breaking left.

723
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,260
I repeat: he's breaking left.

724
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,530
Chloe, have you got them?

725
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,760
Can you see where they're going?

726
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,800
Checking.

727
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,100
What's happening? Why did he turn?

728
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,700
He's in a parking garage.

729
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,430
- It extends across the block.  - How many exits?

730
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,130
- Only two.  - Okay, he's going to have

731
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,330
to double back. Where's the other exit?

732
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,900
- Broadway.  - I'll cover that.

733
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,100
Cole, I want you to pull your team back from the ambush point.

734
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,430
- Cover the block.  - You got it.

735
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,430
All teams,

736
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,930
pull back and reposition.

737
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,860
Set a perimeter around the parking garage

738
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,330
between 158th and 159th.

739
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,060
I've got him.

740
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,430
He's going back into the garage.

741
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,000
Copy that. All units converging on your destination.

742
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,500
He's just moving deeper into the structure.

743
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,800
He's got no place else to go, Jack. You got him.

744
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,700
Where did they go?

745
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,160
Inside the structure.

746
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,400
He's running for the roof.

747
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,000
Move! Move!

748
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,200
Where the hell is he going?

749
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,760
Coming straight at me!

750
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,160
Damn it!

751
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,830
Chloe, we got any movement from the target vehicle?

752
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,800
No. No one could survive that.

753
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,460
Chloe, Hassan is not in the vehicle.

754
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,600
You know where to go.

755
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,900
- What if he comes to?  - He won't.

756
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,960
Not before you deliver him. Go!

757
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,860
I said go!

758
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Yeah.

759
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,230
Hey, it's me.

760
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,630
Have you got Hassan?

761
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,860
No. We set up our ambush.

762
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,560
We were seconds away from taking him down,

763
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,630
when out of nowhere, the driver deviated from his route.

764
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,860
He managed to transfer Hassan

765
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,500
to another vehicle before I could get to him.

766
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,100
Someone inside CTU has got to be tipping them off.

767
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,530
How is that possible?

768
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,800
I don't know, but I've got the driver's cell phone.

769
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,430
Soon as we can set up an uplink,

770
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,330
I'll be able to figure out who it is.

771
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
I'm on my way to CTU.

772
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,400
- Do you want me to talk to Chloe?  - Yeah, but no one else.

773
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,630
Tell her we need a secure area to run the uplink.

774
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,700
- Get back to me as soon as you're ready.  - Okay.

775
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,060
We need to search the parking structure.

776
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:48,730
He switched cars.

777
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,440
All units, grid search on the parking structure now.

778
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,310
All right, let's move.

779
