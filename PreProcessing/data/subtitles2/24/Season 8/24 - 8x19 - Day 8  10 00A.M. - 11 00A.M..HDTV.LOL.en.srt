1
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:16,691
The Russian people join you
in mourning President Hassan.

2
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:20,962
We both know the opposition
that undid him had outside help.

3
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,665
I just got off the phone with
the Russian foreign minister.

4
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,966
He said that he would be

5
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,801
coming to the United Nations
in five hours

6
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:27,969
with the Russian premier

7
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,270
to sign the treaty

8
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:30,304
as scheduled.

9
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:32,907
The credit for that
is all yours.

10
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,942
<i>LOGAN:
It's good to be
back in the game.</i>

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,711
Elements inside
the Russian government

12
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:38,680
were behind
both the assassination

13
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:41,516
of President Hassan
and the supply of

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,785
nuclear material to his enemies.

15
00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:45,687
<i>TAYLOR:
The Russian government?</i>

16
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,721
The Russians inserted

17
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,290
Dana Walsh
at CTU months ago.

18
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:50,558
She's their agent.

19
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:51,793
If Bauer gets to her,

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,796
this will all be finished.

21
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:57,298
I want to know who
killed Renee Walker.

22
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:59,400
<i>WALSH:
Renee's dead? I'm sorry.</i>

23
00:00:59,468 --> 00:01:00,902
You're sorry?

24
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:04,038
(panting)
I can give you the hitter.

25
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,907
I want more than just names;
I want proof!

26
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:08,209
I have proof.

27
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,912
An audio file. Film.

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,513
Where?

29
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:14,415
First I want
my immunity deal back.

30
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:16,484
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:18,052
I won't give
Dana Walsh immunity.

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,822
I believe she knows the names
of the people who facilitated

33
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:22,590
the assassination
of President Hassan,

34
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:25,193
people working within
the Russian government.

35
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,728
<i>TAYLOR:
I won't allow it.</i>

36
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,362
You don't want
to know the truth.

37
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,632
What I want is to keep
the Russians at the table.

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,001
Allegations of this sort
will drive them away.

39
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,503
I've arranged a helicopter

40
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:38,539
to fly you from CTU
to McGuire Air Force Base.

41
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:41,109
You're locking me down.

42
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:43,811
I'm taking this helicopter.

43
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,380
Tell your men to drop their
weapons or you're gonna die.

44
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,116
(dropping weapons)

45
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:49,484
Out of the copter now!

46
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:50,685
All security to the helipad.

47
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:52,620
Security to the helipad now.

48
00:01:52,688 --> 00:01:53,688
Call the FAA, Air Force,

49
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:55,189
say that we have
a stolen helicopter

50
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:57,091
that needs to be intercepted
and forced down.

51
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,326
<i>WINNICK:
Yes, ma'am.</i>

52
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:10,571
CHLOE (over comm):
Jack, it's Chloe.

53
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,073
What are you doing?

54
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:14,942
Talk to me.

55
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,945
Jack, talk to me.

56
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:18,980
Can you hear me?

57
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:20,148
Yeah, he can hear you.

58
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:21,682
Comm's on,
he's just not answering.

59
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,984
Damn it.

60
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:24,786
Air Force choppers are
closing in on his position.

61
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:38,432
PILOT:
Mr. Bauer, you are ordered

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,469
to turn the aircraft around
and return to CTU.

63
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,772
I repeat,
turn the aircraft around now.

64
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:57,585
Jack's descending.

65
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,320
Air Force choppers
are in pursuit.

66
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,189
CHLOE:
Jack, this is crazy.

67
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,490
Come back to CTU.

68
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:20,474
NYPD, this is Ranger One.

69
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,677
Suspect just landed
on the Cooper Building.

70
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,313
We're gonna circle
and maintain visual contact.

71
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,781
DISPATCHER:
Copy that.

72
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:30,351
We're cordoning off a two-block
radius around the building.

73
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,469
We have a
visual on NYPD.

74
00:03:48,537 --> 00:03:50,504
Two units approaching
the building.

75
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:51,505
They're one block out.

76
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:54,609
(sirens wailing)

77
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:02,350
Suspect's on the fire escape.

78
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:03,985
<i>He's descending
to ground level.</i>

79
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:06,487
(sirens wailing)

80
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:24,405
(sirens wailing)

81
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:28,943
We've lost him.

82
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:30,344
Attempting to reacquire.

83
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,334
Dispatch, this is unit 27.

84
00:04:53,402 --> 00:04:55,269
We're at the building,
but we've lost the suspect.

85
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,238
DISPATCHER:
Copy. We'll widen the perimeter.

86
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:05,880
What the hell is Jack doing?

87
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:07,715
He's not letting this go,
that's what he's doing.

88
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:09,617
Dana told him she has
proof about the Russians.

89
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,918
He'll probably
come after her.

90
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:12,019
That's crazy.
She's locked down.

91
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,521
Jack knows he can't
get to her.

92
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:16,257
He'll either figure it
out or he'll die trying.

93
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,560
I want you in the field.

94
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:21,429
Meet with NYPD and coordinate
an interagency search.

95
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:22,897
Bring in whoever you need.

96
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:23,898
Yep.

97
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,967
Arlo, use satellite
and traffic cam.

98
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,635
Maybe we can
track him from here.

99
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,136
On it.

100
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,204
(sighs)

101
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,881
Keep me looped in
on the search status.

102
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,517
No, I don't want to be
updated in ten minutes.

103
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,586
I want a real-time uplink.

104
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,928
They still haven't been
able to lock Jack down.

105
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,062
They lost him.

106
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,297
He landed the chopper

107
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,298
and escaped on foot.

108
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,867
NYPD is securing a perimeter.

109
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,370
CTU is coordinating
an interagency search.

110
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:05,506
If Jack gets this evidence
and exposes the Russians,

111
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,608
the agreement
is over.

112
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:10,244
The peace agreement
may not be the only casualty.

113
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:14,882
Madam President,

114
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,717
you covered up
the Russians' involvement.

115
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:20,721
That's grounds
for impeachment.

116
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,724
Possibly a criminal
indictment.

117
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,294
You crossed a line,
Madam President.

118
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,998
But it may not be too late

119
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:33,234
to step back
and limit the damage.

120
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,303
How?

121
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:37,705
Expose the Russians.

122
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,775
Grant Dana Walsh immunity
in exchange for evidence.

123
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:41,942
We'll launch an investigation

124
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,879
through transparent
international channels.

125
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,547
Which will effectively end

126
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,715
the peace deal.

127
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,251
But it will save
your administration.

128
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,555
There is still a chance

129
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,890
CTU will find Jack.

130
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,193
Even if they do,
the evidence is still out there.

131
00:06:59,261 --> 00:07:01,996
Eventually, it will surface.

132
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:13,908
Allison... I know
better than anyone

133
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,676
how much this means to you.

134
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:18,279
How much you've sacrificed

135
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:22,283
personally
to make it happen.

136
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,586
Ethan, we are so close.

137
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,588
And we will be again.

138
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,623
If not during
your administration,

139
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,692
then during the next one.

140
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,931
I wish I could believe that.

141
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,077
Ethan, I want you to prepare...

142
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,345
(sniffles)

143
00:07:51,413 --> 00:07:54,882
a statement
announcing our withdrawal

144
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,151
from this accord.

145
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:58,252
We have a...
(clears throat)

146
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,620
a press conference
in 40 minutes.

147
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,623
I'll make the announcement then.

148
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:09,997
As hard as this is,
you're doing the right thing.

149
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,370
(sniffles)

150
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,801
(elevator doors squeak)

151
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:55,142
Madam President.

152
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:05,819
It's over, Charles.

153
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:08,722
I've decided not to go through
with the peace deal.

154
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,491
Because of Bauer.

155
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,027
Because the evidence
implicating the Russians--

156
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,562
evidence that
I helped cover up--

157
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,163
is-is potentially too lethal.

158
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,065
I agree, Madam President.

159
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,768
Doesn't sound like you
have much of a choice.

160
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,938
I'm surprised.

161
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:26,106
I expected more of
a fight from you.

162
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:28,108
I'm nothing if not pragmatic.

163
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,945
Although I am
disappointed.

164
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:35,583
I'm afraid you have to find some
other way to repair your legacy.

165
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,752
My own personal
disappointment aside,

166
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,188
it's a loss
for the world.

167
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,957
Yes, it is.

168
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,962
Ethan's drafting
my statement.

169
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,165
I need to call Dalia Hassan.

170
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:53,867
Hope that
she'll forgive me for

171
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,703
keeping the truth from her.

172
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,305
Before you do, there is one
thing you might consider.

173
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:02,009
A way to preserve
the peace deal.

174
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:04,011
The peace deal is over.

175
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,112
You said so yourself.

176
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,747
I said it was over

177
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,115
if the evidence
comes out.

178
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:10,918
Obviously, you
can't grant

179
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,419
Walsh immunity.

180
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,089
The evidence would
become public record.

181
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,692
You need to control the evidence
by keeping Walsh off the grid.

182
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,027
Off the grid?

183
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:22,429
Classify her as
an enemy combatant

184
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,998
and incarcerate her
in a private facility.

185
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:26,166
There is a private

186
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,601
security firm I can recommend.

187
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:31,105
They're effective
and discreet.

188
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,508
I have them standing by.

189
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,514
Sounds like you've been
giving this a lot of thought.

190
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:41,649
Madam President,

191
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:44,318
this evidence is
hanging over your head.

192
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:45,786
You need to deal with it.

193
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,789
We can't keep Walsh
locked up indefinitely.

194
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,157
You wouldn't have to.

195
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:54,428
Ms. Walsh may not give up
the information willingly,

196
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,430
but she will give it up.

197
00:10:56,498 --> 00:11:00,734
And once we have it, it won't
matter what she claims.

198
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,139
You're talking about
using physical coercion.

199
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,341
I know how deeply
this offends

200
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,076
your public and private
sensibilities.

201
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:10,477
It is repugnant,

202
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,013
even immoral.

203
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:15,182
But isn't morality relative,

204
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,451
considering what's
at stake here?

205
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,155
You are still
talking about torture.

206
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,357
I'm talking about
preserving a peace accord

207
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:25,492
that is crucial to the
security of this nation.

208
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,528
And that can only
happen if you

209
00:11:27,595 --> 00:11:29,963
acquire and control
the evidence.

210
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,034
Believe me, Madam President,

211
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:35,836
I don't make
these suggestions lightly.

212
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,638
I appreciate the implications.

213
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:40,174
I've tried to be as open
and candid with you

214
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,608
as I've been
with anyone.

215
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:42,910
And the truth is,

216
00:11:42,977 --> 00:11:46,814
I regret many of my own actions
when I was president.

217
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,882
But I've also had the
time and the distance

218
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,320
to see past them to a place
of clear and deep understanding.

219
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:56,824
What do you understand, Charles?

220
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:00,527
Wielding the kind of power
that I once had and you have now

221
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,829
can change the world.

222
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:04,131
But that often
requires making

223
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,266
impossible choices

224
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:08,836
that challenge
our most sacred ideals.

225
00:12:10,872 --> 00:12:13,507
If you're not
willing to do that,

226
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:17,044
you should take Ethan's advice
and pull out now.

227
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:34,007
This was taken eight minutes ago

228
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:36,076
on the corner
of 25th and Cleveland.

229
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:41,815
Give Cole this information,
have him redirect his search.

230
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:42,883
Ms. O'Brian.

231
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:45,118
I have President Taylor
calling for you.

232
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:46,820
Put her through.

233
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:49,056
CHLOE (on phone):
Madam President, Chloe O'Brian.

234
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:51,725
Have you made any progress
in finding Jack Bauer?

235
00:12:51,793 --> 00:12:53,460
Not yet. We're
still searching.

236
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:54,761
I think it's
safe to assume

237
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,563
he's on his way
to CTU and that

238
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:58,498
Dana Walsh is his target.

239
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,667
That's, that's why
I'm calling, Chloe.

240
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:02,669
I want Walsh
transferred

241
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:05,672
to a safe house
off-site.

242
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,442
Madam President, I've doubled
the security around Dana Walsh.

243
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:10,611
I'm confident thiss
the safest place for her to be.

244
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:14,548
Your opinion notwithstanding,
I'd feel more comfortable

245
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:17,150
with her in a place
where she can't be tracked.

246
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:20,487
Agents from a
private security firm

247
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:22,189
are coming there
to pick her up.

248
00:13:22,257 --> 00:13:24,758
A private security firm?

249
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:27,961
You know as well as I do
that Jack has contacts

250
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:30,364
throughout the
government, some of whom

251
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:32,566
might be sympathetic
to his situation.

252
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:38,305
I'm not suggesting that you're
one of those people, Chloe.

253
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:42,843
I just, I just want to take
every precaution.

254
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,011
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:46,513
I'm sending over the
transfer order now.

256
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:48,615
The agent in charge
of the escort team

257
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,984
is named Mark Bledsoe.

258
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,086
Should be arriving
there in a few minutes.

259
00:13:53,154 --> 00:13:54,855
Understood.

260
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:56,023
Thank you, Chloe.

261
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:00,193
I know this was difficult,
Madam President,

262
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:02,462
but you made the right call.

263
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:07,768
These men of yours, I want
them to use every method of

264
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:10,003
noncoercive interrogation
available to them.

265
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:12,372
I've already given
that standing order.

266
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,341
No one wants this to get ugly.

267
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:17,010
Oh, it's already ugly, Charles.

268
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:21,815
(car horns honking)

269
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,089
Thanks. I don't need
the chargers.

270
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:37,130
(phone line ringing)

271
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,099
O'Brian.

272
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,667
Chloe, it's Jack.

273
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:43,203
Jack. Please, come back now.

274
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,571
This has got to stop.

275
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,673
I need you to get me
access to Dana Walsh.

276
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:48,875
The president said she's lying.

277
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:50,377
No, it's the president
who's lying.

278
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:52,346
She's covering up the evidence
to protect the peace agreement.

279
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,681
Even if she is,
she must have good reason.

280
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:57,351
Besides, it's not your call,
it's the president's.

281
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:58,552
She's covering up evidence

282
00:14:58,619 --> 00:14:59,953
of a terrorist attack
against this country.

283
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:01,288
She no longer has the call.

284
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:03,957
You don't want to go
against me on this.

285
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,360
Are you threatening me?

286
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:09,262
Chloe, I'm trying
to ask you for help.

287
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,431
I need you to put me in
a room with Dana Walsh.

288
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:12,432
You're being hunted by every

289
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,600
law enforcement agency
in the city.

290
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:14,868
You're not thinking clearly.

291
00:15:14,936 --> 00:15:17,604
Right now,
I'm the only one who is.

292
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:20,073
You can't just
go against everyone.

293
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:22,743
Please, just come in here,
and we'll figure this out

294
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,811
before you get
yourself killed.

295
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,046
You know what,
forget it, Chloe.

296
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:27,080
I'll figure out
another way.

297
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:28,215
Jack, wait.

298
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,417
What?

299
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,454
If you do get the evidence
from Dana,

300
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:35,989
what are you gonna do with it?

301
00:15:36,057 --> 00:15:37,991
(panting)

302
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:40,394
I just want the people
who are responsible for this

303
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:41,495
to be held accountable.

304
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:43,964
All I need to do is expose them.

305
00:15:49,404 --> 00:15:51,471
The president's having her
transferred out of CTU.

306
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,140
Why?

307
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:54,174
I'm not sure.

308
00:15:54,242 --> 00:15:55,509
She hired a private
security firm.

309
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:56,676
Where are they taking her?

310
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:58,178
I don't know.

311
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:00,113
Find out.
I'll call you back.

312
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:03,083
Chloe.

313
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:04,651
Okay. I will.

314
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,720
Thanks.

315
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,301
(phone ringing)

316
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:32,813
Yes?

317
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,214
Jim, it's Jack Bauer.

318
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,550
Jack Bauer.

319
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:39,386
From what I'm hearing, you got
the whole damn city after you.

320
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:40,554
Look, I need your help.

321
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:42,055
I'm running out of places to go.

322
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:43,056
Running out?

323
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,524
(wry chuckle)

324
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:45,826
I'd say gone.

325
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:47,894
What'd you do
this time, Jack?

326
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,229
The less you know,
the better.

327
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:50,964
For who?
For both of us.
Look.

328
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:52,566
I'm gonna need weapons and
equipment; I need it fast.

329
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,567
Can you make that happen?

330
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:55,502
I can make just about

331
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,537
anything happen, Jack;
you already know that.

332
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:00,173
The problem is that you're
a walking bull's-eye.

333
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:02,776
Last thing in the world I
need is you on my doorstep.

334
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,878
You wouldn't have a doorstep
if it wasn't for me.

335
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:05,946
I'm calling in a favor.

336
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,247
I'm gonna tell you
what I want,

337
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:08,882
and I want it ready
when I get there.

338
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,250
You understand me?

339
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:12,919
Well, I see you haven't
lost your personal touch.

340
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:15,322
I'm gonna need a comm unit,
two MP5s,

341
00:17:15,389 --> 00:17:17,023
an assortment of assault rifles

342
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:19,192
and ammo, a full communication

343
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,794
and surveillance package.

344
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,529
I'll be there in ten minutes.

345
00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:34,374
(phone line ringing)

346
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,876
Yeah?

347
00:17:35,943 --> 00:17:37,444
It's me. We're at CTU.

348
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:38,445
You have Walsh?

349
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:39,579
Not yet. I wanted to

350
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:40,947
talk about something
before we proceeded.

351
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:42,115
Is there a problem?

352
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,017
We put this team
together on short notice,

353
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:46,253
and we never had a chance
to discuss what to do with

354
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,554
the prisoner once we've
extracted the information.

355
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:48,989
Hand her
back to CTU.

356
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,024
Without the evidence, she has
no teeth; she can't hurt us.

357
00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,492
Well, she can make accusations.

358
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,394
Even without the evidence,
something might stick.

359
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:55,662
You can't afford that.

360
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,863
What are you suggesting?

361
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:59,432
We can make it look like
the prisoner was killed

362
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,767
while she was
trying to escape.

363
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,168
Wouldn't be difficult.

364
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:04,237
I'm not sure we're willing
to go down that path.

365
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:06,006
You hired me
to clean up this situation.

366
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:08,008
In my professional opinion,
that's what needs to happen.

367
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:10,977
Talk it over with the client,
but I need to know soon.

368
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:13,046
Sir?

369
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:14,681
Yes, okay, I'll let you know.

370
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:25,959
Mr. Bledsoe?

371
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:26,993
That's right.

372
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,461
Chloe O'Brian,
acting director of CTU.

373
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,163
Heard you've had a rough day.

374
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:31,164
Yeah, you could say that.

375
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:32,198
I'll take you to Dana Walsh.

376
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,266
Thank you.

377
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:36,169
Where exactly are
you taking her?

378
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:37,304
I can't disclose
that information.

379
00:18:37,371 --> 00:18:39,072
The whole point of
this exercise is to keep Walsh

380
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,273
off the grid.

381
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:42,442
Yes, but I'm responsible
for this prisoner.

382
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,945
You were given a presidential
order to turn over the prisoner.

383
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,713
Actually, I'm gonna need
to see that order.

384
00:18:46,781 --> 00:18:48,582
You should've
received it already.

385
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:50,250
Well, we didn't.
Like you said, we've had

386
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:51,985
a rough day.
We were hit by an EMP

387
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,720
and most of our systems
are still down.

388
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,322
Ms. O'Brian, we don't
have a lot of time.

389
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:58,558
Look, I can't let you take her
unless I see the order.

390
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,960
So, you can wait.

391
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:01,595
Might take an hour, maybe more.

392
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:11,905
Thank you.

393
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:13,006
I'm sorry to be
so by-the-book.

394
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:14,240
It's-- I was
just promoted

395
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:16,776
to this position,
and I just want to make sure

396
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:19,312
that I dot all my I's
and cross the T's.
Right.

397
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:24,651
Satisfied?

398
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:25,852
Yeah, great.

399
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,059
Good morning, Ms. Walsh.

400
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:34,327
My name is Mark Bledsoe.

401
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:35,729
The president's
ordered your transfer

402
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:36,963
to an off-site
facility.

403
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:39,032
You've been designated
an enemy combatant

404
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
by special
executive order.

405
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,769
What do you mean
off-site facility?

406
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,437
It's a secure location.

407
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,006
Chloe, what the hell
is going on?

408
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:47,007
Where's Bauer?

409
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:48,475
Where's my immunity deal?

410
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,843
Just do what he says, Dana.

411
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,378
We can do it the hard way
or the easy way--

412
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:53,113
your choice--
but you're leaving here with us.

413
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,115
Chloe, don't let them do this.
Let's go.

414
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:57,484
Please, they're gonna kill me.
Chloe...

415
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:58,718
Chloe, please.

416
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,020
Chloe!

417
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:05,892
Thank you
for your cooperation.

418
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:24,244
(sighs)

419
00:20:43,898 --> 00:20:45,432
All right, let's get units
on these two intersections.

420
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:46,833
(cell phone ringing)
Have them run car checks

421
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:48,134
on anyone
passing through.

422
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:49,302
I'll contact
Transit Police,

423
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,937
see about getting these
subways locked down.

424
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,841
Chloe, we're still in the middle
of a grid search here.

425
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:55,909
No sign of Jack.

426
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:57,577
I just talked to him;
he called me.

427
00:20:57,645 --> 00:20:59,879
What?
He wants me to
help him get to Dana.

428
00:20:59,947 --> 00:21:01,214
What did you
tell him?

429
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:02,882
I told him that she's
being transferred to

430
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,185
an off-site facility and that
I would give him the address.

431
00:21:05,252 --> 00:21:07,687
And I almost did.

432
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:08,688
But I can't.

433
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:09,889
I'm under presidential orders.

434
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:11,958
Besides, I don't think
he's right.

435
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:14,094
He's not thinking clearly.

436
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:17,297
We have to find him
before he gets himself killed.

437
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,067
What if Jack is
thinking clearly?

438
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:22,736
If he's right,
if the president's lying,

439
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:23,903
and this conspiracy
is real,

440
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:25,905
we might be on the
wrong side of this.

441
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:28,341
Bottom line is, we were given
orders to bring him in.

442
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:29,876
That's what we're gonna do.

443
00:21:29,944 --> 00:21:30,944
All right.

444
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:45,692
I need everyone's
attention, please.

445
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,794
We're mobilizing a sting
operation in the field

446
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:49,729
to be led by
Agent Ortiz.

447
00:21:49,797 --> 00:21:51,865
The target is Jack Bauer.

448
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:56,803
Let's get to work.

449
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,234
Did you get what I need?

450
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:37,370
Nice to see you
again, too, Jack.

451
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,205
Did you get it or not?

452
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:41,407
Yeah, it's right over there.

453
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:47,447
Everything you asked
for-- right there.

454
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:51,417
I've been checking
the scanners.

455
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,353
All the agencies
are looking for you.

456
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,587
But nobody will say
what you did.

457
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,923
It's not about what I did.

458
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:59,292
They're afraid
of what I'm gonna do.

459
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,661
I don't know what
they did to you, Jack,

460
00:23:01,729 --> 00:23:03,630
but it must have
been pretty bad.

461
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:05,265
I got to make a phone call.

462
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:10,503
O'Brian.
Hey, it's me.

463
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:12,505
You find out where
they're taking Dana?

464
00:23:12,573 --> 00:23:15,008
Jack, I want you to think
about what you're doing.

465
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:16,509
Just give me the
address, Chloe.

466
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,111
It's not too late
to turn yourself in.

467
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:20,380
Are you going to give
me the address or not?

468
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:27,787
Dana is being taken to a safe
house in the Middle Village.

469
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:32,125
It's an industrial laundry
at 141 Juniper Valley Road.

470
00:23:34,495 --> 00:23:36,929
Okay, that's about ten minutes
from here. I'll leave now.

471
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:38,231
Call me when you arrive.

472
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:40,199
I'm working on pulling up
the interior specs.

473
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,001
I'll be able to guide you in.

474
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:44,237
Chloe, thanks. I know
I've put you in a spot.

475
00:23:44,305 --> 00:23:45,371
Yeah.

476
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:46,906
I'll get back to you.

477
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:54,080
I need you to stay here.

478
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:56,115
I might need you later.

479
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:57,884
You can't come back
here again.

480
00:23:57,951 --> 00:23:59,052
Besides that,
we're even now.

481
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,753
I'll let you know
when we're even.

482
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,924
Jim, please.

483
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:06,659
I need your help, okay?

484
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:19,972
Did O'Brian brief you?
Yes, sir.

485
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,507
We're drawing Bauer
to this location

486
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:23,142
where he thinks Dana
Walsh is being held.

487
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,445
It's an industrial laundry
the DEA seized a year ago.

488
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:26,913
CTU's been using it
as a safe house,

489
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,481
but there's no way
Jack can know this.

490
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,149
Understand, Bauer's
a highly skilled operative.

491
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:32,652
So we need to make everything
as credible as possible.

492
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,620
He'll be expecting sentries,

493
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:35,655
so Beck, you're out front.

494
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:36,789
Greer, you take the back.

495
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:38,691
You two will be
stationed inside.

496
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,992
Everyone stays out of sight

497
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,427
until Jack's
between our choke points.

498
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:43,930
We do the takedown when, and
only when I give the order.

499
00:24:43,997 --> 00:24:46,766
We get this right,
we take Jack by surprise

500
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,368
before he has a chance
to fight back.

501
00:24:48,435 --> 00:24:49,602
Gear up.

502
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,870
Cole.

503
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:52,338
Jack just called.
He's ten minutes out.

504
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:54,540
What's your status?
We're on-site and getting ready.

505
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:57,543
Remember, nonlethal force.

506
00:24:57,611 --> 00:24:59,278
Look, I don't want anything
to happen to Jack either,

507
00:24:59,346 --> 00:25:02,115
but I can't tell my men
not to defend themselves

508
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:04,517
if their lives
are in danger.
You know that.

509
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:05,818
He's calling me
when he arrives.

510
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:07,520
I'll let you know
when that happens.

511
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:09,355
All right.

512
00:25:09,423 --> 00:25:11,324
Let's go, guys, let's go.

513
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:15,995
Madam President.

514
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:19,665
I have a final draft
of your statement.

515
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:23,002
I think it best for now to cite
President Hassan's death

516
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,304
as the reason
for your withdrawing.

517
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:28,074
Then after the dust has settled,

518
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:30,543
we can start prosecuting the
Russians through back channels.

519
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:34,013
Ethan, I've chosen
not to withdraw

520
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:35,581
from the peace agreement.

521
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:40,253
And I'm keeping the press
conference as scheduled.

522
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,588
I don't understand.

523
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,258
Dana Walsh is being moved
from CTU

524
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:46,759
to a private detention facility.

525
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:49,228
She'll be off the grid,

526
00:25:49,296 --> 00:25:51,697
out of Jack Bauer's reach.

527
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:54,734
I've authorized a private
interrogation team

528
00:25:54,802 --> 00:25:57,770
to acquire the evidence.

529
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,607
Acquire the evidence?

530
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:04,410
Once we have it,
she'll be irrelevant.

531
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:05,711
(scoffs)

532
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,381
Keeping the truth
from Jack Bauer is one thing--

533
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:12,018
but authorizing
the illegal detention

534
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,519
and torture of a prisoner?

535
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,121
How far are you willing to go

536
00:26:15,189 --> 00:26:16,322
to protect this lie?

537
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,424
As far as necessary
to preserve this treaty.

538
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:20,560
It's vital to the security

539
00:26:20,627 --> 00:26:22,628
of this nation.

540
00:26:22,696 --> 00:26:23,930
And what I am doing

541
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,631
is for the greater good.

542
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,069
This was Logan's idea,
wasn't it?

543
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:33,573
The decision was mine.

544
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,209
And I stand behind it.

545
00:26:36,276 --> 00:26:39,045
Now listen--

546
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:41,581
please listen to
what I'm saying.

547
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:43,082
I think this is about more

548
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,084
than the grÃater good.

549
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:47,487
I think your presidency

550
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:50,690
has cost you your marriage
and your children.

551
00:26:50,757 --> 00:26:52,058
And you think
that this treaty

552
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,560
will somehow redeem
that loss...

553
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:55,628
Ethan, that's enough.

554
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:57,964
Now, listen, you've
made this personal,

555
00:26:58,031 --> 00:26:59,565
and you've lost your way.

556
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:01,968
I've known you long
enough to see that.

557
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:04,937
I implore you--

558
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:07,473
take a step back
and look at this clearly.

559
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,775
I said that's enough.

560
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:11,944
I've explained
my reasons.

561
00:27:12,012 --> 00:27:16,015
I appreciate your objections,
but the debate is over.

562
00:27:18,318 --> 00:27:21,220
So, let's move on.

563
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:28,528
Madam President,

564
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:34,600
unless you stop what's
being done in your name,

565
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:37,937
I can't be a part
of this any longer.

566
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:41,173
Don't worry, I'll...
I'll keep it to myself.

567
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:44,644
Um, I'll cite my health as
the reason for my resignation.

568
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:47,880
After all, I'm here
against doctor's orders.

569
00:27:47,948 --> 00:27:51,684
Ethan, please.

570
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:53,953
We are almost there!

571
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:56,122
You-you can't just abandon me
like this.

572
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:58,424
I'm not abandoning you.

573
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:02,094
I'm listening to my conscience.

574
00:28:02,162 --> 00:28:05,097
Anyway,

575
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:07,433
you've got Charles Logan now.

576
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:10,169
Only room for one of us.

577
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:14,640
Madam President.

578
00:28:17,411 --> 00:28:19,579
(door opens, then closes)

579
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:36,386
Look at me.
My hand is shaking.

580
00:28:36,454 --> 00:28:38,455
I would be concerned
if it weren't.

581
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:40,157
What you've agreed
to take on

582
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:42,225
is not something
that could be treated lightly.

583
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:44,294
I keep thinking
that people will accuse me

584
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:46,229
of grabbing for power.

585
00:28:46,297 --> 00:28:48,765
Exploiting my husband's death.

586
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:51,435
Which couldn't be further
from the truth.

587
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:55,372
Still, some people may
perceive it that way.

588
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,041
Remember what
father said?

589
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:00,043
He said the best
way to dispel

590
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:03,880
public misperception
is to address it directly.

591
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,684
Good.

592
00:29:07,752 --> 00:29:10,053
I will take his advice.

593
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,623
Jamot, will you
excuse us?

594
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:15,392
Of course.

595
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,461
I just need to remind you
that the other delegates

596
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:19,463
are expecting you in 20 minutes.

597
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,298
I'll be ready.

598
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,300
Miss Kayla.

599
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:25,635
Jamot.

600
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:30,941
Mother, I'm sorry
for being so selfish earlier.

601
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,476
You were afraid.

602
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,479
You lost your father today.

603
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,547
And you were afraid
of losing me as well.

604
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:41,885
I still am.

605
00:29:46,023 --> 00:29:49,426
This peace agreement
Father died for--

606
00:29:49,494 --> 00:29:53,663
how can so many people be
so violently against it?

607
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:58,435
Some people are so invested
in their fear and hatred

608
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:02,072
that peace is the most
threatening thing

609
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,608
they can imagine.

610
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,363
Chloe, you still there?

611
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:27,597
CHLOE (over comm):
Yes.

612
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,599
I'm at the site.

613
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,368
I only see one man out front.

614
00:30:31,436 --> 00:30:33,003
I found a schematic
of the building.

615
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,972
There's a side entrance to the
north of the loading dock.

616
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,108
I got it.

617
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,143
It looks like it's out of
the sentry's line of sight.

618
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,512
According to
the schematic,

619
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,915
there's an enclosed room
at the southwest corner
of the building.

620
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:46,349
That must be where
they're keeping Dana.

621
00:30:46,417 --> 00:30:48,552
Copy that. Chloe, I got go.
I'm moving in.

622
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:13,143
Cole, he's going into the
loading dock entrance

623
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,311
heading towards
the takedown point.

624
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:16,913
COLE:
I see him.

625
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:19,015
Hopkins, Lee,

626
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,951
Jack's moving into the building
and headed toward your position.

627
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:21,985
Stay sharp.

628
00:31:22,053 --> 00:31:23,553
Copy that. We're ready.

629
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:53,383
(clattering)

630
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:10,934
(taps twice)

631
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:27,217
Chloe, it's Jack.

632
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:28,985
I got a visual
on the room.

633
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:30,153
No hostiles in sight.

634
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:31,721
I'm going to try
and grab her.

635
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,423
Be careful, Jack.

636
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,091
Okay, copy that.

637
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:36,493
(panting)

638
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:47,737
(grunts)

639
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:55,579
Cole, he's almost
at the takedown point.

640
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:57,747
Copy that.
On my way.

641
00:32:57,815 --> 00:32:59,916
Hopkins, we're moving in.

642
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:30,814
Son of a bitch.

643
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:44,628
Put your weapons down!

644
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:45,862
Put your weapons down now!

645
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,263
I can't do that, Jack!

646
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:49,232
Cole, tell them to put
their weapons down or
I will kill him!

647
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,934
COLE:
Put that gun down now!

648
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:52,669
Put your weapons down now!

649
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:57,007
Now!
Put 'em down!
Put 'em down!

650
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:01,144
Tell your men to get down.

651
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:03,346
Do it.
Get on the ground.

652
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:04,347
Now!

653
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:06,683
Cole, slowly advance towards me.

654
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:12,422
Kick the guns over
in my direction.

655
00:34:16,861 --> 00:34:18,695
Get out of my line of sight.

656
00:34:18,763 --> 00:34:20,163
How did you know?

657
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:22,499
I know Chloe.

658
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:24,334
You're gonna call CTU.

659
00:34:24,402 --> 00:34:25,735
You're gonna tell her
that her plan worked,

660
00:34:25,803 --> 00:34:27,604
and you've got me locked down
and ready for transport.

661
00:34:27,672 --> 00:34:29,639
Put it on speaker.

662
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:34,277
CHLOE (on speakerphone):
O'Brian.

663
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:35,812
Chloe, it's Cole.

664
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,514
Cole, go ahead.
What's happening?

665
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:39,149
We've got Jack.
He's locked down.

666
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:40,283
Is he okay?

667
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:41,351
He's fine.

668
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:45,221
What about your men?

669
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:46,690
They're all right.

670
00:34:46,757 --> 00:34:49,325
I know I should feel relieved,
but I just feel worse.

671
00:34:49,393 --> 00:34:51,227
Like you said, Chloe,

672
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:52,996
it's for his own good.

673
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:56,032
I'll talk to him
when he gets here.

674
00:34:59,203 --> 00:35:02,405
Lock your men down.
What are you
planning on doing?

675
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:03,573
Lock 'em down!

676
00:35:24,358 --> 00:35:26,159
All right, Jack,
what now?

677
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:28,361
JACK: Follow me.

678
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:37,670
Take a seat.

679
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:42,809
You're why
I'm here, Cole.

680
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:44,510
I knew Chloe
would send you.

681
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:46,279
You're the only
reason I risked it.

682
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:47,547
What do you want with me?

683
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:49,949
I need you to help me
gain access to Dana Walsh.

684
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,417
I know you well
enough, Cole,

685
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:52,819
that I know you
don't want

686
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,320
to be a part of
this cover-up.

687
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,655
And right now
President Taylor

688
00:35:55,722 --> 00:35:57,824
wants the peace agreement
to move forward so badly,

689
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:59,659
she's willing to lie about
the Russian's involvement

690
00:35:59,726 --> 00:36:00,760
in today's terrorist attack,

691
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:01,994
and I can't let
that happen.

692
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:03,863
How can you be sure
the President is lying?

693
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:06,165
Because she told me to my face!

694
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,767
She said the agreement
was more important

695
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,302
than the Russians
could have done today.

696
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,369
Why the hell do you think

697
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,904
she came down
to CTU to talk to me?

698
00:36:11,972 --> 00:36:14,140
She didn't want me
to give the evidence
from Dana.

699
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,476
She wanted to shut me up
and lock me down

700
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:18,811
Damn it, Cole, your hands
aren't clean in this.

701
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:20,913
You protected Dana
while she was

702
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:22,215
operating for
the Russians.

703
00:36:22,282 --> 00:36:24,217
You lied for her,
which enabled the Russians

704
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:26,853
to provide nuclear materials
to Hassan's opposition.

705
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,288
They facilitated his
assassination and what,

706
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,424
you lost four
of your men today, right?

707
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:33,826
I am giving you
an opportunity to
make this right,

708
00:36:33,894 --> 00:36:36,095
to make the people that are
responsible for everything

709
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:37,230
that happened today
accountable.

710
00:36:39,766 --> 00:36:42,301
You got a decision to make.

711
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,003
Now, what if you're wrong?

712
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:45,805
I'm not.

713
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:54,313
Look, I can't do
this on my own.

714
00:37:00,254 --> 00:37:01,754
Your call.

715
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:15,701
Chloe says she's in a safe house
a few miles from here.

716
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:17,036
We'll notify CTU
about your men

717
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:18,604
within the next two hours.

718
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:21,541
Right now it's imperative that
they think I took you hostage.

719
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,643
Get up!

720
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:31,417
<i>REPORTER:
We've been hearing speculation</i>

721
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:33,085
<i>that Dalia Hassan
will be making</i>

722
00:37:33,153 --> 00:37:34,320
<i>her first official statement</i>

723
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,055
<i>as the provisional head
of state</i>

724
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,057
<i>of the Islamic Republic
of Kamistan.</i>

725
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,760
<i>Earlier, we spoke to a UN
official who confirmed</i>

726
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,162
<i>that under the IRK's
constitution,</i>

727
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,797
<i>Mrs. Hassan would have
the authority</i>

728
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:46,866
<i>to sign this treaty.
Ethan! (turns TV off)</i>

729
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:51,437
I, uh, I heard about
your resignation.

730
00:37:51,505 --> 00:37:53,639
I'm glad to see you're putting
your health first.

731
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:55,274
We all just want

732
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:56,842
you to get well.

733
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,479
I'm leaving
because of you.

734
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:03,249
Because of what
you've started here.

735
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:06,152
You've deliberately
played this out

736
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,188
to maneuver the President
into a corner.

737
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:14,160
I brought the Russians back
to the table.

738
00:38:14,228 --> 00:38:16,329
But you didn't tell her
how you were doing it.

739
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:17,396
She didn't ask.

740
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,765
Because she knew
it was best for her

741
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,634
to preserve her own deniability.

742
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:24,704
The President knows
exactly what she's doing.

743
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:26,138
She's smart.

744
00:38:26,206 --> 00:38:29,041
She's smarter than either of us
ever gave her credit for.

745
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:30,343
I see.

746
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,145
So, uh, you just
provided counsel.

747
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:35,648
That's right.

748
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:39,185
Well, let me counsel you.

749
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:42,188
Stop this cover-up
before it's too late.

750
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:44,490
This peace is no good.

751
00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,359
There's too much blood
on this treaty

752
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:47,727
for it ever to hold.

753
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:50,396
We've both been in this game
a long time,

754
00:38:50,464 --> 00:38:52,231
and we both know damn well

755
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:54,700
that every treaty ever written
had blood on it!

756
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:56,902
Not like this.

757
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,838
You got Allison so far
into the woods,

758
00:38:58,905 --> 00:39:01,040
she'll never be able
to find her way out.

759
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:04,710
She wasn't like you.

760
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:06,712
Wasn't like any politician
I've ever known.

761
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,114
That's right.

762
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:10,750
She's finally got some teeth.

763
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:12,018
You listen to me.

764
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:14,120
If she suffers for this,

765
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:17,490
I will come after you
with everything I have.

766
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:19,859
You're threatening me.

767
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:21,927
I'm warning you, Charles.

768
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:24,697
Do you need to sit down?

769
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:27,667
(scoffs) I'm fine.

770
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:29,502
Well, then, if you don't mind,

771
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:32,605
Allison will be taking
the podium any second now.

772
00:39:32,673 --> 00:39:34,340
(turns TV on)

773
00:39:34,408 --> 00:39:36,375
Get some rest, Ethan.

774
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:38,844
You need it.

775
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:53,893
(Dana gasping)

776
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:12,878
You told Bauer
you have evidence.

777
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:15,081
I need to know
where it is.

778
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,649
Come on, Miss Walsh.

779
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:17,850
You know the deal.

780
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,719
The sooner you tell me,
the easier it'll go.

781
00:40:19,786 --> 00:40:24,390
Please, I have got
nothing to tell you.

782
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,725
There is no evidence.

783
00:40:25,792 --> 00:40:27,827
If that's the way

784
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:29,829
you want
to play it, fine.

785
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,468
(gasping)

786
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:39,739
PRESS SECRETARY:
Ladies and gentlemen,
no questions will be taken

787
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:42,775
until after
this morning's address.

788
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:45,177
Madam President, I want

789
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:47,646
to thank you for
your thoughts
on my speech.

790
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:49,382
They were very helpful.

791
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,750
I'm glad.

792
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:53,619
My husband would have been
grateful for the support

793
00:40:53,687 --> 00:40:55,788
that you have given me.

794
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:57,523
Thank you.

795
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,292
Ladies and gentlemen,

796
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,329
the President
of the United States.

797
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:12,138
My fellow Americans and friends
in foreign lands,

798
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:15,174
I speak to you this morning
with a heavy heart.

799
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:19,478
The brutal and cowardly murder
of President Omar Hassan was

800
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:22,748
a blow to every civilized person
in the world

801
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:25,384
and a stark reminder
that the pursuit of peace

802
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:28,254
sometimes comes
with a steep price.

803
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:32,458
President Hassan understood
that, yet still had

804
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:37,096
the fortitude to pursue a better
tomorrow against so many odds.

805
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:41,033
I join with the American people
in mourning him

806
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:42,701
and every other innocent life

807
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:45,704
that was lost
during this crisis.

808
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,973
But let it be known here and now

809
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:53,012
their sacrifice will not have
been in vain.

810
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:57,183
Peace must and will prevail
no matter the cost.

811
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,760
No matter the cost,
no matter the compromises.

812
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:11,130
We have waited too long
and worked too hard,

813
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:13,599
to allow this opportunity
to pass us by.

814
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:17,403
And that is why in Omar Hassan's
name, I am choosing

815
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,272
to move forward with this
historic summit.

816
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,476
One that was made possible
by the shared hopes and ideals

817
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:24,844
of the IRK leadership,

818
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:25,978
(gasping)

819
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:28,781
and will continue
under its new leader--

820
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:34,153
a woman of unparalleled courage
and grace,

821
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,355
who has been chosen
by her people

822
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:39,325
to carry on the mantle
of her late husband...

823
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,694
Dalia Hassan.

824
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,695
