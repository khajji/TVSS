1
00:00:12,477 --> 00:00:16,179
u know him,
don't you?

2
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:19,248
Mr. Prady, we are in the middle
of a national security crisis.

3
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:21,683
I have to go back to my desk.

4
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:23,910
Okay, perhaps if I talk
to your supervisor,

5
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:26,028
he could let you
take a few minutes off.

6
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,810
It's over.

7
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:31,364
The parole officer looking
for Kevin is here in CTU.

8
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,306
He's after the raw feed.
I'm gonna give it to him, Cole.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,052
Why don't you wait?

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,324
Do you hear me?

11
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:38,937
He knows everything;
he'll go to Hastings.

12
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,756
Do what he says and
you won't get hurt.

13
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,361
Who is he?

14
00:00:44,432 --> 00:00:46,270
Another traitor?

15
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:51,288
The only traitor is your father.

16
00:00:51,356 --> 00:00:53,563
We haven't disabled the American
radiological detectors yet.

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,132
Where are the nuclear rods?

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,597
They're still outside the city.

19
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:57,888
How will you bring
the rods to me?

20
00:00:57,956 --> 00:00:59,618
It's been taken care of.

21
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,557
Let's go!

22
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,893
Stop them!

23
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:08,303
Tarin, no!

24
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,506
Oh!

25
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:13,081
Mr. Hastings, you better
take this; it's Kayla Hassan!

26
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,420
She's in a car; she's escaped.

27
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:16,991
They tried to kill me,
but Tarin got me out.

28
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:18,259
They shot him.

29
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,265
He told me to call CTU!

30
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,402
Ms. Hassan,
my name is Jack Bauer.

31
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,807
We need to know
where you were being held.

32
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,477
We got the location, Jack.

33
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,246
Targets are heading
north on Orchard.

34
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:31,447
They're getting into an SUV.

35
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:32,815
We ID'd one of the targets
as Tarin Faroush; Kayla said

36
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:35,650
he sacrificed himself to
save her, but he's still alive.

37
00:01:35,718 --> 00:01:38,352
Chloe, the car that Tarin
got into-- where is it now?

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,891
Taking the first exit
off the Williamsburg Bridge.

39
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,125
You've gotta put
Hastings on now.

40
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:44,158
I'm on, Jack.

41
00:01:44,226 --> 00:01:45,723
You cannot let Kayla Hassan in.

42
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,857
The terrorists faked her escape.

43
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:48,292
They wanted to get her to CTU.

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,160
She's in the tunnel.

45
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:50,995
Stop the car!
Whoa, whoa!

46
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:51,829
Put your hands where
we can see them!

47
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,699
It's an EMP!

48
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:00,610
What the hell's happening?

49
00:02:00,678 --> 00:02:02,179
Contact NSA.

50
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,081
Terrorists just took down CTU.

51
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:34,112
Central comm node
is totally fried.

52
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,148
Reroute to peripherals.
I already tried that.

53
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:37,649
Try again, Chloe.

54
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,351
Sir, I can't give you
the status on the drones.

55
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,920
Everything's down.
Which means what?

56
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:42,956
That they're going to fall
out of the sky? Not yet.

57
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:45,424
The nav systems should
default to autopilot.

58
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,460
They'll circle until
they run out of gas.

59
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:48,895
But we've lost all
aerial surveillance

60
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,764
and radiological
detection capability.

61
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,332
Basically.

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,735
All right.

63
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:57,038
Agent Skaggs is heading
outside on foot.

64
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:59,573
Have him contact FAA with the
drones' default flight paths.

65
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,275
They need to be taken down

66
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:02,710
before they crash
into populated areas.

67
00:03:02,778 --> 00:03:04,445
Yes, sir.

68
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:10,051
Are you okay?

69
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,420
Am I okay?

70
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,956
An EMP just took us
out of play

71
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:15,324
and now we're
dropping the ball

72
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:17,259
on a radiological threat
against New York City.

73
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,762
So, no, Chloe,
I am not okay.

74
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,131
And I won't be until
we find those rods.

75
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,467
Sir, Kayla Hassan is
finished in Medical.

76
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:26,136
Okay, I need her
taken back to the UN

77
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:27,638
so she can be evacuated
with her family.

78
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,574
Okay, I'll do it.
No, I'll do it.

79
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:31,242
I need you to assemble
division heads.

80
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,978
Tell them that we have
a briefing in ten minutes.

81
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,047
Tell them to come with full
damage assessment reports.

82
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:40,218
Sir, their systems are down.
They can't generate reports.

83
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:42,420
Then tell them to use a pen
and a damn legal pad.

84
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,761
Phil Holden.

85
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,228
Phil, it's Jack Bauer.

86
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:53,826
Ah, Jack, I heard you
were back in play.

87
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,259
Phil, look, I don't have
a lot of time,

88
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:56,727
I need you to listen to me
carefully.

89
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,529
Go ahead. There's an IRK
splinter cell trying to smuggle

90
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:00,231
weapons-grade uranium
into the city.

91
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:02,500
Yeah, I just read
the threat assessment.

92
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:04,835
It says you've got
a CTU team tracking them.

93
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,136
We did, but we lost them.

94
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,672
CTU just got hit by some
electromagnetic pulse device,

95
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,208
wiped out all
our visual and comm.

96
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:12,409
I want you to try
and locate our hostiles

97
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:13,844
with one of your satellites.

98
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:16,013
We don't have any birds
over the metro area, Jack.

99
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,183
All aerial surveillance
was being routed through CTU.

100
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,985
What about traffic cams?

101
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,619
I can try.

102
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:24,952
Give me the hostiles'
last location.

103
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,617
They got off the
Williamsburg Bridge

104
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:28,217
at the West Broadway/
Roebling Street exit.

105
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:29,485
They're driving a gray SUV.

106
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,652
I'll call you
if we get a hit.

107
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:33,085
Phil, I also need you
to shut down

108
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:34,586
all bridge and tunnel traffic
into the city.

109
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:37,355
Thanks.
Done.

110
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:41,991
Where are you going?
NSA's shutting

111
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:43,592
all bridge and tunnel traffic
into the city.

112
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,994
There's only one way
for them to get in.

113
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:47,062
Across the East River.

114
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,497
That's right.

115
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:15,150
CTU is down.

116
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:16,485
You have confirmation?

117
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,787
I have a real-time uplink
to the power grid.

118
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:22,390
It recorded a pulse surge
and now nothing.

119
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:25,392
CTU is blind,
deaf, and dumb.

120
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,560
Have you secured this area?
As you ordered.

121
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,534
You've done well, Ali.

122
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:36,869
Thank you, sir.

123
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,470
Load the rods into the Zodiac.

124
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:53,120
I realize this was very
difficult for you,

125
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:58,492
but Hassan's daughter
was a necessary sacrifice.

126
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,127
Using her was the only way
for us

127
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,628
to get the rods into the city.

128
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:23,817
Agents Beck and Henderson
will escort you back to the UN.

129
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,285
First, tell me
what's going on.

130
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:27,120
Agent Beck will brief you
on the way.

131
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:29,222
Now, once you're there, we need
you to do something for us.

132
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,893
Your father gave us a file
of IRK covert agents

133
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,261
operating in this country.

134
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:35,428
We need you to identify

135
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,196
the men working
with Tarin.

136
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:41,333
I'm not doing anything until
you tell me what's happening.

137
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,938
The car you drove here
was rigged

138
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,740
with an EMP device.

139
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:53,443
It's a pulse weapon designed
to disarm electronics.

140
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,211
It's crashed all our systems.

141
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,146
I don't understand.

142
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,014
Tarin put me in that car.

143
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:01,083
He used you, Ms. Hassan.

144
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,118
He staged your escape,

145
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:04,785
put you in that car,
and sent you back here.

146
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:08,221
But he was shot.

147
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:09,656
I saw him.

148
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,057
He is alive.

149
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:16,127
We spotted him
a few minutes ago.

150
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,929
I know it's a lot
to take in,

151
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,263
but you need to go
with these agents

152
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,866
back to the UN and start
looking through those files.

153
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:24,501
You've seen
these terrorists.

154
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,336
If you can help us
to ID them,

155
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,170
we stand a chance
of finding them

156
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,038
before they carry out
their attack.

157
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,246
Ahman has prepared the bomb.

158
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,147
It'll be short work

159
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:49,316
once we get the rods
across the river.

160
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:51,421
MAN (over radio):
A vehicle is coming.

161
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,058
Where is it?

162
00:07:53,126 --> 00:07:54,695
It's coming from the east.

163
00:07:57,398 --> 00:07:59,933
Black SUV, no markings.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,002
How many men have you got covering?
Three.

165
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:06,539
Wait until the SUV's
in the range,

166
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,307
then take them out.

167
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,276
Ali! Come!

168
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,841
Hold on.
What is it?

169
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,476
Thought I caught something
in the infrared.

170
00:08:41,544 --> 00:08:43,544
Heat source down by the water.

171
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:44,879
Now it's gone.

172
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,380
See if NYPD can get
some units down here.

173
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,182
I'll contact NSA,
see if they've got

174
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:49,783
surveillance of the area.

175
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,425
That's weird.

176
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:02,026
I got four bars, but the
call's not going through.

177
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:03,428
Me neither.

178
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,702
We're being jammed.

179
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,604
They're here. Damn it!

180
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,575
Get down now!

181
00:09:37,094 --> 00:09:38,261
(engine cranking)
Come on!

182
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,763
The engine's down.
Pass your weapons up front!

183
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:45,233
Cole, I want you to take
the sniper to your north.

184
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,201
Maintain coverage
until we're clear.

185
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:48,867
I want both of you
to get ready to unload

186
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,735
all the weapons from
the back, you ready?

187
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:51,969
Yes, sir.
Let's go, go, go!

188
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,679
How did they know
where to look for us?

189
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:08,714
They must have followed us
from the vault.

190
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:12,317
Cole, use your infrared!

191
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:13,718
Call out the snipers
as you see them!

192
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:20,956
Ten o'clock, high and low!

193
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:26,527
I'm counting four men.

194
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:28,462
I recognize one
from the hospital.

195
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,230
He was the one
that talked Marcos

196
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:31,931
out of detonating the vest.

197
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,901
It's Jack Bauer.

198
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,470
Ex-CTU. He was one
of their best agents.

199
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,640
Nine o'clock low!

200
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,280
We can still cross
with the rods.

201
00:10:52,684 --> 00:10:55,953
As long as we're certain Bauer
and his men cannot warn anyone.

202
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,287
It's not a risk.

203
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:59,255
We started jamming
their communications

204
00:10:59,323 --> 00:11:01,991
as soon as they were in sight.

205
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,660
Now they can't leave.

206
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:06,528
Not with the snipers
in position.

207
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:09,197
Good.

208
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,165
Make sure none of them
get out alive.

209
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:13,100
I'll call you
when we're across the river.

210
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,169
Let's move.

211
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:34,082
Reloading!

212
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:41,290
I've got two men,
leaving the dock in a boat.

213
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:42,359
One of them is Tarin Faroush.

214
00:11:42,427 --> 00:11:43,694
They're carrying a box

215
00:11:43,762 --> 00:11:45,362
the right size and shape
for the rods, Jack.

216
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,932
Copy that!

217
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:52,335
Went out of my range.

218
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:53,303
We got to notify NYPD

219
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:54,737
before they cross the river.

220
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,172
I tried cell
and radio frequencies.

221
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,239
They're all jammed.

222
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:02,943
There's a call box mounted
on the building. Ten o'clock.

223
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:07,580
It's gotta be a hard line.

224
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:08,647
We can call from there.

225
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:09,982
How do we get there?

226
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,818
The way the shooters are
positioned, they'll pick us off

227
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:13,220
one by one
as soon as we step out

228
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,689
from behind the vehicle.

229
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:16,557
Our vehicle's armored.

230
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,259
We can pull the panels,
use them for coverage.

231
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:21,094
Start now!

232
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,465
Eleven o'clock, Jack!

233
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,019
Casualty reports are
also coming in.

234
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,587
Three fatalities
from the bomb blast

235
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:39,922
in the motor pool tunnel.

236
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,123
Damn it.

237
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:43,125
What else?
Minor injuries for the most part.

238
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:45,027
Agent McCallan was burned
in a small electrical fire.

239
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:46,295
How is he?

240
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,496
He's going to be okay.

241
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:48,697
But with our infirmary down

242
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:50,832
we had to transport him
to the local hospital.

243
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,634
Says here we have
flooding.

244
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:53,868
Yes, sir, the pumps
are down,

245
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,369
and certain sections
of the basement

246
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:56,870
have about six inches of water.

247
00:12:56,938 --> 00:12:58,871
Well, can you stop it
or are we all going to drown?

248
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,772
The repair crew's
working on it, sir.

249
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,507
Okay, give me another update
in 20 minutes.

250
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,442
Excuse me, sir?

251
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,377
Yes, what is it?
A team from NSA is here.

252
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:08,011
NSA?

253
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,202
Brian Hastings,

254
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,505
director of CTU.

255
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,677
Frank Haynam, senior engineer

256
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:26,913
at the New York
field office.

257
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,750
I understand you've
been hit by an EMP.

258
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,286
Yeah, that's right.
I hope that you're here

259
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:32,057
to help because we can
damn well use it.

260
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,293
We are indeed.

261
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:34,528
Brought my best men with me.

262
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,196
I thought we'd start
by restoring

263
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:38,130
your aerial surveillance
and communications.

264
00:13:38,198 --> 00:13:39,798
So, where's your server room?
It's downstairs.

265
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,536
I'll let my maintenance team
know what you're here.

266
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,708
You boys can put
your heads together.

267
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,412
I prefer to work
with my own people.

268
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,385
There's no one more familiar
with this facility than my crew.

269
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,987
Not exactly true.

270
00:13:51,054 --> 00:13:53,258
I was part of the group
that helped design this place.

271
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,329
Can't say I'm thrilled
with what you've done with it.

272
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,901
How did you find out
we were hit?

273
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,103
Jack Bauer called our
regional headquarters.

274
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:03,471
Told us your situation.

275
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:05,806
Bauer was pursuing the men
behind this attack

276
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:07,341
when we lost contact with him.

277
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:08,843
Do you know
where he is?

278
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:10,844
NSA's been trying
to call him back.

279
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,145
He's not answering.

280
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:13,212
They're not sure why.

281
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:16,316
Right this way.

282
00:14:27,907 --> 00:14:29,846
Chloe, we're supposed to be
writing damage assessments.

283
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:30,949
What are you doing?

284
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,050
There might be away to tap in,

285
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:33,183
get some of our systems
up and running.

286
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,485
Really? How?

287
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:35,653
I haven't figured it out yet,

288
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,121
and I won't if you
keep talking to me.

289
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,190
All right, people,
listen up.

290
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:45,431
This is Frank Haynam,

291
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:47,900
senior engineer of the NSA's
New York field office.

292
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,969
Now, he and his team
are going to help us

293
00:14:50,037 --> 00:14:53,640
restore aerial surveillance
and communications.

294
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,709
So we can get back
to tracking the nuclear rods.

295
00:14:56,777 --> 00:15:00,313
They also brought along a fresh
batch of cell phones.

296
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,970
Give them your
full cooperation.

297
00:15:02,037 --> 00:15:03,849
Whatever they need,
make it happen.

298
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:06,618
Now, we have been knocked down,
but I promise you,

299
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:08,853
we are going
to get back up.

300
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,154
Let's get to work.

301
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:13,691
Agent Blochard, can you get
Mr. Haynam and his team

302
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:15,159
down to the server room?

303
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:19,096
Has NSA heard
from Jack?

304
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:20,330
Yeah. They spoke with Jack

305
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:21,998
and his team
about 20 minutes ago,

306
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,166
but haven't been able
to reach him since.

307
00:15:23,234 --> 00:15:24,634
Why not?
They don't know.

308
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:25,868
He could be in some
kind of trouble.

309
00:15:25,936 --> 00:15:27,636
You need to send men
out looking for him.

310
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:29,305
Even if I had agents available,

311
00:15:29,372 --> 00:15:30,506
I wouldn't know
where to send them.

312
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:32,074
Jack was heading
toward the East River.

313
00:15:32,142 --> 00:15:34,176
That's four square miles
of real estate--

314
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:35,811
too much for me
to commit resources

315
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:36,845
that we don't have.

316
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,846
He was pursuing the terrorists.

317
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:40,814
He's our best chance
at stopping this attack.

318
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,448
We're going to focus
on our efforts here.

319
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:43,682
When we get our eyes
and ears back,

320
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,718
we'll find them.
It might be too late.

321
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:48,988
If anyone can take care
of themselves, it's Jack.

322
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,156
Now, I want you to go
to the server room,

323
00:15:51,224 --> 00:15:53,124
make sure Haynam has everything
he needs.

324
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:03,999
Worse than I thought.

325
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,434
90% of these components
are fried.

326
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:07,102
We're going to have
to swap them out

327
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,170
and install new server boards.

328
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:13,974
Mr. Haynam.

329
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,077
I'm Chloe O'Brian.

330
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:18,578
Mr. Hastings wanted me to make
sure you have everything

331
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:20,647
you need.
We're fine, Ms. O'Brian. Thank you.

332
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:25,785
You're going in through
the CLR processor?

333
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,119
That's right.
We're going to isolate it

334
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,954
from the main servers and
create a brand-new subnet.

335
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,555
Creating a brand-new subnet
from scratch?

336
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,756
That'll take forever.

337
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,991
Ms. O'Brian, thanks
for offering your help.

338
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,192
We'll take it from here.

339
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,526
Look, I think
there's another way.

340
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:39,193
I've been looking
at the CTU schematics.

341
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:40,828
Why not tap directly
into the trunk line?

342
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,195
Because I'm not insane.

343
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:45,564
Mr. Haynam, we need to make sure
those nuclear rods

344
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:46,998
don't get into
the city.

345
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,200
What I'm suggesting
wille a lot faster.

346
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,868
Yeah, and it could make things
a whole lot worse.

347
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:52,736
How could things be any worse?

348
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,838
You reopen that trunk line
without system buffers in place,

349
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,040
you could cause an overload,

350
00:16:56,107 --> 00:16:58,175
wind up electrocuting
yourself,

351
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,309
not to mention starting a fire

352
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:00,443
that canurn down
half the building.

353
00:17:00,511 --> 00:17:01,811
I'm aware of the risks.

354
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,246
I think I can create
a workaround.

355
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,447
You couldn't keep an EMP

356
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,715
from taking out
your whole operation.

357
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,616
Forgive me if I don't bow
to your expertise.

358
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:11,452
If you'd stop with the cheap
insults and just listen to me.

359
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,687
Look, I'm not here
to brainstorm.

360
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:14,054
I'm here to clean up your mess.

361
00:17:14,122 --> 00:17:15,388
You need to leave.

362
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,389
Now.

363
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:18,757
I said now,
Ms. O'Brian.

364
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,992
I won't ask you again.

365
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,931
Start prepping the CLR
for a diagnostic.

366
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:39,272
Arlo, is there any other way

367
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,307
to get into the trunk line
besides the server room?

368
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,575
No, that's the only
way in. Why?

369
00:17:43,643 --> 00:17:45,609
I think I have a faster way

370
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:46,810
to get us back online,

371
00:17:46,878 --> 00:17:48,645
but Haynam says
it's too dangerous.

372
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:51,013
I think he's
a raging egomaniac.

373
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,048
Seems to be a prerequisite
for engineers these days.

374
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,083
You talk to Hastings?

375
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:58,118
If I tell Hastings,
he'll just shoot me down.

376
00:17:58,186 --> 00:18:00,086
Maybe not.
And maybe the moon will fall

377
00:18:00,154 --> 00:18:01,187
from the sky.

378
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:02,522
Just let it go.

379
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,423
These NSA guys seem to know
what they're doing.

380
00:18:04,491 --> 00:18:06,425
And if they don't,
what happens to Jack?

381
00:18:06,493 --> 00:18:07,859
What's Jack got
to do with this?

382
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:09,928
(sighs)
Never mind.

383
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,335
Hello?

384
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,237
Renee, it's Chloe.
Where are you?

385
00:18:23,304 --> 00:18:24,538
I'm at Jack's apartment.

386
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,572
What's going on?

387
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,572
Everything.

388
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,472
All of our systems
CTU was hit bare down.

389
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,506
It's a real mess.

390
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:31,807
How did that happen?

391
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,275
I can't go into it right now,

392
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,609
but we think
the terrorists were trying

393
00:18:34,677 --> 00:18:35,744
to take out
our radiological detectors.

394
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,144
Where's Jack?

395
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:38,646
That's why I'm calling you.
I think he might be

396
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,113
in some kind of trouble.
We need to find him.

397
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,447
Slow down, Chloe.

398
00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:43,082
Uh, what-what do you mean?
What-what kind of trouble?

399
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,350
Jack was tracking the terrorists
when the EMP hit.

400
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,819
Uh, whHe called NSA, mean?
and they lost contact, too.

401
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,486
Does Hastings know
about this?

402
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:51,054
He's the one
who told me.

403
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:53,055
What's he doing about it?
Nothing.

404
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:55,057
He won't send anyone out
to look for them.

405
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:56,491
He says he can't
spare the men

406
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,293
and that Jack can take
care of himself.

407
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,294
Where was Jack
before you lost contact?

408
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:03,196
He took the first exit
off the Williamsburg Bridge.

409
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:04,931
I'm going to try
to find him, Chloe.

410
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,900
You need to get CTU back online
as soon as you can.

411
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,268
Once you acquire
Jack's position,

412
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,569
you can direct me to him.

413
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:10,937
Yeah, well, that might
take a while.

414
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:12,571
NSA brought in
a repair team

415
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,006
and they're going
about it all wrong.

416
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,907
I have a faster way
to get us back online.

417
00:19:15,975 --> 00:19:16,941
Well, then tell them.

418
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:18,609
I tried.
They won't listen.

419
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,243
Then you need to make
them listen, Chloe.

420
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:21,544
Do what you have to do.

421
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,514
Okay. I will.

422
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,582
Call me when you're back up.

423
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,485
The EMP took out
all of our systems.

424
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:53,453
And since we don't know
how long it's going to be

425
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:54,855
until we're up
and running again,

426
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:57,257
we're going to have to evacuate
all nonessential personnel.

427
00:19:57,325 --> 00:19:58,492
You're going to follow
Agent Combs

428
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,093
through our access tunnel.
I need to speak

429
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,495
with Mr. Prady, please.

430
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:02,997
Thank you.

431
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:05,065
Please.
Yeah.

432
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:13,176
I'm really sorry that it took me
so long to get back to you.

433
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:14,611
I've been a little busy.

434
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,314
I know. They briefed me
on what happened.

435
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,515
It's a terrible thing.

436
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,987
Yes.

437
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,027
And I have some bad news
because of it.

438
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,532
The surveillance video
that you wanted

439
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,704
has been erased
by the EMP.

440
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,743
Erased?
Yes.

441
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,981
Everything in the building
has been fried.

442
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,483
Well, that's a damn shame.

443
00:20:33,551 --> 00:20:37,155
So what you're telling me is
whoever helped Kevin Wade

444
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:39,590
rob that evidence locker--
they just caught a huge break.

445
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,395
I'm afraid so.

446
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:44,802
Are you sure that it was
all erased, Ms. Walsh?

447
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,303
I mean, don't you have
a backup system?

448
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,173
Yes, yes, we do,
but it's on-site.

449
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,708
And like I told you, all the
servers have been wiped clean.

450
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:54,618
I know how much
Kevin means to you.

451
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,354
I really wish
I could do more.

452
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,626
So you're sure that there's
nothing else you can tell me?

453
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,262
Anything that would
help me find Kevin?

454
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,297
Believe me, I have told you
everything that I know.

455
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:06,632
I'm sure you have.

456
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,336
Mr. Prady, I really have
to get back to work.

457
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:11,039
Good luck

458
00:21:11,107 --> 00:21:12,808
finding Kevin.
I hope that he's okay.

459
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,709
Me, too.

460
00:21:14,777 --> 00:21:16,845
If anything changes
with those files,

461
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:18,512
I'll be in Little Rock.
You have my number.

462
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,847
Of course.

463
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,882
I hope you get your lights
back on.

464
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:01,219
Mr. Haynam, I think
I found a way to deal

465
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,254
with the safety concerns
you had with my idea.

466
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,456
Here's the workaround.

467
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,757
I thought I made myselear.

468
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,092
We're not going anywhere
near that trunk line.

469
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:13,395
I'm going to ask you
one last time.

470
00:22:13,463 --> 00:22:16,464
We really need
to do this my way.

471
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:17,865
We have agents in the field
who are close to finding

472
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,600
the nuclear rods
and they need our help.

473
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,901
And I'm going to ask you
one last time.

474
00:22:20,968 --> 00:22:22,068
Get out of here.

475
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:25,137
Get out or I'll
call security!

476
00:22:27,374 --> 00:22:28,474
You get out.

477
00:22:28,542 --> 00:22:30,242
Now.
What the hell...

478
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,610
All of you, get out now.

479
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:34,946
Look, look,
take a second to think.

480
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,481
Do you really want to do this?

481
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:40,417
Mr. Haynam,
I don't want to hurt you.

482
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:41,818
You're probably

483
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,019
an okay guy
when you're not at work.

484
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:45,288
And you're wearing
a wedding ring.

485
00:22:45,356 --> 00:22:46,622
I swear to God,
if you don't leave right now,

486
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,458
I will shoot you.

487
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:52,461
Get out!

488
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:55,463
Go!

489
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:13,144
Go get Hastings and tell him
to bring security.

490
00:23:30,396 --> 00:23:31,931
They're starting to flank us!

491
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,899
We're almost there!

492
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,004
Jack, they're almost on us.
We cannot stay here!

493
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:40,472
Just give me one more second.

494
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:44,609
Okay...

495
00:23:44,677 --> 00:23:46,310
Okay, I'm ready.

496
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:47,778
We're gonna use these plates
to form a way

497
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,012
so that we can make it
over to the call box.

498
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,113
Remember, we need to move

499
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,647
slow and steady.

500
00:23:51,715 --> 00:23:53,515
It is imperative that we
stick together for this to work.

501
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,150
You understand?
Yes, sir.

502
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,018
No matter how difficult
it gets out there,

503
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,319
this armor is gonna protect us.

504
00:23:58,387 --> 00:23:59,486
You need to trust that.

505
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:01,387
Yes, sir.
Yes. Okay.

506
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:02,755
Cole, you're with Agent King.

507
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:03,922
Owen, you're with me.

508
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:12,661
Let's go!

509
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:28,372
The armor's not gonna hold up.

510
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:30,006
Yes, it is.

511
00:24:30,074 --> 00:24:31,608
Maintain formation.

512
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,580
Can you get a shot?

513
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:39,514
Not from this angle.

514
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:43,084
It's not holding up.
We gotta go for it.

515
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:44,919
Yes, it is. Slow down!

516
00:24:47,222 --> 00:24:49,056
We're almost there. Move!

517
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,757
No!
No, no!

518
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,578
(King groaning)

519
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,580
There's nothing
we can do for him now.

520
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:18,081
We can't just leave him there.

521
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,449
I'm with Owen.
We don't leave our men behind.

522
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,617
You try and bring him in
now, you're dead.

523
00:25:20,684 --> 00:25:21,751
They're trying to draw us out.

524
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,218
Best thing
we can do for him

525
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:25,387
is make it to the hard line
and try and call for help.

526
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:29,256
We're almost there.

527
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:31,391
You cover the north,
Owen the east.

528
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:32,792
I can get there.

529
00:25:43,768 --> 00:25:44,968
Owen!
Owen!

530
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:46,302
Cover him!

531
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,568
I'm sorry.

532
00:26:22,636 --> 00:26:24,437
I couldn't leave him behind.

533
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:25,771
You did great.

534
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:32,076
Is he all right?

535
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:33,311
Did he make it?

536
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:38,449
Did he make it?!

537
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:40,318
Yeah, he made it.

538
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:43,421
Come on. Stay with me.

539
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:45,756
Stay with me.
Jack, they're repositioning.

540
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,959
Stay on them.

541
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:14,968
Are you all right?
Yes.

542
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:16,302
Are you sure?

543
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,570
Yes, Mother, I'm okay.

544
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:26,878
I'm so sorry, Father.

545
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:30,215
(sobbing):
I'm so sorry.

546
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,354
You were right
about Tarin.

547
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:39,324
I should have listened to you.

548
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,693
You are safe.

549
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,194
That's what's important.

550
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,562
Mr. President,

551
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,497
CTU is preparing a subterranean
evacuation route.

552
00:27:48,565 --> 00:27:50,198
If there is
a radiological attack,

553
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:51,700
you'll be shielded
underground.

554
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:52,867
When do we leave?

555
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:54,435
As soon as possible.

556
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:55,735
President Taylor's waiting for
you with the other delegates.

557
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:59,771
The files Mr. Hastings
requested are inside.

558
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,740
Thank you, sir.

559
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,808
Kayla, go with them.

560
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:16,950
She's strong.

561
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:19,685
She'll be all right.

562
00:28:19,753 --> 00:28:23,789
We almost lost her.

563
00:28:23,857 --> 00:28:26,891
And I... almost lost you.

564
00:28:29,665 --> 00:28:32,906
All for a peace agreement that
could fall apart at any moment.

565
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:35,780
And it will only get
more difficult, Dalia.

566
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:39,424
My enemies will be waiting
for me once we return home.

567
00:28:39,492 --> 00:28:42,360
Omar...

568
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:44,027
Despite everything
that's happened,

569
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:46,062
there's one thing
I've never doubted.

570
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:50,303
That what you are doing here
is an absolute good.

571
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:53,940
You have to be strong, too.

572
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:15,359
We need to get in there fast

573
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:17,295
before O'Brian
can do any more damage.

574
00:29:17,363 --> 00:29:20,206
I understand the situation,
Mr. Haynam.

575
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,945
How long?

576
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,116
I just need to drill
into the locking mechanism.

577
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,652
It shouldn't take more
than a couple minutes.

578
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,922
This woman is out of her mind.

579
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,791
Where the hell do you find
these people, Hastings?

580
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:33,294
I can't believe she
pulled a weapon on me.

581
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:35,363
She was ready to use it, too.
I seriously doubt that.

582
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:37,299
I'm sure she was
just trying to scare you.

583
00:29:37,366 --> 00:29:39,367
Yeah? Well, she did
a very good job.

584
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:42,105
You wanted to see me, sir?

585
00:29:42,173 --> 00:29:44,307
Yes, O'Brian's going off
the deep end.

586
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:46,709
She thinks she knows how to
get the CTU up and running.

587
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:49,146
But she's locked herself
in the server room to do it.

588
00:29:49,214 --> 00:29:51,382
We'll be in there
in a few seconds.

589
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:53,150
What's she trying to do?

590
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:54,653
She's trying to tap directly
into the trunk line,

591
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:55,789
which I don't have to tell you,

592
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:57,327
is a catastrophe
waiting to happen,

593
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:35,932
Stop what you're doing, Chloe!

594
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,432
Let's see the gun.

595
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,202
Okay, don't shoot or anything.

596
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:45,072
I know what I did is crazy.

597
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,540
I know I'm in a lot of trouble.

598
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:47,541
You're damned right.

599
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:48,675
I wouldn't have done it

600
00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:49,910
if I didn't think it could work.

601
00:30:49,977 --> 00:30:51,777
I'm almost done.
I just need ten more minutes.

602
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,345
Get her out of here now.

603
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:54,513
Do me a favor:
let me give the orders.

604
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,414
She pulled a gun on me!
I know what she did.

605
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:59,884
Now just shut up
and let me handle it.

606
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:02,187
Chloe, what in the hell
were you thinking?

607
00:31:02,254 --> 00:31:05,223
Jack's looking for those nuclear
rods and he might need our help.

608
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:07,025
I can get satellite
and comm back up.

609
00:31:07,093 --> 00:31:08,560
I just need to finish tapping
into that trunk line.

610
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:09,627
I told Mr. Haynam,

611
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:10,795
but he wouldn't listen.

612
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:12,396
So I pulled a gun on him.

613
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:16,099
I didn't want to.
I don't even like guns.

614
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:20,670
Dana, what's your
take on this?

615
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:22,872
Mr. Haynam is right.

616
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,707
Tapping into the trunk
line is dangerous

617
00:31:24,775 --> 00:31:26,809
and there's no guarantee
that it'll work.

618
00:31:26,877 --> 00:31:28,644
What about Cole?
He could be in trouble.

619
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:30,145
Aren't you worried about him?

620
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:32,413
Yes, I am. That's why I can't
go along with your plan.

621
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:33,747
It's reckless.

622
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:34,915
I'm sorry, Chloe.

623
00:31:34,983 --> 00:31:36,182
You've never been
my biggest fan.

624
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,451
Why start now?

625
00:31:38,518 --> 00:31:41,620
Look, it's not as dangerous
as they're saying.

626
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:42,988
I've taken precautions.

627
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:44,356
This can work.

628
00:31:44,423 --> 00:31:46,224
I just need ten minutes.

629
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:50,561
If I can't get the systems
online by then, fine, arrest me.

630
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:52,764
When you brought me
on for this job,

631
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:54,832
you said it was because
I didn't think like anyone else.

632
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,367
Ever since I got here,
I've been punished for that.

633
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:59,502
I've been right
more than once today.

634
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:00,770
I think I've proven myself

635
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,505
and I think I deserve
that ten minutes.

636
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:12,147
Ten minutes.

637
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:13,481
Thank you, sir.

638
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:15,717
You can't be serious about this.

639
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:16,651
You need any help?

640
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:18,252
No, just let me work.

641
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,755
All right, let's give
the lady some space.

642
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:31,561
That's all, gentlemen.

643
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:36,498
You are making a huge mistake.

644
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:39,134
Maybe, but I'm willing
to take that chance.

645
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:40,735
O'Brian proved
herself today.

646
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:43,738
I want to see what
she comes up with.

647
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:46,173
I'd appreciate it if you
and your men would stand by.

648
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:51,044
Yes?

649
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:53,380
What is it? Sir, there's a man
here who wants to speak

650
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:54,814
with you-- Bill Prady.

651
00:32:54,882 --> 00:32:56,716
He says
he's a probation officer.

652
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,551
Probation officer?
From Arkansas, sir.

653
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:00,485
What does he want?

654
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,853
He didn't say.

655
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:04,021
Put him in Holding 2.

656
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:05,722
Tell him I'll be there
in 15 minutes.

657
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,890
All right.

658
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,358
Dana, stay here
in case O'Brian

659
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:09,926
needs anything.
I'll be in my office.

660
00:33:09,993 --> 00:33:11,994
Yes, sir.

661
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,967
Mr. Hastings, are you there?

662
00:33:43,035 --> 00:33:45,236
We're here, Chloe.
What's your status?

663
00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:46,538
I'm into the
trunk line.

664
00:33:46,605 --> 00:33:48,339
I'm about to activate
the bypass circuit.

665
00:33:48,407 --> 00:33:50,040
Okay, what can we expect?

666
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:51,775
Well, if I don't
electrocute myself,

667
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,143
some of our primary systems
should start booting up.

668
00:33:54,211 --> 00:33:56,547
All right,
whenever you're ready.

669
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:32,199
We've got power to comm.

670
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:38,805
And one of the sat links
is back online.

671
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:40,807
All right, that's good enough.
Start looking for Bauer.

672
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,609
Okay, Chloe, it's working.

673
00:34:43,677 --> 00:34:44,777
You all right?

674
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:46,245
I just need a few more minutes.

675
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:47,513
I'll be right there.
Okay.

676
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,914
Mr. Hastings, one more thing.

677
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:51,883
If you do locate Jack,
you need to call Renee Walker.

678
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,050
Walker?

679
00:34:53,118 --> 00:34:54,618
She went out looking for him.

680
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,119
She should be in the vicinity.

681
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:58,121
Will do.

682
00:34:58,188 --> 00:35:01,190
Why don't you go see
if Miss O'Brian needs a hand?

683
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,027
And be civil this time.

684
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:13,436
Come on, Owen.
Stay with me.

685
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:21,177
Stay with me.

686
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,581
He's gone.

687
00:35:28,284 --> 00:35:30,819
I lost two
of the snipers.

688
00:35:30,886 --> 00:35:33,888
If we're gonna make a move,
we got to do it soon, Jack.

689
00:35:33,956 --> 00:35:36,357
We can't lay down cover fire
for something we can't see.

690
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,392
We need to give them something
to shoot at.

691
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,327
I'll make a break
to the north,

692
00:35:40,395 --> 00:35:42,628
try and draw their fire,
you make a run for the call box.

693
00:35:42,696 --> 00:35:44,396
But that's a suicide play, Jack.
You'll never make it.

694
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:46,064
But you will.
No.

695
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:47,332
I can't let you do that.

696
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,599
I'm in command here.

697
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,167
That's what gonna happen.

698
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:51,869
Do you understand?

699
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:54,208
Yeah.

700
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,080
I need you to do me a favor.

701
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:58,648
What is it?

702
00:35:58,716 --> 00:36:00,917
You make sure
that Hastings keeps his promise.

703
00:36:02,252 --> 00:36:04,353
That he doesn't
bring Renee back in.

704
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:06,688
I give you my word.

705
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:09,691
You're not gonna have long
before they start firing on you.

706
00:36:09,759 --> 00:36:11,493
Good luck, Jack.

707
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,594
You make it to that call box.

708
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:14,481
Clear!

709
00:37:29,424 --> 00:37:31,392
Jack? Jack?!

710
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:32,559
Jack?
(gasps)

711
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:33,994
It's okay.
It's okay. It's me.

712
00:37:34,061 --> 00:37:35,628
It's Renee.
It's okay.

713
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:37,229
(groans)
It's okay.

714
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,531
Shh.
(panting)

715
00:37:38,598 --> 00:37:40,599
They got the fuel rods
in a boat.

716
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:43,067
They're heading
across the river into the city.

717
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,769
I can't breathe.
Shh.

718
00:37:44,836 --> 00:37:46,470
It's okay.
Nothing went through.

719
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:51,476
Relax. You may have
a collapsed lung...

720
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:52,477
Jack, I got through to CTU.

721
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:53,845
They just got back online.

722
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:55,113
NYPD's sending choppers.

723
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,380
We still got a real good shot
at finding them.

724
00:38:07,558 --> 00:38:10,026
Mr. Hastings, I just got
a call from Agent Ortiz.

725
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,794
The nuclear rods
are on a Zodiac

726
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:12,928
with two
of the terrorists aboard.

727
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:14,329
They were heading northwest

728
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:16,264
across the river toward the city.
Where are the choppers?

729
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:17,699
One second.

730
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:20,500
They just arrived at the port.

731
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:21,467
Okay, redirect them.

732
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:22,802
Start diverting
all available

733
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,136
NYPD units to that shoreline.

734
00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:26,638
We need to lay down a cordon.
Yes, sir.

735
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:28,739
Chloe?

736
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:31,307
Thanks. You-You were...

737
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,642
I'm not good with praise.

738
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:26,220
What do you think you're doing,
going to my boss?

739
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:28,154
My job.

740
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:29,989
I've answered
all your questions.

741
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:31,590
Why won't you just leave?

742
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:33,024
I can't do that.

743
00:39:33,092 --> 00:39:34,993
I know you were involved with

744
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,093
that robbery,
Ms. Walsh.

745
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:37,228
What?

746
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:38,762
I think you know
exactly where Kevin is.

747
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,929
I think you're protecting him.

748
00:39:39,997 --> 00:39:42,331
You are out of your mind.

749
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:43,533
And you're a liar.

750
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,401
I'm not leaving here

751
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,336
until I know the truth.

752
00:39:47,404 --> 00:39:50,105
This'll go a lot
smoother for you

753
00:39:50,172 --> 00:39:53,674
if you just come clean
right now.

754
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:56,610
It's not too late,
Miss Walsh.

755
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:59,513
But I promise you, if you don't,

756
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,515
I'm gonna nail your ass

757
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:03,516
to the wall.

758
00:41:11,947 --> 00:41:14,047
Contact CTU.

759
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:16,818
See if they picked 'em up
going across the river.

760
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:34,966
It's me.

761
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,501
CTU's back online.

762
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:38,769
I know. There are helicopters

763
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:40,303
searching the river.

764
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:42,337
They're getting close.

765
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:44,072
You should have
warned us earlier.

766
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:45,706
I didn't have time.

767
00:41:45,774 --> 00:41:47,741
I was too busy
preserving my cover.

768
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:51,310
I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to stay under.

769
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:52,678
I thought
you took care of that problem.

770
00:41:52,745 --> 00:41:53,845
So did I.

771
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:55,480
It came back.

772
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,448
Well, we can't stay here.

773
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:59,950
The police must already
be cordoning off the area.

774
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,917
We're going to need your help
getting clear.

775
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:03,583
I will get you
out of there.

776
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,049
Don't worry.

777
00:42:05,117 --> 00:42:07,550
Stand by.
I'll call you in a few minutes.

778
