1
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,410
Hassan isn't happy

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,090
about Taylor's response to the ultimatum.

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,410
If he wants to take it up with President Taylor,

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,090
he can do it when he's...

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,900
- Put your gun down.  - Omar, what are you doing?

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,900
Mr. President...

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,100
My life for tens of thousands?

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,660
I couldn't live with that.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,430
What if they blow up the bomb anyway?

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,030
At least I've tried to stop the attack.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,800
We've got less than five minutes... we gotta move.

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,460
Mr. President, you can't trust him!

13
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,600
Don't move, hands where we can see them!

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,730
Is he still alive?

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,760
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,230
Where is President Hassan?

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,430
I don't know.

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,100
Don't lie to me!

19
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,760
They have Hassan; we have the bomb.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,260
The bomb's at Amsterdam and 93rd.

21
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,360
We know that President Hassan was handed over

22
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,360
approximately ten minutes ago.

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,430
We have an ambush point yet?

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,760
Yes, intersection of 161st and Amsterdam.

25
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,800
CTU is following you.

26
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,200
Can you find me an exit?

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,560
There's one between 158th

28
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,000
and 159th... parking garage.

29
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,260
Damn it, they've made us!

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,230
He's breaking left! I repeat, he's breaking left!

31
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,160
I've got him, he's going back into the garage.

32
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,160
He's coming straight at me, damn it!

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,760
You know where to go.

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,630
- Have you got Hassan?  - No.

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,130
The driver managed to transfer Hassan to another vehicle

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,460
before I could get to him.

37
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,400
Someone inside CTU's gotta be tipping them off.

38
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,600
It's only a matter of time

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,960
before this gets traced back to me.

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,500
I need you to get the hell out of here while I still can.

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,600
Uh, excuse me, Ms. Walsh?

42
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,530
I need to see your passkey.

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,860
What's this about?

44
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,930
It's a new security protocol because of the EMP attack.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,230
Nobody gets in or out without personally being

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,860
cleared by Mr. Hastings.

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,060
I can't let you through.

48
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,600
You haven't been coded out.

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,260
Well, I'm not leaving.

50
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,030
I'm just going to my car.

51
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,900
I'm sorry, you'll have to talk to Mr. Hastings.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,600
Hastings is in the middle of a crisis.

53
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,960
It'll just be a couple minutes.

54
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,760
No one will even know I was gone.

55
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,030
Look...

56
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,060
I just want to go get my migraine meds.

57
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,700
Please don't make me beg.

58
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,130
All right, tell you what,

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll have one of my men run out to your car,

60
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,200
grab your medication.

61
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,930
Give me your keys.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,560
You know, that's fine, your men are busy enough.

63
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,900
I'll talk to Hastings.

64
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,000
- You sure?  - Yep. 

65
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,460
Thank you, Jim.

66
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,760
Only one car left the parking garage.

67
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,030
One minute after the crash.

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,830
Northeast exit, a blonde woman was driving.

69
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,160
Hassan was probably in it.

70
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,330
Can you track it?

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,100
No, it left the satellite grid.

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,060
Damn it. Put out an APB on that car.

73
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,130
- Yes, sir.  - Scan the NSA servers.

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,960
- See if they've picked up any chatter.  - Yes, sir.

75
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,830
Mr. Hastings, the President's on line one,

76
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,800
- she'd like an update.  - Great, thank you.

77
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,160
Madam President, Brian Hastings.

78
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,860
Mr. Hastings, I saw the crash.

79
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,260
Please tell me President Hassan survived.

80
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,360
Actually, we just learned that President Hassan was not

81
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,860
in the vehicle.

82
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,060
I don't understand.

83
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,260
During the pursuit, we believe

84
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,830
he was switched to another car.

85
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,100
We're trying to track it now.

86
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,460
- Then he's still alive.  - It appears so, ma'am.

87
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,700
If the terrorists wanted him dead,

88
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,860
they would've killed him on site.

89
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,660
They must have another agenda.

90
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,800
I don't even want to speculate on what that might be.

91
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,230
We will keep you apprised, Madam President.

92
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,530
Thank you.

93
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,930
What is happening?

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,130
Is my father alive?

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,260
We think so, but he's still in the hands

96
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,100
of the terrorists. Now, CTU

97
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,230
- is searching for him now.  - Then there's still hope.

98
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,700
- Yes.  - Excuse me...

99
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,600
but Madam President, the Russian Foreign Minister is outside.

100
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,760
He wants to speak with you.

101
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,630
I'll be right there.

102
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,160
I can't imagine how hard

103
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,160
this is for both of you.

104
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,100
Please know that I'm committing

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,860
every resource at my disposal to finding him.

106
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,360
Mr. Novakovich.

107
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,700
What can I do for you?

108
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,030
Thank you for seeing me, Madam President.

109
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,500
I know that you are very busy.

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,460
It's all right.

111
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,460
Please.

112
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,030
Can I assume there is no change

113
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,060
in the status of President Hassan?

114
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm afraid not.

115
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,900
Then he is still being held by terrorists.

116
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,860
For now, yes.

117
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,630
Are you hopeful that CTU can recover him?

118
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,830
We're following a lead now, and, yes, we are very hopeful.

119
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,730
What is the nature of the lead?

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,600
I'd rather not get into specifics.

121
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,060
You'll be told the second we know more.

122
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,430
Madam President, I need to stress

123
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,630
that if Hassan is not found, his government

124
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,060
will be in disarray.

125
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,060
The peace agreement will have no chance of success.

126
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,400
I'm aware of that, but there's, there's no point in speculating

127
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,060
on the worst-case scenario; we're not there yet.

128
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,600
I just want to make our position clear.

129
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,630
If Hassan dies, there is no agreement.

130
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,360
If I didn't know better,

131
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,160
I'd think you were hoping for that to happen.

132
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,100
- Madam President!  - You believe this treaty

133
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,100
weakens your influence in the region.

134
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,700
Your country has been looking for any excuse to pull out.

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,200
I realize you are under a great deal of pressure,

136
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,100
but there is no reason for these baseless accusations.

137
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,430
My country has been more than supportive.

138
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,100
We are here, are we not?

139
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,200
Perhaps I spoke too harshly.

140
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,100
I just don't need you to remind me

141
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,130
how perilous this situation is.

142
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,100
I do appreciate your support,

143
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,060
and I hope that I can count on it

144
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,560
until we find President Hassan.

145
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,160
Of course, Madam President.

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,300
Chloe, can I talk to you for a second?

147
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,960
We've got a problem.

148
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,600
Jack thinks that someone inside of CTU

149
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,930
is working for the terrorists.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,300
Why does he think that?

151
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,300
They must've been warned that they were being followed.

152
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
That's why they transferred Hassan to a different car.

153
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,430
Yeah, that bothered me too.

154
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
And then there was a satellite glitch that happened earlier.

155
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,730
What glitch? The glitch that allowed

156
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
the terrorists to get away in the first place.

157
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,230
It was a little too unlucky; especially for us.

158
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,860
Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash.

159
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,530
If someone did call to tip him off,

160
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
we can get the number off the memory.

161
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,530
Jack's on his way back to CTU now.

162
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,930
He wants you to call him on a proprietary line

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,800
so he can upload the data.

164
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,130
- All right.  - Go.

165
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,430
I'm ready to receive.

166
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,430
I'm calling Jack now.

167
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,200
This is Bauer.

168
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,730
Jack, it's Chloe, Renee filled me in.

169
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,900
Good, I'm going to upload

170
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,330
the cell phone data to your station.

171
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,560
- What's your I.D. number?  - 91770.

172
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,530
91770.

173
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,760
Chloe, it's encrypted... you're gonna have to work fast.

174
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,660
Excuse me, sir, I need to access your workstation.

175
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,030
What for?

176
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,460
I want to make sure all the parameters reset properly

177
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,900
- after the EMP.  - Can't that wait?

178
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,100
No... if the parameters are off we could lose more data.

179
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,630
- How long?  - Couple minutes.

180
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,000
Go ahead.

181
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,930
Hastings.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,400
Mr. Hastings, it's Chloe.

183
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,060
I need to talk to you at my station... it's important.

184
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,300
What is it, Chloe?

185
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
I'll explain when you get here.

186
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm on my way.

187
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,730
Let me know when you're finished.

188
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,830
All right, what is it?

189
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,100
We think someone inside of CTU is working with the terrorists.

190
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,530
What are you talking about?

191
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,530
They switched Hassan to a different car

192
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,430
because they knew they were being followed.

193
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,700
Jack recovered Tarin's cell phone from the crash.

194
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,560
Chloe's decrypting the data right now.

195
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,360
Who the hell is it?

196
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,830
The data's coming in now; it'll take a second.

197
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,530
Okay, there... these are all the calls

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,130
that Tarin made in the past hour.

199
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,060
That's one of ours.

200
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,430
It's one of the cell phones

201
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,730
NSA provided to us right after the EMP hit.

202
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,160
Who was issued that phone?

203
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,400
They were logged in by hand; hold on.

204
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,000
That's Dana's phone.

205
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,900
Where is she?

206
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,730
I checked with Hastings; he cleared me through, Jim.

207
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,900
How's that migraine?

208
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,100
Worse than ever, thanks to you.

209
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,260
Sorry about that. Just doing my job.

210
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,760
Stay where you are and keep your hands...

211
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,460
Security monitors, main screen.

212
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,000
We need a medical team to the main entrance.

213
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,000
What's going on?

214
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,500
Why is there a 112 out on Dana?

215
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,360
She's working with the terrorists.

216
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,930
Just shot two security guards.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,230
She's trying to leave the building.

218
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,400
Wait... wait a minute, what the hell are you talking about?

219
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,800
We traced a call from her cell phone

220
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,130
to one of the terrorists.

221
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,830
She's been working with them, Cole.

222
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,200
What the hell did you know about this?

223
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
Nothing, sir!

224
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,660
She just entered the parking garage.

225
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,130
She's heading for the north end of level two.

226
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,900
- She's going for her car.  - Cole... Cole!

227
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,030
Notify Security, lock down the exits.

228
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,300
Get out of the car now!

229
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,000
Who are you, you lying bitch?

230
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,330
Who are you?

231
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,530
Cole! Let her go!

232
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,930
Cole, let her go.

233
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,030
Cole...

234
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,900
I said let her go.

235
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,060
Where's Hassan?

236
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,260
You're going to talk to me one way or the other.

237
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,460
I said, where are they taking Hassan?

238
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,500
I want to talk to Jack Bauer.

239
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,600
You want answers...

240
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,800
get Bauer.

241
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,530
Get her out of here.

242
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,700
If her name's not Dana Walsh, then who is she?

243
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,190
Her real name's Jenny Scott.

244
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,670
How much pain you can endure.

245
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,920
At least that's what she told me.

246
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,630
I don't know what to believe anymore.

247
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,700
But she said she did some bad things in her past.

248
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,400
That's why she had to change her identity.

249
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,660
What bad things?

250
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,600
She was involved with a felon.

251
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,860
They committed some armed robberies.

252
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,360
Someone got killed.

253
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,430
That's all I know, but it's not relevant

254
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,630
to finding Hassan.

255
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,930
You let me decide what is relevant and what is not.

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,530
Why and hell didn't you report any of this?

257
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,460
Oh, I just found out about it a few hours ago.

258
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,030
That is not an excuse.

259
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,060
I know, sir.

260
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,960
I guess I was just trying to protect her.

261
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,200
I wasn't thinking straight.

262
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,800
So when you and Dana... or whatever her name is...

263
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,830
went AWOL, what was that about?

264
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,700
It's a long story, sir,

265
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,560
and it won't help us find President Hassan.

266
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,700
I'll make a full debrief

267
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,800
once this is all over, but until it is,

268
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,500
please, let me stay on duty.

269
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,130
I know I screwed up, but I've been running Hassan's security

270
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,860
for the last month.

271
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,960
Give me a chance to make this right.

272
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,700
Hastings.

273
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,960
Sir, you wanted to be told when Jack Bauer got here.

274
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,160
He just arrived.

275
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,460
Send him to interrogation.

276
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,800
Yes, sir.

277
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,900
You get over to debrief.

278
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,230
Sir, you need me on this.

279
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,700
I need people I can trust.

280
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,700
You want to make this right?

281
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,160
Then start by getting down everything you know.

282
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,230
Then we'll talk.

283
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,130
What's happening?

284
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,860
You were right. They had someone inside of CTU.

285
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,630
Dana Walsh. She's an analyst.

286
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,530
We checked the phone data you sent over.

287
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,760
She's the one that called Tarin before he crashed.

288
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,530
She must've warned him that he was being pursued.

289
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,900
Anybody know who she really is?

290
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,360
She's not saying anything until she talks to you.

291
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,330
Me? Why?

292
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,360
She won't say.

293
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,200
- Jack, are you up to speed?  - Yeah.

294
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,600
I just spoke with Agent Ortiz. You know he was her fiance?

295
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, that would explain a few things.

296
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,400
He doesn't know much... only that she had

297
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,600
some kind of criminal past, and altered

298
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,430
her identity to infiltrate CTU.

299
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,700
Not an easy task.

300
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,260
Well, she obviously had help from someone.

301
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,030
However she did this, we need to find out.

302
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,160
You think Cole's clean?

303
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,860
I think he's telling the truth,

304
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,900
but after this, I'm not sure

305
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,000
I trust my own opinion. I thought I knew Dana Walsh.

306
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,300
Cole's clean.

307
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,260
Why does she want to talk to you, Jack?

308
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,530
Don't know. Just met her today.

309
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,100
But I think we should find out, don't you?

310
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
Open up.

311
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,460
You stand down for now.

312
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,360
Just so we're clear, as far as I'm concerned,

313
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,230
I kept up my end of our deal.

314
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,900
The nuclear rods were recovered.

315
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
The only reason why I'm still here is because

316
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,330
I gave President Taylor my word

317
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,700
that I would protect President Hassan.

318
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,100
I know.

319
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Okay, thank you.

320
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,260
Biometrics ready?

321
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,730
Yes, sir.

322
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,400
They said I was the only one you wanted to talk to.

323
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,230
Why?

324
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,700
Because you're the only one here

325
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,660
who doesn't have his head up his ass.

326
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,300
So let's not waste any time.

327
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,800
You want President Hassan, I can get him for you.

328
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,960
I know where they're taking him. I know what they're planning

329
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,430
to do.

330
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
What do you want?

331
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,830
You know the drill.

332
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,700
Full immunity, clean record.

333
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
And I want to be compensated.

334
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,960
Compensated?

335
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,630
When you get these IRK agents,

336
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,430
you're gonna get your hands on their cash.

337
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,660
I want my share.

338
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,160
I lost a lot of money when this deal went south.

339
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,430
You're telling me all of this is about money?

340
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,030
Isn't it always?

341
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,800
If I'm going to take this to the president,

342
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,200
I need proof that you know something worthwhile.

343
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,660
Well, in about a half an hour,

344
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,360
you will have all the proof you need...

345
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,860
Hassan's head.

346
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,660
You little bitch.

347
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,360
Let me explain something to you.

348
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,160
Damn it, Jack!

349
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,630
The only reason you've got any leverage right now is

350
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,960
because President Hassan is alive.

351
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,960
So stop screwing with me!

352
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,130
They are going to force him to make a statement,

353
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,030
and then they're going to kill him,

354
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,830
live over the Internet.

355
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,330
So I suggest we stop haggling

356
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,830
and you start making this happen.

357
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,900
Fine. I'll take this to the president.

358
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,830
But you better understand

359
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,800
that if we don't recover President Hassan alive...

360
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,860
you get nothing.

361
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,760
Nothing.

362
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,400
It's why I asked for you,

363
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,500
Mr. Bauer.

364
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,830
It's part of the deal.

365
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,330
You're going to handle this operation.

366
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Hassan is heavily protected.

367
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,530
I need someone with your experience running the show.

368
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,060
There's been enough screwups for one day...

369
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,130
don't you think?

370
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,430
Earlier, you said you lost a lot of money

371
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,730
because the deal went bad.

372
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,300
Who was supposed to pay you?

373
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,600
Tick-tock, Mr. Bauer.

374
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,960
You're running out of time.

375
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,930
Open the door.

376
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,630
So what do the biometrics say?

377
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,400
Autonomics are stable. No deception.

378
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,130
I wouldn't put much faith in those readings.

379
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,930
She's a sociopath. She cannot be trusted.

380
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
Renee's right... this isn't just about the money for her.

381
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,860
She's hiding something.

382
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,430
But given the timeframe that we have,

383
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,800
we need to follow through with this.

384
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,360
How do you want to play it?

385
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,660
We need to call the president.

386
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,660
Hassan is here.

387
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,030
They're bringing him up.

388
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,660
Samir, we should kill him now.

389
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,730
The entire city is looking for him.

390
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,160
It's not enough to kill him.

391
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,330
We need him to confess his crimes,

392
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,500
renounce his lies.

393
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,360
The longer we delay, the better the chance

394
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,700
the Americans will find him and try to rescue him.

395
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,930
He will never be rescued.

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,900
He will die

397
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,730
right here.

398
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,960
Samir?

399
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,230
Do you remember me?

400
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,060
I was a young man when we met.

401
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,630
You were a general in the Revolutionary Guard.

402
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,960
I had the honor of briefing you

403
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,130
on our operations in Abul Province.

404
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,130
You were a great leader then.

405
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,700
What happened?

406
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,230
Why did you turn your back on our country?

407
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,830
It is you...

408
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
you who has betrayed our country.

409
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,100
No.

410
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm fighting to keep us strong.

411
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,430
You have chosen to surrender to the West.

412
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,430
It's not surrender.

413
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,460
It's an honorable

414
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,530
peace... that will strengthen our country.

415
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,430
I do remember you.

416
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,330
Do you remember the campaign

417
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,460
we fought to secure the perimeter

418
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,130
of Abul?

419
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,830
Yes, I do.

420
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,960
The other generals said I was leading my men into defeat.

421
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,700
But we fought

422
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,260
for four long days.

423
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,330
I believed in my heart that victory was possible.

424
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
And I was right.

425
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,830
I'm not saying I'm never wrong.

426
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,260
But I believe...

427
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,330
just as strongly in this peace agreement.

428
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,960
All I'm asking...

429
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,660
is that you put your faith in me once again.

430
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,530
I implore you to stop this madness.

431
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,500
The next thing you say...

432
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,330
will be an apology to every citizen of the IRK.

433
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,330
You will beg forgiveness for your treason,

434
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,330
and you will renounce the peace agreement.

435
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,900
That will never happen.

436
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,830
I'll never do that.

437
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,230
I will never do that.

438
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,930
Oh, you will.

439
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,100
It just depends on how long it takes.

440
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,840
This immunity agreement's made out to "Dana Walsh".

441
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,160
But it's my understanding that's not her real name.

442
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,590
The lawyers are aware of that, ma'am.

443
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,760
They say the agreement will hold.

444
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,420
Too bad.

445
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,460
I thought for a moment there we had a way out.

446
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,100
I'll get these to CTU right away.

447
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,360
Thank you, Tim.

448
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
Thank you.

449
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,200
Ethan.

450
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,600
Still here, Madam President.

451
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,030
Are you going to be all right?

452
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,860
I'll let my doctors field that one.

453
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,100
They're running tests.

454
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,130
Good.

455
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,630
Madam President,

456
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,630
what's the situation with Hassan?

457
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,630
Is he safe?

458
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,930
They have him, Ethan.

459
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,530
The IRK agents have Hassan.

460
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,930
Oh, dear God.

461
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,960
They're going to kill him.

462
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,060
Not if CTU can get there in time.

463
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,430
There's a rescue operation underway.

464
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,760
They know where he is?

465
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,800
They will shortly.

466
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,830
The terrorists had someone working for them inside CTU

467
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,730
an analyst named Dana Walsh.

468
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,900
I've agreed to a conditional immunity deal

469
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,430
in exchange for her cooperation.

470
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,060
Conditional on what?

471
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,260
Omar Hassan's safe return.

472
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,260
Ethan... there's a real possibility

473
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,730
Hassan won't survive this.

474
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,230
I hate to even think about it,

475
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,400
but we have to be prepared.

476
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,260
Is there any chance that the person who succeeds Hassan

477
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,600
will be someone we can deal with?

478
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,600
The IRK constitution is vague

479
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,630
when it comes to succession of power.

480
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,400
There's no telling who'd take his place.

481
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,430
Besides, Hassan barely was able

482
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,000
to form a consensus in his own administration.

483
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,200
It took a man of his charisma

484
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,830
and passion to achieve that.

485
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,930
I'm sorry to be so negative, Madam President,

486
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,930
but we have to be realistic.

487
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,360
Without Hassan, there can be no peace.

488
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,860
They're ready to start the briefing with Dana

489
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,930
or whatever her name is.

490
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,830
- Arlo?  - Yeah. I heard you.

491
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,300
You work with someone for a year, you think you know them.

492
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,560
How did we all miss this?

493
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,560
I always knew there was something wrong with her.

494
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,800
She was a little too perfect.

495
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,560
But I never imagined she'd be a terrorist.

496
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:28,100
I should've seen it.

497
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,900
She was acting weird all day.

498
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,900
Maybe if I'd been looking in the right spot,

499
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,230
like somewhere in the vicinity of her face,

500
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,250
I might've noticed something useful.

501
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,730
She played us. Get over it.

502
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,230
Sit down.

503
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,260
I'm only telling you this because you're going

504
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,260
to find out soon enough.

505
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,760
Dana's been given provisional immunity by the President.

506
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,500
What?!

507
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,530
She's providing us with intelligence

508
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,530
as to the whereabouts of the people holding President Hassan.

509
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
I don't care what she's providing.

510
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,860
She's a traitor and a murderer!

511
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,100
Cole...

512
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,830
You can't let her walk! Not her!

513
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,500
Stop.

514
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,660
I know you've been burned

515
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,830
professionally, personally.

516
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,400
Get over it.

517
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,000
Jack Bauer's heading up the operation to rescue President Hassan.

518
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,800
He wants you on his team.

519
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,030
But Dana

520
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,030
is briefing the group.

521
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,660
Do you have a problem with that?

522
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,900
No, sir.

523
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,160
I'm fine.

524
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,330
Good.

525
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,230
Stand by outside the conference room.

526
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,700
His name is Samir Mehran.

527
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,530
Before the IRK planted him here,

528
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,530
he was a soldier with the Revolutionary Guard.

529
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,360
Altogether, he has about six men left.

530
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,930
You killed the rest.

531
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,360
You're absolutely sure that's where they're holding Hassan?

532
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,400
Yes. The entrance to the tenement

533
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,830
is on Holland Avenue with exits to the rear and east side.

534
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,330
He'll have at least a couple lookouts stationed.

535
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,530
What's the apartment number?

536
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,660
I don't know.

537
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,700
What's the apartment number?

538
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,800
If I knew, I would tell you.

539
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,730
Somewhere above the first floor.

540
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,930
What makes you say that?

541
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,930
Because the building is populated.

542
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,430
Some families.

543
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,100
Samir will want to use them as human shields

544
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,830
in the event of a frontal attack.

545
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,660
We got what we need.

546
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,700
We have to move.

547
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,660
Secure the prisoner.

548
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,200
Take her to holding.

549
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,200
Hey. You all right?

550
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,630
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

551
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,760
Get your men and assemble them in the motor pool.

552
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Let's move.

553
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,400
Let's go

554
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,460
Just read the statement, Omar.

555
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,360
Put an end to this.

556
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,550
This is only going to get worse.

557
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,700
Tell the people you've made a terrible mistake.

558
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,800
Atone for your sins.

559
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,830
You are wasting your time.

560
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,500
I will never do what you ask.

561
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,430
Read the statement, Omar,

562
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,360
or I will start cutting pieces from your body.

563
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,860
Whether I live...

564
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,860
or I die...

565
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,900
this peace will happen somehow.

566
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,600
And men like you

567
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,300
will have no place to hide.

568
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,230
This peace dies right here with you!

569
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,800
You said the drug would break down his resistance.

570
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,930
It should be working.

571
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,400
Give him another injection.

572
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,630
Any more could kill him.

573
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,630
I don't care.

574
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,930
Do it.

575
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,460
Samir, we can't continue this forever.

576
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:06,660
If he won't read the statement, we must think of something else.

577
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,330
He will break.

578
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,160
I know it.

579
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,660
He's stronger than we thought.

580
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,000
We need to accept it.

581
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,500
Stop.

582
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,530
Prepare the Internet feed.

583
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,830
What are you going to do?

584
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,530
I will tell the world of his crimes.

585
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,700
And carry out his sentence.

586
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,660
Madam President, I just got word from CTU.

587
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,700
Their tactical team is approaching the staging area.

588
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,700
They also have real-time uplink.

589
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,930
Dalia and Kayla Hassan have asked to speak with you.

590
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They're in the waiting area.

591
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,560
I was told you found my husband.

592
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,560
He's being held in an apartment building.

593
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,500
CTU is preparing to go in

594
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,630
after him.

595
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,000
Do they know if he's still alive?

596
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,000
We believe that he is, but we can't be sure.

597
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,900
We have our best men in the field

598
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,000
and they're going to do everything they can

599
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,560
to save your husband's life.

600
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,830
But you cannot guarantee he will be saved.

601
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,930
I'm afraid not.

602
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,230
But I assure you, we're going to do everything

603
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,230
we can.

604
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,200
Thank you, Madam President.

605
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,430
Madam President, we need you in the situation room.

606
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,460
We'll know something very soon.

607
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,060
NSA just red-flagged a live feed going out on the Internet.

608
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,760
It's President Hassan.

609
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,960
Put it through.

610
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,200
President Hassan is a traitor to his country.

611
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,260
His belief that we must capitulate to the infidels

612
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,030
nearly condemned our people to a life of subjugation.

613
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,530
What follows is a list of his crimes.

614
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,630
You will see that he deserves the harshest punishment.

615
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,530
Hassan has tortured and sent his bulldogs

616
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,260
on other leaders of the society

617
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,800
The scholars...

618
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,300
Does the video give us any clue

619
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,560
to Hassan's location in the building?

620
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,730
Look at the shadows behind his head.

621
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,330
The light coming from the left is natural light.

622
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,160
It's a window.

623
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,730
You're sure that's daylight?

624
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,900
Yes, the light temperature is 5,600 degrees Kelvin.

625
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,100
That's the building where Dana said Hassan is being held.

626
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,060
Based on the angle of the shadows,

627
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,730
they're in an east-facing apartment.

628
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,500
By the height of the surrounding buildings,

629
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
they're on the fourth floor.

630
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,730
Sir, the drone is in position.

631
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,200
There are two lookouts on the roof.

632
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,400
Patch me through to Jack.

633
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,960
It's Bauer.

634
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,530
Jack, we've got a good fix on Hassan's location.

635
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,430
We think he's in an east facing apartment on the fourth floor.

636
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,360
We also confirm two look-outs on the roof, both armed.

637
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,000
- North and south corner.  - Copy that.

638
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,400
You need to hurry, Jack.

639
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,030
The terrorist is running a live Internet feed.

640
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,900
He's reading a list of Hassan's so-called crimes.

641
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,330
As soon as he's done, he's going to execute him.

642
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,600
We're at the staging area; I'll let you know

643
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,460
as soon as we're moving in.

644
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,860
- Is this everyone?  - Yes, sir.

645
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,360
Okay, Cole, I want you and your team to take down the lookouts;

646
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,500
I want coordinated kill shots and I want you to cover

647
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,130
the perimeter as we move in.

648
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,960
Charters, Bank, you're gonna be with me.

649
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,960
We're gonna use audio surveillance to locate

650
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,530
the apartment where they're holding President Hassan.

651
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,730
I want all of you to silence your weapons.

652
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,900
The only way this operation works

653
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
is if we take these terrorists by surprise.

654
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,230
If they get a sense that we're moving in on them,

655
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,130
President Hassan is dead.

656
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,160
I don't have to tell you what we're up against,

657
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,060
and the significance of this operation.

658
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,200
Trust your training and let's get this done.

659
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,230
Check your comms, we'll meet at the rally points in two minutes.

660
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,560
Renee, I need to talk to you.

661
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,530
I want you with me on the assault team.

662
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,930
I thought you wanted me running ops.

663
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,600
In order for this to work,

664
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,900
I need every agent with experience I can get.

665
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,560
But you need to understand

666
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,560
this goes against every instinct I have.

667
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,700
So you need to promise me that you'll stay

668
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,500
right behind me and you'll do exactly as I say.

669
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,530
Okay.

670
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,830
- No, I need you to promise me.  - I promise.

671
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,000
Get ready.

672
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,600
Target A acquired.

673
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,360
B Target moving towards you.

674
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,700
20 feet... ten feet...

675
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,500
On my mark.

676
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,460
Now.

677
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,930
Lookouts are down, you're clear.

678
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,660
CTU, we're moving in towards the building now.

679
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,830
We see you, Jack.

680
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,400
It has become a tool

681
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,130
for truth-hiding, misinformation

682
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,430
and propaganda for his regime.

683
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,400
Openly supports the masked

684
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,630
poisonous vipers of America.

685
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,330
This man is not our President!

686
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,600
He's an arrogant pretender who would sell our women

687
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,800
and children to the infidels

688
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,360
and the imperialists of the West.

689
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,500
His terrible crimes against our people demand retribution!

690
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,330
We're not terrorists,

691
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,700
as President Taylor and her other rats would label us.

692
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,500
Don't move.

693
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,060
Federal agent. Get down on the ground now.

694
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,530
Get down on the ground.

695
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,130
Hastings, we just took a hostile out on the second floor.

696
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,630
Are we still good to go?

697
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,960
Yes, Jack, you are still good.

698
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,760
Cover that, we need to move now.

699
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,400
corruption and promiscuity over our country

700
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,700
and bringing back foreign domination

701
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,300
over the Islamic Republic of Kamistan.

702
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,830
This is the dog that we sent to speak for our country.

703
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,830
He's Taylor's puppet!

704
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,660
we've seen in a generation.

705
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,630
We could finally lay the foundation for real peace...

706
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,000
He who is guilty.

707
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,700
That's it, Jack.

708
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,660
It's all right.

709
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,500
We're not here to hurt you.

710
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,530
Where's your mommy and daddy?

711
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,560
Federal agent! Get on the ground now!

712
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
One more word and I will kill you.

713
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,960
On the couch now.

714
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,760
Jack, looks like Samir's wrapping it up.

715
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,200
You need to get in there right now!

716
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,730
Today we get justice.

717
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,960
Taylor and her country want to strip our nation of progress

718
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,830
and all defense capabilities.

719
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,860
She sees our great nation rising together,

720
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,730
making strong advancement in nuclear technology.

721
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,460
so much that she would charm Hassan

722
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,000
and make him her subordinate.

723
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,300
And Hassan's own greed-fueled lies and promises

724
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,860
that he never intended to keep.

725
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,500
I have a visual on Hassan.

726
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,860
Ready to engage.

727
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,500
You would do the same if your homes were occupied.

728
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,160
We have thousands of volunteers who have promised their service

729
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,400
and are willing to give their lives.

730
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,060
No...

731
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,860
No!

732
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,360
All he sought to create

733
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,360
is a hollow, soulless nation.

734
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,600
You will soon hear the cry to rise up and renew.

735
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,560
We will take back our country.

736
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,300
Remember this day as the beginning of a revolution.

737
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,560
It is the day we eliminated a tyrant.

738
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,100
Hassan has torn us apart, muzzled us, divided us

739
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,730
with his condescending peace treaty

740
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,960
of subjugation to the Americans.

741
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:20,460
For this treachery, the penalty is death.

742
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,700
I'm sorry.

743
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,630
I will carry out this sentence myself.

744
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,460
The time has come for this criminal to pay for his treason.

745
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,100
Our country demands justice.

746
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,430
Omar Hassan shall pay with his own blood.

747
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,700
Oh!

748
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,100
Oh...

749
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,230
Jack.

750
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,730
Jack, talk to me.

751
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,760
The, uh, statement was prerecorded.

752
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,660
He was dead before we got here.

753
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,000
Oh...

754
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,160
Oh.

755
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,800
Call CTU.

756
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,160
I want to know what the hell went wrong.

757
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,560
And clear the screens.

758
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,360
We were too late.

759
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,760
We weren't able to save him.

760
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,230
I'm sorry.

761
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,360
- No...!  - I'm sorry.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
