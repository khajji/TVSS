1
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:14,759
Who is it
you're looking for?

2
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:17,428
Someone who can give me the
names of everyone else involved.

3
00:00:17,496 --> 00:00:20,698
I need you to write the story
in case I don't make it.

4
00:00:20,766 --> 00:00:22,166
<i>If Dalia Hassan finds out</i>

5
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,702
that the Russians had a hand
in the death of her husband,

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,104
she'll never sign the agreement.

7
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:27,505
MEREDITH:
I need to speak to your mother.

8
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:29,941
It's about the people
who really murdered your father.

9
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,476
We know who is responsible.

10
00:00:31,543 --> 00:00:32,643
What you don't know is,

11
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:33,811
those people
were working under

12
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:35,813
the orders of Russian agents.

13
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,181
Bauer made contact

14
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:38,449
with Meredith Reed.

15
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:40,351
My God.
You need

16
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,286
to call her
publisher and demand

17
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:44,789
that they do not
run the story.

18
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:45,923
You're suggesting
muzzling the press?

19
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:48,126
If you don't use the
power of your office

20
00:00:48,193 --> 00:00:49,927
to shut this story down,

21
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:53,498
your peace agreement
won't be the only casualty.

22
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:55,500
I need you to contact the FBI.

23
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,668
Have them locate Reed

24
00:00:57,736 --> 00:01:00,605
and seize whatever evidence
she purports to have.

25
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,440
Meredith Reed? FBI.

26
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:03,608
You're under arrest.

27
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:04,809
Let's go.
But I...

28
00:01:04,877 --> 00:01:06,144
You were right
about Jack.

29
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,478
He is working
with somebody.

30
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:09,847
It's James Ricker,
ex-CIA op.

31
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:11,649
We found him living in a place
on Mercer Street.

32
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,885
He's not gonna be happy
we tracked him down.

33
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:15,586
<i>I need you to talk to him.</i>

34
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:17,388
Get him to tell us
where Jack is.

35
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:19,490
Are you good with that, or
have you still not taken sides?

36
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:22,160
I want to expose this cover-up
as much as you. I'm in.

37
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:25,963
(tires screech, horn honks)

38
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:28,032
That's Jack Bauer!

39
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,534
(coughing)

40
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,736
Get up. I could just
kill you right here.

41
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:33,771
<i>Do you know the name
of the person inside</i>

42
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,139
the Russian government
who's giving the orders?

43
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:36,307
I want that name.

44
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,842
Jack.
Give me the name!

45
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,010
I'll tell you.
Four.

46
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:40,678
Three.
Mikhail Novakovich!

47
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:41,712
Where's Novakovich?

48
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,381
He's dead.

49
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:45,149
Bauer just came in shooting.

50
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:47,318
Mikhail Novakovich
was just murdered

51
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,653
by Jack Bauer.

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,954
What?

53
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,756
<i>LOGAN:
As far as, uh,</i>

54
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:52,757
Bauer is concerned,

55
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,492
the trail ended
with Novakovich.

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,961
Then Bauer has no idea

57
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,796
that Novakovich was operating
under my orders?

58
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:00,264
None.

59
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:02,967
If you're so worried about
Bauer, you never should have

60
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,536
given the order
to kill Renee Walker.

61
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:24,188
(phone ringing)

62
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,892
Arlo.

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,361
Cole, I just picked up
a preliminary flash.

64
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:32,597
Jack murdered Novakovich
at his hotel,

65
00:02:32,664 --> 00:02:34,265
and six of his security guards.

66
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,466
According to a witness,

67
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,401
Jack killed all seven men
on his own.

68
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,103
Then fell right back
off the radar.

69
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:42,106
Eden can't find
any trace of him.

70
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:43,641
Does Chloe know about this?

71
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:44,842
I just talked to her,

72
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,911
and she should be
at the U.N. any minute.

73
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,948
Cole, I know that we need
this evidence that Jack has,

74
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,917
but this crime scene
is a slaughterhouse.

75
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:56,053
Does Chloe really still
think she can pull this off?

76
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:57,855
If anyone can talk Jack down,
it's Chloe.

77
00:02:57,923 --> 00:02:59,223
And if she can't?

78
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,391
Then we're both
prepared to do

79
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,525
whatever it takes
to stop him.

80
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:02,760
Even when Novakovich's

81
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:04,428
whole security staff couldn't?

82
00:03:04,496 --> 00:03:05,930
What do you want me to do, Arlo?

83
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:07,999
The truth about what went down
today needs to get out,

84
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,268
and that's not going to happen
unless we get to Jack.

85
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:11,969
Look, I'm coming up
on Ricker's apartment.

86
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,170
I'm going in.

87
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:14,639
Cole. COLE: What?

88
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,841
Ricker went to a lot of
trouble to disappear.

89
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:19,010
He's not going to like
that you found him.

90
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:21,078
I'm not expecting him to.

91
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:33,291
TV REPORTER: You're looking
at the U.N. Plaza gardens

92
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:34,458
and the podium from which

93
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:35,860
all three co-sponsors

94
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:38,095
of the peace treaty
will address the public

95
00:03:38,163 --> 00:03:41,165
following a private signing
ceremony inside the U.N.'s

96
00:03:41,233 --> 00:03:42,533
Council Chamber.

97
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:44,035
Russian President Yuri Suvarov,

98
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:45,703
the third co-sponsor
of the treaty,

99
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:47,438
is en route to the U.N.

100
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:49,840
where he will join
President Taylor

101
00:03:49,908 --> 00:03:52,143
and acting IRK President
Dalia Hassan...

102
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,645
(computer alarm chimes)

103
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:02,153
(alarm chiming stops)

104
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:40,791
(knocking) COLE: Mr. Ricker,

105
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,159
this is Agent
Ortiz, CTU!

106
00:04:42,227 --> 00:04:43,694
Open that door.

107
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:47,431
(gun cocking)

108
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:55,973
Before you pull that trigger,

109
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,808
there's something
you ought to know.

110
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:59,810
I don't place a call
in 15 minutes,

111
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:02,980
every intelligence agency in the
country gets alerted about you.

112
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:05,449
Weapon charges alone
will get you locked up

113
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:06,817
for the duration,

114
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:09,153
Or you can help us
find Jack Bauer,

115
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,055
and we'll keep our mouths shut.

116
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,595
You think you're protecting him?

117
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:21,399
The order on Jack Bauer
is shoot to kill.

118
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,568
He knew what
he was getting himself into.

119
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,004
Jack's not thinking straight.

120
00:05:27,072 --> 00:05:29,373
Look, I read
your file.

121
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,642
I know Jack saved your life
in Damascus.

122
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,513
This is your opportunity
to pay back that debt.

123
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,015
You know how this
is gonna end, right?

124
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,217
Do you?

125
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:48,125
If Jack dies today,

126
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:50,194
it's on you.

127
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,138
Hey.

128
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,107
Wait a minute.

129
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,279
Wait a minute.

130
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,347
(garbled radio transmission)

131
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,855
Thanks, Adam.

132
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:19,990
(text alert tone)

133
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,165
Director O'Brian,
Agent Burke.

134
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,834
I have the revised security
assessment for you.

135
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,470
Ma'am, I noticed that
Agent Ortiz's name

136
00:06:32,537 --> 00:06:34,371
was back on the duty
roster. That's right.

137
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,274
He was arrested for
helping Jack Bauer.

138
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:39,944
I got him a temporary clearance
so he could help us out here.

139
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,012
He was the one who designed
the U.N. protocols

140
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,881
in the first place.
I know.

141
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:46,283
Do you really think
we can trust him?

142
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:49,420
I wouldn't have gotten him
a release if I didn't.

143
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:50,921
(phone ringing)
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:52,990
Excuse me.

145
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:56,760
(Burke clears throat)

146
00:06:57,796 --> 00:06:58,896
What happened?

147
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:00,130
COLE:
Not good, Chloe.

148
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:02,566
I think Jack's
targeting Suvarov.

149
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,068
Is that what Ricker said?

150
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,604
Yeah. Jack planted a bug
on Charles Logan,

151
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:08,572
overheard a conversation
between the two men.

152
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,407
Turns out Suvarov's the
one who gave the order

153
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:11,575
for Renee to be killed.

154
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:14,144
(sighs)
Does Ricker have a recording

155
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:15,346
of that conversation?

156
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:16,680
No. He wiped his system clean

157
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,249
as soon as he saw me coming.

158
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,751
But the surveillance rig
he gave Jack records everything

159
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,453
to a backup,
so Jack has a copy.

160
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,621
Good. We're
gonna need it.

161
00:07:23,688 --> 00:07:24,788
Why?

162
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,624
The White House
just arrested Meredith Reed.

163
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:28,492
They confiscated a data card
from her.

164
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
Dana's evidence.

165
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:32,329
Exactly. The recording
that Jack has

166
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:33,831
is the only proof
we have now.

167
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,099
(sighs)

168
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,467
Chloe, I don't know

169
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,569
that getting proof is
our first priority anymore.

170
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:40,938
We have to put an alert out
on Jack.

171
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:43,507
If we do that, then Pillar
will get to him first.

172
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:45,209
He'll kill Jack,
and he'll destroy the recording.

173
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:46,610
Chloe, we
can't stand by

174
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:48,746
and let Jack assassinate
the president of Russia.

175
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,651
No, but we can
buy ourselves time.

176
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:57,288
Can change Suvarov's
motorcade route,

177
00:07:57,355 --> 00:07:58,522
sequester him in the U.N.

178
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,457
Make it impossible
for Jack to get to him.

179
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:03,060
Yeah, except Suvarov's gonna
be standing at that podium soon,

180
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:05,396
and once he's exposed like that,
we can't protect him.

181
00:08:05,463 --> 00:08:07,031
That's not happening
for over an hour.

182
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:08,732
If we haven't found Jack
by then,

183
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,401
then we can put out the alert.

184
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:12,136
It's still taking a big risk,
Chloe.

185
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,404
I know.

186
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:14,738
All right,
get Suvarov's route changed.

187
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,574
But you're putting me
in charge of his security

188
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,175
as soon as he gets to the U.N.

189
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:19,410
How far out are you?

190
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:20,744
I'll be there in ten.

191
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,046
(car engine starting)

192
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,592
(tires squeak)

193
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,295
(garbled radio transmission)

194
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,863
Okay.

195
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,367
Sir, the flash
about Novakovich is going out.

196
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:46,003
You wanted to speak with the
president before that happened.

197
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,171
Ah.

198
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:49,173
(exhales)
Thank you, Jason.

199
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,275
Oh, um...

200
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:53,043
do we know anything about Bauer?

201
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:54,979
No. Nothing.

202
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,847
If you don't mind
me asking, sir.

203
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:59,083
What are you going
to tell the president?

204
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,855
I think it's time she...
she knows everything.

205
00:09:12,297 --> 00:09:14,231
All the delegates
are present

206
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:16,133
with the exception of Suvarov,
who's still in transit.

207
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,268
He'll be given the details
once he arrives. (phone ringing)

208
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,239
Excuse me, Tim.

209
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,608
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:26,710
I'm about to go
into the protocol meeting.

211
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:27,978
What's going on?

212
00:09:28,046 --> 00:09:30,080
I wanted you to hear this news
from me first.

213
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,348
What news?

214
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,549
I tried to

215
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:34,385
insulate you as long as I could,

216
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:36,086
preserve your plausible
deniability, but...

217
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,855
Just tell me what
you're talking about, Charles.

218
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:41,759
Jack Bauer isn't just trying
to gather evidence

219
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,093
about the conspiracy.

220
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,095
He's...

221
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:47,164
He's seeking retribution.

222
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,968
Go on.

223
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:53,971
Bauer just murdered
Mikhail Novakovich,

224
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,173
along with a good
number of his staff.

225
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:59,510
(whispering): So Novakovich was
responsible for the assassination

226
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,278
of President Hassan?

227
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,280
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

228
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,451
Novakovich was
the ranking member

229
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,219
of the Russian Delegation.

230
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:12,322
President Suvarov is going
to demand an explanation.

231
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:16,627
Actually, he's not.

232
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:20,397
Are you telling me

233
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:23,500
that Hassan's murder goes
all the way up to Suvarov?

234
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,536
Yes.

235
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:28,338
But the good news is
that Bauer doesn't know that.

236
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,541
How can you be sure?

237
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:33,644
Because according to a witness,
Bauer killed Novakovich

238
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:35,646
before he could talk.

239
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:39,349
And aside from me, Novakavich

240
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,085
is the only person who ever knew

241
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:42,853
that Suvarov
was calling the shots.

242
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:45,856
Madam President,
Bauer's finished

243
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:47,124
what he started,

244
00:10:47,192 --> 00:10:49,727
an-and Suvarov will be happy
to sweep this under the rug.

245
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,528
An-and the peace agreement
can go forward

246
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:52,796
as planned.

247
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:54,131
This is...

248
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:56,834
Really, we couldn't have
asked for a better outcome.

249
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:00,137
Except that I am asking
Dalia Hassan to shake hands

250
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,005
with her husband's murderer.

251
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,274
Madam President...
Call Suvarov.

252
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:09,379
Tell him that I am aware
of his involvement in this,

253
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:12,750
and that I will see him
at the signing.

254
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,552
(snaps cell phone shut)

255
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:26,130
My apologies.

256
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:31,135
Thank you for waiting.

257
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,173
How did the call go?
I told the president

258
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:39,276
about Suvarov's
involvement, and, um...

259
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:42,880
she understood- not that
she has an alternative.

260
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,882
Well, that's
good news, sir.

261
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:46,416
PILLAR: Your new Secret
Service detail's here

262
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,951
to escort you to the U.N.

263
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:51,388
Thank you, Jason.

264
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,957
It's been a long
road, but, uh...

265
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:56,393
(chuckles):
we're almost there.

266
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,398
(Logan groans)

267
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:04,434
(slaps car twice)

268
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,450
(phone auto-dialing)

269
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,719
Anything new on Bauer?

270
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:25,522
A security camera picked him up
leaving Novakovich's hotel.

271
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,090
Confirmed what Berkov told us.

272
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,560
Bauer was definitely wounded
during the attack.

273
00:12:29,627 --> 00:12:31,528
How badly?

274
00:12:31,596 --> 00:12:33,530
Badly enough that he's
gonna need treatment.

275
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:35,098
Getting alerts out
to medical facilities now.

276
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,967
All right, also let
Port Authority and INS know

277
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,036
Bauer might be trying
to get out of the country.

278
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,371
We'll find him- it's
only a question of time.

279
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:45,108
Maybe a little quicker
than you thought.

280
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:48,846
Slowly, take your weapon out
and pass it back to me.

281
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,180
Slowly.

282
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:59,523
Start the car and drive.

283
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,759
You saw what
I did to Pavel.

284
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,194
I didn't have
a lot of time with him.

285
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:05,629
You, I've got all the time
in the world.

286
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:08,131
So you either do what I say,
or I will take you apart

287
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,132
piece by piece.

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,367
Now, drive!

289
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:12,069
(panting)

290
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:20,944
Where are we going?

291
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,213
The U.N.

292
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:25,883
Why? You already
got what you wanted.

293
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,085
You killed
everyone involved.

294
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,486
Save your breath.

295
00:13:29,554 --> 00:13:32,890
I know about President Suvarov.

296
00:13:45,654 --> 00:13:48,322
Your delegations will be joining
you at the reception

297
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,990
after the post-signing ceremony.

298
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:52,660
And finally, on behalf
of the U.N. staff,

299
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:55,529
I would like to say
that we are all

300
00:13:55,597 --> 00:13:58,699
honored to be part
of this historic occasion.

301
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,868
Thank you for your time.

302
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:11,845
Your daughter's been waiting
inside to speak to you.

303
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:14,048
She says
it's important.

304
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:16,317
(exhales)
Let her know

305
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:18,552
I'll be right there.
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,058
Madam President.

307
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:27,194
I have something for you.

308
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:28,762
It's from Omar.

309
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:32,633
He wanted to
give it to you

310
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:36,036
to sign the agreement, and...

311
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:40,074
I'm grateful that I can
do so on his behalf.

312
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:44,445
It reads:

313
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,113
"All religions,

314
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:48,015
"all this singing,

315
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,583
"one song,

316
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:51,318
peace be with you."

317
00:14:55,323 --> 00:14:57,124
It is a verse

318
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,926
Omar would quote
from Rumi

319
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:02,796
when he was talking about what
you and he were trying to achieve.

320
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:06,033
Thank you for
seeing this through

321
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:10,037
and for helping us all
do justice to his memory.

322
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:19,880
Dalia, I am...

323
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,949
I am honored.

324
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,952
I'm very honored.

325
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,788
Th

326
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:48,709
Kayla, what is it?

327
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,211
Meredith Reed called
the residence looking for you.

328
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,480
I am not interested in
that woman's condolences.

329
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:55,115
That is not
why she called.

330
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:57,384
She says she
has information

331
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:59,987
about the people who are
behind Father's murder.

332
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:02,556
But we know who was behind
your father's death-

333
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:04,291
extremists in our country.

334
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:06,694
(whispers): She claims
that they had outside hKYp.

335
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:08,529
That the Russians were involved.

336
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:10,364
Why would she say such a thing?

337
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,599
Does she have evidence,
or is this just a rumor?

338
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,803
I don't know, but it can't have
been easy for her to call you.

339
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,472
I don't think she would have
done so because of a rumor.

340
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,307
What else did she say?

341
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,110
She wouldn't say anything more
until she talked to you.

342
00:16:23,178 --> 00:16:25,346
She left her number.

343
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:30,984
Let's call her
from the residence.

344
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:35,456
(indistinct radio transmissions)

345
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:46,233
Ann, President Suvarov's
motorcade is delayed

346
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:48,302
five minutes because
of the new route- put out

347
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,903
an all-agency.
How do you want it coded?

348
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:51,071
Eyes only.

349
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,072
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,140
(sighs)

351
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:56,944
Lanza, make sure
Burke reports here

352
00:16:57,011 --> 00:17:00,013
with a set of tactical gear
for Agent Ortiz. Yes, ma'am.

353
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:03,584
Arlo's at CTU, running
the surveillance video

354
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:04,918
through facial recognition
software.

355
00:17:04,986 --> 00:17:07,287
Still no sign of Jack.
Look, I've been thinking.

356
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:08,789
Let's say we do get this
recording from Jack.

357
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,090
What are we supposed
to do with it?

358
00:17:10,158 --> 00:17:11,492
I mean, if the
president's willing

359
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,826
to lock down
Meredith Reed...

360
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:14,962
She can't shut down
every media outlet in the world,

361
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,797
which is where
we're gonna send this file.

362
00:17:16,865 --> 00:17:19,800
We're also gonna send it to every
government employee in the country.

363
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:20,968
Legislative,
military, judiciary-

364
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:22,336
that's over
a hundred thousand people.

365
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:24,171
<i>How are we doing this?</i>

366
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,439
By using CTU servers,

367
00:17:25,507 --> 00:17:27,808
we can distribute it
simultaneously to everyone.

368
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,144
President Taylor won't
be able to stop the truth

369
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,678
from getting out.

370
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:32,913
Burke.

371
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:34,381
Good to see yo
Sir.

372
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:35,949
Did you use the
revised protocol

373
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:37,584
for President Suvarov's arrival?
Yes, ma'am.

374
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:39,987
We're now bringing the motorcade
into the FDR Drive ramp. Good.

375
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:42,689
Make sure that Agent Ortiz
has the revised protocols.

376
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:44,658
He's back in charge.

377
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:47,795
Let's take a look.

378
00:18:21,729 --> 00:18:23,530
We're going
to the Hart Building.

379
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:25,499
I want you to park underground.

380
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,474
This guard's life
is in your hands.

381
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,108
You make one move that
I don't like, I'm gonna

382
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:36,643
kill you both,
you understand?

383
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,284
Jason Pillar.

384
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:55,095
There's no one inside.

385
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:57,364
They left the building
two hours ago.

386
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:59,132
Yeah, I'm just running

387
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,434
a last-minute
security check.

388
00:19:00,502 --> 00:19:02,336
Of course, sir.

389
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:08,342
Is there anything
else, sir?

390
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:13,680
No. Thank you.

391
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:18,852
Drive.

392
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:24,625
(grunting quietly)

393
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:26,693
(panting)

394
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:32,332
Pull in over here.

395
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,874
Slowly, with
your right hand,

396
00:19:40,942 --> 00:19:42,776
take the keys
out of the ignition

397
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:44,678
and pass them back.

398
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:52,252
Get out of the car.

399
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,387
(panting)

400
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:55,822
Now!

401
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,524
Close the door.

402
00:19:57,592 --> 00:19:59,192
Put your hands
on the roof.

403
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,230
Don't you move.

404
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:06,266
Suvarov's not gonna be out on
the podium for another hour.

405
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:07,434
You're not gonna
make it that long,

406
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:08,502
not the way you're bleeding.

407
00:20:10,805 --> 00:20:13,307
(panting)

408
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,342
Slowly,

409
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,477
back up towards me.

410
00:20:24,786 --> 00:20:27,187
Stop. Turn around.

411
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:31,024
Good.

412
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:33,393
You're gonna
suture me up.

413
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,396
(groans)

414
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,665
You try and make
a move on me,

415
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:40,267
the slightest twitch,

416
00:20:40,335 --> 00:20:42,469
I will put a bullet
in your brain.

417
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:43,637
You got it?

418
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,272
Yes.

419
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:48,008
(groans)

420
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,714
(Jack panting)

421
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,049
(gasps)

422
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:01,588
I don't understand
something.

423
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:04,224
You've spent your entire career
working outside the system;

424
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:06,259
you've always had a good reason.

425
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:09,830
But this...
it's just blood lost.

426
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:12,532
You're destroying an agreement
that took years to put together.

427
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,502
An agreement made by
murderers and liars.

428
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,104
(gasps)
Murderers?

429
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:20,407
You're the one killing
people in cold blood.

430
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:23,443
Everybody I took out had
a hand in today's attack.

431
00:21:23,511 --> 00:21:25,679
But who makes you
judge and jury?

432
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,280
President Taylor,

433
00:21:27,348 --> 00:21:29,549
when she agreed
to the cover-up.

434
00:21:29,617 --> 00:21:33,320
I would have accepted
justice by law...

435
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:36,990
but that was taken away
from me by people like you.

436
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:41,228
So you're right-
I am judge and jury.

437
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:43,764
Now, step back.

438
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,332
Turn around.

439
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:47,834
Start to move back
towards the car.

440
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:49,870
Look, I came in after
Hassan and Renee were killed.

441
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:52,472
I didn't have anything to do
with that, you have to believe me.

442
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,675
Get on your knees! Please,
Bauer, I'm telling you the truth.

443
00:21:54,742 --> 00:21:56,710
I've got a family;
I've got a little girl.

444
00:21:56,778 --> 00:21:58,278
Shut up.

445
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,053
Please...

446
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,689
(muttering): I'm
telling you the truth.

447
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:09,756
(grunts)

448
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:14,227
(loud thump)

449
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:18,365
(panting)

450
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,934
(yells)

451
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,161
Still no answer.

452
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:59,564
Are you sure this is
Meredith Reed's number?

453
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:01,899
It's the number she gave me.
Then why isn't she answering?

454
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:04,469
I just talked to Gary
Klausner, Ms. Reed's editor.

455
00:23:04,536 --> 00:23:07,605
He doesn't know where she is
and has no way to reach her.

456
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:10,041
He seemed very anxious
to get off the phone.

457
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:17,815
Where are you going?

458
00:23:17,883 --> 00:23:19,350
President Taylor and I
are supposed

459
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:20,885
to be sitting across the table

460
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:22,954
from Yuri Suvarov
in less than an hour.

461
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:25,390
If his government was involved
in murdering your father,

462
00:23:25,457 --> 00:23:27,792
President Taylor needs to know.

463
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:35,633
TV NEWS ANCHOR: Following
the death of Omar Hassan,

464
00:23:35,701 --> 00:23:38,102
President Suvarov
was reportedly pessimistic

465
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,471
about the viability
of the peace treaty.

466
00:23:40,539 --> 00:23:42,040
But rumors of
a Russian withdrawal

467
00:23:42,107 --> 00:23:43,875
were soon dismissed
by the White House,

468
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:45,209
and President Suvarov
is expected

469
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:47,378
to arrive at the U.N. shortly.
(knocking)

470
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:48,780
Yes?

471
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,715
Excuse me,
Madam President.

472
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:52,350
It's Dalia Hassan.

473
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:54,152
I'll have to call her back.

474
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,653
She's outside, ma'am.

475
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:57,822
She says it's urgent.

476
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:02,527
Send her in.

477
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:11,069
(clears throat)

478
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:16,341
(footsteps approaching)

479
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:20,712
(sighs)
Madam President, forgive me.

480
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,247
I have just heard something

481
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:24,615
that is very
disturbing.

482
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:25,983
What did you hear?

483
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:27,685
That the Russian government,

484
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:29,387
or people within
the Russian government,

485
00:24:29,455 --> 00:24:31,155
were involved

486
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:33,291
in the murder
of my husband.

487
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,093
Where did you hear this?

488
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,695
My daughter
received a phone call

489
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:39,931
from the journalist,
Meredith Reed.

490
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:42,033
Have you spoken
with her yourself?

491
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:43,501
No.

492
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,269
I've tried everything,

493
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:48,439
but I've been
unable to reach her.

494
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:51,376
I came here to ask for
your help finding Miss Reed.

495
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:54,045
I need to know
if there is any truth

496
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:55,546
in what she said.

497
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:57,648
Dalia, we heard a rumor

498
00:24:57,716 --> 00:25:00,418
about the Russians
being involved as well.

499
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:03,087
And you didn't tell me?

500
00:25:03,155 --> 00:25:04,989
No. Because we looked into it

501
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:07,625
and found that there was
nothing backing it up.

502
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:09,394
It was just
a frivolous accusation.

503
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:11,295
Whatever else she may be,

504
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:13,631
Meredith Reed is not
a frivolous woman.

505
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:14,999
She came to me,

506
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:18,870
someone she knew would have
every reason to doubt her.

507
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:20,872
(clears throat)
Dalia...

508
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:23,708
I know that you want answers...

509
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:27,278
but we are signing the agreement
in less than an hour.

510
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:30,782
Madam President, I feel like
you're not listening to me.

511
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:34,118
Before I sign a treaty
with people who may have

512
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:37,755
murdered my husband,
I need help finding this woman.

513
00:25:37,823 --> 00:25:39,056
Please.

514
00:25:39,124 --> 00:25:43,661
I will do the best I can
in the time that we have left.

515
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:45,897
I don't think
I'm making myself clear.

516
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:48,466
Until I determine
if her allegations are true,

517
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,401
I will not sign this treaty.

518
00:25:50,469 --> 00:25:52,170
Dalia...

519
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:54,972
please, be reasonable.

520
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,808
This is my position,
Madam President.

521
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,476
I will not change my mind.

522
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:03,281
(inhales and exhales loudly)

523
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:06,150
Then you...
You leave me no choice.

524
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:14,459
I had Meredith Reed arrested.

525
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,361
Why?

526
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,531
Because her allegations
would be too damaging.

527
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:22,066
That doesn't make any sense.

528
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:23,968
You wouldn't arrest someone
for making

529
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,037
false allegations.

530
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:31,209
Unless they aren't false.

531
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,647
You knew!

532
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:39,951
You knew the Russians

533
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:42,720
were behind my husband's death,
and you said nothing?!

534
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,556
Dalia,

535
00:26:45,624 --> 00:26:47,391
I am so sorry.

536
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:48,993
(sighs)

537
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:52,363
It-it was an
im-impossible situation.

538
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:53,865
(sighs)

539
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:55,733
I was trying to protect you.

540
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,134
Protect me?

541
00:26:57,202 --> 00:26:58,703
You betrayed me!

542
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,173
Dalia, we are about
to complete the most important

543
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,442
diplomatic action
in generations.

544
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,312
Your husband
sacrificed his life to preserve

545
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,647
this agreement...

546
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,382
How dare you invoke my husband!

547
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,584
He never would have stood
for this!

548
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:20,892
This treaty happened
because he trusted you.

549
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:24,395
And even though every fiber
in my being wanted to go home

550
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:27,431
and grieve, I carried on
because I trusted you.

551
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,867
But not anymore.

552
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:31,435
I will not make peace

553
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:33,271
with the people
who murdered my husband.

554
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:34,539
Or with you.

555
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,941
There will be
no agreement.

556
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:42,046
I will be entering
a formal complaint

557
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:43,915
with the United Nations,

558
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:45,583
demanding that you
release Ms. Reed,

559
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:48,886
and disclose whatever
evidence you've kept from me

560
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:51,656
and from the rest of the world!

561
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,392
Stop!

562
00:28:00,265 --> 00:28:02,900
In one hour, you will stand

563
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:05,570
beside me
in the council chamber,

564
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:08,139
and you will sign the treaty
your husband and I agreed to.

565
00:28:08,206 --> 00:28:09,540
I will not!

566
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:11,742
You will!

567
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,844
Because if you don't,

568
00:28:13,912 --> 00:28:18,849
my administration will disclose
hard, indisputable evidence

569
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:21,385
that agents inside
your intelligence service

570
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:23,788
attempted to detonate
a nuclear device

571
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:26,791
on our soil,
which will give me

572
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:31,028
all the justification I need
to retaliate against the IRK

573
00:28:31,096 --> 00:28:34,565
with the full force
of the American military.

574
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:36,400
It will be decades before

575
00:28:36,468 --> 00:28:38,936
your country recovers.

576
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,610
But it doesn't need
to come to that.

577
00:28:45,677 --> 00:28:48,813
All you have to do
is sign the agreement.

578
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,523
Dalia?!

579
00:29:02,027 --> 00:29:04,028
(door slams)

580
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:52,327
(clattering)

581
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:09,544
(panting)

582
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:16,684
First they murder my husband,
and now this woman

583
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:20,388
who has lied to me
is threatening my country!

584
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,493
(panting)

585
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:28,429
I don't see a way out of this,
Madam President.

586
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:34,402
We can tell the world
what these Russian bastards did,

587
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,138
and how President Taylor
protected them.

588
00:31:37,206 --> 00:31:39,174
We can take our case
directly to The Hague.

589
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,209
There is no case.

590
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:43,211
No proof to support any
of these accusations.

591
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,579
More important,

592
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:46,214
there are President Taylor's
threats to consider.

593
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:47,415
We cannot dismiss them.

594
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:50,418
Our military can protect us
from incursion.

595
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:54,422
And if necessary, we can
reactivate our nuclear program!

596
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,358
Giving your husband's enemies

597
00:31:57,426 --> 00:32:00,728
exactly what they wanted
in the first place.

598
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:04,065
In addition to providing her
with even more of an excuse

599
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:06,701
to launch a preemptive
military strike against us.

600
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:10,638
I don't care what President
Taylor said; she wouldn't dare.

601
00:32:11,707 --> 00:32:14,976
Can you really take that chance?

602
00:32:17,012 --> 00:32:18,713
(phone rings)

603
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,819
Yes?

604
00:32:26,856 --> 00:32:29,424
Thank you.

605
00:32:33,462 --> 00:32:37,232
Yuri Suvarov's delegation
will be arriving any moment.

606
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:41,236
President Taylor is expecting
you there to greet him.

607
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,774
(panting)

608
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:59,053
CHLOE:
Agent Ortiz?

609
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:01,022
What's going on?

610
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,257
I spoke with Arlo.

611
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:04,192
He got a facial recognition hit
on Jack.

612
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,593
Where?

613
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:08,129
Inside our perimeter.

614
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:09,764
He's here, Cole.

615
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:12,901
He's been
careful to avoid

616
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:14,936
all the security cameras,
but Arlo found this.

617
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:16,604
It's from the 22nd floor

618
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:19,307
of the Hart Building
across the street from the U.N.

619
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,942
The software picked up
his reflection.

620
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,644
How did he get
into the building?

621
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,479
According to the logs,
the only person

622
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:27,448
that entered the building within
the past 20 minutes was Pillar.

623
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:28,983
Jack must have
taken him hostage.

624
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,952
The windows on the east side
of the building give him

625
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,553
a clean line of sight
down onto the podium.

626
00:33:32,621 --> 00:33:34,622
I'm going to
go find him.

627
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,957
I'm going with you.

628
00:33:36,025 --> 00:33:37,158
You can't.

629
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,993
It would just
cause a fight.

630
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,262
I'm the only one that Jack will
listen to. And what if he doesn't?

631
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,431
(sighs)

632
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,433
Give me 20 minutes.

633
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,235
If you don't
hear from me,

634
00:33:47,303 --> 00:33:48,569
we'll follow through
with our plan.

635
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:50,371
Sound the alarm about Jack
and secure Suvarov.

636
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,975
20 minutes.

637
00:33:54,043 --> 00:33:55,510
Okay.
And keep your comm open.

638
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,812
I want to know what's
going on. I can't.

639
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,247
CTU is monitoring
all frequencies.

640
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:01,115
It's too risky.

641
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:03,952
All right.

642
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,287
At least take this.

643
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:08,489
Thanks.

644
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:10,591
Be careful.

645
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:14,662
(switch clicks)

646
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,130
(computer chirps)

647
00:34:16,198 --> 00:34:17,799
Where's O'Brian headed?

648
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:21,035
She's running a last-minute
perimeter sweep.

649
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,503
By herself?

650
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:24,872
Keep a real-time uplink open
with Suvarov's security people.

651
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,041
Let me know
when it's up and running.

652
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,010
Yes, sir.

653
00:34:34,683 --> 00:34:36,784
(sighs)

654
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:38,353
Okay.

655
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:41,022
(beeps)

656
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:44,158
Hey.

657
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:45,827
(sighs)

658
00:34:45,894 --> 00:34:47,462
As long as I can remember,

659
00:34:47,529 --> 00:34:49,697
every time
I've had to talk to you,

660
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:52,166
it seems,
for one reason or another,

661
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:55,870
I've started out
by telling you how sorry I am.

662
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:58,740
I'm not going to do that
to you now.

663
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:00,775
You're going to hear a lot
of stories

664
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:02,276
about what I've done today.

665
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:04,178
Some of them may even be true.

666
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:06,347
But no one, and I mean no one

667
00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:10,218
can tell you why I did
what I did except for me.

668
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:14,055
And a lot of good people died
today.

669
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:16,057
Not just President Hassan.

670
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:20,228
Operatives from CTU, members of
other law enforcement agencies.

671
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:24,365
ReneWalker.

672
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:30,705
Who I was very close to.

673
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,986
Yes?

674
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:46,754
Thank you.

675
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,325
President Suvarov's motorcade
has just rounded the corner.

676
00:35:51,393 --> 00:35:53,995
Was Mrs. Hassan notified
of his arrival?

677
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:55,229
I believe
so, ma'am.

678
00:35:55,297 --> 00:35:56,964
Yes or no, Tim?
Which is it?

679
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:58,232
Is she coming or not?

680
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,902
Why wouldn't she be?

681
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,934
âª âª

682
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:44,278
President Taylor,

683
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:47,215
that we are all here together

684
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:49,383
is a tribute
to your persistence.

685
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,788
Mrs. Hassan, I am

686
00:36:53,856 --> 00:36:55,790
sorry for your loss.

687
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:58,392
I admired your husband
very much.

688
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,229
We're wanted upstairs
for the press conference.

689
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:03,064
Yes, of course.

690
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:06,100
Mr. President.

691
00:37:10,372 --> 00:37:12,940
Dalia, I know that this is
very difficult for you.

692
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,810
There is nothing left
for either of us to say,

693
00:37:15,878 --> 00:37:18,146
Madam President.

694
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:32,714
(garbled radio transmission)

695
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,249
Chloe O'Brian,
Director of CTU.

696
00:37:34,316 --> 00:37:35,717
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:38,319
Master key and building
schematics you requested.

698
00:37:38,387 --> 00:37:39,387
(beeps)

699
00:37:40,756 --> 00:37:42,757
(applause)

700
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:55,003
Good afternoon,
fellow delegates

701
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,538
and ladies and gentlemen
of the press.

702
00:37:57,606 --> 00:38:01,843
The last 24 hours have been
the most difficult in this

703
00:38:01,911 --> 00:38:04,479
long and challenging road
that we've all traveled together

704
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:06,247
to reach this moment.

705
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,750
Now, the eyes
of the entire world are looking

706
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:11,452
to the leaders
standing here with me now, ready

707
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,790
to usher in a new era
of transparency, honesty

708
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:18,526
and trust.

709
00:38:18,594 --> 00:38:21,529
President Taylor,
President Hassan

710
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:24,732
President Suvarov
have each risen

711
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,535
to this challenge
for the sake of world peace.

712
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:30,238
And the treaty
that they have created together

713
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:33,107
represents the culmination
of their courageous efforts.

714
00:38:33,175 --> 00:38:35,243
(applause)

715
00:38:40,282 --> 00:38:42,617
Agent Burke?

716
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,452
Sir.
I need you to assemble

717
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,454
a ten-man squad
and deploy them to Sector C-7.

718
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:48,389
The Hart Building, sir? We
already have men on post there.

719
00:38:48,457 --> 00:38:49,757
Not nearly enough
if there's a threat

720
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:50,925
anywhere along that corridor.

721
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:52,260
Keep your men
outside the building

722
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:53,528
until you hear otherwise.

723
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:55,430
Yes, sir.

724
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,472
(sighs)

725
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,780
(panting)

726
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,313
âª âª

727
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:52,820
(sighs)

728
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:09,437
(gasps)

729
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:11,172
What the hell
are you doing here?

730
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,774
You don't have to kill Suvarov.
There's another way.

731
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:14,375
Who else knows
where I am?

732
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,544
Please listen.
Who else knows?!

733
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:19,347
Cole and Arlo.

734
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:21,516
If I don't get you
out of here

735
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,284
in ten minutes,
Cole's gonna send in

736
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:26,320
every agent we have.

737
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:27,822
(panting)

738
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,891
Jack, they're going
to kill you.

739
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:32,693
There's a standing order
to shoot you on sight.

740
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:34,028
I couldn't let that happen.

741
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:36,264
You shouldn't have come
after me.

742
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:37,698
You're my friend.

743
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:40,134
I didn't have a choice.

744
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:41,803
Neither do I.

745
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,871
(gagging)

746
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,374
Don't fight it.
(coughs)

747
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:48,976
Don't fight it.

748
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:51,045
(gasping for air)

749
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:58,386
(gasping stops)

750
00:40:58,454 --> 00:41:00,455
(Jack sighs)

751
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:33,087
(rifle cocking)

752
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:50,371
(phone ringing)

753
00:41:56,278 --> 00:41:58,212
Jason, you watching this?

754
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,181
Jason?

755
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:03,451
JACK: I have a five-five-six rifle
pointed straight at your head.

756
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:08,156
Bauer.

757
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:09,724
The bullet travels

758
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:10,892
2,900 feet per second.

759
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,560
If you try and move,
you're a dead man.

760
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:14,061
Which means you need to
do exactly what I say.

761
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:15,229
Do you understand?

762
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:16,898
(gasps)

763
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:19,800
Do you understand?

764
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:23,971
Uh, Jack, I told you
everything I know.

765
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:26,908
And you thought I believed you?

766
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:28,910
(recorder clicks on)

767
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:30,978
LOGAN (on tape):
And aside from me,

768
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:32,446
Novakovich was the only one

769
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:35,616
who knew that Suvarov
was calling the shots.

770
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:37,385
(recorder clicks off)

771
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:42,423
What do you want?

772
00:42:42,491 --> 00:42:43,858
I want you to call
President Suvarov

773
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:45,226
and have him meet you

774
00:42:45,294 --> 00:42:47,461
where you are as soon as
the press conference is over.

775
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:53,801
What am I supposed to tell him?

776
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:55,303
Try the truth for a change.

777
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,837
Tell him
you've got credible intelligence

778
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:58,472
about a threat to his life.

779
