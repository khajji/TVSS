2
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:16,538
Someone needs to take the reins
of the IRK government.

3
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:19,108
Someone who believes
in the same ideals

4
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:21,009
and principles as Omar Hassan

5
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:23,512
and who shares his strength.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,147
<i>If it is the will of my people,</i>

7
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:28,317
I will take my husband's place
at the peace conference.

8
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:30,052
Did you find him,
President Taylor--

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,854
the man who killed my father?

10
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,123
Samir Mehran, yes.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,126
<i>He was badly wounded,
but he'll live to stand trial.</i>

12
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:38,994
I took care of him.

13
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:41,530
So there is no connection to us.
We're in the clear?

14
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:43,732
Maybe not.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,100
There was a woman there
who might have

16
00:00:45,168 --> 00:00:47,069
recognized me.
What woman?

17
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:49,505
She may be CTU.
I'm not sure,

18
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,573
but I've seen her face before.

19
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:52,908
Once again,

20
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:54,810
Mr. Novakovich,
you're giving

21
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:57,479
every indication that
Russia has no interest

22
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,548
in this peace ac

23
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:00,983
I don't understand

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,152
how you can believe that
installing Hassan's widow

25
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,887
will alleviate our concerns

26
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:07,823
about the instability
of the IRK government.

27
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:10,592
I have close friends in Moscow.

28
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,028
Do you honestly think
your relationships

29
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:15,063
can change their minds?

30
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:18,734
Let's just say I'm going to be
able to exercise some leverage.

31
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:20,636
Jack thinks that
someone inside of CTU

32
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:22,704
<i>is working for the terrorists.</i>

33
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:24,139
<i>I spoke to Hastings.</i>

34
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:25,641
He cleared me through.

35
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,044
Stay where you are and keep
your hands where I can...

36
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,047
<i>She just entered
the parking garage.</i>

37
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,153
Who are you, you lying bitch?

38
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:41,056
Don't move.

39
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:47,262
Renee!

40
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,931
Renee!

41
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:55,771
You were on the phone
with her right before

42
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,373
she got shot.
What were you talking about?

43
00:01:58,441 --> 00:01:59,675
Samir Mehran was given

44
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:01,577
a lethal injection at the scene
of his capture.

45
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:04,012
Renee thought she recognized
one of the EMTs from her days

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,581
undercover with the Russian mob.

47
00:02:05,648 --> 00:02:07,583
I, I've got to get back to you.

48
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,251
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,719
She didn't make it.

50
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:42,317
Sir?

51
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:48,056
Sir, I'm so sorry,
but we need to move her now.

52
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:12,014
Sir, are you the husband
of the deceased?

53
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,248
No.

54
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:15,984
Well, we need to contact
her next of kin.

55
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:18,120
Can you help us with that?

56
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:21,456
Do you know where
her parents live?

57
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:24,359
Are they alive?

58
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't know.

59
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:34,770
Sir, are you gonna be
all right?

60
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:55,357
I don't know if these will fit.

61
00:03:55,425 --> 00:03:57,259
I got them from an intern.

62
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:59,294
Thank you.

63
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:49,745
Yeah?

64
00:04:49,812 --> 00:04:52,581
Jack, I heard about Renee.

65
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:53,682
I'm so sorry.

66
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,184
What can I do to help?

67
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,486
Tell me who did this.

68
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:59,321
You told me earlier

69
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:00,822
Renee thought she
recognized someone

70
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,957
at Hassan's crime scene.

71
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,892
An EMT?

72
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,394
Let us deal with that.

73
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:07,195
We have everyone here
working on it.

74
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:09,364
Don't try and handle me,
Chloe, not now.

75
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:10,932
Who did she see?

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,434
She thought
she recognized somebody

77
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:14,636
from the Russian mob--
Red Square.

78
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,004
Bazhaev's group?
Right.

79
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:17,439
I want to talk to him.

80
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:19,875
Like I said, I'm already on it.

81
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:21,209
He's in custody
somewhere, Chloe.

82
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:22,444
I brought him in myself.

83
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:23,645
Where is he?

84
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,680
There's something
that you need to know.

85
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:29,184
Division replaced Hastings...
with me.

86
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:32,120
That means I'm responsible
for what happens to Bazhaev.

87
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:33,622
I know you're upset about Renee.

88
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,757
So am I.

89
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:37,125
But Bazhaev's our only lead.

90
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:39,628
I need whoever talks to him
to be in complete control.

91
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:41,696
I don't think
that's you right now.

92
00:05:41,764 --> 00:05:42,898
I won't interfere

93
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,032
with your investigation.

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,734
You think
you can stick to that?

95
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:47,536
I give you my word.

96
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,572
Chloe, I'm gonna ask
you one more time:

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,474
Where is he?

98
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:56,545
He's in federal court downtown.

99
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:58,346
He's being arraigned right now.

100
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:06,788
Plan was for this chamber
to be full by now.

101
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:08,723
Ethan, what in the world

102
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:09,758
are you doing here?

103
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:11,726
You should be resting.

104
00:06:11,794 --> 00:06:12,761
The doctor said

105
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,096
it was my call.
Ethan...

106
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:16,898
I'm fine.

107
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:19,267
I was thinking,
Madam President,

108
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:22,437
our discussion
about enlisting Charles Logan.

109
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,172
It's done.

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,774
You've contacted him already?

111
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:28,076
He's on his way to talk
to the Russian Foreign Minister.

112
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:30,312
Whew! That was fast.

113
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,546
The Russians
were about to announce

114
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,415
they were pulling out
of the talks.

115
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:34,416
I didn't see

116
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:36,418
a lot of options.

117
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:37,419
So,

118
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:38,820
what's his angle?

119
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,426
Madam President,
you said he's on his way

120
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:45,660
to talk to Novakovich.

121
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:51,099
How does he intend
to get the Russians to stay?

122
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:54,836
I assume he uncovered something

123
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:55,971
in his business
dealings with them.

124
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:57,539
But you don't know what it is?

125
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:00,175
Not exactly.

126
00:07:00,243 --> 00:07:03,044
Madam President,
he's operating in your name.

127
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:06,381
Shouldn't we find out?

128
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,084
I agreed I wouldn't.

129
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:12,721
Don't ask, don't tell was the
price for Logan's cooperation.

130
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,535
Mikhail!

131
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:31,840
Mr. President.

132
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,676
The Russian people join you

133
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,645
in mourning President Hassan.

134
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:39,614
His death was a tragedy
for all peace-loving nations.

135
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:42,384
You can save your platitudes.

136
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,920
You want the truth.

137
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:47,789
Why not... for a change?

138
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,793
Espresso.

139
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:58,500
I assume President Taylor
sent you here

140
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:01,469
to bring my country back
to the bargaining table.

141
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,505
She is going to be disappointed.

142
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:08,543
President Taylor lured the whole
world here with the promise

143
00:08:08,611 --> 00:08:10,178
that Hassan had united the IRK,

144
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,846
that there would be peace

145
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:13,682
for the first time in decades.

146
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:17,219
Well, now it is clear
that was a lie.

147
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:19,187
There was no unity
even with Hassan,

148
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,423
and now that he is gone...

149
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,392
...his widow Dalia can pick up
the mantle.

150
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,595
Not in our estimation.

151
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:29,397
Hassan was undone
by his own opposition.

152
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:31,700
How could his widow possibly
succeed where he failed?

153
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,235
'Cause we both know

154
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:36,171
the opposition that undid him
had outside help.

155
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,376
Nuclear threats,
assassination plots

156
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:42,644
against a heavily guarded

157
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:44,279
head of state.

158
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:45,614
This was not some

159
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,849
Third World malcontents
lashing out.

160
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:50,385
This was a highly
organized effort

161
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:54,556
orchestrated by a major rival
to the United States,

162
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:59,194
a rival convinced
that their best interest

163
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:01,329
was to stop the peace process

164
00:09:01,397 --> 00:09:02,831
by killing Hassan.

165
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:04,366
If you are insinuating...

166
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:05,700
Insinuating, no.

167
00:09:05,768 --> 00:09:09,504
<i>I'm saying it was people
inside your government,</i>

168
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:11,273
<i>first among them you.</i>

169
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:15,243
That is an

170
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:16,711
outrageous accusation.

171
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,813
It's a fact
for which I have proof.

172
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,583
I don't believe you.

173
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,652
Well, that's your right.

174
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:28,957
But I'll tell you this:
you don't want to test me.

175
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:32,227
Because what I have, I will
share with President Taylor

176
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:34,095
if you and I fail

177
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:36,931
to come to an
understanding here.

178
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,101
Espresso, sir.

179
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:49,344
At this point President Taylor
knows nothing about any of this.

180
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:52,480
I didn't see what
good could come out

181
00:09:52,548 --> 00:09:55,717
of inflaming the situation
between our countries further,

182
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:59,554
not without talking
to you first.

183
00:10:04,827 --> 00:10:06,561
And now I have.

184
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,832
The president's expecting me
at the UN.

185
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,000
I need to go.

186
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:14,002
What will you tell her?

187
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,970
What I'd would like
to tell her is

188
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:17,772
that Russia is back at the table

189
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,041
and her peace process
is on track.

190
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:24,512
But if neither of us

191
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,049
hears from you
before I get there,

192
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,918
I'm afraid what I'll have
to tell her instead

193
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:32,387
is the unvarnished truth.

194
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:40,495
"Sergei...

195
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:41,629
Buh-zay-off."

196
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:43,765
<i>Bazhaev, Your Honor.</i>

197
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,133
We'd like to waive reading.

198
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:46,801
I'm sure you would,
given the charges here.

199
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,003
I can tell you right now
I'm gonna deny bail.

200
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:53,842
Judge Ruffin, Sergei Bazhaev
is a businessman

201
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:55,343
with deep ties
to this community.

202
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:57,345
He's a foreign national.

203
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,347
That's true, Your Honor,
but he has lived

204
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:01,549
in this country continuously
since 1985.

205
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,418
His entire family lives here.

206
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:04,753
In fact, several members

207
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,355
of his family are represented
in court today:

208
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:10,091
his wife,
daughter-in-law, grandson,

209
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,961
for whom incidentally he is
the sole means of support.

210
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:16,131
According to the charges,
he's their sole support

211
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,432
because he killed
the boy's father,

212
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,733
not to mention the other counts:

213
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,002
trafficking in
nuclear materials,

214
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,438
assassination, conspiracy.

215
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:27,308
Like I said,
I'm going to deny bail.

216
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:30,211
I'm remanding him
to Marion immediately.

217
00:11:35,217 --> 00:11:38,219
Your Honor, may I have five
minutes with my client, please?

218
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:40,555
Fine. You have five minutes.

219
00:11:40,623 --> 00:11:43,391
Court will recess
for 30 minutes.

220
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:46,327
Clear the courtroom, please.

221
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,305
My client would like
to have a word with you.

222
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,688
If you touch my family,
I swear to God I...

223
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:14,722
You're not really sitting in

224
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,825
the right chair
to be making threats.

225
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,728
Who shot Renee Walker?

226
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,897
I don't know that name.

227
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:24,365
She was a former FBI Agent.

228
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,067
Approximately six years ago,

229
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:27,936
she worked undercover
in your organization.

230
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:31,739
Earlier today, she recognized
one of your men as Red Square.

231
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:33,141
There is no Red Square.

232
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:35,743
Not anymore.

233
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:37,712
Let me explain myself.

234
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,349
This Agent, Renee Walker--

235
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,251
I considered her
to be my family.

236
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:49,224
So take a long hard look
into my eyes

237
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,926
and realize that I will have
no problem taking out

238
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:54,462
each member of yours
before they even get home today

239
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,764
unless I get
the information I want.

240
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:02,737
Whoever killed her
had nothing to do with me.

241
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,342
Enjoy your time at Marion.

242
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,512
I'll tell your wife and your
daughter-in-law you said hello.

243
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:13,414
Wait.

244
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:16,284
Wait!

245
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:28,930
If I tell you,
they'll kill my family anyway.

246
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:31,466
We'll provide them
with witness protection.

247
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:33,535
I give you my word.

248
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,210
Moscow.

249
00:13:44,013 --> 00:13:47,849
The Russian government--
they're behind it, not me.

250
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:52,020
Everything that happened today,
all of it, was them.

251
00:13:52,087 --> 00:13:53,087
Who inside the government?

252
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,822
I don't know.
What do you mean,

253
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,457
you don't know? You're talking
about 100,000 people.

254
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:57,458
I need names.

255
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:58,760
I don't know names.

256
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:01,296
They never let me get close.

257
00:14:01,363 --> 00:14:03,131
The woman working for them
arranged everything.

258
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:04,599
What woman?

259
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:08,169
The one they planted at CTU.

260
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:09,637
Dana Walsh.

261
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,340
Sir, let's go.

262
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,878
You promised.

263
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,548
You promised.

264
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,253
Nerve-wracking, isn't it?

265
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,288
Waiting.

266
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,824
I only saw
Novakovich's face, sir,

267
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:40,659
but you definitely
had his attention.

268
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:45,497
It's the president.

269
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:51,002
Charles Logan.

270
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,604
Charles.

271
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,306
Yes, Madam President.

272
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,708
I just got off the phone with
the Russian foreign minister.

273
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:59,311
You did?

274
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,279
And what did he say?

275
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:05,317
He said that the two of you had
a very interesting discussion.

276
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:08,220
And that he would be coming to
the United Nations in five hours

277
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,689
with the Russian premier
to sign the treaty

278
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:11,823
as scheduled.

279
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,159
He also said the credit for that

280
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,560
is all yours.

281
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:19,631
Oh, uh, he was in the mood to be
convinced, Madam President.

282
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,366
Mr. President,
Ethan Kanin here.

283
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:22,868
So you're back on your feet.

284
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:23,869
Yes.

285
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,770
And I'm curious.

286
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:26,938
What did you say

287
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,640
to the Russian minister
to convince him

288
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,408
to come back to the peace talks?

289
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:33,512
I told him that peace
is in all of our interests.

290
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:36,248
Seriously,

291
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:38,917
I'd like to know how you did it.

292
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:40,018
Madam President,

293
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,654
those-those details
are for me alone.

294
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:43,955
That was our agreement.

295
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,557
Am I right?

296
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,325
Yes, you are.

297
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:50,896
So, Ethan, um,
let's not do anything

298
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:53,932
to-to sully our victory.

299
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,901
And it is a victory.

300
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:57,569
For all of us.

301
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,339
It's a good feeling, isn't it?

302
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,340
What?

303
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:04,609
Being of service.

304
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:06,578
To your country.

305
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:09,781
Yes, it is.

306
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:12,651
I'll see you at the UN shortly.

307
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,071
O'Brian.

308
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:20,239
Hey, it's me.

309
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:22,041
Bazhaev's family
just left the courthouse.

310
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:23,142
They're going to need
witness protection.

311
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,443
I want you to pick them up

312
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:25,912
and bring them in.
What did he say?

313
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,747
He said the people who
are behind Renee's murder

314
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,081
weren't Russian mob.

315
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:30,750
Said they were people
inside the Russian government.

316
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:33,286
He claims that Moscow is behind
everything that happened today.

317
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:35,354
I thought the IRK opposition
was trying to stop Hassan.

318
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,123
No, he said the Russians
were just using them.

319
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,524
He didn't have time to explain

320
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:40,393
why they don't want the
peace accord to go through,

321
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,228
but he did say
something important.

322
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:45,231
He said Moscow's main contact
on the ground was Dana Walsh.

323
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,233
Dana? You believe that?

324
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,168
That would explain
how she managed to breach CTU.

325
00:16:49,236 --> 00:16:51,837
Anyways, I'm on my way in.
I want to talk to her.

326
00:16:51,905 --> 00:16:53,606
I'll set it up.
Thanks.

327
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,481
Cole, I need your help.

328
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,450
Jack's on his way here
to interview Dana.

329
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:05,818
Dana? What about?

330
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:07,587
According to Jack,
she's some kind of Agent

331
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:08,621
with the Russian government.

332
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,591
He says they're
behind everything

333
00:17:11,658 --> 00:17:13,225
that happened today,
including Renee's murder.

334
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,227
Listen,

335
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,796
if Dana knows who killed Renee

336
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:18,764
or Jack thinks
she's in any way responsible,

337
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:20,433
there's no telling
what he might do.

338
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,301
Jack respects you.

339
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:23,803
You might be the only one

340
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,138
who can deal with things
if he gets out of hand.

341
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:30,910
I know this is difficult
for you,

342
00:17:30,978 --> 00:17:31,911
but during the questioning...

343
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:32,979
Yeah, I'll be there.

344
00:17:33,046 --> 00:17:34,447
Thanks.

345
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,425
It's good to be back
in the game,

346
00:17:46,493 --> 00:17:48,327
even if it is
through the rear entrance.

347
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,365
President Taylor's worried
about her image.

348
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:55,267
Huh, believe me,
I of all people understand that.

349
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:57,303
She can't keep you
hidden away forever, sir.

350
00:17:58,372 --> 00:17:59,305
That's right.

351
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:00,906
Credit given
where credit is due.

352
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:01,907
Publicly.

353
00:18:01,975 --> 00:18:03,376
That's our deal.

354
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:04,410
Yeah.

355
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:06,746
Yeah.

356
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:08,781
Uh-huh.

357
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:10,449
Right.

358
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,551
Okay.

359
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:13,586
Mm-hmm.

360
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,488
No, no, believe me,

361
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:17,156
the president will
be grateful to know.

362
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:18,958
Okay.

363
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,427
Who is that Agent?

364
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:22,428
I want him reassigned.

365
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:23,429
Sir, that was one

366
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:24,764
of my contacts
at Justice just...

367
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:26,032
Did you hear me?!
Yes.

368
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:27,199
I'll take care of it.

369
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,768
But we have a more
immediate problem:

370
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:31,671
Jack Bauer.

371
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:33,606
Bauer?

372
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:40,780
What does he have to do
with any of this?

373
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,215
He was just downtown at
the federal courthouse,

374
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:44,650
the arraignment
of a Sergei Bazhaev.

375
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:47,787
Bauer got to him behind closed
doors and got him to talk.

376
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:49,288
How much does
this Bazhaev know?

377
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,724
He knows about
Dana Walsh, the mole

378
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:52,892
the Russians planted at CTU.

379
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,928
I know who she is.

380
00:18:55,996 --> 00:19:00,733
Bauer's headed to CTU,
presumably to talk to her.

381
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:05,137
Sir, my sources tell me
Walsh hasn't given up anything

382
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:06,439
about Moscow's involvement.

383
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:07,606
Not yet.

384
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:09,542
But she knows enough
to bring everything down.

385
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:11,811
If she gets in a room
with Bauer...

386
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:13,145
Obviously, that can't happen.

387
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:15,481
We need to stop Bauer
before he talks to her.

388
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,649
That won't be easy.

389
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,451
He may have a personal
stake in this.

390
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:21,353
Apparently, he was asking
Bazhaev about a Renee Walker.

391
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,556
She was shot dead
in Bauer's apartment

392
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,591
less than an hour ago.

393
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:32,364
Sir, this could easily

394
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,266
get out of hand.

395
00:19:34,334 --> 00:19:37,603
You may need to ask
President Taylor to intervene.

396
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,271
What are you suggesting,
that I tell her the truth?

397
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,740
If she finds out
what the Russians have done,

398
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,775
she'll be furious
I kept her out of it.

399
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:45,444
She might back out of our deal.

400
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:47,513
Sir, you really need
to stop Bauer now.

401
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:50,182
I don't see any other way.

402
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,585
You have to talk
to the president.

403
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:00,893
Bauer torpedoed my presidency.

404
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:02,762
Tried to ruime; almost did.

405
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:07,066
There's no way I'm gonna
let that happen again.

406
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:15,775
Thank you.

407
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:16,876
Dana Walsh ready?

408
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:19,311
Yes, I'll take you to her.

409
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,213
I'm so sorry about Renee.

410
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:22,882
I don't even know what to say.

411
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:25,384
Dana know I'm going to be
interrogating her?

412
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:27,887
No, I didn't want
to give her a heads-up.

413
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,755
Good.

414
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,367
Jack.

415
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:44,036
I'm sorry about Renee.

416
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:50,709
I have to leave
the cameras on, Jack.

417
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:52,878
You think I'm gonna kill her?

418
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:55,214
I wouldn't blame you if you did.

419
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,652
If I wanted her dead, Chloe,
she'd be dead.

420
00:20:59,719 --> 00:21:04,290
I'm just gonna wake her
up to the idea of it.

421
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:08,327
Open the door.

422
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:21,140
What do you want?

423
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:28,314
I want to know
who killed Renee Walker.

424
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:30,115
Renee's dead?

425
00:21:30,183 --> 00:21:32,151
Yeah.

426
00:21:33,854 --> 00:21:35,254
That doesn't make any sense.

427
00:21:35,322 --> 00:21:38,290
It... it must have
been a mistake.

428
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:41,260
No mistake.

429
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:46,699
I'm sorry... Jack.

430
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:49,635
Really.

431
00:21:49,703 --> 00:21:51,637
You're sorry?

432
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,043
You're sorry?

433
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:01,947
I want to know
who the shooter was!

434
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:05,584
I want to know ordered it!
I want names now!

435
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:06,418
Stop him!

436
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:07,653
Let it play, Chloe.

437
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:08,821
You hit me, and you get nothing.

438
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,457
You think you get
to make demands here?

439
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,360
I can give you the hitter,

440
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:16,695
the man behind him,

441
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,130
all the way up to the top.

442
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:19,131
I want more

443
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,599
than just names. I want proof!

444
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,968
I have proof:

445
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:25,137
an audio file, film.

446
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,872
Where?

447
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:31,710
First I want
my immunity deal back.

448
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:35,915
Soon as I start talking,
I'm dead.

449
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:41,553
Your move, Jack.

450
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:53,065
If you lie to me...

451
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:55,868
I'll find you

452
00:22:55,936 --> 00:22:57,770
no matter where
you try and hide.

453
00:22:57,837 --> 00:23:00,239
You understand that?

454
00:23:03,877 --> 00:23:05,678
Good.

455
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:22,221
We've had such little good news

456
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,222
these last few hours,

457
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,824
I wanted to tell you
right away.

458
00:23:24,892 --> 00:23:26,125
The delegates have voted

459
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:27,994
unanimously to accept you

460
00:23:28,062 --> 00:23:29,462
as the representative
of the IRK

461
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,930
at the signing of the treaty.

462
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:31,964
I'm pleased.

463
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:35,334
Thank you for all your efforts.

464
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:37,370
You're welcome.

465
00:23:37,438 --> 00:23:38,805
There is one proviso,
of course.

466
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:40,573
That my own country accept me

467
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:41,941
as signatory of the treaty.

468
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:43,609
I know you've had
very little time

469
00:23:43,677 --> 00:23:44,744
to pursue this.

470
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:46,379
Jamot and I have
been making progress.

471
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:47,914
In the next hour,

472
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:51,017
our constituent assembly
will vote on the issue,

473
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:53,086
but as we've already received
pledges of loyalty

474
00:23:53,153 --> 00:23:54,854
from most
of my husband's coalition,

475
00:23:54,922 --> 00:23:57,223
I believe we have a good chance
of success.

476
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:00,326
Excellent. Dalia,

477
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:02,428
we might just make it yet.

478
00:24:02,496 --> 00:24:03,463
We might.

479
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,664
Madam President,

480
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:06,132
Mrs. Hassan.

481
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,633
I need a word.

482
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:09,569
Excuse me.

483
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:13,840
Logan wants to speak with you.

484
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:15,141
About what?

485
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:17,443
He wouldn't say
except that it's urgent.

486
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:20,113
He's waiting in your office.

487
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:24,050
Following President Hassan's
death, the expectation was

488
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,218
that the delegates
to the peace conference

489
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:26,619
would have to pack up
and go home,

490
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:29,689
but the latest rumors
coming out of the UN

491
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:32,558
are pretty sensational: that
Dalia Hassan might be stepping

492
00:24:32,626 --> 00:24:33,826
into her husband's shoes.

493
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:35,995
In fact, there are already
street demonstrations

494
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,664
taking place in Kamistan

495
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:40,299
in support
of Dalia Hassan's candidacy.

496
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,434
Does this mean the...

497
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:42,435
Mr. Logan,

498
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:43,803
the president is here.

499
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:45,304
Thank you.

500
00:24:45,372 --> 00:24:46,873
We don't know, but...

501
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:55,047
Thank you for seeing me,
Madam President.

502
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,116
Ethan said you wanted
to speak with me.

503
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:59,952
Um, can we have
the room, please?

504
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:15,535
What's this about, Charles?

505
00:25:15,602 --> 00:25:17,370
Jack Bauer--
he's out of control.

506
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:20,606
He's already pressured
a Russian mafioso

507
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:22,041
in federal court,
and now he's on

508
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:26,112
his way to question a woman
in custody at CTU: Dana Walsh.

509
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,481
Why does he want to talk to her?

510
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:30,149
He thinks she knows who's behind

511
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:32,318
the, uh, the shooting

512
00:25:32,386 --> 00:25:34,120
of a Renee Walker.

513
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,289
Agent Walker?

514
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:39,225
She's dead?

515
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:49,669
How did this happen?

516
00:25:49,736 --> 00:25:50,736
That's still being
investigated,

517
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:52,038
but in the meantime,

518
00:25:52,105 --> 00:25:54,607
what I'm saying is
Bauer needs to be stopped.

519
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:56,475
Why?

520
00:25:56,543 --> 00:25:59,212
You're going
to have to trust me.

521
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,515
What we need to do right now is

522
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:03,516
lock Bauer down.

523
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:05,084
You better tell me exactly

524
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:06,185
what's going on.

525
00:26:06,253 --> 00:26:07,587
Madam President...
No!

526
00:26:07,654 --> 00:26:10,289
I won't do a thing
about Jack Bauer

527
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:12,058
until you tell me the truth.

528
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:22,401
Elements inside the Russian
government were behind

529
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:25,171
both the asssination
of President Hassan

530
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:27,607
and the supply
of nuclear material

531
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:30,076
to his enemies.

532
00:26:30,143 --> 00:26:31,177
<i>The Russian government?</i>

533
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:32,478
Why do you think

534
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:33,779
they're back at the table?

535
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:36,048
Because I threatened to expose

536
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:38,017
their role in today's events.

537
00:26:38,085 --> 00:26:39,785
You knew about this

538
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:40,886
and you didn't tell anyone?

539
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:42,121
I was trying
to protect the president.

540
00:26:42,189 --> 00:26:43,322
Protect her?!

541
00:26:44,591 --> 00:26:46,726
You've compromised her
hopelessly!

542
00:26:46,793 --> 00:26:49,128
Why didn't you say anything
before?

543
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:52,064
I told you that I had leverage
with the Russians.

544
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,532
You-you must have understood

545
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,567
it was significant.

546
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:55,768
Significant, yes!

547
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:57,270
Evidence of a sex scandal,

548
00:26:57,337 --> 00:26:59,438
some kind of
financial malfeasance,

549
00:26:59,506 --> 00:27:02,074
not this, for God's sake!

550
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:08,281
If I find that you were
in a position to prevent

551
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:09,682
anything...
Absolutely not.

552
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,717
This information came to me
only very recently.

553
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:13,052
From whom?

554
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,121
I can't tell you.

555
00:27:15,188 --> 00:27:16,222
<i>You will tell me.</i>

556
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,523
I can't, Madam President,

557
00:27:17,591 --> 00:27:19,525
because it would do no good.

558
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:23,863
My sources would plausibly deny
even knowing me.

559
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:29,235
The Russian involvement--

560
00:27:29,303 --> 00:27:31,837
that's what Jack Bauer is about
to bring out into the open?

561
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:34,540
<i>If he talks to Dana Walsh, yes.</i>

562
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:37,143
The Russians
inserted her at CTU

563
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,378
<i>months ago.
She was their Agent.</i>

564
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:40,780
If Bauer gets to her,

565
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,516
it will all come out,
and then, and then

566
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,918
this, this

567
00:27:45,986 --> 00:27:47,019
will all be finished.

568
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:48,387
It's finished anyways.

569
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:50,456
Do you think the president
wants anything more to do

570
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:52,525
with the Russians
after what they've done?

571
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:56,028
Yes, yes, you do,

572
00:27:56,096 --> 00:27:57,997
Madame President,
because you are

573
00:27:58,065 --> 00:28:00,533
looking at the bigger picture,

574
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,234
the greater good.

575
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:04,337
How can you call
any of this good?!

576
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:06,872
Because it is good,
an undeniable good!

577
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,508
A peace that's escaped
the world for generations!

578
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,510
That's what you're on
the verge of achieving.

579
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:13,879
Do you really want
to throw it all away?

580
00:28:13,947 --> 00:28:15,781
Do you really think

581
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,983
Dalia Hassan will sit down
at the table

582
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:19,585
with the people

583
00:28:19,653 --> 00:28:21,354
who murdered her husband?

584
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:24,223
Who says she has to know?

585
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,429
Believe me, I know
how hard you worked for this,

586
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:33,632
how you sweated and prayed,
the sleepless nights.

587
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,102
I know.
The power

588
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:39,038
to make a difference-- that's
why we came into politics.

589
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:40,172
How few of us

590
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,941
get to achieve it,

591
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:45,077
but you have...

592
00:28:45,145 --> 00:28:48,280
<i>You so nearly have.</i>

593
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:50,216
Ethan will tell you
to make a stand.

594
00:28:50,283 --> 00:28:51,884
I applaud his-his
moral clarity,

595
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:53,386
but then he's on the sidelines.

596
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:54,387
He can afford it.

597
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:55,287
That's enough!

598
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:57,390
Is the situation ideal? No!

599
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:59,425
Far from it,

600
00:28:59,493 --> 00:29:02,194
but you have a real chance

601
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:05,664
to make the world
a better place.

602
00:29:09,436 --> 00:29:13,472
Don't listen to this, Allison.

603
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,375
If the treaty's not signed
today, it's not the end.

604
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:19,111
You can build a better peace,

605
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:21,714
with honest partners.

606
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,582
"There is a tide
in the affairs of men,

607
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,786
which, taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune."

608
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:28,320
What the hell does that mean?

609
00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:32,291
The president knows.

610
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:35,661
<i>It's from Julius Caesar.</i>

611
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:38,831
It means "Now or never."

612
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:44,103
Madam President,
I have Jack Bauer for you.

613
00:29:47,874 --> 00:29:49,141
Where is he?

614
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,343
He's at CTU.
He wants to talk to you

615
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:52,611
about an immunity agreement

616
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,246
for a Dana Walsh.

617
00:29:58,852 --> 00:30:00,453
I'll have to call him back.

618
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,655
Yes, ma'am.

619
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:04,857
Madam President,

620
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:09,228
there is no choice here.

621
00:30:09,296 --> 00:30:12,498
<i>But there is a choice, Ethan,</i>

622
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:15,901
and unfortunately,
only I can make it.

623
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:27,546
I'm going to CTU.

624
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:28,981
To do what?

625
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:33,052
To see Jack Bauer.

626
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,575
Has the president
called back yet?

627
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:52,843
Not yet.

628
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:54,812
Jack, are you sure
you want to do this to yourself?

629
00:30:56,414 --> 00:30:57,648
We can take it from here.

630
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,416
The minute Dana's immunity deal
is back in place,

631
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:00,651
we can roll up the names,

632
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,852
close this out.

633
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,487
I need to see this through.

634
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,924
Excuse me.

635
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,360
The president's
on the phone, line 3.

636
00:31:09,427 --> 00:31:10,728
She asked for Chloe.

637
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,970
Madam President.

638
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,205
Ms. O'Brian,

639
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:23,207
I'm on my way to see you.

640
00:31:23,274 --> 00:31:24,475
You're coming to CTU?

641
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,243
Yes, I'm almost there.

642
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:28,078
I need to talk to Jack Bauer.

643
00:31:28,146 --> 00:31:29,446
Make sure he doesn't leave.

644
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,182
Yes, ma'am.

645
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,285
Let Security know the president
will be here any minute.

646
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,186
She's coming here?

647
00:31:36,254 --> 00:31:37,488
That's what I just said.

648
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:38,555
Have them standing by.

649
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,659
Why's she doing this?

650
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:44,328
She said she wants
to talk to you.

651
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:45,796
Why doesn't she just talk to me
on the phone?

652
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,131
I don't know.

653
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:49,767
You should probably meet her
in Hastings' office.

654
00:31:52,737 --> 00:31:54,571
Fine.

655
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:22,332
Madame President,

656
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,834
welcome to CTU.
I'm Chloe O'Brian.

657
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:24,868
Thank you, Ms. O'Brian.

658
00:32:24,936 --> 00:32:25,903
Is Jack inside?

659
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,471
Right this way.

660
00:32:41,853 --> 00:32:45,522
I want to say how grateful I am

661
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,258
for all your efforts today.

662
00:32:48,326 --> 00:32:51,128
We've taken
some pretty hard hits,

663
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:53,897
but we've managed to keep
ourselves in the game.

664
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:56,433
The peace process
is still alive,

665
00:32:56,501 --> 00:33:00,170
and I am counting on your hard
work and your vigilance

666
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:01,939
to keep it that way.

667
00:33:02,006 --> 00:33:03,974
I know you won't let me down.

668
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,328
Thank you, Miss O'Brian.

669
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:25,629
Um, I'll go up alone.

670
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:42,279
Hello, Jack.

671
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:44,281
Madam President.

672
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:46,617
I am so sorry

673
00:33:46,684 --> 00:33:50,020
about Agent Walker.

674
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,724
I gather she meant a lot to you.

675
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,926
Yes, ma'am.

676
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:59,396
Which makes what I'm about
to ask so very, very hard.

677
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,567
Please, Jack.

678
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:12,476
I need you to stand down.

679
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,213
I-I'm sorry. I don't understand.

680
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:19,917
I do not want you
to question Dana Walsh.

681
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:23,353
Madam President, the information
that I can extract

682
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:26,990
from Dana Walsh is not limited
to the murder of Renee Walker.

683
00:34:27,058 --> 00:34:29,493
I believe she knows the names
of the people who facilitated

684
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:30,727
the assassination
of President Hassan,

685
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:34,264
people working within
the Russian government.

686
00:34:34,332 --> 00:34:35,566
That is pure speculation.

687
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,367
Then grant her immunity.
Let me question her.

688
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:38,368
If she's lying,

689
00:34:38,436 --> 00:34:39,570
you lose nothing.

690
00:34:39,637 --> 00:34:42,139
I'm sorry. I won't give
Dana Walsh immunity.

691
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,675
I can't.

692
00:34:44,742 --> 00:34:48,278
The peace process
is back on track.

693
00:34:48,346 --> 00:34:51,148
Dalia Hassan will represent
her country at the signing.

694
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:52,482
The Russians have accepted her

695
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,351
and have undertaken
to support the treaty.

696
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:55,852
Madam President,
the Russians have been trying

697
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,853
to destroy the treaty.

698
00:34:56,921 --> 00:34:57,955
You can't trust them.

699
00:34:58,022 --> 00:34:59,323
You don't know that.

700
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,892
The information that I have
came from Sergei Bazhaev,

701
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,193
and I believe him.

702
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:04,428
If you let me question
Dana Walsh,

703
00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:05,462
I can prove it to you.

704
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,731
No.

705
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:09,800
I won't allow it.

706
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,306
You don't want
to know the truth.

707
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:21,111
What I want is to keep
the Russians at the table.

708
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:22,679
Allegations of this sort

709
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,081
will drive them away.

710
00:35:24,148 --> 00:35:25,582
What if the allegations
are true?

711
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,451
If I keep the Russians
at the table,

712
00:35:27,518 --> 00:35:29,586
I can bring peace
to a part of the world

713
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:33,590
that has known nothing but war
for generations.

714
00:35:33,658 --> 00:35:37,761
<i>That is the greater good
that I am working toward.</i>

715
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:39,896
And to achieve it,
there have to be sacrifices!

716
00:35:39,964 --> 00:35:42,032
With all due respect,
Madam President,

717
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,533
these people gave
nuclear weapons to terrorists

718
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,235
who were willing to obliterate
half of Manhattan!

719
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:47,070
You don't know that!

720
00:35:47,138 --> 00:35:51,074
And I'm telling you,
we have to move on.

721
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:53,777
Even Hassan's widow
has picked up the torch

722
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:55,278
and is continuing
the peace process.

723
00:35:55,346 --> 00:35:57,781
Does she know the Russians
helped murder her husband?

724
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:00,117
Do you think she'd be
willing to sign that treaty

725
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:01,685
if she knew that?
Have you even told her?

726
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:02,686
That's enough.

727
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:03,687
Have you told her?!

728
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,389
I said that's enough!

729
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:12,529
This peace treaty
is in the interests

730
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:15,632
of the United States
and of the world.

731
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,435
That makes it a good in itself,
and certainly

732
00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:20,804
more important than
your desire for revenge.

733
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:23,774
Madam President, I don't
want revenge; I want justice.

734
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:26,476
And I want peace.

735
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:29,413
If there were another way,
I would take it,

736
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,214
but there's not.

737
00:36:31,282 --> 00:36:33,950
That's my decision.

738
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:35,452
Do you understand?

739
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,757
Do you understand, Jack?

740
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:46,863
Yes, ma'am.

741
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,934
I've arranged a helicopter

742
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:54,237
to fly you from CTU
to McGuire Air Force Base.

743
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:57,140
You're locking me down.

744
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,343
You'll be debriefed there.

745
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,516
Good-bye, Jack.

746
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,820
I'm sorry.

747
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:32,809
I had them gather your things.

748
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:33,810
Thanks.

749
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:34,811
What happened up there?

750
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:36,780
Nothing.
What do you mean?

751
00:37:36,848 --> 00:37:38,148
I mean nothing.

752
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,549
Nothing happened.

753
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:02,564
What I need is a meeting
with Dalia Hassan

754
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,566
to coordinate our response
to the likely questions.

755
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:06,835
Will you set that up?

756
00:38:06,903 --> 00:38:08,070
Thank you.

757
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:09,504
I'm leaving CTU now.

758
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:10,505
I'll be with you

759
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:13,108
in ten minutes.

760
00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:14,443
They said you wanted to see me.

761
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,510
Yes.

762
00:38:19,082 --> 00:38:22,751
Dana Walsh is to remain locked
down until further notice.

763
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:25,487
No one gets access
to her without

764
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:27,322
my express permission.
Is that clear?

765
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,791
I guess.

766
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,126
What about Jack?

767
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:33,528
Jack is going to McGuire
Air Force Base to be debriefed.

768
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:36,798
He didn't seem very happy
about that.

769
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:39,468
He was disappointed

770
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:41,603
that I wouldn't grant
Dana Walsh immunity

771
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:42,771
in exchange for her testimony.

772
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,040
But Dana knows who's responsible

773
00:38:45,108 --> 00:38:46,341
for everything
that's happened today.

774
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:48,410
She is a sociopath.

775
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:51,246
She'll say anything.

776
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,048
And the last thing
we need right now

777
00:38:53,116 --> 00:38:54,449
is a bunch of
unfounded allegations

778
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:56,752
derailing the peace that
we've all worked so hard for.

779
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:57,819
Do you understand, Chloe?

780
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,494
We're having a press conference
at the UN in two hours

781
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:08,463
to present Dalia Hassan
as the new leader of the IRK

782
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:10,966
and to announce that the
peace talks are still on track.

783
00:39:11,034 --> 00:39:12,934
What we need CTU to do

784
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:15,270
is to make sure
security is airtight.

785
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:16,438
Yes, ma'am.

786
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:27,916
Tim Woods speaks
very highly of you.

787
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:29,551
When the situation
got out of control,

788
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,553
he was quite adamant
that you were the one

789
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,789
to take over.

790
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:35,957
I'm surprised
he even knows who I am.

791
00:39:37,994 --> 00:39:40,329
It was a pleasure
to meet you finally, Chloe.

792
00:39:40,396 --> 00:39:43,198
Thank you.

793
00:39:58,881 --> 00:40:01,083
Cole, we're gonna be
back on UN detail.

794
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,084
What's happening with Dana?

795
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,819
As of now, nothing.

796
00:40:03,886 --> 00:40:05,187
What about
the immunity agreement?

797
00:40:05,254 --> 00:40:06,822
There isn't gonna be one.
Why not?

798
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:09,124
The president says that
Dana's a lying sociopath

799
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:10,459
who will wreck the peace treaty.

800
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:13,061
What's Jack say about that?

801
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:14,162
I don't know.

802
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,597
He's being choppered to McGuire

803
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:18,166
for debriefing.

804
00:40:18,234 --> 00:40:19,935
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

805
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,737
There's gonna be
a press conference soon,

806
00:40:21,804 --> 00:40:23,572
and the president needs us
to guarantee security.

807
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,340
You'll need to get
your teams ready.

808
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:27,476
Okay. Fine.

809
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,232
So Jack's being taken away
for a debrief?

810
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:51,733
About what, may I ask?

811
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:52,768
No.

812
00:40:52,835 --> 00:40:54,169
Director O'Brian,

813
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:55,370
this is Falcon One.

814
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:56,538
We're touching down
at CTU, ma'am.

815
00:40:56,606 --> 00:40:57,939
Copy that.

816
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:00,542
Security personnel en route
to the roof with Jack Bauer now.

817
00:41:22,632 --> 00:41:24,332
Mr. Bauer,
Agent Winnick.

818
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,034
The White House has
instructed me to escort you

819
00:41:26,102 --> 00:41:28,970
to McGuire Air Force
Base for a debrief.

820
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:38,814
Heard a lot about you, sir.

821
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:40,982
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

822
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,419
There's no reason to be sorry.

823
00:41:51,527 --> 00:41:53,462
Get in this helicopter.

824
00:41:53,529 --> 00:41:54,996
Tell your men to
drop their weapons

825
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:56,064
or you're gonna die.

826
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:02,504
Arlo, pull up the audio.

827
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:03,505
Something's happening.

828
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:05,240
Coming up.

829
00:42:05,308 --> 00:42:07,075
Put your weapons down now!

830
00:42:07,143 --> 00:42:08,076
I will kill him!

831
00:42:08,144 --> 00:42:10,178
Everyone to the helipad.

832
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:11,313
All security
to the helipad now.

833
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,814
What the hell is going on?

834
00:42:12,882 --> 00:42:14,082
He's gonna steal
that helicopter.

835
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,417
We have a hostage situation.

836
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:19,087
Out of the copter now!

837
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,090
Bauer took a hostage.

838
00:42:22,158 --> 00:42:23,558
Hijacking the helicopter.

839
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:31,299
Hold your fire!
Lower your weapons!

840
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,770
Give me your walkie.

841
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:36,771
Jack.

842
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:38,573
Please land the chopper now.

843
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:42,010
Jack, you know I have
to call this in.

844
00:42:42,078 --> 00:42:44,112
The Air Force will
force you down.

845
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,413
This is a bad idea.

846
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:46,448
Land the chopper

847
00:42:46,516 --> 00:42:47,816
now.

848
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:51,152
Call the FAA, the Air Force.

849
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,687
Tell them we have
a stolen helicopter

850
00:42:52,755 --> 00:42:53,889
flying West over Manhattan

851
00:42:53,956 --> 00:42:55,590
that needs to be intercepted
and forced down.

852
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,425
Yes, ma'am.

853
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,520
