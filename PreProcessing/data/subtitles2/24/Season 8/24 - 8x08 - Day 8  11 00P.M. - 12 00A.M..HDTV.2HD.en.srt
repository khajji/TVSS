1
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:14,968
Our security police have completed their initial sweep

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,233
of the capital city.

3
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,506
65 known members of the opposition have been arrested

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,566
and are being questioned.

5
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,633
Have you learned anything?

6
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,757
Were any of them working with my brother?

7
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:23,833
It's too early to tell.

8
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:25,934
Kayla, your father is a great man,

9
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:28,200
but Farhad's betrayal has changed him.

10
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,134
What can we do?

11
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,066
The president says

12
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,466
you may be involved with his brother.

13
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,733
He's ordered me to detain you.

14
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,100
I'll talk to him.

15
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:39,533
President Hassan's crackdown

16
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:42,499
isn't just a response to the attempt on his life.

17
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:45,801
There are unsecured nuclear materials in play.

18
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,163
CTU is running an undercover operation

19
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:49,767
to retrieve them as we speak.

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,166
I've got something.

21
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:54,100
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

22
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:58,015
A local vice group just impounded $120,000.

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,897
I help you do this and you never call me again.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,234
That's beautiful, man. Absolutely beautiful.

25
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:06,433
It's a cop.

26
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,367
You're going to have to slip past him.

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,801
- I'm at the warehouse...
- Nick!

28
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:12,883
Kevin, stop him!

29
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:15,421
I hear there are materials for sale.

30
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:16,833
Talk straight.

31
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:17,833
What materials?

32
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,266
Nuclear rods.

33
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,467
Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody.

34
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:22,666
We have a problem.

35
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:24,868
Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.

36
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,720
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.

37
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,267
Somebody knows something.

38
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:30,334
No one knows, there's no one left to call.

39
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,366
Look, it's over!

40
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:33,267
What is wrong with you?!

41
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,700
Renee.

42
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,566
Stop, stop.

43
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,805
- They're Russian.
- What are you doing?

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,166
I need to let them take me.

45
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,747
When CTU gets here, you tell them to start tracking me from the air.

46
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:49,534
These people are gonna lead us to everything we're looking for.

47
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,467
I'm unarmed, don't shoot.

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,173
We can do business.

49
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:56,163
Where's Jack?

50
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:57,566
The Russians took him.

51
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:59,549
He said that you'd be monitoring him from the air.

52
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:01,066
We haven't seen anything.

53
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,067
Where is he?

54
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,199
Yeah?

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,299
Where the hell are you?

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,993
Hey, Jenny girl!

57
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:31,134
You said you would call me as soon as the two of you got clear.

58
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,796
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I forgot.

59
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:35,197
We-we got-- hold on-- we got caught up

60
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,701
celebrating our score.

61
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:37,833
<i>Celebrating?</i>

62
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,234
You put a police officer in the hospital.

63
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:42,467
Hey, that wasn't me, that was Nick.

64
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:45,133
A- And look, why do, why do you got to focus on the negative?

65
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:48,501
We're flush 120 grand.

66
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:50,233
Why don't you just come down here,

67
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:52,032
have a drink, celebrate with us?

68
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:54,886
We're at a club in Jersey City called Starlight.

69
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,466
We'll work out your cut.

70
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,700
What cut?

71
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:59,366
I don't want anything from you, Kevin.

72
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,999
We're done.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
I want you to put my key

74
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,477
in my mailbox and get the hell out of my life

75
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:07,100
like you promised.

76
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,334
Yeah, that-that's not going to happen.

77
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:15,402
What does that mean?

78
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:18,717
This is a sweet operation that we got going here, you know?

79
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:21,713
You getting the access codes and-and us pulling the jobs.

80
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:23,032
W- W-Wait...

81
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:25,133
We had a deal, Kevin.

82
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,501
You promised me I do this one thing for you

83
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:28,999
and then you leave me alone.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,033
I- I know and I, and I, and I meant that, all right,

85
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:36,801
but things change, okay, an-an-and...

86
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,750
We can get rich off of this, Jenny.

87
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,667
You can't do this to me, Kevin.

88
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,033
Jenny, please...

89
00:03:44,446 --> 00:03:45,833
Look, bitch,

90
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,500
you're in this up to your neck.

91
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,929
You want your boss and want your boyfriend finding out

92
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,200
you're not who you say you are?

93
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:55,033
You're gonna be our golden goose, okay?

94
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:03,234
- Hello?
- Dana.

95
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:05,333
What are you doing?

96
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:08,297
We got a situation; you need to be on the floor.

97
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,032
Dana...

98
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,200
I heard you, I will be right there.

99
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,933
Who was that on the phone just now?

100
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,497
That's none of your business.

101
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:16,554
Actually, it is.

102
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,667
When you start sneaking away

103
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:19,367
to make phone calls or leave the office,

104
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,153
making me cover for you,

105
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,907
it becomes my business.

106
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:23,800
Now, who was that?

107
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:25,091
Kevin?

108
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,834
How the hell would you...?

109
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,566
Are you spying on me?

110
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,789
Look, you want to step out on your fiancé,

111
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:33,091
it's fine with me.

112
00:04:33,126 --> 00:04:34,199
God knows I've got no love for the guy.

113
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,766
You have no idea what you are talking about.

114
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:36,867
I am not cheating on Cole.

115
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,167
Okay, whatever you want to call it,

116
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,567
you'd better start telling your boyfriend what's going on

117
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,211
or I will.

118
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:45,638
Now, come on.

119
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,234
Our undercover operation just went south.

120
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:49,999
What's happened?

121
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,110
Jack Bauer was grabbed

122
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,267
by an unknown group of armed Russians.

123
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,701
We think they're the ones in control of the nuclear rods.

124
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,766
Are we tracking them?

125
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:59,033
We can't.

126
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,633
They took Bauer through an underground access

127
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,666
behind the building.

128
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,849
Without aerial support, the best

129
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:04,032
my people could do was track them

130
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,767
to a drainage junction near Avenue Y and Ocean.

131
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:08,433
They must have had a vehicle standing by.

132
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,933
Jack's cell phone was trashed at the scene.

133
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,299
Well, there has to be something at the site

134
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,867
to help us ID the vehicle.

135
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:15,450
Tire treads, transmission fluid, oil residue?

136
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:18,032
No, there's nothing, sir, the trail's gone cold.

137
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:19,233
Well, what about Walker?

138
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,099
<i>Did she get a good look at these people?</i>

139
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,399
I don't know, sir.

140
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:24,701
Frankly, she's pretty messed up right now.

141
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,006
Blaming herself for Jack's circumstances.

142
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,066
Well, she should.

143
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,534
She crippled this operation when she murdered her contact.

144
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,534
Without Vladimir Laitanan, we have no lead to finding Bauer

145
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,066
or the nuclear materials.

146
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,033
You get her back to CTU for debriefing.

147
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,700
I want to know what the hell happened.

148
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:40,204
Yes, sir.

149
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,189
You might want to consider

150
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:43,166
running a psych eval on her when we arrive.

151
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,733
Count on it.

152
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,674
You were supposed to be coordinating with NSA,

153
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,032
monitoring chatter.

154
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,057
I know, something came up, I had to take care of it.

155
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,868
What was so important?

156
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:55,771
It's my fault, Mr. Hastings.

157
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:57,533
I asked Dana to recover a datalog

158
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,783
I accidentally deleted from archives.

159
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,471
I didn't have clearance.

160
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,734
I'm uplinking to NSA servers now.

161
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:08,999
All right.

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,166
Just get on it.

163
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,334
Roll back any chatter within the last 20 minutes.

164
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,501
Right now that's all we've got.

165
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:15,967
Let me know if something turns up.

166
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,934
I need to brief President Taylor.

167
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:21,533
Thank you.

168
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,967
You can thank me by putting aside

169
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,695
whatever it is that's bothering you

170
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,633
and helping me find Jack.

171
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,294
He's my friend and he's in trouble.

172
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:45,301
Take him down the hall.

173
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,801
Where is Vladimir?

174
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:52,933
Dead.

175
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,400
So are his men.

176
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,133
The German said they tried to rip him off.

177
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,033
Did he also say how he knows about the fuel rods?

178
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,900
Who are you?

179
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:31,968
Ernst Meier.

180
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,901
I've been looking for you to make you an offer.

181
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:36,533
You know who I am?

182
00:07:36,534 --> 00:07:37,533
No.

183
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:39,167
All I know is that there's a very powerful man

184
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:40,800
in the Russian syndicate who's been trafficking

185
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,211
weapons-grade uranium,

186
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,779
specifically U-235 fuel rods.

187
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:46,801
After the nasty business with Laitanan,

188
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,533
these men brought me here,

189
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:51,000
so I'm just assuming you're that man.

190
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,767
Where did you get this information?

191
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:56,434
I represent a consortium of private interests.

192
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,067
They intercepted communiques within the Islamic republic.

193
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:01,434
From whom?

194
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,501
Farhad Hassan...

195
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:06,534
or someone in his camp.

196
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,367
In either case, you're doing business with the wrong people.

197
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:12,634
And who are these people-- the ones you work for?

198
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:18,418
I'm sure you can understand I'm not at liberty to say.

199
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,167
Aah!

200
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:27,521
You should be less concerned about who I work for

201
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:28,533
and more concerned about the deal

202
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:29,900
that they're willing to offer you.

203
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,167
I'm not interested in your offer.

204
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,824
$250 million,

205
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:36,834
half of which is ready to be wired to you immediately.

206
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:38,744
The other half you will receive

207
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,834
upon final acquisition of the fuel rods.

208
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,549
You pose a very difficult problem for me.

209
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:53,086
You show up out of nowhere,

210
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,033
knowing far too much of my business,

211
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,533
yet I've never heard of you.

212
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:59,534
You've never heard of me because I'm good at what I do.

213
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:04,000
What I'm concerned about... is that you're a cop.

214
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:06,679
I just killed three people back at that garage.

215
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,714
Vladimir Laitanan-- I stabbed in the eye.

216
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,834
You really think I'm a cop?

217
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:14,914
As a child, I saw KGB throw an entire family

218
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:17,474
off the roof of a building,

219
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:20,000
two of them small children.

220
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,968
I know what cops are capable of.

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,299
So I ask you again:

222
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,466
Who do you work for?

223
00:09:26,244 --> 00:09:28,334
I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.

224
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,338
Dimitri, work on him until he's ready to tell us everything.

225
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,167
No, we can make a deal.

226
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,967
We can still make a deal!

227
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:40,100
No! No!

228
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,167
No!

229
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,601
You have buried your brother's body?

230
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:06,801
It's Oleg's necklace.

231
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:09,133
You gave it to him at his confirmation.

232
00:10:11,663 --> 00:10:13,067
You keep it.

233
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,567
To remind you of him.

234
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:22,067
I'm glad you're back.

235
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,234
We may have a problem.

236
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,666
What is it?

237
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:30,234
There is a man down the hall who claims to be an arms broker.

238
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:32,300
He knows about the nuclear rods.

239
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:34,861
How could he?

240
00:10:34,896 --> 00:10:40,100
He says there was a leak from Farhad's people, but I wonder.

241
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,567
Until I know for certain who and what this man is,

242
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,466
I've stopped the transport of the rods.

243
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:47,299
They've been redirected to our weigh station

244
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,600
off the Wantagh Parkway.

245
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,167
I'm sure Farhad can't be happy about that.

246
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,667
I haven't told him yet.

247
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,334
Perhaps we should tell him together.

248
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,300
How long do you plan to hold him off?

249
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:05,633
That depends.

250
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:06,957
On what?

251
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:09,701
On how long it takes Dimitri to break this guy.

252
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:24,433
Okay, Mr. Policeman.

253
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,533
I'm not a cop.

254
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:26,700
I swear to you.

255
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:28,601
Please, don't do this.

256
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,534
Tell me what you know.

257
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:53,566
We are exhausting all efforts

258
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:56,001
to ascertain who took Bauer and where,

259
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:58,500
but until any progress is made, we just have to hope

260
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,900
<i>that Jack can find some way</i>

261
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,766
<i>of salvaging the operation on his end.</i>

262
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:03,901
What even makes you think he's still alive?

263
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,466
Only the fact that he wasn't killed

264
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,799
at the point of abduction.

265
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,137
Mr. Hastings, I need a realistic assessment.

266
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,440
What are the odds of finding and securing

267
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,700
these nuclear weapons within the next few hours?

268
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:14,678
I can't answer that, ma'am,

269
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,952
but the longer we're out of touch

270
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,957
with Bauer, the less likely our chances.

271
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:20,367
All right, Mr. Hastings.

272
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:22,467
Continue to coordinate with my office.

273
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:24,533
I want updates every 30 minutes.

274
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,467
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

275
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,700
I just spoke to General Wasim.

276
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,066
He's very worried.

277
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,967
Your brother's crackdowns back home are intensifying.

278
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,866
Everyone is being arrested.

279
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:38,034
Our window of opportunity is closing.

280
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,967
And why didn't the general call me himself?

281
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:41,138
<i>Perhaps he's losing confidence</i>

282
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:43,134
in your ability to complete our mission.

283
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,466
This is my mission.

284
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,633
My plan!

285
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:47,000
Of course.

286
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:48,934
But we're running out of time.

287
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,532
If your brother dismantles our opposition forces,

288
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,900
we will no longer be able

289
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,665
to reconstitute our nuclear program.

290
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,799
He won't succeed.

291
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,665
At this rate, he will.

292
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:58,466
How much longer must we wait

293
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,133
for the delivery of the uranium?

294
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,070
Not long.

295
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:04,001
The rods should be arriving to you within the hour.

296
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,934
Have your men ready.

297
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,734
I'll call you back.

298
00:13:10,034 --> 00:13:11,466
Yes? What is it?

299
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,824
There is a man downstairs who's shown up

300
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,795
to outbid you for the fuel rods.

301
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,381
Is this some feeble attempt to renegotiate terms?

302
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,326
Not at all. This man, Meier,

303
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:21,933
claims someone in your organization

304
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,499
tipped him off to our deal.

305
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,819
That's not possible. He's lying.

306
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,318
At any rate, in light of his sudden appearance,

307
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:29,368
I'm halting delivery of the rods for the time being.

308
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,570
What? You can't do that.

309
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:31,866
It's already done.

310
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,874
I cannot take the risk that we may be exposed.

311
00:13:34,909 --> 00:13:36,414
The longer you delay, the more time

312
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,885
my brother has to crush his enemies.

313
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,193
If he manages to purge everyone in the military

314
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:42,467
who opposes him, the uranium is worthless to me.

315
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,666
That's your concern.

316
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,862
Mine is to make certain this Meier is not a policeman.

317
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:48,734
One of my men is interrogating him now.

318
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,001
That could take hours, even days.

319
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,532
Not days.

320
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,739
I can promise you that.

321
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,533
You promised to assassinate my brother, too.

322
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:58,866
Your failure to eliminate him

323
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,629
has put me under enormous pressure, and now,

324
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:03,131
because of your people's inability to maintain secrecy,

325
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,268
you break our agreed timetable to suit your needs.

326
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,334
Don't speak to my father that way.

327
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,744
We've honored every agreement we made with you,

328
00:14:13,934 --> 00:14:15,699
and shed a lot of blood for it.

329
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,537
My father's allowed you to stay here

330
00:14:17,572 --> 00:14:21,490
and hide from the Feds at great personal risk to our family.

331
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,700
Tell him to put the gun down.

332
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,933
No.

333
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:30,034
We're not taking any more of your demands.

334
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,833
Throw him out of here.

335
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,533
Let his own people shelter him if he thinks we're such fools.

336
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,644
I'll drive him there myself if that's what it takes.

337
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,891
It would seem you have used up our hospitality here.

338
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,247
Perhaps it's best you join your men

339
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:50,901
at the rendezvous point to wait for delivery.

340
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,399
And when will that be?

341
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,233
When I think it's safe.

342
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:59,134
Not a moment before.

343
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,134
Make sure he gets where he's going.

344
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,301
Still got men back at the scene in case we missed something.

345
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,752
In the meantime, I'll work out

346
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:40,667
the aerial sweep protocols with Arlo.

347
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,532
What are you doing to find Jack?

348
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,734
Everything we can, Ms. Walker. Come with me.

349
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:48,133
Have you checked all the... the traffic cams, subway routes?

350
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,966
You have all this technology working for you--

351
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,599
comm surveillance, satellite tracking.

352
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,167
We're using everything at our disposal.

353
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:56,268
Then how come you haven't found him yet?

354
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:57,933
Why don't you have any leads?

355
00:15:57,934 --> 00:16:00,134
The best lead we had is dead.

356
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:04,034
I know about your suicide attempt.

357
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,101
You should have been honest with me.

358
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,447
O'Brian will take your statement.

359
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:11,824
I want to know every detail about every event

360
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,167
leading up to the death of Vladimir Laitanan.

361
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,917
When she's done, take her to medical.

362
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:25,001
I've ordered a full psych evaluation.

363
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,067
Yes, sir.

364
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,573
Uh, you can write your statement here.

365
00:16:42,398 --> 00:16:44,500
Hastings blames me for what happened to Jack.

366
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:46,000
And he's right.

367
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,517
No, he's not.

368
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:49,532
He shouldn't have said that.

369
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,142
The only reason that Jack was even

370
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,734
part of this operation was because of me.

371
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,667
So whatever they're doing to him right now,

372
00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,901
it's because of me.

373
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,201
I have to find him, Chloe.

374
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:06,076
Renee, I know how you must feel.

375
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:11,054
Just... just take one thing at a time.

376
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,144
We have to deal with what you did.

377
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,167
So write your statement.

378
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,334
I'll check back with you.

379
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,599
Cole.

380
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,599
Hey.

381
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,259
Do you have some time? I need to talk to you.

382
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:36,546
Can it wait? I need to review these protocols

383
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:37,834
before Arlo distributes them.

384
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:39,432
I've got it covered.

385
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,333
Go talk to your girlfriend.

386
00:17:52,268 --> 00:17:53,633
What's up?

387
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:54,799
You all right?

388
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,901
No, I'm not.

389
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,169
I have a big problem.

390
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:02,210
And it's the reason why I've been acting kind of weird

391
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,133
the past few days.

392
00:18:04,134 --> 00:18:06,101
Okay.

393
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,367
Listen, if you're calling off the engagement,

394
00:18:10,368 --> 00:18:12,133
you couldn't have picked a worse day.

395
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:13,798
No.

396
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,166
No, I would never do that.

397
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:17,699
Good.

398
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,166
So what's bothering you?

399
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:22,067
There are things about my past

400
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,533
that I haven't told you.

401
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,867
I'm listening.

402
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:31,405
Hey.

403
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,309
I'm sure I haven't told you

404
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,800
everything about my past either.

405
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:37,800
I don't care what happened before I met you.

406
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,399
All that matters is now

407
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,104
and what we have to look forward to.

408
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:45,433
I think that's all that matters, too.

409
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,034
So what are you so worried about?

410
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,001
I don't want to lose you.

411
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,834
I'm not going anywhere.

412
00:18:57,294 --> 00:18:58,100
Excuse me.

413
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,533
Agent Ortiz, Mr. Hastings needs to see you in his office.

414
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,533
Uh, tell him I'll be there as soon as I can.

415
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:04,633
- No. Go.
- Hastings can wait.

416
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:05,900
So can this.

417
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,633
Talking to you has helped.

418
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,867
I think I know what I need to do now.

419
00:19:10,907 --> 00:19:11,633
You sure?

420
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,333
Mm-hmm.

421
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,800
Okay.

422
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:18,134
Maybe later you tell me what this is all about.

423
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,234
Who do you work for?

424
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:46,801
Who else knows about the fuel rods?

425
00:19:49,172 --> 00:19:50,745
Everybody has a limit.

426
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,137
Don't worry,

427
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,734
I'll find yours.

428
00:19:58,268 --> 00:19:59,933
You're working with the police.

429
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,166
Admit it!

430
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:03,234
Tell me and the pain will stop.

431
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,168
Who else knows?

432
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:12,034
I told you... I'm not a cop.

433
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:13,066
Please.

434
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:15,400
I'm just a businessman.

435
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,633
Please.

436
00:20:17,286 --> 00:20:18,534
Who do you work for?

437
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,368
I'm an independent contractor.

438
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:24,333
I couldn't even tell you if I wanted.

439
00:20:24,334 --> 00:20:26,234
Please.

440
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,600
We'll see.

441
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,233
Wake up.

442
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,800
I said, wake up.

443
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:00,352
I told you I didn't want to be disturbed.

444
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:03,401
<i>Your daughter is still demanding to see you, Mr. President.</i>

445
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,567
She refuses to leave.

446
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,501
Very well. Send her in.

447
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:13,967
Kayla, my love,

448
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:17,046
I'm in the middle of a crisis, so unless it's an emergency...

449
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:19,216
It is an emergency.

450
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,933
We need to talk about you having Tarin arrested.

451
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,170
Tarin has been taken to the embassy

452
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:26,933
to help clarify a few questions,

453
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:27,919
strictly routine.

454
00:22:27,954 --> 00:22:30,701
I know you believe he's been working against you.

455
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:33,167
What I don't understand is why.

456
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:37,200
He refused to follow my orders.

457
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,012
You asked him to arrest the family

458
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:40,559
of one of your delegates.

459
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:42,900
A man you considered a friend.

460
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:45,900
Kayla, this is a matter of state; it doesn't concern you.

461
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,596
It doesn't make sense.

462
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:49,271
Tarin was in the car with you--

463
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:51,418
if the assassination attempt was successful,

464
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,078
he would've been killed, too.

465
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:55,800
The world is full of men willing to die for their cause.

466
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,800
I know you consider Tarin a friend.

467
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,900
And your loyalty is commendable.

468
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,600
But trust me, I have my reasons.

469
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,200
We are more than friends.

470
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:06,141
We're in love,

471
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,467
and have been for almost a year.

472
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,267
You've been carrying on with this man

473
00:23:15,722 --> 00:23:17,534
behind my back?

474
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,074
You say that to me,

475
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:22,124
after driving mother away with your infidelity.

476
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,820
Please, Father.

477
00:23:26,855 --> 00:23:28,826
Don't let Uncle Farhad's betrayal

478
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:31,619
turn you against everyone who cares about you.

479
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,267
I can't think of a better way

480
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:39,856
to completely infiltrate my life and influence my judgment

481
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,434
than getting close to my daughter.

482
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,534
It's not like that.

483
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:46,867
You're not to see that man again, ever.

484
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:48,600
Father...

485
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,966
I'm done with this conversation.

486
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:51,933
I need to get back to my work.

487
00:23:54,401 --> 00:23:56,401
What's happening to you?

488
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,034
Come on.

489
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:25,701
Damn it!

490
00:25:30,755 --> 00:25:33,434
I am holding the rods until Meier comes clean

491
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:34,966
about how he knew of the transfer.

492
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,134
If what Meier said is true about the leak in Farhad's team,

493
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,566
it will be dangerous for us.

494
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,900
So we must unload the rods, finish this.

495
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,167
Let them be someone else's problem...

496
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,334
And we erase any evidence.

497
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:48,755
Once Dimitri is finished, and I'm satisfied

498
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,237
the German is telling the truth,

499
00:25:50,272 --> 00:25:51,970
I'm going to want to hand off the rods

500
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:55,301
to Farhad tonight.

501
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,734
Keep your men out of sight along the perimeter.

502
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:09,734
Mikhail and his men will stay with the cargo.

503
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Check to see if the rest of the street lost power.

504
00:26:23,673 --> 00:26:25,757
Just us.

505
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,090
It's Meier.

506
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:28,668
Cover the exits.

507
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:34,334
Check the fuse box.

508
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:24,701
Come on.

509
00:27:27,675 --> 00:27:28,538
CTU. O'Brian.

510
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:30,266
<i>Chloe. It's Jack.</i>

511
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,334
Jack, everyone's been looking for you.

512
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:31,787
<i>Where are you?</i>

513
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:33,289
I need you to trace this call

514
00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:34,721
and send a Tac team immediately.

515
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:36,423
- Jack?
- Chloe, just trace the call.

516
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:38,501
<i>Jack!</i>

517
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:23,701
We're sure NYPD's got the perimeter locked down?

518
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:26,100
The restaurant and everything in a block radius is secure.

519
00:29:26,134 --> 00:29:28,696
Our response team will be there soon.

520
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,366
Where's Dana?

521
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,652
She logged out of the building about 15 minutes ago.

522
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:35,401
Something about fixing a faulty relay

523
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:37,099
at our 17th Street station.

524
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,200
Why didn't she just have IP maintenance take care of it?

525
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:40,600
Good question.

526
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:43,200
She had to manually reboot the firmware herself.

527
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:45,668
That's what she said anyway.

528
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,155
Where are we with this man Bazhaev?

529
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,231
It's coming through right now.

530
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:51,368
I've cross-accessed interagency servers,

531
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:53,734
also Interpol and FSB.

532
00:29:53,768 --> 00:29:55,534
I'm relaying intel as it comes in

533
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,301
to our response team and to Jack.

534
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:59,234
Good. Put it up on screen.

535
00:30:01,808 --> 00:30:03,200
Okay, people.

536
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,128
We've ID'd the suspect we have in custody.

537
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:09,467
His name is Sergei Petrovich Bazhaev,

538
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:11,516
Ukrainian national, 61 years of age.

539
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,531
Now, we believe he knows the location

540
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:15,507
of the unsecured nuclear rods.

541
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,000
Now, tactical is on its way to transport him back here

542
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:19,004
for interrogation.

543
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,234
Agent Ortiz will coordinate operations from here.

544
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,301
Is it true? You found Jack?

545
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,234
Yeah. He's okay.

546
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,865
If you're finished with your statement,

547
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,331
I need to take you to medical.

548
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,100
No. No. I want to be here when Jack gets back.

549
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,600
I'll let him know where to find you.

550
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:47,749
Come on.

551
00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:51,301
Mr. Bauer, this should hold you for now.

552
00:30:51,336 --> 00:30:52,799
But you're going to have to go to the hospital.

553
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,027
- Okay.
- Excuse me, sir.

554
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,167
They uploaded the suspect's file right now.

555
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,890
How far out is CTU?

556
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,896
They're about five minutes out.

557
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,867
It's all right. I got it. Thanks.

558
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:22,372
Sergeant?

559
00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:24,768
I need to speak with this man alone.

560
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,701
I knew you were a cop.

561
00:31:36,734 --> 00:31:38,199
I should have trusted my instincts

562
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,433
and killed you on the spot.

563
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:43,501
Well, you can add it to your list of regrets.

564
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,484
CTU's already acquired a great deal of intel on you,

565
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,967
Mr. Bazhaev.

566
00:31:50,664 --> 00:31:52,668
It's over. You know that, right?

567
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:54,601
You're finished.

568
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,766
I mean, at the very least, we've got you

569
00:31:57,801 --> 00:31:59,366
on kidnapping and murder, and that's before

570
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,168
CTU rips this place apart and uncovers the rest

571
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:03,933
of your criminal activity.

572
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:08,047
Lucky for you, though, I'm only interested in one thing,

573
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,818
and that's the acquisition of those fuel rods.

574
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:14,185
So, if you were to cooperate,

575
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,799
that would go a long way to reducing

576
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:21,800
what is clearly going to be a very long prison sentence.

577
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,100
That offer extends to both of your sons, too--

578
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,167
Josef and Oleg.

579
00:32:31,502 --> 00:32:33,067
Oleg is dead.

580
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:36,023
He was exposed to the rods.

581
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,702
Became ill with radiation poisoning.

582
00:32:39,737 --> 00:32:41,534
He was suffering,

583
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:44,734
and I shot him,

584
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:48,267
as if he was just a sick dog.

585
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:52,833
I murdered my own son.

586
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:56,900
For nothing.

587
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:09,534
You want to know where the rods are?

588
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,333
I will tell you.

589
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:12,767
But I want full immunity.

590
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:15,828
Not just for me, but for my other son, Josef.

591
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:17,668
I don't think I can make that happen.

592
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:19,668
Then we have nothing to talk about.

593
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:35,167
I'll see what I can do.

594
00:33:43,024 --> 00:33:44,167
CTU. O'Brian.

595
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,945
Chloe, it's Jack.

596
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,405
I need to speak with Hastings.

597
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,861
I think he's in the middle of a briefing with President Taylor.

598
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,234
Even better. See if you can patch me in, okay?

599
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:53,133
Okay.

600
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:55,780
Mr. Hastings, it's Farhad Hassan I'm worried about.

601
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:57,094
How do we know he hasn't acquired

602
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:58,145
<i>the rods already?</i>

603
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,270
Based on the intel we have, the transfer hasn't

604
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,017
<i>taken place yet.</i>

605
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:02,854
<i>Madam President, excuse the interruption.</i>

606
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:03,990
<i>Jack Bauer is on the line.</i>

607
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:05,456
<i>He wishes to be conferenced in.</i>

608
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:06,966
Put him through.

609
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,199
Jack, it's President Taylor.

610
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,666
<i>You're on with Mr. Hastings</i>

611
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:11,133
<i>and my chief of staff.</i>

612
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:14,084
CTU's been keeping me apprised of your involvement in this.

613
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,334
I'm sorry that it's taken this long for us to speak.

614
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:18,266
I understand, and please forgive me

615
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:19,600
for getting straight to the point,

616
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:21,484
but the man that we have in custody,

617
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,243
Sergei Bazhaev, is willing to cooperate.

618
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:24,967
He said he would hand over the fuel rods

619
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,933
in exchange for full immunity for him and his son.

620
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:27,931
Is that all?

621
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,640
Why don't me give him a parade down Broadway, too?

622
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:31,437
Jack, you've been dealing with this man.

623
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,199
Is there no other way to get the location

624
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,923
of the nuclear materials out of him?

625
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:38,003
It says in his files that he did 12 years in a Russian labor camp.

626
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:39,828
In the time frame that we have,

627
00:34:40,188 --> 00:34:41,585
we're not gonna break him, Madam President.

628
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,877
I can see it in his eyes.

629
00:34:42,912 --> 00:34:45,205
Mr. Hastings, what is your assessment?

630
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,563
Well, at first blush, I'd say an immunity deal is premature,

631
00:34:48,598 --> 00:34:50,634
but under the circumstances,

632
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:52,900
I'll defer to Jack's judgment on this.

633
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:55,706
Gentlemen, I have a peace deal that's going to fall apart

634
00:34:55,741 --> 00:34:58,523
at any moment unless I can show President Hassan

635
00:34:58,558 --> 00:34:59,735
that we have stopped his brother

636
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,668
from smuggling those fuel rods out of the country.

637
00:35:03,826 --> 00:35:05,434
Make the deal, Jack.

638
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,199
Madam President, he's going to want this in writing.

639
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,366
<i>He'll get it.</i>

640
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,197
But in the interests of expediency,

641
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:12,028
<i>put him on the phone with me.</i>

642
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:14,434
Yes, ma'am.

643
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,234
The President of the United States

644
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,167
wants to talk to you.

645
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,267
You want to tell me what's going on?

646
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:35,577
What are you talking about?

647
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:37,266
You were implying something about Dana,

648
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,767
and I want to know what it is.

649
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:42,272
When she came over before and said

650
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,509
she had to talk to you, what did she tell you?

651
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,867
Nothing. She said she had a problem, and she'd handle it.

652
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:48,300
That's it?

653
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,999
Arlo, if you know something...

654
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,194
Okay, look,

655
00:35:52,229 --> 00:35:53,167
it's none of my business,

656
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,878
and I didn't want to be the one to tell you this,

657
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,301
but I think she went to meet some guy.

658
00:36:01,914 --> 00:36:03,774
You're out of your mind.

659
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:05,634
Take a look at this.

660
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,855
Who is he?

661
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,742
I checked with the gate.

662
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:14,772
They said his name is Kevin Wade.

663
00:36:14,807 --> 00:36:16,767
Identified himself as a friend.

664
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,434
Okay, so he's a friend.

665
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:34,534
Cole?

666
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:38,088
Bazhaev's given up the location of the nuclear rods.

667
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:39,959
I've already scrambled a NEST team.

668
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:41,761
Meet your tactical unit at the helipad.

669
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:43,751
The coordinates will be relayed to you en route.

670
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:45,832
Yes, sir.

671
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:48,078
You think you can find her?

672
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:50,434
I could if all the drones weren't already committed.

673
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,367
What about a cell trace?

674
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,833
Just do it.

675
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:27,933
I don't know where you are or what you're doing, Dana,

676
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,648
but I need you to call me as soon as you get this.

677
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:31,832
It's important.

678
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,819
I love you.

679
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:42,700
Thank you, sir.

680
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:43,733
Sorry.

681
00:37:43,734 --> 00:37:45,634
Don't worry about it.

682
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:04,899
Miss Kayla, no.

683
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,149
Get out of my way, Nabeel.

684
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,005
I want to see him.

685
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,022
Your father forbids it.

686
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:13,368
I'm sorry. I'm just doing my job.

687
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:15,233
A job that Tarin gave you.

688
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:16,870
He brought you into my father's

689
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:19,468
security detail, and this is how you repay him?

690
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,533
You're his friend, Nabeel.

691
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,467
You know he's innocent.

692
00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:27,800
What would you have me do?

693
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,632
Just let me speak to him.

694
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:31,900
A few minutes is all I ask.

695
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,167
I can't let you in now.

696
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:36,532
Tarin's going to be readied for transport

697
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,400
to our embassy in an hour.

698
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:41,401
I will find a moment you can see him before then.

699
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,967
Thank you, Nabeel.

700
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:47,134
Now go before we're both in trouble.

701
00:38:55,967 --> 00:39:00,301
Cole, the NEST team's ETA is two minutes from target site.

702
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:03,992
Now the HAZMAT crew will wait for your signal to move in.

703
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:05,833
Be advised the truck with

704
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:08,700
<i>the fuel rods is being guarded by two armed hostiles.</i>

705
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:11,567
Command, we have an immunity deal with their boss.

706
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,533
Why haven't they been ordered to stand down?

707
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:17,267
Well, Jack's understanding is that these men are hard cases.

708
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:18,733
They won't roll over easily.

709
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,633
We cannot take the risk that they'll flee with the rods.

710
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:22,335
Understood.

711
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,634
Now, when you secure the nuclear materials,

712
00:39:24,669 --> 00:39:26,899
you'll transport them to Fort Hamilton.

713
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,234
<i>We're clearing that air corridor as we speak.</i>

714
00:39:33,116 --> 00:39:34,246
Command, we see the truck,

715
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:36,568
but there's no sign of hostiles.

716
00:39:36,603 --> 00:39:38,532
Approaching the weigh station now. Stand by.

717
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:40,800
Set us down there.

718
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:09,876
Picking up trace radiation.

719
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:11,500
30 millirads. It's safe.

720
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,433
Go, go. Move in.

721
00:40:36,386 --> 00:40:37,700
We're clear.

722
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:47,567
Command, are you seeing this?

723
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,200
I am.

724
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,234
Where the hell are the rods?

725
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:53,554
We picked up trace radiation signatures.

726
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:54,953
The rods were here.

727
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,767
Right now all we have are two bodies, both shot.

728
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,934
Hey, Agent Ortiz.

729
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:27,867
Come on, man, you can have a good time.

730
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,034
It's okay. It's okay to laugh once in a while.

731
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,967
You can be a happy person.

732
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,433
This is Bauer.

733
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:41,532
It's Hastings.

734
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:42,849
Our team's at the truck stop.

735
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:44,166
The nuclear rods are not there.

736
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:47,267
What? H-Hold on. Say that again.

737
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,834
<i>I said the rods are not there.</i>

738
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:51,899
That's not possible.

739
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,367
Did your men go to the right place?

740
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:54,766
They went exactly where you sent them.

741
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,934
Now stop playing games and tell us where the rods are.

742
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:59,468
I told you, they were there.

743
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,166
I had two of my men guarding them.

744
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,833
<i>We found their bodies, both shot.</i>

745
00:42:02,834 --> 00:42:04,066
<i>And there was something else.</i>

746
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:05,532
Some kind of necklace hanging

747
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:07,216
on the inside of the truck's door.

748
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:08,899
Like someone wanted to send a message.

749
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,084
What kind of a necklace?

750
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,767
<i>A gold cross.</i>

751
00:42:14,684 --> 00:42:16,500
What does that mean?

752
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:20,201
Josef.

753
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:25,632
I have the fuel rods.

754
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,301
Really?

755
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:29,666
I wasn't sure I believed, Josef,

756
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,166
that you would betray your father.

757
00:42:31,586 --> 00:42:33,609
You were upset that he was holding up delivery

758
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:35,633
of the rods; now I've gotten them for you.

759
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:37,270
It won't take him long to realize what's happened,

760
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,100
so let's get this done fast.

761
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:39,853
You're worried he'll discover

762
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:41,566
you've replaced him as our partner.

763
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:44,567
No, I want my father to know.

764
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,834
In fact, I made sure he will.

765
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:48,333
When will you get here?

766
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:49,966
Less than five minutes.

767
00:42:58,694 --> 00:43:01,909
