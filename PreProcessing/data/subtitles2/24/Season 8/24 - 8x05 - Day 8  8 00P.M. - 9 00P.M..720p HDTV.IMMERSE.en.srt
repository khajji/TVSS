1
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,133
I need to know about my brother.

3
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,760
He's alive. Get out now.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,030
It can't be long

5
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,030
before they realize it's you.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,360
I need you to get back in the car.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,800
Ah!

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,260
Your brother was involved with the attack.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,560
He's the insider we've been looking for.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,860
What's going on?

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,660
The body triggered a Hazmat alarm.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,930
It's highly enriched uranium.

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,100
You mean it's weapons-grade?

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,700
How the hell did he come into contact with that?

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,400
I think I know the answer.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,930
Someone approached my brother with weapons-grade uranium.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,060
- Who?  - Someone who had access

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,700
to decommissioned Soviet stockpile.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,460
You must find the Russians

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,560
before they can get the uranium to my brother.

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,000
I want proof that the rods exist,

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,260
or you will not be paid.

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,700
You want proof, huh?

24
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,230
Come with me.

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,560
My younger son,

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,530
he was transporting the rods,

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,860
and he was careless.

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,900
There, you have your proof.

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,860
You were undercover for nearly two years

30
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,760
with the Russian mob.

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,260
Your cover is still intact.

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,660
Are you asking me to go back in?

33
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,060
Agent Walker hasn't been undercover for over six year

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,060
I think you're making a mistake by putting her in.

35
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,530
You must have other options.

36
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,700
She's our only way in.

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,860
Fine, then I want to go with her.

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,360
I assume your plan is

39
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,800
trying to set up a competing buy?

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll act as a buyer.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm looking for Vladimir.

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,860
Vlad disappeared.

43
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,530
But you can find him.

44
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,530
They know where I am 24/7.

45
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,860
I'm still in prison.

46
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,400
Parole bracelet?

47
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,460
I can get this off.

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,930
You can't cut bracelet.

49
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

50
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,860
What the hell have you done?!

51
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,200
That's it, this is over.

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,830
Maybe for you, Jack, but I'm just getting started.

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,670


60
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,180
Where have you been?

61
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,280
It took me this long to get clear.

62
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,610
I'm with Bazhaev.

63
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,180
To hell with Bazhaev!

64
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,610
Everything we have worked for, it's all over because of him.

65
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,410
It's not over, General.

66
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,750
Of course it is!

67
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,150
Your brother is still alive,

68
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,750
and your plan to replace him as head of state is finished.

69
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,810
Now his security forces are rounding up our people

70
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,480
all over the city.

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,710
General Amiri was just pulled from his home five minutes ago,

72
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,510
in front of his wife and children.

73
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,350
Look, the Americans won't let him continue.

74
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,980
They'll accuse him of human rights violations

75
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,480
and threaten to pull out of the peace talks.

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,250
Once we have the uranium

77
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,450
my brother will become irrelevant anyway.

78
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,350
You are being hunted like an animal.

79
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,980
How do you expect to get the uranium?

80
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,380
Bazhaev can deliver it to us,

81
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,980
but first I need payment wired to his account.

82
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,850
It's all right.

83
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,650
Mm. Thank you.

84
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,850


87
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,330
I found a doctor who can treat him.

88
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,660
We have been through this.

89
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,030
No doctors.

90
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,730
Yes, but this one has a family.

91
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,730
I know where they are, I know their names.

92
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,760
I'll make sure he keeps his mouth shut.

93
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,360
And you can guarantee no one else in this clinic

94
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,700
will find out?

95
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,690
Another doctor, a nurse, no one?

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,360
The authorities know about the nuclear material

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,760
or they will soon enough,

98
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,130
and they'll be looking everywhere.

99
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,500
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.

100
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,090
He's going to die if we don't get him help.

101
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,400
Then he's going to die.

102
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,400
But alone like this?

103
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,630
In a cold room behind the kitchen?

104
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,930
He's my brother, Papa,

105
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,130
and he's your son.

106
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,160
All right.

107
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,500
Take him to the country house.

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,630
Ulana will look after him.

109
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,460
Thank you, Papa.

110
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,160
What is it?

111
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,930
Farhad is asking for you.

112
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,930
You have news for me?

113
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,300
Yes.

114
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,960
The money will be transferred to your account shortly.

115
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,700
When can I take possession of the rods?

116
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,530
As soon as we have the money.

117
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,300
Five hours.

118
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,000
Good.

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,230
I'll help you pass the time.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,130
You have a preference?

121
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,160
No.

122
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,500
Then take both.

123
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,760
He's still bleeding out.

124
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,130
This should cauterize the wound.

125
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,230
Okay, it's working.

126
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,930
Who are you calling?

127
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,260
- Hastings.  - Why?

128
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,600
Because I'm shutting this operation down.

129
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
You shouldn't be in the field, and this proves it.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,260
This was the only play, Jack.

131
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,500
You would've done the same thing.

132
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,030
The play was to get him to cooperate.

133
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,000
- He will cooperate.  - How do you figure?

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Look, I know these guys, Jack.

135
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,090
The only thing that Ziya likes

136
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,730
more than 13-year-old girls is money.

137
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,500
He'd have butchered himself for a score like this.

138
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,160
Yeah, well, Hastings still needs to know the truth.

139
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,300
The truth?

140
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,260
That you're unstable!

141
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,860
Look... I don't blame you

142
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,630
after everything you've been through,

143
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,130
but you are not fit for this mission.

144
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,960
I went through a rough patch, yeah,

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
but I came out on the other side.

146
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
And I don't think you have.

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,460
The bottom line is, I'm still the best chance

148
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,300
that anyone has of intercepting that uranium,

149
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
and I can do it now.

150
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,300
So, what's it going to be, you making that phone call or what?

151
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,560
He's waking up, Jack.

152
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,100
Better make up your mind.

153
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,090
Fine.

154
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,500
You see what you can get out of him.

155
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,330
But don't forget, I'm listening.

156
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,900
Renee!

157
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,430
Shut up, Ziya.

158
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,400
Renee!

159
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,560
You'll get your painkillers as soon as we get out of here.

160
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
- What did you do?!  - I got the bracelet off,

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,460
all right, I did you a favor.

162
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,500
You crazy bitch! You cut off thumb!

163
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,030
Look, what's done is done.

164
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,360
You can either stay here and whine about it like a baby,

165
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,860
or you can come with me and be a rich man.

166
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,600
Look, I'm willing to give you a point on this deal off the top.

167
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,460
It's a lot of money, Ziya.

168
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,800
How much?

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,300
Two-and-a-half million.

170
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,360
Maybe three when it's all done.

171
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,230
Two million?

172
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,800
You're serious?

173
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,690
You tell me.

174
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,600
I take this deal to Vladimir,

175
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
and it's not real, you know what happens?!

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,030
Why would I be here if this wasn't real?!

177
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,800
Fine, forget it, Ziya.

178
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,090
I'll find Vladimir my own way.

179
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,960
No, wait!

180
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,700
I don't know where he is exactly,

181
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,060
but where he might be.

182
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,900
Tell me.

183
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,130
No, I'll take you there myself.

184
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,500
You have a car?

185
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,930
I have truck, it's parked out back.

186
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,360
All right, I'll drive.

187
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,030
Come on!

188
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,560
Yeah?

189
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,760
Jack, I just found out in my

190
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,900
background check that Ziya has a probation officer.

191
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,960
- How do you want to handle this?  - You don't need to.

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,230
He has a tracking bracelet.

193
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,460
Not anymore.

194
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,830
I don't understand.

195
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,530
Those things have anti-tamper mechanisms.

196
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,600
You can't cut them off him without triggering an alarm.

197
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,900
Yeah, well, trust me, it's been taken care of.

198
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,730
Jack, what happened in there?

199
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,860
Renee got the result she wanted.

200
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,830
Ziya's taking her to Vladimir.

201
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,300
Dana's still working on your cover profile.

202
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,900
Okay, they're moving.

203
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,730
I'll call you when it's ready.

204
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,960
Jack's still waiting on the rest of that profile.

205
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,300
I'm still working the timeline.

206
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,060
Tell him I'm almost finished.

207
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,130
Okay.

208
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,000
Aren't you going to get that?

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,330
Yeah, probably should.

210
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,530
Hello?

211
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,030
I'm in the middle of something.

212
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,560
Hold on a second.

213
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
Chloe, I will send that profile to you as soon as I'm done.

214
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,500
Okay.

215
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,260
I told you not to call.

216
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,800
Yeah, I know what you told me.

217
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,930
But now that I'm here in your apartment,

218
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,360
I just can't help but miss you.

219
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,430
My shift is over in the morning.

220
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,360
I will see you then.

221
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,530
Yeah, well, that's just not going to work now, is it?

222
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,160
I'm right in the middle of something, Kevin.

223
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,760
Turn on the news if you don't believe me.

224
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,090
Hey, that's not my problem.

225
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,700
Okay, I need to see you.

226
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,800
- You have 15 minutes.  - That's not possible.

227
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,190
Okay, you got 30.

228
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,800
Who said I can't be reasonable?

229
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,300
Kevin...

230
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,530
Don't make me call that little boyfriend of yours.

231
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,430
Rock his perfect little world.

232
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,960
"Hey, pal, congratulations on the engagement."

233
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,400
"By the way, her name's not Dana Walsh, it's Jenny Scott."

234
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,260
"Oh, did I mention that she's an ex-con?"

235
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,900
"No, no, no, nothing too serious."

236
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,090
"Just accessory to murder is all."

237
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,900
You still there?

238
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,930
Yeah, I'm here.

239
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,230
See you soon.

240
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,760
Arlo, can I ask you something?

241
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,500
Yes, I'm available Saturday night,

242
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,760
and I can change my plans for Friday if you want.

243
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,730
Also, I'm free on Thursday.

244
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,900
Look, Arlo, I'm sorry.

245
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,730
It's just, a situation's come up,

246
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,400
and I have to go home for a while.

247
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Dana, we're in the middle of a major protocol.

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,630
I understand that, and I won't be long, I promise.

249
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,630
But I need you to cover for me.

250
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,800
Put the finishing touches

251
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,500
on the profile for Renee Walker and Jack Bauer.

252
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,560
And if I ask what this is about, you'll tell me...

253
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,660
- That it's none of your business.  - Right.

254
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,030
I thought so.

255
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,760
Send it to Chloe's screen as soon as you're finished.

256
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay.

257
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,060
Thank you, Arlo. I owe you one.

258
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,500
One what?

259
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,530
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.

260
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,230
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

261
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,730
I've spoken to 12 heads of state.

262
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,560
They're concerned, but they're all still

263
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,960
planning to attend the signing ceremony tomorrow.

264
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,030
Well, I've got some bad news.

265
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,400
Apparently, killing

266
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,700
President Hassan was only part

267
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,860
of his brother's plan.

268
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,230
CTU now believes

269
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,930
he's also trying to acquire weapons-grade uranium.

270
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,030
From whom?

271
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,000
A Russian crime syndicate here in New York.

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,230
Half of them are

273
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,930
ex-Soviet Army or KGB.

274
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,800
If anyone had access to unsecured stockpiles...

275
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,830
It's what we've been afraid of since the Wall came down.

276
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,960
Is President Hassan aware of this?

277
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,900
He's the one who told CTU about it.

278
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,200
Director Hastings has already initiated

279
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,430
an undercover operation to try to recover the uranium

280
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,160
before it's smuggled out of the country.

281
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,630
The nuclear materials are here on U.S. soil?

282
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,760
- Are they sure?  - Afraid so.

283
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,930
Ethan, you asked if President Hassan

284
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,500
was aware of this. Why?

285
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,760
Helps explain what's been going on in the Islamic Republic.

286
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,600
I just spoke

287
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,730
with our ambassador in the I.R.K.

288
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,130
Hassan's security forces are sweeping through the capital,

289
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,460
arresting opposition leaders, shuttering news organizations.

290
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,430
Has he declared martial law?

291
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,800
Not officially, but effectively,

292
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,460
that's exactly what he's been doing.

293
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,830
Who can blame him?

294
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,930
I mean, his brother can't have been acting alone.

295
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,100
We want Hassan cracking down

296
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,460
on hardliners in his own government.

297
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,030
Except that he's defying his country's laws,

298
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,000
as well as his international human rights obligations.

299
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,930
And if he continues, it may delegitimize the peace accord.

300
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,260
Is President Hassan back yet from CTU?

301
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,860
He'll be here in ten minutes.

302
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,000
I want to speak to him... alone.

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll take care of it.

304
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,660
That's enough.

305
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,530
What's your problem?

306
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,700
I need you thinking clearly.

307
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,560
You tell me you'd get me real painkiller.

308
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,800
Put it away.

309
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm surprised.

310
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,060
I'm surprised you

311
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,860
take deal to him again after what he did to you.

312
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,200
How much further?

313
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,660
Okay.

314
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,760
You don't want to talk about Vladimir.

315
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,700
I understand.

316
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,030
I don't blame you.

317
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,530
After all, what is there to say about such a man?

318
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,160
Nothing good, nothing very...

319
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,500
Just tell me

320
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,630
how much further.

321
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,260
Ten minute.

322
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,860
Touchy, touchy.

323
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,930
Yeah?

324
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,760
Arlo just locked your cover profile.

325
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,460
I'm uplinking it to you now.

326
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,030
Okay, hold on one sec.

327
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,930
Okay, I got it.

328
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,100
Hey, you're taking me out

329
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,800
of Renee's comm when you call, right?

330
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,860
Okay, I want you to go into her undercover file

332
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,230
with regards to Vladimir Laitanan.

333
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,930
I need to know everything that happened between them.

334
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,260
I'll call you right back.

335
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,430
Okay, thanks.

336
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,630
Mr. President.

337
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,900
Your chief of staff said it was urgent.

338
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,760
It is, but first,

339
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,630
I want to say again how thankful we are that you're all right.

340
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,100
If this is about my security forces

341
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,330
and the necessary steps

342
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm taking back home, I'm afraid I can't help you.

343
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,160
Are you so sure they're necessary?

344
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,960
What happened today was nothing short of a coup.

345
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,530
These same people are trying

346
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,300
to restart my country's nuclear weapons' program.

347
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,930
I understand, but...

348
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,260
No, I don't think you do.

349
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,830
Yours is an open society, Madam President,

350
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,530
governed by the rule of law.

351
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,530
Mine is closed.

352
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,660
The only real law is power.

353
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,260
Any perceived

354
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,600
weakness on my part, and I'm finished.

355
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,030
I'm aware of the complexities

356
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,600
of your situation, Mr. President.

357
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,030
My brother tried to kill me,

358
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,630
helped by elements within my own government.

359
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,300
Those elements must now be purged.

360
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Purged?

361
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,030
You mean, executed?

362
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,330
It is the only thing my people understand.

363
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,060
I can't vouch for you as a reformer, Mr. President,

364
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,630
if you renege on your human rights obligations.

365
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,560
The world is trusting you because I trust you.

366
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,960
You're asking me to show mercy to enemies

367
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,660
who are trying to destroy me.

368
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,600
I am asking you to find a middle way,

369
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
in the name of bringing peace

370
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,030
to a region that hasn't known peace for generations.

371
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,400
I need to see my family now.

372
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,700
I found a doctor.

373
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,160
A doctor? 

374
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,360
Someone who can help you, someone we can control,

375
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,000
but Papa says it's too risky.

376
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,860
Papa's right.

377
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,860
Condemning you to death?

378
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,330
I don't believe that.

379
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,130
What happened... was my own fault.

380
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,730
The family shouldn't have to pay for my mistake.

381
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,930
You know, all these years, I thought it was an act.

382
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,400
But you really are the good son, aren't you?

383
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,600
I'm no better or worse than you, Josef.

384
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,260
You're my older brother.

385
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,230
You've always looked out for me.

386
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,330
Joseph? Joseph, what are you doing?!

387
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm taking you to the doctor.

388
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,160
But Papa said we can't.

389
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,660
I don't care what Papa said!

390
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm not letting you die without a fight.

391
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,790
You are old enough to make your own decisions.

392
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,000
I've decided to stay.

393
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,860
As you wish.

394
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,560
You should stay, too.

395
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,830
I can't.

396
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,600
Why not? You think that

397
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,160
your father is one way, but

398
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,430
he's not what you think.

399
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,460
Stop doing that.

400
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,960
- You always do that.  - What?

401
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,790
Imply things, but you never actually tell me what you mean.

402
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,260
It is better that way, Kayla, believe me.

403
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,430
I don't want to poison you against your father. 

404
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,560
There. You're doing it again.

405
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,930
You can't help yourself.

406
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,000
Doing what again?

407
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,330
Father!

408
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,830
Oh, are you all right?

409
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,030
I'm fine.

410
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,360
We thought that...

411
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,500
I know, I know.

412
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,330
Kayla, I need to speak to your mother now alone.

413
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,730
Okay.

414
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,530
Dalia?

415
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,400
We have nothing to say to each other.

416
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,100
Dalia, please.

417
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,730
Do you love her?

418
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,500
It's over.

419
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,100
I ended it.

420
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,330
You didn't answer the question.

421
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,500
Be honest for once.

422
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
Show me a little respect.

423
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,730
I'm your wife, damn it.

424
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Do you love her?

425
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,130
Maybe I thought I did.

426
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,500
Then say it.

427
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,160
What does it matter now?

428
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,130
It matters to me.

429
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,030
The truth is...

430
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,160
I'm just glad I could still feel something, anything.

431
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,130
And that's my fault somehow? How dare you!

432
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,760
Our fault.

433
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,200
There's enough blame to go around.

434
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,660
Dalia, please don't go.

435
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,600
What?

436
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,360
I don't want you to leave.

437
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,760
Don't worry.

438
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,530
I won't make a scene.

439
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,360
You should know me better than that by now.

440
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,730
My brother's a traitor.

441
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,360
My highest officers are conspiring against me.

442
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,560
And now President Taylor

443
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,330
is threatening to pull out of the peace talks.

444
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,460
It has been a long time since you've asked my advice

445
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,560
about anything.

446
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,200
You were the one who always gave me the best counsel.

447
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,100
Thank you for remembering that.

448
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,700
Then you'll stay?

449
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,330
It's too late for that, Omar.

450
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,260
Too much has happened between us.

451
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,030
Dalia...

452
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,830
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,100
Vlad operates out of here?

454
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,560
Sometimes.

455
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,300
He moved around a lot.

456
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,700
That's why cops don't find him inside here.

457
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,230
Come on, let's go.

458
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,530
Hey, Ziya?

459
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,760
Hmm?

460
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,800
You know, Vladimir was never fond of surprises,

461
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,360
so I was thinking...

462
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,000
maybe you could go in first?

463
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,900
Get him used to the idea of me again.

464
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Whet his appetite?

465
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Exactly.

466
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,060
Okay.

467
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,930
Is our cover in place?

468
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,500
Yeah. Chloe got me everything.

469
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,730
Good. Let's start going over what happened in Mexico City.

470
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,430
How we met, who we dealt with.

471
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,830
First tell me about Vladimir.

472
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,330
What do you want to know?

473
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,200
What he did to you? I heard what Ziya said.

474
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,760
Ziya?

475
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,800
Come on, Jack, he's a drama queen.

476
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Damn it, Renee, I am running this!

477
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,630
Stop messing with me!

478
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,960
I'm responsible for your safety.

479
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,530
So, when I ask you a straight question,

480
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,760
you give me a straight answer.

481
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,430
Look, it was nothing, all right?

482
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,100
I handled him six years ago, I can handle him today.

483
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,600
The only thing that I am worried about

484
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,000
is locking down this cover, so, please,

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,030
let's not waste another minute on Vladimir.

486
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,360
I'm a Munich-based arms dealer named Ernst Meier.

487
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,460
We met in Mexico City.

488
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,960
You became my liaison to the locals.

489
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,900
Lugo.

490
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,400
Long time.

491
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
It's me, Ziya.

492
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
I know who you are.

493
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
Now what the hell are you doing here?

494
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,330
I've got business.

495
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,200
- Business?  - Yeah.

496
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,230
With Vladimir.

497
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,730
You've got business with me?

498
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,660
Vlad!

499
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,160
I should kill you for even thinking of coming here.

500
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,630
What?

501
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,200
Let me go, please!

502
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,230
- No, I...  - Five years

503
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,730
I've been living underground.

504
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,730
Five years! And now you walk into my place of business?

505
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,830
You're on probation!

506
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,900
No. Not anymore, Vlad.

507
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Look.

508
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,860
She get bracelet off.

509
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,230
What are you talking about? Who did?

510
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,860
It's what I'm trying to tell you. Renee.

511
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,400
Renee Zadan.

512
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,160
She come to my place

513
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,400
looking for you.

514
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Yeah, she say

515
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
she have buyer that

516
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,500
you'd want to hear about.

517
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,960
That it'd be good for all of us.

518
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,230
It'd be worth it for all of us.

519
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,230
Renee.

520
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,860
Dah.

521
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,030
She say where she'd been these last five years?

522
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,600
Uh, where everybody else was.

523
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
In jail.

524
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,230
Then she go to Mexico City.

525
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,130
She say she got the opportunity there.

526
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,800
Mexico City, huh?

527
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,800
What do you think, Lugo?

528
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,930
You believe this piece of dirt?

529
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,960
Sure I believe him.

530
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,730
He's too stupid to make up a story like that.

531
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,100
It's her I don't believe.

532
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,130
I never did.

533
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,930
I told you, Lugo, it wasn't her.

534
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,130
She's not the one who sold us out.

535
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,130
She shows up out of the blue,

536
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,760
then 16 months later, the feds are down our throats.

537
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm just saying, Vlad.

538
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,430
You were just saying.

539
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
Where's Renee now?

540
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,800
Outside.

541
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,130
Clean yourself up.

542
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,360
Bring her to me.

543
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Arlo, where's Dana?

544
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,000
She isn't at her desk. She went home.

545
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,430
Home?

546
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,430
Yeah.

547
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,530
Who is it?

548
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,930
It's me.

549
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,760
You have my key.

550
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,800
Nice of you to drop by.

551
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,300
It's not funny.

552
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,730
What the hell?! Who's he?

553
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,060
That's Nick.

554
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,030
It's a buddy of mine from Beaumont.

555
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,060
Get him the hell out of here.

556
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
You know I can't do that, Jen.

557
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
I already told him he could stay.

558
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,960
It'd be impolite.

559
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
Here.

560
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,060
What's this?

561
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,330
It's $500.

562
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,400
It's all I could get out of the cash machine.

563
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,000
I'll get you another 500 in the morning.

564
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,300
You think you're smart,

565
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
and the whole world's stupid.

566
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,730
That's just not how it is, Jen.

567
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,630
I don't think you're stupid.

568
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:40,730
No? But you think you can buy me off with $1,000?

569
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm not trying to buy you off.

570
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,060
No, no.

571
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,200
What do you want from me?

572
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,400
You know what I want?

573
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,260
What I really want

574
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,330
is for you to stop treating me like some dumbass,

575
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,600
19-year-old stickup artist with a fast car!

576
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,560
You're not the only one who's grown up.

577
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,430
Easy, Kevin, easy.

578
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,930
I've been waiting for this moment.

579
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,500
Dreaming about it.

580
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,230
You owe me.

581
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,730
If you think that I testified against you, I didn't.

582
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,530
Don't lie to me!

583
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,230
I'm not lying to you!

584
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,460
I got out of jail

585
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
before you did, yeah, but only

586
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
because I went in as a minor.

587
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,330
No other reason.

588
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,400
The truth is,

589
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,030
it doesn't change things,

590
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,800
one way or another.

591
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,530
See, I've done my homework.

592
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,030
I know what your job is.

593
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,960
I'm a data analyst, nothing more.

594
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,400
Yeah, but you're a data analyst for CTU.

595
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,900
You got access to all sorts of good stuff...

596
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,260
bank codes, port authority manifests,

597
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,300
stock exchange.

598
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,800
Access, yeah, but not unrestricted access.

599
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,460
You'll figure something out.

600
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,060
You always do.

601
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,930
But whatever it is,

602
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,460
the payout's got to be at least six figures, okay?

603
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,730
Please, Kevin.

604
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,660
Okay, here's the deal.

605
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,500
You do this one thing for me,

606
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,560
and I'm gone.

607
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,060
I'll never bother you again.

608
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,630
I can't.

609
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
You can.

610
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,100
And you will.

611
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,530
Since last August, we've been living and operating

612
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,260
out of a hotel called Bella Nocheon Avenida Juarez.

613
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,400
Can't they check that?

614
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,230
Yeah, it's been set up as a safe haven for high-end criminal activity.

615
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,060
They don't keep records. Have you got the name?

616
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,200
Bella Noche. I got it.

617
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,900
Okay, I'm going to be monitoring you, filling in the details.

618
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,100
Just listen to my voice.

619
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,730
I'll get you all the information you need.

620
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,460
He's coming.

621
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,160
Come on. Let's go.

622
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,430
Yeah?

623
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,500
It's not pretty, Jack.

624
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,930
She had a real problem on her hands.

625
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,360
Talk to me.

626
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,600
According to the responsible agent,

627
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,260
Vladimir Laitanan was completely obsessed with her.

628
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,360
It turned violent.

629
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
How violent?

630
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Broken ribs, a busted cheekbone.

631
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
A couple of trips to the emergency room.

632
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,660
Did he rape her?

633
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,030
Not according to these files,

634
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,200
but it looks like he tried a couple of times.

635
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,030
Did she say anything about this to you or Hastings?

636
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,860
No.

637
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,000
What's this about, Jack?

638
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,530
Jack?

639
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,530
The FBI tried to cover this up as much as they could.

640
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,200
But after she left the bureau,

641
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Renee went into a tailspin.

642
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,060
She tried to kill herself at least once that I know about.

643
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,660
She says she's past it, but I know she's not.

644
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,200
I can see it in her eyes.

645
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,230
You think she's purposely putting herself in harm's way?

646
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,900
I don't think she cares what happens to her either way.

647
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,900
- Where is she now?  - She's going in.

648
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,160
I'm going to put you on speaker.

649
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,660
(speaking native language)

650
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,560
Hands up.

651
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,060
Turn around.

652
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,760
Go.

653
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,930
Hello, Vlad.

654
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,330
Renee.

655
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:20,500
You changed your face.

656
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
I had it done in Caracas.

657
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,360
What do you think?

658
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,160
Makes you look younger.

659
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,960
I should get the name of that doctor.

660
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,000
He's not practicing anymore.

661
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,030
A sad story.

662
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,100
Our little friend here

663
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,000
says you were in Mexico City.

664
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,530
For what?

665
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,200
Had some business.

666
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,160
Good for you. I have some contacts there myself.

667
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,100
Yeah, I know you do.

668
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,260
So...

669
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,760
give me names.

670
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,500
The Peralta-Rodriguez...

671
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,960
- family.  - Uh...

672
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,000
The Peralta-Rodriguez family.

673
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,060
Castorenas in Guadalajara.

674
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,800
Ramon Jimenez.

675
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,730
I know Ramon. Is his brother Luiz still running

676
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,730
their heroin operations?

677
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,730
He was killed nine months ago by the Federales.

678
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,460
Not since he was killed by the Federales nine months ago.

679
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
You know, Renee,

680
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,460
now that you mention it,

681
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,100
there is something different about you, too.

682
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,830
How do you mean?

683
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,660
Your eyes.

684
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,830
Your skin.

685
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,400
You look like hell.

686
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,300
Well, it's hard to look your best with a gun in your face.

687
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,430
No, that's not it.

688
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,700
Something else.

689
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,730
Have you been sick?

690
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,530
No.

691
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,200
Maybe you picked up a little

692
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,360
Hepatitis C on your travels?

693
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,800
Where were you staying in Mexico City?

694
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,760
The Bella.

695
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,700
Bella Noche Hotel.

696
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,330
Bella Noche, naturally.

697
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,400
Then, of course, you must know

698
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
the government official who allows it

699
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,600
to operate without police interference.

700
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,830
Chloe, the hotel in Mexico City...

701
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,160
was there a local politician on the take?

702
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,400
- I don't have it here.  - Neither do I.

703
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,800
- Checking DEA database.  - Come on.

704
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,430
- Chloe.  - Give me a minute.

705
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,330
She doesn't have a minute.

706
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,260
Waiting for a name!

707
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,230
Go ahead, tell him.

708
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Really getting tired of this, Vlad.

709
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,360
His name!

710
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,260
Got it... Raul Castillo.

711
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,760
Castillo, Raul Castillo.

712
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,130
Raul Castillo, all right?

713
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,000
Are we done playing 20 questions now?

714
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,800
Yes, I believe we are.

715
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,530
You know, Renee, I had almost forgotten

716
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,660
how much fun you are.

717
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,330
You're not like other women.

718
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,730
You have balls.

719
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,900
Hmm, you always did say the nicest things.

720
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,800
Can we talk about this deal now?

721
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,430
I wish it were that simple.

722
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,130
Tie her up.

723
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,160
What?

724
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,400
Vlad, what are you doing?

725
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,830
You gave me all the right answers, Renee,

726
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,100
- but you're not telling the truth.  - You're making

727
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
a mistake.

728
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,600
This is the chance of a lifetime.

729
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,460
Him, too.

730
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,660
Vlad, wait.

731
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,600
Put them in the trunk.

732
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,130
Vladimir, Vladimir, no!

733
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,460
No, Vladimir, please don't do this!

734
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
Listen to me!

735
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,700
She come to me!

736
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,760
She come to my place,

737
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
the bitch!

738
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
I swear!

739
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,760
Vladimir, I don't know anything about this!

740
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,800
No!

741
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Chloe, what the hell just happened?

742
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,330
They put her in the trunk, I lost audio.

743
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,830
Boosting the signal now.

744
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,830
Renee?

745
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,830
Try it again.

746
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,060
Renee, can you hear me?

747
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,830
Say something.

748
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,900
Chloe, I don't have her.

749
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,960
Then the car must be armored.

750
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,430
Either that or her comm shorted out.

751
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,600
Are you seeing this?

752
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,900
I am.

753
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,530
Okay, I'm following north

754
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,960
through an alley towards Woodward.

755
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,860
I think this operation just blew up.

756
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,800
Jack, are you planning to intercept?

757
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Not if the car is armored.

758
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,130
I'm gonna need tactical support.

759
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,800
I'm alerting Hastings to scramble a team now.

760
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,660
Tell him I see four men in the car,

761
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,960
and we're going to have to assume

762
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,200
they're taking Renee somewhere to kill her.

763
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,230
Copy that.

764
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,130
Damn it!

765
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Don't work too late, hon.

766
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,700
Call me when you're on the road.

767
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Will do.

768
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,060
Dr. Levine.

769
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,500
How did you get in here?

770
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,830
My brother is sick.

771
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,800
I'm not seeing patients right now.

772
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,830
He needs your help.

773
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,630
- I'm gonna call you an ambulance.  - No.

774
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,830
No one else can know about this.

775
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,000
My men are outside your house in New Rochelle.

776
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,360
I don't believe you.

777
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,830
I just spoke to my wife.

778
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,700
We're outside the gate.

779
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,500
The address is 1614 Brook Street.

780
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,430
The light in your little daughter's room

781
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,000
just went out about ten minutes ago,

782
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,200
so I want you to put the phone down

783
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,430
because you're not going to try

784
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,930
to warn anybody about this.

785
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,600
Do you understand?

786
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,460
I understand.

787
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,400
My brother has radiation poisoning.

788
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,900
He needs treatment.

789
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,130
His symptoms seem quite advanced.

790
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,500
I'm not sure what it is I can do for him.

791
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Well, you'd better be able to do something,

792
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,100
for your family's sake.

793
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,330
I, um... I need to know what kind of materials

794
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,900
he came in contact with.

795
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,260
It was uranium.

796
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,060
Do you know what variant, the isotope?

797
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,730
Weapons-grade 235.

798
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,630
Jack, this is Hastings.

799
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,060
TAC teams are three minutes away.

800
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,230
All of them aware that Renee is in the trunk?

801
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,630
The instructions are to engage only on my command.

802
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,760
Any indication where they're taking her?

803
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,930
- None.  - Any percentage in letting this play out?

804
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,800
No. As soon as she's out of the vehicle,

805
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,430
she becomes that much more vulnerable.

806
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,500
If we engage now, it means ending the operation.

807
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
This operation's over.

808
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,400
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

809
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,930
Target just turned south on Flushing.

810
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,600
Jack, that's a feeder onto the BQE in 2.6 miles.

811
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,660
Mr. Hastings, if we don't engage on these surface streets,

812
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,300
we lose our tactical advantage.

813
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,960
Chloe, get me an ETA.

814
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,930
Intercept in... two minutes, ten seconds.

815
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,230
Sir, you need to make the call now.

816
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,900
All right, I'm authorizing engagement.

817
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,360
Stand by for intercept protocols.

818
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,430
This is good. Pull over.

819
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,100
Open it.

820
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Take them out of the trunk.

821
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,160
Lugo, please, you tell him, tell Vladimir...

822
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,000
Chloe, I've got a signal again.

823
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,700
Please, Vladimir, Vlad...

824
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,430
Something's wrong... they definitely sound stopped,

825
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:33,760
but the vehicle I'm following

826
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,360
is still going south on Flushing.

827
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,600
- She told me to come to you!  - Shut up, shut up, Ziya.

828
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,900
It's not going to do any good.

829
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,400
Confirming that, Jack, the target is still moving.

830
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,230
Chloe, we're following a decoy.

831
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,300
They must have left in another vehicle. Find it!

832
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,630
Okay, pulling up a satellite footage.

833
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,700
All right, TAC teams,

834
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,630
- hold your positions, stand by.  - Jack,

835
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,130
another car drove out of the back of the auto parts building

836
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,530
five minutes after the first one.

837
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,660
Are you kidding me?!

838
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,730
I'm sorry, we were focusing

839
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,130
everything on your follow.

840
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,500
Just tell me where they are!

841
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,460
Take them down to the water.

842
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,360
Okay, I've got a GPS lock on Renee.

843
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,760
They're pulled off at Newtown Creek,

844
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,930
just south of Bryne Memorial Bridge.

845
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,230
- Where are the TAC teams?  - I'm redirecting them now.

846
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,160
How far out are they?

847
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,600
- At least ten minutes.  - Tell them to move it.

848
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,800
Put me back on to Renee's comm. Damn it!

849
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,330
Renee, it's Jack.

850
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,330
I know you can hear me.

851
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,500
Vladimir had us following a decoy.

852
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,400
TAC teams are ten minutes out.

853
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,430
I'm on my way now.

854
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,330
Do whatever you have to to buy time.

855
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,130
On your knees, both of you.

856
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,660
Please listen to me, I don't know anything.

857
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,600
Shut your mouth.

858
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,330
I'm going to give you one last chance

859
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,800
to tell me what is going on.

860
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,660
Vladimir, I swear on my life, she come to my place.

861
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,430
I don't know anything.

862
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,000
No!

863
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,560
Renee.

864
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,300
Renee?!

865
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,360
Amazing.

866
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,860
You didn't even blink.

867
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:31,760
Go ahead.

868
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Just get it over with.

869
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,530
Renee, what the hell are you doing?

870
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,760
Not yet.

871
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,200
For God's sake, don't make me grovel.

872
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Just pull the damn trigger.

873
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,330
First I want to hear the truth.

874
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,430
I want to know who you really are.

875
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,230
Who I really am?

876
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:55,700
Yeah, who you are, not a game, Renee...

877
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,200
or whatever your name is.

878
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,200
Fine, you want the truth?

879
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,830
I'll tell you the truth.

880
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,700
You were right.

881
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,660
You were right, I am sick.

882
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,230
I am so sick of living like this.

883
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:20,160
The truth is...

884
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,830
even if you let me walk right now...

885
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,760
I have nowhere to go and no one to go to.

886
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,230
You don't want to do this deal,

887
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,760
fine.

888
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,830
Then you might as well just kill me

889
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,000
because this deal is the only thing that I have.

890
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,800
Renee, please don't do this, please.

891
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,530
Besides, you wouldn't be doing anything

892
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,360
that I haven't already tried myself.

893
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,500
Do it.

894
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,930
Do it!

895
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,430
Pull the trigger!

896
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:14,760


898
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,800
You understand, right?

899
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,630
Yes.

900
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,630
Good... good.

901
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,430
Dump him in the river.

904
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,630
I need a status update.

905
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,830
Jack, are you there?

906
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,160
Do you copy?

907
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,400
You tell the TAC teams to stand down.

908
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,060
What's going on?

909
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,760
She's in.

910
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,100
They bought her cover.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
