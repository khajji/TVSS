2
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:14,050
Listen, I've been thinking

3
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:15,451
a lot about what we talked about.

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,288
I want to move back to Los Angeles with you.

5
00:00:17,356 --> 00:00:18,523
Really?

6
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:19,924
Yeah.

7
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:21,125
You're coming with us tonight?

8
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:22,193
If it's okay.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,494
Dad, I don't know what to say.

10
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:24,494
I'm so happy!

11
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:26,096
Victor, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:27,797
How the hell did you find me?

13
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,165
I have information. I'm out.

14
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,666
I don't work for the government anymore.

15
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:32,101
Well, this you're gonna want to hear.

16
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,602
There's a big hit going down.

17
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,270
President Hassan at the UN,

18
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:36,504
he's getting taken out.

19
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:37,672
When? Today,

20
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,373
before he can sign this thing with Taylor.

21
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:42,777
My country agrees to abandon
the pursuit of nuclear weapons.

22
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:45,646
But our terms, Mr. President,

23
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:47,181
were that the inspectors themselves

24
00:00:47,249 --> 00:00:49,717
would be American, not IAEA.

25
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:52,119
This is the message that you
send to the rest of the world,

26
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:53,386
and then you wonder why we
don't want to negotiate!

27
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:54,453
Farhad.

28
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,288
Please excuse my brother's passion.

29
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,555
We need to resolve this issue

30
00:00:57,623 --> 00:00:58,789
before we can move forward.

31
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,390
Find a way to give him what he wants.

32
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,692
This man is a once-in-a-lifetime leader.

33
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,428
I'm, uh, stuck outside.

34
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:06,728
I'll take care of it.

35
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:09,563
This woman poses no threat
to me or the peace process.

36
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:10,997
But you are married.

37
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:12,932
I've done nothing reckless.

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,001
Just reinstate Ms. Reed's clearance now.

39
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:17,670
Unless you want to destroy
everything that he's worked for,

40
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:19,304
stay away from him.

41
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:21,673
The brother revoked my clearance,

42
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,241
but I had Hassan reinstate it.

43
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:26,076
I know I'm behind schedule,
but it'll get done.

44
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:27,811
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings.

45
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,180
Jack Bauer's on line three.
He needs to talk to you.

46
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:31,515
Bauer?

47
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:33,483
<i>I'm with an informant
that I used to run</i>

48
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,118
who's claiming he's got intel
on an assassination attempt

49
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:36,552
on President Hassan.

50
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,588
And what does Mr. Aruz want
in return for his information?

51
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:41,256
CTU protection and immunity.

52
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:43,191
I'll send a chopper to pick you up.

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,593
Don't stop for anything! Keep going!

54
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:50,962
(gasps)

55
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,401
You need to get him out of here!
He's losing a lot of blood!

56
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,403
Hastings wants to debrief you back at CTU.

57
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,238
I'm not going back to CTU.
I delivered him, I'm done.

58
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:03,006
No, Mr. Bauer...

59
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:04,607
I got a flight to catch.

60
00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:05,474
That's it?

61
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:07,282
Get down!

62
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:13,585
Tell me what you know.

63
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:16,221
The hitter has someone on the inside...

64
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,623
close to Hassan.

65
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:27,296
(siren wailing)

66
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:39,173
It's done. Aruz is no longer a problem.

67
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,742
But we don't know how much he told CTU.

68
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:46,045
We need to accelerate the hit.

69
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:50,949
(phone rings)

70
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:52,284
Sir, Agent Ortiz is calling in.

71
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:55,353
HASTINGS: Put him through.
I want everyone on this.

72
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:58,622
Comm channel 235. All right, go ahead.

73
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,924
This is Cole. Where are those EMTs?

74
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,292
They should be there any second.

75
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,626
How's the rest of your team?

76
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:06,595
Earley's injured.
Torres and Johnson are dead.

77
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:07,996
What happened? Look, those drones

78
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:09,831
are supposed to have antiballistics.

79
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,666
Why didn't they take out the missile?

80
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,100
We're still running the diagnostic.

81
00:03:13,168 --> 00:03:14,735
Sir, this should've never happened!

82
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,803
We should've had another team
checking those buildings!

83
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:19,172
We can discuss this at a later time,

84
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,673
Agent Ortiz.

85
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:22,141
Yes, sir.

86
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,809
Bauer wants to talk with you.

87
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:25,611
Put him on the phone.

88
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:26,712
Stand by.

89
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,449
Jack, I have Mr. Hastings on the line.

90
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:32,418
Mr. Hastings?

91
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:34,954
Victor Aruz told me right before
he died that the assassin is

92
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,858
working with someone very
close to President Hassan.

93
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,360
Did you get a name?

94
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,928
No, not before he died.

95
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,664
You believe him? Normally,
I wouldn't trust him

96
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,199
as far as I could throw him.

97
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,500
He was dying, sir.

98
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:46,935
He had no reason to lie.

99
00:03:47,003 --> 00:03:48,471
All right. We're on it.

100
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,540
I need you and Cole back here to debrief.

101
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,943
Mr. Hastings, I already gave one
of your agents my statement.

102
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,679
I need you back here.

103
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:57,582
Yeah... Mr. Bauer?

104
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,492
Fine. We're on our way.

105
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:11,232
Mr. Hastings.

106
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Yes?

107
00:04:12,368 --> 00:04:15,003
I may have a lead on that insider.

108
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,672
What do you mean? I just picked up

109
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,974
an unauthorized access in
one of the secure databases

110
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:20,042
at the UN.

111
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,477
How do you know it's unauthorized?

112
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:23,413
Because they bypassed the main access page

113
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,214
and went through a back-end server.

114
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,549
The only reason to do that

115
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,749
is if you're trying to cover your tracks.

116
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,250
Stay on it. Let me know
if you trace the source.

117
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,751
And put O'Brian on this, too,

118
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,518
if you don't think she'll slow you down.

119
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,184
No. She's doing much better, sir.

120
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:37,919
I'm gonna call Taylor's chief of staff.

121
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,520
They need to know this insider
could be moving against Hassan.

122
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:43,388
Mr. President, you are under a
great deal of pressure at home

123
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:45,189
from an active opposition
to this peace agreement.

124
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:46,856
They believe that by dismantling

125
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:48,357
your nuclear weapons programs,

126
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:49,791
you're surrendering to the West.

127
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:51,391
How do you respond to those charges?

128
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,124
The only thing we are surrendering is

129
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,526
the cloud of antagonism and mistrust

130
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,395
under which we have lived for far too long.

131
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:00,430
This is a victory for my people.

132
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:04,167
It marks an end to isolation and
will bring economic stability

133
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:07,203
to my country for the first
time in decades. (phone buzzes)

134
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,438
(reporters clamoring)

135
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:09,706
How do you propose economic stability

136
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:11,241
when your people are so divided?

137
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:13,376
This is Weiss. Did you bring in Victor Aruz?

138
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,377
I'm afraid not, sir.

139
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:15,678
There was an ambush,

140
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:17,847
and Aruz was killed,
along with two of our men.

141
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:19,916
Damn it.

142
00:05:19,984 --> 00:05:21,317
Before Aruz died, he shared

143
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:22,986
some very troubling information.

144
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:25,321
Now, he claimed that someone close

145
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:27,690
to President Hassan has been
conspiring with the assassin.

146
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:30,793
Now, we don't have a name yet,
but we are pursuing a lead.

147
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,028
Tell me how, and I'd better be impressed.

148
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:35,731
We're tracing what might
be an unauthorized entry

149
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,433
into one of the UN servers.

150
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,068
And you think this is the
person we're looking for?

151
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,135
Well, we're optimistic.

152
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,303
Yeah, you better hope that optimism

153
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,303
translates into results.

154
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:43,972
Sir, until we locate the insider,

155
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,842
you might want to consider
locking down President Hassan

156
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,777
and postponing this conference.

157
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:50,546
That is not an option, Mr. Hastings.

158
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,414
We are close to signing one
of the most important treaties

159
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:54,849
in the history of this country.

160
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,018
You were put in charge
of CTU because you said

161
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,452
you could get the job done.

162
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,353
"Lean, mean and fast," that's what you said.

163
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:02,422
President Taylor expects you
to deliver on those words.

164
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,623
Yes, sir.

165
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:06,726
I'll take this to the president.
Keep me posted.

166
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:10,097
TAYLOR: President Hassan and I still
have a great deal of work to do,

167
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:12,168
so we're gonna wrap this up,

168
00:06:12,236 --> 00:06:14,938
but I would like to say that
the president and I chose

169
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:17,607
the United Nations as the
venue for these talks

170
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,576
because the problems facing
the Middle East have become

171
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:21,578
a world concern.

172
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:25,415
And President Hassan and I are confident

173
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,517
that this agreement will lay the foundation

174
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:29,920
for a lasting peace in the region.

175
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:32,856
And we thank you for your time. Thank you.

176
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:34,791
(reporters clamoring)

177
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,159
TAYLOR: Mr. President,

178
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:38,462
I'll see you after the break.

179
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,463
I look forward to resuming it.

180
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,030
Thank you.

181
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,335
Madam President, I just spoke with CTU.

182
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,203
There's been a development
regarding the threat to Hassan.

183
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:53,005
We need to speak in private.

184
00:06:55,575 --> 00:06:57,141
That is really wonderful.

185
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,742
Thank you. I'll join you later.

186
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,984
Hello.

187
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,519
You were terrific.

188
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,887
(chuckles) It's not about me,

189
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:13,455
it's the message that's important.

190
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:16,558
I just hope no one could
see how nervous I was.

191
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:18,560
(chuckles) Well, you hid it well.

192
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:19,560
Are you here?

193
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,362
Yes, on my way up.

194
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,031
Do you still have time to see me?

195
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:25,733
I've been looking forward to it all day.

196
00:07:25,801 --> 00:07:27,702
When?

197
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:31,406
What did you say?

198
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,207
When can I see you?

199
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,510
I've got half an hour before
the next session begins.

200
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:37,745
You meet me now, and we'll go up

201
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:39,413
to my private office together.

202
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,581
I'll tell my staff that
you requested an interview

203
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,083
Perfect. I'll be right there.

204
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,253
I just ran a systems check on the drone.

205
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:51,554
Sensors did pick up the missile,

206
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:52,588
but the drone didn't fire.

207
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,889
Why not?

208
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:56,390
I won't know until I have
a chance to take it apart.

209
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,424
Mr. Hastings,

210
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:01,090
I don't want to sound like
I'm covering my own ass.

211
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:03,821
but I did tell you that
the antimissile system

212
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:06,556
had not been tested in an urban environment.

213
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:08,024
I know what you said, Arlo.

214
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:11,792
You just find out what went
wrong and you get back to me.

215
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,127
Mr. Hastings, I was right.

216
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,895
Someone hacked into the UN database.

217
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,663
They downloaded security protocols,

218
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,132
the schematics to the UN and
Hassan's personal itinerary.

219
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,301
I was able to trace an IP address.

220
00:08:23,368 --> 00:08:24,469
Did you get a name?

221
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:25,603
Chloe's into the computer's registry.

222
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,672
She should have it by now.

223
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,743
Almost there. Come on, Chloe.

224
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,279
Saying that isn't gonna
make it happen any faster.

225
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:39,792
There, the computer's owner is listed

226
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,092
as Meredith Michelle Reed.

227
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,291
<i>She's a reporter working for
the New York Courier.</i>

228
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,960
She's doing a profile on Hassan.

229
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,961
Applied for a security clearance at the UN.

230
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:47,695
Did she get it?

231
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:48,796
My God... What?

232
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:49,932
She's there now.

233
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,737
UN Security logged her in 15 minutes ago.

234
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:52,905
She's at the press conference.

235
00:08:52,973 --> 00:08:54,373
Put me through to UN Security.

236
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,807
(device beeps)

237
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,375
You're clear. Go ahead.

238
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:59,176
Thank you.

239
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:09,784
Okay, go ahead.

240
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:11,719
This is Brian Hastings,

241
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:13,087
director of CTU.

242
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,322
We have a possible o
n-site threat to President Hassan.

243
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,323
Do you have an ID?

244
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,790
Her name is Meredith Reed.

245
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,493
She has a press security clearance.

246
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,895
We're sending a photograph to your PDA.

247
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,397
We just got a call about a
threat to President Hassan.

248
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,099
The UN gave us access to
their surveillance feed.

249
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,702
Facial recognition software
is sweeping the area now.

250
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,444
Got a match.

251
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,679
Northeast corner, moving toward Hassan.

252
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,847
Located the suspect.

253
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,449
She's ten yards from Hassan,

254
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,618
east side of the press section.

255
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:47,652
Green top,

256
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,854
black skirt, black jacket!

257
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,096
There she is. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

258
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,365
Everybody, move back!
Move back! What are you doing?

259
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,167
(clamoring) I'm a reporter.
I have clearance.

260
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,702
Move back!

261
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,171
HASSAN: Meredith?

262
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,107
I'm a journalist! I'm a journalist.
I have credentials.

263
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,309
We got a call from CTU about
a threat to your life.

264
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,310
Keep moving, keep moving.

265
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,713
(clamoring)

266
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,147
Mr. President...

267
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,420
Come on!

268
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,489
You're making a mistake.

269
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:36,346
The suspect's name is Meredith Reed.

270
00:10:36,414 --> 00:10:38,715
She's a journalist profiling Hassan.

271
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:43,086
Now, our operating theory is
that she's been using her access

272
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:44,220
to gain security intel,

273
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:45,721
which she's been feeding to the assassin.

274
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,859
Ms. Reed is being transported
back here right now.

275
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:53,561
My hope is that she will give
us the name of the assassin

276
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,697
so that we can put an end to this threat.

277
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:58,136
Refer to your digital briefing
packets for specifics.

278
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:00,574
Mr. Hastings, I just received a

279
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:01,742
preliminary report from the team

280
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,943
sweeping Ms. Reed's apartment.

281
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:04,078
And?

282
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,246
They recovered the files

283
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,248
stolen from the UN database off her laptop.

284
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:08,817
It looks like we found our insider.

285
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,253
They also found a large file
that couldn't be opened.

286
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,754
It's been encrypted with
intelligence grade software.

287
00:11:12,822 --> 00:11:14,222
HASTINGS: I want you to find out

288
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,590
what's inside that file.

289
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:18,293
It's on its way over as we speak. Good.

290
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,528
Excuse me, does anyone think this happened

291
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,130
a little too fast and a little too easily?

292
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:23,332
You know, Chloe, things do
happen a little faster in here

293
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,400
than what you're used to.
I know, you keep reminding me.

294
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,135
I might not be up to speed
on all your software,

295
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,171
but I know if someone
doesn't want to be found,

296
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:30,773
they don't leave behind code fragments

297
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,075
that could lead to an I.P.
address. Unless, of course,

298
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,278
they were in a hurry and
they had to improvise.

299
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,380
Maybe, but then why would you
go through all that trouble

300
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,282
and leave a huge red flag
for everyone to find?

301
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,416
What is your point?

302
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:43,120
It's like someone wanted us to find her.

303
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:47,291
I just think we should continue
to vet this until we're sure

304
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:48,925
that we have the right person.

305
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,958
We are vetting this from every angle.

306
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,325
I appreciate your concerns.
We'll keep them in mind.

307
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,859
In other words, "Shut up, Chloe."

308
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,794
That's not what he said.
Well, that's what I heard.

309
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,329
All right, you made your point.

310
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,331
Chloe, thanks.

311
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,333
All right, one last thing.

312
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:05,770
Ms. Reed has spent a lot of time
on assignment in the Middle East.

313
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,838
I want to cross-check all of her movements

314
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:10,474
with those of known terrorist groups.

315
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:11,475
Let's get moving.

316
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:13,210
Chloe.

317
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:21,016
Jack Bauer should be here any second.

318
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,485
I want you to handle his debrief.

319
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:25,787
You're taking me off the floor?

320
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:28,156
I think you'll be better
utilized debriefing Mr. Bauer.

321
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:29,257
Go set up.

322
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:30,692
Thank you, sir.

323
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:36,765
(tires squealing)

324
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,534
I'm walking in now.

325
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:43,403
Give me the home phone numbers
for Torres and Johnson.

326
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,237
Nobody speaks to their wives before me.

327
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,840
Cole, before you make your report,
I want you to keep someing in md.

328
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:49,074
What's that?

329
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,610
I know you asked for
more boots on the ground,

330
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:52,977
but what happened happened.

331
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:54,745
There's nothing we can do about that.

332
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,480
You put your opinion on record,

333
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:59,149
it's going to flag an
internal review from division.

334
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:01,985
It's only going to hurt us moving forward.

335
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:03,720
We're clear.

336
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:07,525
Mr. Bauer, Brian Hastings.

337
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:09,094
Sorry about the loss of your men.

338
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:12,431
Thank you. You'll be glad
to know the lead you got

339
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:13,833
from Victor Aruz panned out.

340
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,369
You telling me that you've
already found the insider?

341
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:18,771
Her name's Meredith Reed. She's a
journalist who was covering the peace
conference.

342
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,140
She was stealing files off the UN servers.

343
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,508
Now, we wouldn't have gotten
this far without your help.

344
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:24,910
Thank you.

345
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,545
Now, Chloe O'Brian's waiting to debrief you.

346
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:28,246
Shouldn't take long.

347
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:30,715
I just need to make a phone call first.

348
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:32,950
Excuse me.

349
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:34,218
(phone dialing)

350
00:13:34,286 --> 00:13:36,521
We need to be on the same page here.

351
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:37,789
I think you can understand that.

352
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,757
Sir, you're asking me to lie on the record.

353
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,693
I'm asking you to exercise some discretion.

354
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:45,229
There's an assassin out there.

355
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,498
We don't need people secon
d-guessing how we do things.

356
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:49,633
Well, maybe you'd like to debrief for me.

357
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:53,237
(phone line ringing)

358
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,239
(phone ringing) All right,
let's get you in here.

359
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:56,373
Hello.

360
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,075
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

361
00:13:58,142 --> 00:13:59,376
Hey, where are you?

362
00:13:59,444 --> 00:14:01,911
CTU.

363
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:03,981
CTU? Does this have anythingo do

364
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,616
with what's going on at the UN?

365
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:07,118
Yes, but I promise I won't be long.

366
00:14:07,185 --> 00:14:08,552
I just need to give them a statement.

367
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,920
But I'm going to have

368
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:11,422
to meet you at the airport.

369
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:13,391
Dad, what's going on?

370
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,560
It's complicated.
I'll explain when I see you.

371
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:17,628
Okay, but we're coming there to pick you up.

372
00:14:17,696 --> 00:14:18,896
Sweetheart, you don't need to do that.

373
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:20,764
I want to. It's on the way.

374
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:24,301
Okay, I'll have Chloe
get you a security pass.

375
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:26,269
I'll see you soon. Bye.

376
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:28,404
Who was that?

377
00:14:28,472 --> 00:14:29,705
My father.

378
00:14:29,773 --> 00:14:30,773
Everything all right?

379
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:33,209
I'm not sure.

380
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,845
HASTINGS: Everyone said you were too young,

381
00:14:36,913 --> 00:14:38,447
and inexperienced to head up field ops,

382
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:40,282
but I believed you could do the job.

383
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,652
Now I need you to show the same
faith in me that I showed in you.

384
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,321
Keep our little dispute off the record.

385
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:47,422
Where's Chloe?

386
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,925
She's upstairs. First room to the right.

387
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:52,360
Thank you.

388
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:56,465
Think about what I said.

389
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:07,776
Hey.

390
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:09,177
Hey, Jack.

391
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:11,413
Sorry, but we got to do this kind of quick.

392
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:13,382
I guess you heard about the
reporter they arrested.

393
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,283
Yeah. Well, I think we might

394
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:16,351
have the wrong person.

395
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:17,785
Meredith Reed could be innocent.

396
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,687
Hastings said they found
evidence on her computer.

397
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,156
I know, but I think those
files may have been planted.

398
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,491
Look, I've been scanning
through the trafc cam footage

399
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,159
from outside Meredith
Reed's apartment building.

400
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:27,727
Five minutes before the intrusion

401
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:30,063
to the UN server, this man was going

402
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,797
into the service entrance of the building.

403
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,799
Ten minutes later, he left.

404
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,201
What if he went into her
apartment and used her laptop

405
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,736
to break into the servers?

406
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,571
Sounds a little thin.

407
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,439
Don't you think we found her kind of fast,

408
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,074
and that it was a little too easy?

409
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:44,308
Why are you showing me this?

410
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,876
Why don't you just take it to Hastings?

411
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,244
Hastings doesn't think
I know what I'm doing.

412
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,082
He won't listen to me.
He might listen to you.

413
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,517
Chloe, I'm here for my debrief.

414
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:52,053
Kim's on her way.

415
00:15:52,121 --> 00:15:53,588
I'm leaving on a plane to Los Angeles

416
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:54,690
with my family in an hour.

417
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:57,159
I'm just asking you to talk to him.

418
00:15:57,227 --> 00:15:58,728
It'll take ten minutes.

419
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:00,396
If the assassin framed Reed

420
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:01,630
to create a diversio

421
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:03,766
that means we have the
wrong person in custody.

422
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,001
That he still has someone
inside Hassan's delegation.

423
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:09,238
I'm sorry, Chloe, it's not my problem.

424
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:11,307
Please, let's just
continue with the debrief.

425
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:18,381
<i>NEWSCASTER: Nor will they
confirm any fatalities.</i>

426
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:20,784
There is no evidence at this
time to support the theory

427
00:16:20,852 --> 00:16:23,221
that the two incidents are related.

428
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:24,890
We're still waiting for
an official statement

429
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,192
as to why this reporter was arrested.

430
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,562
At this time we can confirm that
her name is Meredith Reed...

431
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,030
I'm so gd you're all right.

432
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:33,765
I can't believe this happened.

433
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,100
...has yet to comment. In other news...

434
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:37,602
It's hard to believe, Kayla.

435
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,804
I just don't understand how
this woman got so close to you.

436
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:42,272
She's a journalist.

437
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:44,304
She had security clearance.

438
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:46,639
Do all reporters get these clearances?

439
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,873
No, but she's writing an article on me.

440
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,374
You know that, Dalia.

441
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:51,909
She was given special access.

442
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,610
You gave her that access?

443
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:56,579
Yes, I did. I did it.

444
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:58,914
This article was important for me.

445
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:01,783
I wanted to get my message
across to the American public.

446
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,418
That's the only reason?

447
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:05,720
Yes, that's the only reason!
What other reason?

448
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:07,388
If you have something to say, then say it.

449
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:10,024
You should never have
let her into our lives.

450
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,592
You put us all in danger.

451
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:12,826
(knock at door) Please, stop.

452
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,162
Excuse me.

453
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,131
I just spoke to the UN press director.

454
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,599
We're going to make a public statement.

455
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,667
Make sure I see it first.

456
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:29,974
Omar, may I speak with you alone?

457
00:17:49,793 --> 00:17:51,694
Excuse us.

458
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,703
They've taken Meredith Reed to CTU.

459
00:18:02,906 --> 00:18:05,107
I can't believe she's part of this.

460
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:09,945
What reason could she have
to help someone kill me?

461
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:13,682
What reason does any American
have to do anything? Money.

462
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:16,818
They found incriminating
files on her computer, Omar.

463
00:18:16,886 --> 00:18:19,254
Whether you want to believe
it or not, she is guilty.

464
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:20,555
And she's going to talk.

465
00:18:20,623 --> 00:18:23,358
I need to know what she's going to tell them

466
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:25,193
about your relationship.

467
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:27,662
Be honest with me.

468
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,063
Tell me everything.

469
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,536
It started three months ago in B'Dar.

470
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:42,110
We met for an interview in her hotel room.

471
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:45,513
Dalia and I had been fighting that day.

472
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,981
She used you, Omar.

473
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,583
She almost cost you your life.

474
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,118
And if this affair becomes public,

475
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:52,486
it will destroy your credibility

476
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:53,854
and everything that you've worked for.

477
00:18:53,922 --> 00:18:56,357
I don't need you to tell
me the consequences.

478
00:18:56,424 --> 00:19:00,093
If she talks to the Americans,
you must deny it.

479
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,628
It never happened.

480
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:05,432
Look, Omar, I know you're thinking

481
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,702
you must do the honorable
thing and confess the truth.

482
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,071
That would be a terrible mistake.

483
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:18,545
I need to be with my family.

484
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,493
DAVROS: Yes?

485
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,261
I just spoke with my brother.

486
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:37,130
I told him to deny the affair.

487
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:38,665
What did he say?

488
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,100
He's going to consider it.

489
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,634
Press him harder.

490
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:45,338
The reporter's claims
need to be discredited.

491
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:49,508
CTU needs to continue to think
she's my contact on the inside.

492
00:19:49,576 --> 00:19:50,775
I understand.

493
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:53,044
We only need another hour.

494
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:55,613
I'll be ready to move by then.

495
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,401
Arlo. Hey.

496
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:10,535
I need your help decrypting that file

497
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:11,903
they found on Reed's computer.

498
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,338
I broke off a section.
It should be on your screen.

499
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:16,407
What filter do you want
me to run it through?

500
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:17,441
Esquire Nine.

501
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,475
No problem.

502
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:20,577
And, Arlo--

503
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,545
you can stop staring at my breasts now.

504
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:25,048
So when are you going
to drop Captain America

505
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:26,482
and find yourself a real man?

506
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,818
I'm still thinking about it.

507
00:20:29,886 --> 00:20:31,420
Well, don't take too long.

508
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,054
I might lose interest.

509
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:34,122
(phone ringing)

510
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,456
Let me know what you find.

511
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:41,227
Dana Walsh.

512
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:43,296
Hello?

513
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:47,365
Dana Walsh.

514
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,699
I like that.

515
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,034
You picked a good name for yourself.

516
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:53,102
That's actually better than the
one your mama picked for you.

517
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,206
Whoever this is,
I told you to stop calling me.

518
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:59,077
Yeah, I know what you told me, Jenny.

519
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:01,584
My name is not Jenny.

520
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:04,320
You must be mistaking me for someone else.

521
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,321
Oh, am I?

522
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,256
Yes.

523
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:08,391
That's funny.

524
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,126
'Cause you sound a lot like this girl

525
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:12,595
I used to know from Rock
Springs named Jenny Scott.

526
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:14,363
She was a wild thing, man.

527
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:16,532
We used to do some crazy stuff.

528
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,435
The next time you call me,

529
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:22,104
I promise you I will contact the police.

530
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:24,406
Yeah? You know, I got a better idea.

531
00:21:24,474 --> 00:21:25,808
Let's contact them right now.

532
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,376
I'm hanging up now.

533
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:28,744
Hey, don't hang up this phone.

534
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:30,012
I'm warning you, Jenny,

535
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
do not...

536
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:35,284
Hey.

537
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:38,220
Hey.

538
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:40,155
Whoa.

539
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,925
I was just going to look for you.

540
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:47,163
I'm so glad that you're okay.

541
00:21:50,735 --> 00:21:55,138
I'm sorry that I have
been so distant lately.

542
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:57,440
It's just...

543
00:21:57,508 --> 00:22:00,309
I don't ever want to lose you.

544
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:02,478
Don't worry.

545
00:22:08,018 --> 00:22:10,286
Why am I here? This is a mistake.

546
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:13,190
Damn it. Who's in charge here?

547
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:14,491
Tell Mr. Weiss there's nothing yet.

548
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,361
But I'll call him as soon
as we have news. Thanks.

549
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,198
Brian Hastings, director of CTU.

550
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,164
Look, I don't know who the
hell you people think you are.

551
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:24,165
But I want an attorney, and I demand to know

552
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,833
what I'm being charged with.

553
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:27,502
We found the files, Ms. Reed.

554
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:29,003
What files?

555
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,271
On your computer. In your apartment.

556
00:22:30,338 --> 00:22:32,471
You searched my apartment?

557
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:33,972
We found six documents

558
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,707
on your laptop that were
stolen from the UN servers.

559
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:38,841
What documents?

560
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:40,876
Relating to the security arrangements

561
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:41,877
for the peace conference.

562
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,645
You're here because we know

563
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:48,684
that you're part of a plan to
assassinate President Hassan.

564
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:50,987
What? What?

565
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:52,855
Please don't waste my time.

566
00:22:52,923 --> 00:22:54,823
The evidence against you is clear-cut.

567
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:57,526
No, no, no. Listen to me.
You're making a mistake.

568
00:22:57,594 --> 00:22:59,027
If there are files

569
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:01,496
on my computer, then someone put them there.

570
00:23:01,564 --> 00:23:02,897
HASTINGS: Now you listen to me.

571
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,632
I'm giving you a chance to help yourself

572
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,033
by telling us what you know.

573
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:08,871
I need the name of the assassin,
how to find them.

574
00:23:08,939 --> 00:23:11,574
And we talk about you
avoiding the death penalty.

575
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:15,011
You're wrong.

576
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:17,213
You've got the wrong person.

577
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:21,016
Take her to interrogation.

578
00:23:21,084 --> 00:23:23,652
Full biometric package.
I'll be there shortly.

579
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,020
MAN: This way, ma'am.

580
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:32,927
Mr. Hastings?

581
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,230
You're done with your debrief?

582
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:36,898
Yeah. Can I talk to you?

583
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:38,900
Not a good time, Mr. Bauer.

584
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:41,503
Meredith Reed might be
telling you the truth.

585
00:23:41,571 --> 00:23:43,606
Is this coming from O'Brian?

586
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,040
I told her to drop this.

587
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:46,374
Yeah, well, she didn't.

588
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:49,310
She found this. They were
taken from traffic cams

589
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:52,280
near Ms. Reed's apartment.
Check out the time stamps.

590
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,683
It shows this man entering the
building through the service entrance

591
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,686
almost five minutes before the
intrusion into the UN servers.

592
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:58,687
It shows him leaving the building

593
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,555
almost immediately after. So?

594
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:01,622
Chloe talked to the building manager.

595
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,090
There was no scheduled maintenance today,

596
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,859
no packages delivered.

597
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:06,627
And this is your evidence?

598
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,928
I'm looking at an apartment building,

599
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:09,063
where dozens of people live,

600
00:24:09,131 --> 00:24:10,297
coming and going all day long.

601
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,233
Look, I understand. All I'm saying is that

602
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:14,101
it is possible that someone
broke into the apartment

603
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:15,636
and used her computer
to steal the documents.

604
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,605
All you need to do is send a
couple agents to check it out.

605
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,406
I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

606
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,108
And I can't waste valuable resources

607
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:24,111
because Chloe O'Brian has a theory.

608
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:27,281
Chloe and I have worked
together for a long time.

609
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:30,117
And trust me. She's someone
you might want to listen to.

610
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:32,719
She's very good at what she does.

611
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:34,621
And if she's right, the assassin's

612
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,056
got you looking in the wrong place,

613
00:24:36,124 --> 00:24:37,557
and you will get bit.

614
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:41,194
Mr. Bauer, I have a suspect in hand

615
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:44,464
with a file she felt
damning enough to encrypt.

616
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:46,466
That's where I'm going
to focus my resources.

617
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:47,801
Now, if you will excuse me.

618
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:55,208
I hate this place.

619
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,584
He's not going to help, is he?

620
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,219
We have to follow this lead.

621
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:06,453
If they have the wrong person...

622
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,521
Chloe, I did what you asked.
I talked to Hastings.

623
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:10,357
If he doesn't want to listen,
that's his mistake.

624
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:11,724
But it's not my problem.

625
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:13,359
To be honest with you,
it's not yours, either.

626
00:25:13,427 --> 00:25:15,361
What about the threat against Hassan?

627
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,463
What about the peace conference?

628
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,630
Doesn't any of that matter to you?

629
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:19,332
What if Hastings knows something you don't?

630
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,304
Look, I'm sorry.

631
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:29,575
Kim's waiting for me outside.

632
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:31,610
I've got to go.

633
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:32,812
Jack!

634
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,982
You've come to me for help many times,

635
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,583
and I've never let you down.

636
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,151
You've asked me to do crazy things,

637
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:43,520
and I've always taken your side.

638
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,590
Please help me.

639
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:51,927
I can't do this by myself.

640
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,231
I'm sorry.

641
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,499
I-I can't.

642
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,036
Not this time. Not me.

643
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:18,884
Hey.

644
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,156
Look what I made!

645
00:26:21,223 --> 00:26:23,225
Let me see.

646
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:27,230
That's Daddy. That's Mommy.

647
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:28,732
And that's me and that's you.

648
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,201
See? That's you, Grandpa.

649
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,003
It's beautiful, sweetheart.

650
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:34,039
Dad, we need to talk.

651
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:37,309
Yeah. Here, honey.

652
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:39,878
Why don't you get Daddy to
put you in the car seat?

653
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,647
We're ready to go.

654
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,416
What's wrong?

655
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:46,084
I spoke to Chloe.

656
00:26:46,152 --> 00:26:48,287
She told me what's happening.
Chloe called you?

657
00:26:48,354 --> 00:26:50,289
No, I called her because
you wouldn't tell me

658
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:52,958
what was going on, so I decided
to find out for myself.

659
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:55,727
I know about the threat
to the peace conference,

660
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,262
that CTU might have the wrong suspect.

661
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,430
What's happening?

662
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:00,966
Chloe had me make her
case to the head of CTU.

663
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:02,134
He wasn't convinced,

664
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:03,435
and he thinks he's got the right person.

665
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:04,670
But if he's wrong,

666
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:06,805
then there's still someone inside the UN

667
00:27:06,873 --> 00:27:08,340
who's working with this assassin?

668
00:27:08,407 --> 00:27:09,875
That's what Chloe thinks.

669
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:11,543
What do you think?

670
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,312
I think it's not my problem.

671
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,447
Dad! What?

672
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:17,815
I don't believe you.

673
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:20,351
I've never known you to walk
away from something like this.

674
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,155
If you have to stay, it's all right.

675
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:25,790
You're not letting me down.

676
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:26,958
I understand.

677
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:28,893
Sweetheart, I want to go with you.

678
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,428
I know you do.

679
00:27:30,496 --> 00:27:32,931
And there's nothing I want more
than for you to come with us.

680
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:36,268
I have been waiting so long for this day.

681
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:38,770
We both have.

682
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:41,173
But if something terrible happens,

683
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:44,110
and you could have done
something to stop it,

684
00:27:44,177 --> 00:27:46,112
I don't think you'd be
able to live with yourself.

685
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:55,657
Dad, it's okay. You can go.

686
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,878
As soon as I'm finished here,

687
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,380
I will get on a plane and I will
be in Los Angeles, I promise.

688
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:22,351
Just be careful, please.

689
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:24,720
Come here.

690
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,789
I will.

691
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,225
I should tell Teri.

692
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,660
No, no. Let me do it.

693
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:37,693
Go ahead.

694
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,759
Go.

695
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:45,328
Okay.

696
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:50,198
Go on.

697
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:54,335
You okay?

698
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:56,470
Yeah, I'm fine, but we should go.

699
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:58,572
Sweetie...

700
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:00,573
Grandpa has some work to do.
He can't fly with us.

701
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:02,909
But he'll come as soon as he can.

702
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,011
But he said he was coming today.

703
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,712
No, not today.

704
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,880
But soon, okay?

705
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:09,681
All right, let's go.

706
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:14,552
Jack...

707
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,986
We need to find out where your suspect went

708
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,219
after he left Miss Reed's apartment.

709
00:29:17,287 --> 00:29:19,587
Start checking traffic cams.

710
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:33,386
Okay. I need to get a baseline

711
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:36,489
on her respiratory,
cardio and dermal response,

712
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:37,557
so make her comfortable.

713
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,058
Start off with a few softball questions.

714
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,919
Miss Reed, I think we need a fresh start.

715
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:06,422
Now, you claim those files
were planted on your computer.

716
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:08,891
Fine. I'm willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

717
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,527
but you need to meet me halfway. Talk to me.

718
00:30:11,595 --> 00:30:13,829
Help me understand your side of the story.

719
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,231
Fair enough?

720
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:21,437
, when was the first time
you met President Hassan?

721
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:22,939
(clears throat)

722
00:30:23,007 --> 00:30:25,709
About six months ago.

723
00:30:25,777 --> 00:30:27,744
At a conference

724
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:29,177
of oil ministers.

725
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,505
I requested an interview, and he agreed.

726
00:30:32,573 --> 00:30:37,604
We met in his hotel lobby twice.

727
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:40,006
Hour, hour and a half,

728
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:42,074
at the most.

729
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:45,143
(elevator bell dings)

730
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,215
Madam President.

731
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,118
Mr. President.

732
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:56,452
I want to thank you

733
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,121
for wanting to continue our negotiations.

734
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:00,956
I know it's a risk.

735
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:03,659
Madam President, you are no stranger

736
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,294
to making personal sacrifices

737
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:07,096
for your beliefs.

738
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:11,366
If the price for peace is my lif so be it.

739
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:13,268
Now, we are doing everything in our power

740
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:14,936
to make sure that that doesn't happen.

741
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:17,171
We've tightened security measures here,

742
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:19,507
and CTU's top priority

743
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:21,443
is to find the people who are targeting you.

744
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,346
I appreciate that.

745
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:26,514
Madam President,

746
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:29,584
the woman you took into custody...

747
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:31,086
The reporter. Meredith Reed.

748
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:34,722
Yes. Is CTU certain that
she is part of this plan?

749
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,954
Well, from what I understand,
the evidence against her

750
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:40,589
is quite incriminating.

751
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:42,156
Have they found out her reasons?

752
00:31:42,224 --> 00:31:44,024
Well, Miss Reed is being
questioned as we speak.

753
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:46,626
I'll make sure whatever
information we get from her

754
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:49,459
will be shared with your
people as soon as possible.

755
00:31:57,296 --> 00:31:59,030
Jack, I've searched through
all the traffic cams

756
00:31:59,098 --> 00:32:01,132
within a five-block radius
of Meredith Reed's apartment.

757
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,900
There's no sign of where the suspect went.

758
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:03,935
Can you check other sources?

759
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,670
CTU has drones all over the city.

760
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:07,104
I could look through their archives

761
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,240
and see if they picked anything up.
Where are they?

762
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:10,508
The archives are in Arlo's station.

763
00:32:10,576 --> 00:32:12,811
I don't have the clearance.

764
00:32:12,878 --> 00:32:15,179
Can you hack in?

765
00:32:15,246 --> 00:32:17,614
Yeah.

766
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,849
Do it.

767
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:24,021
I'm glad you're here. Thanks for staying.

768
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:26,089
Yeah.

769
00:32:26,157 --> 00:32:27,323
This will all be over soon

770
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:28,825
and you can get to California.

771
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:34,563
Okay. I'm in.

772
00:32:37,034 --> 00:32:40,036
One of the drones picked him
up leaving Reed's apartment.

773
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:46,342
Play it forward.

774
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:49,945
Well, he hailed a cab when he left.

775
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:51,647
JACK: Can you track the cab?

776
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:53,683
No. It's beyond the drone's search grid.

777
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:55,018
Okay, back it up.

778
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:58,554
Stop.

779
00:32:58,622 --> 00:33:00,956
Move in closer.

780
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,291
ere, that's what I want to see.

781
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,060
Closer.

782
00:33:05,127 --> 00:33:06,795
See the medallion?

783
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:08,697
Call t cab company, find out where it went.

784
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:10,398
I'm not tracking this guy without a weapon.

785
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,700
The Armory's on Level C.

786
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:14,168
I have to input your palm print
through the hand scanner.

787
00:33:14,236 --> 00:33:16,404
Erase this as soon as I'm clear.

788
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,508
(beeping)

789
00:33:20,576 --> 00:33:22,610
I'll call you as soon as I'm on e road.

790
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,926
(dialing phone)

791
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:45,567
(phone ringing)

792
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:46,735
Hello?

793
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:48,936
Ruth, it's me. Jenny?

794
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:50,871
I need to talk to you, are you alone?

795
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:52,706
Uh, just my kid. What's going on?

796
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:54,673
Haven't heard from you since Christmas.

797
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,540
Kevin Wade found me.

798
00:33:57,608 --> 00:34:00,042
He's been calling me at
work the last two days.

799
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,545
Damn it, Ruth, you told him how to find me?

800
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:05,179
No, I didn't!

801
00:34:05,247 --> 00:34:07,214
You're the only one who knows the truth.

802
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:09,515
The only one who knows where I am.

803
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:10,716
I swear, I never talked to Kevin.

804
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:12,017
I didn't even know he was out of jail.

805
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:13,552
Then how did he find me?

806
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,621
I don't know!

807
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:18,790
Okay.

808
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:21,525
And what does he want,
anyway? Why is he calling you?

809
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:24,394
He didn't say.

810
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:27,097
But he's threatening to tell
everyone the truth about me.

811
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:30,807
It'll destroy my career.

812
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:37,020
I'm about to get married, Ruth.

813
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:39,222
To a really great guy.

814
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:41,623
Well, there's gotta be something you can do.

815
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:44,259
You can't let this son of a
bitch just ruin your life.

816
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:48,762
I don't know what to do.

817
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,132
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose everything.

818
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,935
I gotta go, I'll call you later.

819
00:35:01,138 --> 00:35:02,739
Where you been?

820
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:04,040
I've been trying to find you.

821
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:07,442
Did you decrypt the file? No.

822
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:08,609
I'm still working on it.

823
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:10,545
I found something weird, though.

824
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:14,615
Someone hacked into my station
and it came from inside CTU.

825
00:35:15,817 --> 00:35:17,417
What were they doing?

826
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:19,453
Scanning the drone archives.

827
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:26,525
Track it down, see who it was.

828
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:36,959
And when you were in B'Dar,

829
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:40,495
profiling President Hassan,
were you ever approached

830
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:42,631
by anyone who was hostile to his regime?

831
00:35:42,698 --> 00:35:44,232
No. No one paid you?

832
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,935
No. Pressured you into cooperating?

833
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:48,437
I said no.

834
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:51,073
So all you did was interview

835
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,241
President Hassan, that's it?

836
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:55,676
Yes, that's all.

837
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:02,452
Her answer prompted a leve
l-five autonomic reaction.

838
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,120
You're lying, Ms. Reed.

839
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:05,588
I'm not. I...

840
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:06,823
Tell me what really happened in B'Dar!

841
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,259
How is it connected to
the assassination plot?

842
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:11,294
I don't have anything to do

843
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:14,296
with any plan to assassinate
President Hassan.

844
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:15,798
My God, why would I?

845
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:17,333
Your reasons are irrelevant.

846
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,769
All I care about is stopping the assassin.

847
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,470
So do I.

848
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,874
So if someone really is
trying to kill Hassan,

849
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:27,311
you need to stop wasting your
time on me and find them.

850
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:36,556
(doorbell ringing)

851
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:42,262
Hey, Mike, what's going on?

852
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:44,197
Maggie, I-I'm so sorry for dropping by

853
00:36:44,264 --> 00:36:45,597
without calling first.

854
00:36:45,665 --> 00:36:46,764
Mind if I come in?

855
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,098
Sure, come on. Thanks.

856
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:53,199
Did, uh, Jim leave for work yet?

857
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,500
No, just got or. Oh, good.

858
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,434
'Cause I need to ask him
something before he leaves.

859
00:36:57,501 --> 00:36:59,169
Kind of a favor. Okay.

860
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:00,537
Hey, babe?

861
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,305
KOENIG: Yeah? Mike Farmer's here.

862
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:03,906
Says he needs to talk to you.

863
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,475
Mikey! Hey!

864
00:37:05,542 --> 00:37:07,376
What are you doing here? You're not on shift

865
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:10,146
till tomorrow. Yeah, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

866
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:11,480
All right, I'll be right down.

867
00:37:11,548 --> 00:37:12,815
All right, take your time.

868
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:15,551
Want coffee? Sure.

869
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:16,886
Come on. NEWSMAN:...
during President Taylor's

870
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:18,654
press conference earlier this afternoon.

871
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:22,558
NEWSWOMAN: I wouldn't want to speculate
at this time, Bob, but as you know,

872
00:37:22,626 --> 00:37:25,828
President Taylor's peace
negotiations with IRK president

873
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:28,397
Omar Hassan are highly controversial...

874
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:30,132
Sit down. Thanks.

875
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,069
...and are causing much political
dissent both in... (sighs)

876
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:35,570
Did you hear anything
more about what happened

877
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:36,738
at that press conference?

878
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:39,408
No, only what they're saying on TV.

879
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:42,811
I gotta tell you,
I'm so proud of you and Jim

880
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:45,380
and all those boys down at the precinct.

881
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:47,182
I mean, you're gonna be part of history.

882
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,917
Nah, I don't know.

883
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,252
We're just directing traffic, really.

884
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,354
You're on the UN security detail.

885
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:55,957
That's more than directing traffic.

886
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,692
Ahh... Hell, you might even get on TV.

887
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,694
<i>Wow, yeah, wouldn't that
be something.</i>

888
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:01,029
Yeah, it would!

889
00:38:01,096 --> 00:38:02,530
Right.

890
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,965
(both chuckling)

891
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:09,872
(monitors beeping)

892
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:12,441
I need to speak with Mr. Hastings.

893
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:16,211
Uh, we're in session. It's important.

894
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:18,646
Excuse me, Mr. Hastings,
I have Dana Walsh out here.

895
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,549
She says it's important.

896
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:26,689
You're not leaving this room
until you tell me the truth.

897
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:30,726
No matter how long it takes.

898
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:43,305
I'm sorry to bother you, sir,

899
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:44,740
but I didn't think that this could wait.

900
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:45,908
What's this about?

901
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:48,644
Jack Bauer.

902
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:57,753
Come on...

903
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,389
(beeping)

904
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:02,191
(lock clicks, buzzes)

905
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:28,643
(phone ringing)

906
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,810
Yeah?

907
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:32,045
I spoke with the dispatcher
at the cab company.

908
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:34,414
His driver logged the dro
p-off at West 23rd Street

909
00:39:34,482 --> 00:39:36,183
at the northwest corner
of Broadway in Queens.

910
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,351
Anything more specific?

911
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:38,518
An apartment number, an address?

912
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:40,854
Not from the dispatcher,
but I'll keep sifting

913
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:42,989
through the aerial footage.
Okay, Broadway and West 23rd.

914
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:45,125
I'll call you when I get there.

915
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:46,693
Hands in the air! Now!

916
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,728
Against the wall!

917
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,533
Don't move.

918
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,508
He had this, sir.

919
00:40:05,044 --> 00:40:07,378
We'll take it from here. AGENT: Stand down.

920
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,514
I told you to leave this alone.
Chloe tracked the man

921
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:12,984
in the surveillance photo
to a second location.

922
00:40:13,051 --> 00:40:14,952
We didn't think you'd follow
through with an investigation.

923
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,187
So you had no choice except to
steal weapons from the armory.

924
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:18,322
Would you have followed through

925
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:19,489
with an investigation if I'd asked?

926
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:20,623
I'm not debating this anymore.

927
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:22,425
You shut down a lead before you could

928
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:24,360
even assess whether it was good or bad.

929
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:25,527
Take him to detention.

930
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,963
Take him!

931
00:40:29,031 --> 00:40:30,365
COLE: Let's go.

932
00:40:30,432 --> 00:40:31,699
I'm sure President Taylor's
gonna be very interested

933
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:33,700
to find out what happened to my informant

934
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:35,869
when I tried to deliver
him to you. Excuse me?

935
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,737
Cole tried to secure that
landing zone with more men,

936
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:39,305
but instead you sent a drone,

937
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,339
which failed to detect
the missile that killed

938
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:41,974
my informant and two of your men.

939
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,310
Cole hasn't said anything about it.

940
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:47,481
And neither will I,
as long as you let me pursue this.

941
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,251
So now you're blackmailing me?

942
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:51,354
You forced my hand, now I'm forcing yours.

943
00:40:51,422 --> 00:40:53,190
You don't want to be doing this,
Bauer. No, I don't.

944
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,128
I wanna be on a plane to
Los Angeles with my family.

945
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:56,929
But you're not giving me another choice.

946
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:03,736
You want to waste your time chasing ghosts?

947
00:41:03,804 --> 00:41:05,638
Knock yourself out.

948
00:41:05,706 --> 00:41:07,473
I've got to stop an assassination plot.

949
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:08,641
Give him the bag.

950
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,178
I need Chloe to run Ops.

951
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:14,547
Fine, she's all yours.

952
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:16,315
Thank you.

953
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:24,556
Anything to what he's talking about?

954
00:41:24,624 --> 00:41:28,093
The only viable lead is sitting
in our interrogation room.

955
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:31,129
And she's the only way we're
going to get to the assassin.

956
00:41:34,434 --> 00:41:35,934
What's going on, Mikey?

957
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:40,004
Hey, listen, um, something came up.

958
00:41:40,072 --> 00:41:41,439
I can't make my shift tomorrow.

959
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:43,374
So, I was wondering if we could swap.

960
00:41:43,442 --> 00:41:44,976
Oh, I'd be happy to, except Maggie and me

961
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,311
have a meeting with Sean's teacher tomorrow.

962
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,478
She said he's

963
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,248
acting out in class, but I don't believe it.

964
00:41:50,316 --> 00:41:52,684
Jim keeps making excuses for him,
but if he needs help,

965
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:54,218
I want to give it to him.

966
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:57,855
Where is he? He's at his grandma's tonight.

967
00:41:57,923 --> 00:42:00,758
I'm not making excuses.

968
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:03,895
So, what are you saying?

969
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:06,163
You can't trade shifts with me?

970
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:08,465
This is kind of important, so I'm sorry.

971
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:12,035
(sighing): Yeah.

972
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:14,737
Me, too.

973
00:42:14,804 --> 00:42:16,772
Whoa, Mikey, what...

974
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,142
Maggie, I want you to sit down.

975
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:25,348
Jim, there's a roll of tape

976
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,683
in my bag.

977
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,186
Tear off a strip and put
it over Maggie's mouth.

978
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:34,490
Do it.

979
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:45,501
(Maggie panting)

980
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,808
I'm sorry, baby. Oh, my God.

981
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,679
Now, pick up the phone,
call Captain Ravello.

982
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,048
Tell him you're sick

983
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,019
and I'm filling in for you.

984
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,188
Now, listen, you son of a bitch,
there's no way...

985
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,791
Oh! Oh, what's the matter
with you?! (sobbing)

986
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,360
What are you doing?!

987
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:16,063
Next time, I won't miss the bone.

988
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:18,699
(Maggie sobbing)

989
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:20,969
Make the call.

990
00:43:21,037 --> 00:43:22,604
All right.

991
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:23,972
All right, I'll call.

992
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,941
Please, just leave my wife alone, all right?

993
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:32,877
