1
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:16,310
Sir, we just found this among
Meredith Reed's personal effects.

2
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:18,342
It's a dedicated key card,
United Nations issue.

3
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:20,807
To who? President Hassan and his family.

4
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,673
It accesses their private residence.

5
00:00:22,706 --> 00:00:24,538
<i> We got her.

6
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:26,137
I want to know where you got it.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,702
Omar gave it to me.

8
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:32,733
I gave Miss Reed this key card for
reasons I'm sure are clear to you.

9
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,031
<i>Sir, are you confirming

10
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:37,029
a romantic involvement with Meredith Reed?

11
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:39,662
I trust your complete
discretion in this matter.

12
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,493
We have a problem.

13
00:00:41,526 --> 00:00:42,826
My brother confessed to the affair.

14
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,758
I don't know if the frame's going to hold.

15
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,090
<i> There is no reason to diverge

16
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:47,922
from the plan.

17
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:48,987
How much longer?

18
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,188
Your brother will be dead

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,252
before the hour is out.

20
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,784
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:56,683
I thought I told you to leave me alone.

22
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:59,048
<i>CTU.

23
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:01,080
Senior Data Analyst.

24
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:03,312
Well, sounds like an important job.

25
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,210
Damn it, what do you want from me?!

26
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:06,544
A place to crash, for starters.

27
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:07,710
You can stay the night.

28
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:09,873
I want you out tomorrow.

29
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:12,106
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're evacuating immediately,

30
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,338
due to a possible bomb threat.

31
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,570
<i>Madam President,
you and Secretary Kanin

32
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:17,703
need to move now.

33
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:19,535
President Hassan, if you'll follow me.

34
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:24,764
Yes?

35
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:26,229
He's in the third car.

36
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:28,329
The motorcade's coming up the ramps now.

37
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,327
Officer, this is going down now.

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,526
You can either stand here and do nothing

39
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:34,991
or you can help me stop it.

40
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:37,022
Cole, you need to stop Hassan's car now.

41
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,655
The assassin is part of
the evacuation detail.

42
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,321
There is no bomb in the UN.

43
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:43,419
It's too late-- Hassan's
car just exited the tunnel.

44
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:45,584
Cole, you need to stop that car,
or Hassan's a dead man.

45
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:57,076
Cole!

46
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,709
What was that?! What happened?

47
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:16,664
This is a damn disaster, Brian.

48
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:18,362
What do you mean,
you don't know what happened?

49
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:19,861
How is Hassan? Is he all right?

50
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:21,060
We don't know yet, Madam President.

51
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:22,892
It appears the bomb threat at the UN

52
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:25,024
was a hoax designed to get
him out of the building.

53
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,390
"It appears"?

54
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:28,788
An IED was planted on
Hassan's evacuation route.

55
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,786
And you drove him right into it!

56
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,852
One of our agents detected the ambush,

57
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,051
tried to head him off
just as the bomb exploded.

58
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:37,016
Well, you better pray he got there in time.

59
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,305
Security there! Now!

60
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,133
Stand down! I'm with CTU.

61
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:09,128
Sir, we need to move you
to another vehicle. Now.

62
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,393
Sir, you do not want to stay here.

63
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,051
Go, go, go.

64
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,482
Move! Move!

65
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:41,240
Cole?

66
00:03:41,273 --> 00:03:42,240
Yeah.

67
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,672
Thank God you're okay.

68
00:03:43,706 --> 00:03:45,104
I got lucky.

69
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,869
Hassan escaped the blast; he's fine.

70
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:48,535
He's heading toward CTU,

71
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:51,566
eastbound on 48th Street
in a black SUV. Got him.

72
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,899
Mr. Hastings, here.

73
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,730
Hassan, he's safe.

74
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:57,761
Dana, the assassin was posing
as a part of the security team.

75
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:59,361
I know-- we got the info from Chloe.

76
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,227
The police are putting up a thre
e-bock cordon now.

77
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,625
Cole?

78
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:07,489
Cole? Cole, are you there?

79
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:09,720
I've got the suspect-
he's dressed as a cop.

80
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,053
Entering a white low-rise

81
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,320
north of the UN.

82
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:13,751
Call it in! I'm in pursuit!

83
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:15,716
Chloe, I need to put out a priority APB.

84
00:04:15,749 --> 00:04:16,982
Move, move, move!

85
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:48,727
What is it now?

86
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,594
They've got a lead on the assassin.

87
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:51,926
4722 East 47th Street.

88
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,492
I'm gonna need my weapon.

89
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,191
Your bag's right behind my seat.

90
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,953
East 47th Street-- that's just above the UN.

91
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,085
You're gonna need to turn now.

92
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:03,984
Now! Now!

93
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:11,280
UN Four, come in.

94
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:14,311
UN Four, this is CTU Two. Come in, please.

95
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:17,309
I'm sorry, I can't reach him. Try again.

96
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:20,673
That's my husband in that car up there.
They're not answering.

97
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,639
I have to go to him. Dalia! Ma'am,
please, you need to remain in the car.

98
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,404
Stay calm.

99
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,003
I'll try another number.

100
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,399
Where are you?

101
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,831
Yes, we're safe.

102
00:05:33,864 --> 00:05:35,397
Dalia, Kayla and myself.

103
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,395
I need to know about my brother.

104
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:39,927
He's alive.

105
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,691
He survived.

106
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,857
Farhad, how is he?

107
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,189
He's alive.

108
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:50,087
God is with us.

109
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,917
Can you tell me what happened?

110
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:02,645
A car in the motorcade
swerved in front of him.

111
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:04,677
They're locking down the entire area.

112
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,510
What would you suggest we do?

113
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:10,107
It's over.

114
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:11,806
Get out now.

115
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,270
It can't be long before
they realize it's you.

116
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:21,167
Farhad?

117
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,730
Sir, please stay in the car!

118
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:27,761
Please, sir.

119
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:31,360
Sir, I need you to get back in the car.

120
00:06:39,188 --> 00:06:40,254
Oh!

121
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:20,160
Get on your knees.

122
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,590
Slide your weapon back to me.

123
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:25,657
Slowly...

124
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,223
slow...

125
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:33,485
Now... you're going to walk me out of here.

126
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:35,317
Call in.

127
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,581
Say the southwest corner is clear.

128
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:43,312
Tell them to move the search
team to the northeast.

129
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,277
Do it.

130
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,543
You want to live?

131
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,773
Make the call.

132
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:58,436
This is Cole Ortiz

133
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,400
in the southwest corner of the building.

134
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:03,331
I'm in pursuit of the assassin.

135
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,725
He's with me now.

136
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,622
You okay?

137
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:18,621
You okay?

138
00:08:18,654 --> 00:08:20,553
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

139
00:08:20,586 --> 00:08:23,385
Okay.

140
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,345
Son of a bitch.

141
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,364
Mr. President, Brian Hastings.

142
00:08:55,398 --> 00:08:57,096
We spoke on the phone.

143
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,161
We're glad you're here. Please follow me.

144
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,090
Is my family here?

145
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:07,089
No, sir. We'll try and get

146
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,888
you all together shortly.
Are they all right?

147
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:10,653
Your wife and daughter are fine.

148
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:12,053
And my brother?

149
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,716
Was he hurt?

150
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,715
No, sir.

151
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,581
Mr. President...

152
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:24,411
It appears your brother was
involved with the attack.

153
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:26,176
My brother?

154
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,541
Yes, sir.

155
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:29,375
That can't be right.

156
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:31,506
Bring him to me. I need to talk to him.

157
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:34,372
Unfortunately, we don't know
where he is at the moment.

158
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:37,269
Then how can you be sure it was him?

159
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,368
Mr. President, after the explosion,

160
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:42,932
he killed one of my men to
facilitate his own escape.

161
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,662
There were witnesses,
including your wife and daughter.

162
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,828
He's the insider we've been looking for.

163
00:09:48,861 --> 00:09:51,759
There's no doubt.

164
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,325
Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry for interrupting.

165
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,924
You asked for any updates
about the assassin.

166
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,357
And?

167
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,021
He's dead. Jack just called it in.

168
00:09:59,054 --> 00:10:00,987
He uplinked some video
footage that you need to see.

169
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,052
I'll be there in a minute.

170
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,717
Don't let me keep you from your job.

171
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,283
Thank you, sir.

172
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:07,748
No, thank you. I owe you my life.

173
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,414
Conference room.

174
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:11,546
Uh, Mr. Hastings, uh...

175
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,945
Meredith Reed,

176
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,110
the woman you brought here for
questioning, where is she?

177
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,475
Still here.

178
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,541
Looks like she'll be
cleared of any wrongdoing.

179
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:21,306
I'd like to talk to her.

180
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,871
I'll arrange it.

181
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:23,938
Thank you.

182
00:10:23,972 --> 00:10:25,570
Excuse me.

183
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:28,235
I saw that. What?

184
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,200
The way you looked at me when he
thanked me for saving his life.

185
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,098
You think he should have been thanking you?

186
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:35,596
I was actually thinking
he should thank Jack,

187
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,028
then Cole, then maybe me.

188
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:47,323
I underestimated you, Chloe.

189
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,254
You saw what was really going on; I did not.

190
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:52,320
It was a major save.

191
00:10:52,353 --> 00:10:53,985
And my report will state that.

192
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:06,410
Chloe said you have some video to show me.

193
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,376
Yes, sir. Take a look.

194
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,875
These are images uplinked

195
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:09,874
by Jack Bauer

196
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,173
from the bomb site.

197
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:12,972
It's the assassin who was targeting Hassan.

198
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,904
We have an ID? Not yet.

199
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:17,769
But I believe we do have a workable lead.

200
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,900
These are tattoos off the
two men who attempted

201
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,666
to take out our informant this afternoon.

202
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:23,232
Same as the assassin.

203
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,664
We believe they indicate membership

204
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:26,330
in a particular Russian crime syndicate.

205
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:28,129
What's a Russian gang have against

206
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,627
the leader of the Islamic Republic?

207
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:30,927
I don't know.

208
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,792
Could just be hired muscle.

209
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,757
But when the photos arrived,
I ran them by the FBI.

210
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,956
Turns out, they had an agent
undercover working with

211
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,922
the Russian mob here several years ago.

212
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,619
A woman. Contact her.

213
00:11:40,653 --> 00:11:43,286
Already done. I have a
helicopter bringing her in now.

214
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:45,516
Chloe, I think you worked with her.

215
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:47,182
Renee Walker.

216
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:49,980
Says here she's no longer with the FBI.

217
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:51,013
It's true.

218
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,313
She resigned over an internal dispute.

219
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,845
Meaning she was fired

220
00:11:53,878 --> 00:11:54,877
and her records have been sealed.

221
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,842
What are we getting into here?

222
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,841
Sir, we are only using her to brief us.

223
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:01,307
These Russian groups are secretive

224
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,572
to the point of paranoia.

225
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:03,604
She's the only one

226
00:12:03,638 --> 00:12:05,237
who ever got close.

227
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,629
President Omar Hassan was
not harmed in the attack,

228
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:19,328
and has since been taken
to a secure location.

229
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:22,159
Confirmed fatalities now stand at three...

230
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:25,258
...including a police officer.

231
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,087
Yes?

232
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,086
Why is my brother still alive?

233
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,818
You're upset, Farhad.

234
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:34,817
Justifiably.

235
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,083
Your man failed!

236
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:38,048
Once you have the materials
in your possession,

237
00:12:38,082 --> 00:12:39,780
your brother, his peace conference,

238
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:41,146
none of that matters.

239
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,578
Isn't that what you told me?

240
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:45,576
All you have to do is stay
calm and stick to your plan.

241
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:50,107
Or should I be looking for another buyer?

242
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,173
I'll be there soon.

243
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,438
Good.

244
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:55,171
We'll have a nice meal waiting.

245
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,502
And we'll talk.

246
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:21,376
I've been informed that the
bomb threat was a hoax.

247
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,675
That's confirmed, Madam President.

248
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,207
We've swept the negotiating
chamber with sniffer dogs

249
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,906
and ground- penetrating radar.

250
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,904
I can assure you, it's safe.

251
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,669
I'm glad to hear it.

252
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:33,201
Hassan is standing by at CTU.

253
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:34,268
How is he, Rob?

254
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,633
Well, he narrowly escaped

255
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,232
being blown to pieces by his
own brother, so not too well.

256
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,861
But your call to him can't just
be all sympathy and concern.

257
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:46,525
We need to know where he stands vi
s-Ã -vis the talks.

258
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:47,859
It's hardly the time.

259
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,025
No, it's exactly the time.

260
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,590
The signing is scheduled for tomorrow.

261
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,088
Dozens of world leaders are
already en route to New York.

262
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,686
We need to know if we still
have a peace process.

263
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,384
Put him on.

264
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:04,480
Sir,

265
00:14:04,513 --> 00:14:07,013
I have President Taylor for you.

266
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,345
Madam President.

267
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,543
I cannot begin

268
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:11,210
to say how relieved I am

269
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,375
that you survived this
terrible attack, Omar.

270
00:14:13,407 --> 00:14:14,707
Thank you.

271
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:17,905
I'm mortified that this
outrage happened on U.S. soil.

272
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:22,169
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.

273
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:23,768
My brother, Farhad, did this.

274
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:27,765
He betrayed me, and worse,
he put you in harm's way.

275
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,830
I should have realized what he's up to.

276
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:33,761
We can only be betrayed
by the people we trust.

277
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:36,059
He fooled all of us.

278
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:39,358
Sir, this is Rob Weiss.

279
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,090
You've heard Farhad escaped.

280
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:43,420
Can I ask what you think
his agenda might be,

281
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,987
aside from targeting you?

282
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,450
Uh, w-what I mean, sir,
is... does he have a plan?

283
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,116
Yes, he has a plan.

284
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,148
Regime change.

285
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:54,881
Isn't that what you Americans call it?

286
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:57,478
Mr. President, we're doing everything we can

287
00:14:57,511 --> 00:14:58,844
to apprehend Farhad,

288
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,775
but while he's at large, I'd understand it

289
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,406
if you wished not to continue the talks.

290
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,071
However, I hope that I can
persuade you to reconvene.

291
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:12,468
We have come so far together.

292
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,201
And to let this moment slip...

293
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,799
Would be to hand Farhad victory.

294
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,697
I will not give him this satisfaction.

295
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,927
If you are willing to continue
with these talks, so am I.

296
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:26,959
I am delighted to hear it.

297
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:30,723
Uh, if you could persuade

298
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:32,955
Mr. Hastings here to release me.

299
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:34,420
We'll coordinate with CTU

300
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:37,019
so that you can return to
the UN as soon as possible.

301
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:39,717
I-I know that you want to be
with your wife and daughter.

302
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,716
Thank you.

303
00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:42,015
Thank you, Madam President.

304
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:51,210
You want your office back, Mr. Hastings.

305
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,441
It's fine, sir.

306
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:54,874
Can I ask what you and
President Taylor agreed?

307
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:57,272
That I should return to
UN as soon as possible.

308
00:15:57,306 --> 00:15:58,271
We'll make the arrangements.

309
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,437
Uh, before I leave,

310
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,436
I would like to thank

311
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:01,769
the young man who saved my life.

312
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,835
That would be Agent Ortiz.

313
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:05,366
He's returning to CTU right now.

314
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,024
You really should go to Medical.

315
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:21,056
Yeah.

316
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,488
Soon as I hand the body over to Forensics.

317
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:23,887
What are you going to do?

318
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:25,753
Finish my debrief, try and catch
that last flight to Los Angeles.

319
00:16:25,786 --> 00:16:27,451
Thanks, Jack. It's been an honor.

320
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,484
Take care of yourself, okay?

321
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:32,582
Hey.

322
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:33,648
I'm glad you're okay.

323
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:35,014
Thanks. Me, too.

324
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,279
We ID'd the assassin
using your video footage.

325
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:38,611
We think he was working for

326
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:40,376
one of the Russian crime syndicates here.

327
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:41,509
Any idea which one?

328
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,675
Not yet.

329
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,275
But we're bringing in someone to brief us.

330
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,740
Good.

331
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:48,437
Jack, it's Renee.

332
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,803
What?

333
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:52,170
Why?

334
00:16:52,202 --> 00:16:54,500
Six years ago, she worked
undercover with the Russian mob.

335
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:56,965
FBI says she's still one of
the best experts they have.

336
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,231
Have you spoken to her?

337
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,730
No.

338
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:03,327
I tried phoning her a few times,
she never returned my calls.

339
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:05,460
She made it clear she
didn't want to speak to me,

340
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:06,993
so I-I let it go.

341
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,924
I heard she had a rough time.

342
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:10,389
Yeah.

343
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:13,122
Like, a really rough time-
some sort of a breakdown.

344
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:14,654
She should be landing any minute.

345
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:16,053
Look, she didn't want to talk to me then,

346
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:17,485
she's not gonna want to talk to me now,

347
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,718
and I want to respect that.

348
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:20,084
So, please, don't tell her I'm here, okay?

349
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:21,916
You sure?

350
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:23,281
Yeah. Okay.

351
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:24,447
I'll be waiting for you

352
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,446
up in Debrief One.

353
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:31,110
We'll get you a full set of
photos as soon as possible.

354
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,442
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,835
Agent Ortiz.

356
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:42,969
Mr. President.

357
00:17:43,002 --> 00:17:44,634
I want to thank you for saving my life.

358
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,365
You're welcome, sir, but it wasn't just me.

359
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,565
If it weren't for Jack Bauer

360
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,931
and Chloe O'Brian, I wouldn't have been

361
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,197
in place to make the save.

362
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,262
Well, I'll thank them, too,

363
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:53,162
but you risked your life for me.

364
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,559
You put yourself between me and the bomb.

365
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:56,725
My family and I

366
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,059
are in your debt.

367
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,389
What's that?

368
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:02,422
It's a hazardous materials alert.

369
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:03,921
Hazardous materials?

370
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:05,253
Please wait here, sir.

371
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,316
What's going on?

372
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,116
The body triggered a hazmat alarm.

373
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:13,781
We're reading radioactive contaminants.

374
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:14,913
What sort of contaminants?

375
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:17,179
Rad count's low, so it could be uranium.

376
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,945
It's just trace elements.

377
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,976
There's no danger.

378
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:23,475
U-235?

379
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:24,574
It's highly enriched uranium.

380
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:26,473
You mean it's weapons-grade?

381
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,138
Yes. How the hell did he

382
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,171
come into contact with that?

383
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:30,636
I don't know, but he had to

384
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,902
have been exposed to it recently.

385
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,735
I think I know the answer.

386
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:35,233
What is it, sir?

387
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,832
Sir, we're talking about nuclear materials.

388
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:39,797
If you know something, you need to tell us.

389
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:42,795
I need to talk to Mr. Hastings right now.

390
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,245
Hey, Renee.

391
00:19:27,278 --> 00:19:28,610
It's good to see you.

392
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:29,843
This way.

393
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:52,594
Didn't know you were back at CTU.

394
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:54,127
Yeah. Morris lost his job a year ago.

395
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,460
I asked to be reinstated,

396
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:57,858
and this is where they assigned me.

397
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:12,948
So what about you?

398
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:16,279
I heard you've been working
for a security firm.

399
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:17,446
Uh, I was.

400
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,477
Didn't work out.

401
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:28,371
So it's confirmed and you're certain.

402
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,600
Thanks.

403
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:34,167
It's Forensics.

404
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,132
They confirmed the composition
of the radioactive material.

405
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,629
It's U-235, 94.7% pure,

406
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:41,928
weapons-grade uranium.

407
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:43,560
If you have an explanation, sir,

408
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,026
I'm eager to hear it.

409
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,525
Before we started this peace initiative,

410
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:51,222
my country was close to
developing a nuclear weapon.

411
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:53,355
Yes, our intelligence was aware of that.

412
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:55,319
You may also be aware
that we could not enrich

413
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:56,885
enough fissile material to arm it.

414
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:58,451
Soon after our countries began

415
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:01,782
to negotiate the peace process,
my brother came up to me

416
00:21:01,815 --> 00:21:03,714
and said that someone
had approached him with

417
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,712
weapons-grade uranium.

418
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:06,712
Who?

419
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:07,778
Someone who had access

420
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,877
to decommissioned Soviet stockpiles.

421
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,276
You think it's

422
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:13,707
the same Russians who were
trying to kill you today?

423
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,739
Yes, I do.

424
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,804
I told my brother to stay away from them,

425
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:20,535
but obviously he had other plans.

426
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:21,902
Mr. President,

427
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:23,933
the nuclear material that you were offered,

428
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:26,299
you have any idea where it is?

429
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,031
That man was contaminated recently.

430
00:21:28,064 --> 00:21:29,629
Doesn't that mean the materials are here

431
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:32,461
in the U.S.?

432
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:36,393
Farhad always used to tell me
that our country will always

433
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:38,158
be at the mercy of the West

434
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:40,490
unless we become a nuclear power.

435
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:41,721
You must find

436
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:43,221
the Russians

437
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:44,254
before they can get

438
00:21:44,287 --> 00:21:45,952
the uranium to my brother.

439
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:47,717
We'll do what we have to do, sir.

440
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:51,383
I'll notify my security
forces to cooperate fully.

441
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,578
Patty,

442
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:59,576
get me the file on Renee
Walker's undercover operation.

443
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,508
The stars mean these men were
part of the criminal elite.

444
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,741
<i>Vory v zakone.

445
00:22:02,774 --> 00:22:04,107
This one spent time

446
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,872
in a Siberian prison camp-- IK-10.

447
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,305
The number of spires
means length of sentence.

448
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:09,337
Three years?

449
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,403
Three life terms.

450
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:11,668
Must have escaped.

451
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:15,000
Now these, broken cross,
here, here and here.

452
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,665
Same on all three.

453
00:22:16,698 --> 00:22:19,330
So what does it mean?

454
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:20,795
Brian Hastings,

455
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:21,894
director of CTU.

456
00:22:21,928 --> 00:22:23,727
I appreciate that you came in.

457
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,193
So what does it mean?

458
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:26,891
It means you can break our arms,

459
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:29,291
you can break every bone in our body-
we'll never talk.

460
00:22:29,324 --> 00:22:30,390
It's supposed to be the symbol

461
00:22:30,423 --> 00:22:32,388
for a group called Red Square.

462
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:34,220
Supposed to be? We tried to find them

463
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:35,353
and never got close.

464
00:22:35,386 --> 00:22:36,819
A lot of rumors that they're ex-military,

465
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:38,650
special forces, intelligence, whatever.

466
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:40,216
I'm not sure they actually exist.

467
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:41,449
They exist, Ms. Walker.

468
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:43,214
And we need to find them.

469
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:44,512
Why?

470
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:46,778
You're aware of the attack in midtown today?

471
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:48,477
You mean the smoking crater by the UN?

472
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,776
Yeah, it was hard to miss.

473
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,508
Well, we believe it's just the beginning,

474
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:52,908
and that the group responsible

475
00:22:52,941 --> 00:22:54,973
is in possession of
unsecured nuclear materials.

476
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:57,504
Now Dana asked you here today

477
00:22:57,538 --> 00:22:59,071
to brief on background.

478
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:01,269
But I have a much bigger ask.

479
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:06,166
You were undercover for nearly
two years with the Russian mob.

480
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:08,431
Your cover's still intact.

481
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:14,194
What are you saying exactly?

482
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,326
Are you... are you asking me to go back in?

483
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:20,257
Dana, Chloe, would you
give us a moment, please?

484
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:29,516
I wouldn't be asking if
it weren't important,

485
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,149
but yes,

486
00:23:31,182 --> 00:23:32,948
I want you to go back in.

487
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:35,279
And this doesn't seem in the least bit--

488
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,145
I don't know, ironic to you?

489
00:23:37,178 --> 00:23:41,675
I know that you left the FBI
under difficult circumstances.

490
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,773
Difficult doesn't even begin to describe it.

491
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,605
I can get you your badge back.

492
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:49,436
I laid down my badge, Mr. Hastings.

493
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,669
I took it from my pocket and I laid it down.

494
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,100
So why would you possibly
think that I want it back?

495
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,965
Well, what do you want?

496
00:23:56,998 --> 00:23:59,562
What do I want?

497
00:23:59,596 --> 00:24:01,528
Nothing.

498
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:08,590
You have weapons-grade uranium
in the hands of the Russian O.C.

499
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,156
I can do something about that.

500
00:24:10,189 --> 00:24:12,289
So I'll go back in...

501
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:15,120
but not for a badge.

502
00:24:18,018 --> 00:24:19,250
Thank you.

503
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:21,948
We brief in ten minutes.

504
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:39,637
Hey.

505
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,369
Just want to say good-bye.

506
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:42,635
You're off finally?

507
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:44,233
Yeah.

508
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:45,932
How did Renee's debriefing go?

509
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:49,030
It was going fine until Hastings
kicked me out. Why'd he kick you out?

510
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:51,495
It just started to get really uncomfortable.

511
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:53,827
Is that her undercover file?

512
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,792
Yeah. I'm just trying to get up to speed.

513
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:58,523
They found traces of
uranium on the assassin.

514
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:00,656
Hastings says there's
nuclear materials in play.

515
00:25:00,688 --> 00:25:01,855
Yeah, I heard.

516
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,387
What's that got to do with Renee?

517
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,952
He asked her to go back
under with the Russians.

518
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:13,380
What is it?

519
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,740
Hey.

520
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,839
Jack.

521
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:33,800
Chloe didn't tell me you were here.

522
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,664
I asked her not to.

523
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:38,563
I didn't think you'd want to see me.

524
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:39,829
Right.

525
00:25:39,863 --> 00:25:43,127
You tried to get in touch,
and I didn't call back.

526
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:44,327
Sorry.

527
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,024
I was so happy to hear
that you were okay, though.

528
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:49,290
Thank you.

529
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:51,156
I'm surprised that you're back at CTU.

530
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:53,321
I'm actually not.

531
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:55,019
I'm moving back to Los
Angeles with my daughter.

532
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,118
I'm supposed to be on a
plane with her right now.

533
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:59,482
Then what are you doing here?

534
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,216
An old informant knocked on my door.

535
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:02,681
Everything went downhill from there.

536
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:03,813
The attack in midtown.

537
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:05,146
That's why I'm here, too.

538
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,045
I heard Hastings wants you to go undercover

539
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:08,177
with the Russians again.

540
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:10,709
He does. I've agreed.

541
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:13,373
You really think that's a good idea?

542
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,806
They need me.

543
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,804
I'm not worried about them.

544
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:20,037
I'm worried about you.

545
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,167
I know what you did.

546
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:26,965
Really, Jack? What did I do?

547
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,462
You almost killed Wilson
during your interrogation.

548
00:26:29,496 --> 00:26:32,727
In fact it was so bad,
the FBI had to let you go.

549
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:35,358
Even after everything you did that day.

550
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:39,989
Renee, I know where you are,
and it's a dark place.

551
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:41,521
Yeah, and I've come back.

552
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:42,887
It takes longer than you think.

553
00:26:42,921 --> 00:26:45,386
I wouldn't have signed up
for this if I wasn't ready.

554
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,819
And I don't think you are.

555
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:58,710
Renee, this is too important.

556
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,009
You need to let them take
care of it. They will.

557
00:27:03,973 --> 00:27:07,005
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, really.

558
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:08,336
You said you were going to Los Angeles

559
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,669
to be with your daughter, right?

560
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,902
Please don't do this.
Go to California, Jack.

561
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,565
I have a briefing.

562
00:27:29,712 --> 00:27:31,844
You will receive an official apology

563
00:27:31,878 --> 00:27:33,510
for your detention here, but in the meantime

564
00:27:33,542 --> 00:27:35,875
I hope you can accept my
sincere personal regrets.

565
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:37,773
I'm sure you understand
that given the threat

566
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,038
to President Hassan,

567
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:40,171
we were under extreme pressure.

568
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:42,237
I would have thought that came with the job.

569
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,536
Along with the ability

570
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,168
to handle it.

571
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:48,532
Good-bye, Mr. Hastings.

572
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,164
Ms. Reed.

573
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,860
Thank God you're all right.

574
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:00,391
I was lucky.

575
00:28:00,425 --> 00:28:04,522
I heard it was Farhad who
tried to have you killed.

576
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:08,052
I can't believe he would betray you.

577
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:09,685
He betrayed both of us, Meredith.

578
00:28:09,718 --> 00:28:12,716
And then I betrayed you.

579
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:15,315
What are you talking about?

580
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:18,279
I told them about us.

581
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:21,010
I was scared. I panicked.

582
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:23,409
I hope you can forgive me.

583
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:24,908
There's nothing to forgive.

584
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,941
But you stood by me.

585
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:29,038
You didn't deny me.

586
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:31,070
Even though you had a million reasons to.

587
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:33,735
Before that moment, I...

588
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:37,767
I never really knew what you felt for me.

589
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,997
You should have.

590
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:42,397
Didn't I make it clear?

591
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,090
What? What is it?

592
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:53,255
I nearly died today.

593
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:59,018
And I saw how fragile it all is.

594
00:28:59,051 --> 00:29:03,049
Not only my life, but
everything I've ever worked for.

595
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:06,381
Any good I might be able to do.

596
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:09,511
I just can't jeopardize that.

597
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,708
I understand.

598
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:15,874
I'm sorry.

599
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:19,405
Don't be.

600
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:26,066
Meredith...

601
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,745
Six years ago I was
undercover with these men.

602
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,577
They were running an arms trafficking ring.

603
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:04,041
We broke up the ring and arrested everyone

604
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:05,541
except for the man in charge-
Vladimir Laitanan.

605
00:30:05,574 --> 00:30:06,939
He's our target.

606
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,139
It was through him I first heard
about the group Red Square.

607
00:30:09,172 --> 00:30:11,303
If anyone can connect us to them it's him.

608
00:30:11,337 --> 00:30:12,636
Everything I've read about Laitanan

609
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:13,901
says he disappeared without a trace.

610
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,401
How are you going to find him?

611
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:16,768
Through this guy.

612
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:18,066
Ziya Dakhilov.

613
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,198
He's out on parole.

614
00:30:19,232 --> 00:30:20,698
He'll take us to Vladimir.

615
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:23,796
The FBI offered Ziya full
immunity if he gave up Vladimir.

616
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,094
He turned it down and kept

617
00:30:25,128 --> 00:30:26,560
his mouth shut and did his time.

618
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,559
I'm not FBI, I'm a former felon, remember?

619
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,758
I'll be offering Ziya
the deal of a lifetime.

620
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:31,989
Trust me, he'll take it.

621
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:33,955
Once I've made contact with Vladimir,

622
00:30:33,988 --> 00:30:35,454
I'll tell him that I've heard whispers

623
00:30:35,488 --> 00:30:36,919
of nuclear materials on the market.

624
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,386
I'll say I have a buyer for them.

625
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,585
Who's that going to be? Agent Ortiz?

626
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:40,883
You up for this?

627
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:41,983
Yes, sir.

628
00:30:42,016 --> 00:30:43,383
How much money are we talking about?

629
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:45,547
For nuclear rods,
we need to show offshore accounts

630
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:47,747
of $100 million at least.
Probably twice that.

631
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,445
Okay, I'll get on that.

632
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,944
Chloe will work up a backstory to cover

633
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:52,410
the time after your release from prison.

634
00:30:52,443 --> 00:30:54,242
Now you and Agent Ortiz need to figure out

635
00:30:54,275 --> 00:30:55,375
where you met,

636
00:30:55,408 --> 00:30:57,040
how long you've known each other.

637
00:30:57,073 --> 00:30:58,773
Jack.

638
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:00,537
I thought you'd left.

639
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:02,269
I'm sorry to interrupt.

640
00:31:02,303 --> 00:31:04,569
But could I have the room with Mr.
Hastings alone, please?

641
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:11,597
You, too, Renee.

642
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,496
I think I'll stay.

643
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:16,728
So what's going on, Jack?

644
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:19,158
Agent Walker hasn't been
undercover for over six years.

645
00:31:19,192 --> 00:31:21,091
I think you're making a
mistake by putting her in.

646
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,555
Why don't you tell him what's
really on your mind, Jack?

647
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:26,120
I'll tell him exactly what I told you.

648
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,386
I'm concerned about her,

649
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,753
and this operation.

650
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:30,883
So what does that mean?

651
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,650
She's not ready for this.

652
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:33,848
You must have other options.

653
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:34,947
Mr. Hastings,

654
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,447
no one else knows these Russians.

655
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,713
No one else can get you as close.

656
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:40,111
Unfortunately, I'm your only choice.

657
00:31:40,144 --> 00:31:43,242
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

658
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,241
but she's right.

659
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:45,907
She's our only way in.

660
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,171
Fine, then I want to go with her.

661
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:51,670
I assume your plan is trying

662
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,002
to set up a competing buy?

663
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:54,368
I'll act as a buyer.

664
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:56,100
That won't be necessary.
Agent Ortiz has already agreed.

665
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:58,299
He doesn't have the experience.
Then this is how he gets it.

666
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,065
Not with nuclear weapons on the line.

667
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:02,096
Mr. Hastings,

668
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,495
I'm officially requesting

669
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:04,662
that you send me in

670
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:06,260
with Agent Walker.

671
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:08,759
Jack, if you're willing to do this,
I'd be foolish to object.

672
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:12,023
We'll work up a cover for you

673
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,356
and dovetail it with Agent Walker's alias.

674
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,755
We're going to have to work fast.

675
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:16,587
The Russians are going to want
to unload the nuclear fuel rods

676
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:17,819
as quickly as possible.

677
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:26,614
I'm sorry.

678
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:35,741
Are you sure this information is reliable?

679
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:36,906
MAN : It checks out.

680
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,905
All right then.

681
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:40,004
Farhad is here.

682
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:41,704
Bring him in.

683
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:47,166
You look worried.

684
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,365
Every cop in the country
is hunting this man,

685
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:50,897
but we let him come here?

686
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,994
So, how does looking like
a scared girl help us?

687
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,259
This man is our buyer.

688
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,190
Well, we found him,

689
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:02,223
we can find another.

690
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:05,554
Josef, my son, we are on the verge

691
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:07,453
of the biggest deal of our lives.

692
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:09,618
Farhad is paying us more
than anyone dreamed possible,

693
00:33:09,652 --> 00:33:12,249
and you want to send him away
because he makes you nervous?

694
00:33:24,642 --> 00:33:26,207
Sit down, please.

695
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,972
A drink first, then some food.

696
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,338
I want to see the rods.

697
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:31,537
They will be on the same ship

698
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,168
that will transport you
back to your country.

699
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:35,834
As soon as we have completed

700
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:37,166
our financial arrangements.

701
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,997
You'll be paid, Bazhaev,
after I have the rods.

702
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,429
They are in a secure place.

703
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:43,662
Show me.

704
00:33:43,695 --> 00:33:44,961
You've seen the photographs.

705
00:33:44,995 --> 00:33:46,727
That's not good enough.

706
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,759
I want proof that

707
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,691
the rods exist or you will not be paid.

708
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:53,522
You want proof, huh?

709
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:54,722
Okay.

710
00:33:54,754 --> 00:33:55,622
Come with me.

711
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,141
Josef...

712
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,798
My younger son.

713
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:32,163
He was transporting the rods...

714
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,794
...and he was careless.

715
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:40,525
There. You have your proof.

716
00:34:44,754 --> 00:34:47,119
How long will it take to
get the rods to the ship?

717
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,851
Five hours.

718
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:51,317
I want to be there to supervise the loading.

719
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,516
Whatever you want, my friend.

720
00:34:55,348 --> 00:34:58,346
Now where is my money?

721
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,577
I'll make the call.

722
00:35:20,111 --> 00:35:24,375
Agent Walker worked undercover
as Renee Zadan for 16 months

723
00:35:24,408 --> 00:35:26,074
before the bust went down
and she was incarcerated.

724
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:28,704
We're focusing on the period
of time just after her release

725
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:31,936
when she's supposed to be
in Mexico working with Jack.

726
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,935
We're synchronizing two
years of travel materials

727
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:35,700
mostly to and from Mexico City.

728
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,665
What all do we know about
this Ziya character

729
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:38,832
that she's visiting?

730
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:40,231
Not much.

731
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,828
He pled out to a clas
s-three felony one month after the bust.

732
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:46,659
He's now in Long Island City
working in an auto parts store

733
00:35:46,692 --> 00:35:47,993
as a condition to his early release.

734
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:50,224
That's where Jack and Renee are headed now.

735
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:51,257
Where exactly are they?

736
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,588
En route. Just leaving Manhattan.

737
00:35:52,622 --> 00:35:55,321
Good. Chloe, download the
cover materials to them.

738
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:58,019
Walk them through it.
Make sure there's no surprises.

739
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:06,780
Jack, it's Chloe.

740
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:09,111
You should be receiving
a consolidated timeline

741
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:11,411
plus detail files for travel and residency.

742
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:13,109
Have they downloaded to your PDA yet?

743
00:36:13,143 --> 00:36:14,475
Yes, we got it, Chloe.

744
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:15,940
Oh, and Dana would like for me

745
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,706
to review the facts with you,
if that's okay.

746
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:19,439
We're fine, Chloe.
I know how to prep a cover.

747
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:22,370
I'm sure you do, it's just that...
Chloe, it's all right.

748
00:36:22,404 --> 00:36:23,969
As soon as we got something,
we'll get back to you.

749
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,733
Okay, I guess

750
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,466
I will leave you then. Good luck.

751
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,765
Thanks.

752
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:30,364
You got a problem?

753
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:31,763
No, just that you've got

754
00:36:31,796 --> 00:36:33,396
everyone treating me like I'm an invalid.

755
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:34,627
No one's treating you like an invalid.

756
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,894
It's standard procedure.

757
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,260
They're trying to sync up two cover stories.

758
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:38,658
He's not gonna quiz me on the facts, Jack.

759
00:36:38,692 --> 00:36:40,656
He gonna take one look at
me and decide if I'm lying.

760
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,521
I know. And whatever happens after that,
we need to be ready.

761
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:48,651
It's hard being with you
when you don't think

762
00:36:48,685 --> 00:36:50,218
that I'm up to this.

763
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,250
I never said you weren't up to this.

764
00:36:52,283 --> 00:36:54,581
I said I was concerned about you.
It's different.

765
00:36:54,614 --> 00:36:55,780
Whatever you call it,

766
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,413
the fact is you don't trust me, not really.

767
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:03,608
So here we are.

768
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,940
Me and my babysitter.

769
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:16,733
How are we on aerial?

770
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:19,199
Already in place and
they're not even there yet.

771
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,330
Jack and Renee are five minutes from target.

772
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,363
They should arrive just
before he closes up shop.

773
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:26,427
Walsh.

774
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,491
Someday, you're going to have

775
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:30,224
to tell me how you picked that name.

776
00:37:30,257 --> 00:37:31,689
I can't talk now.

777
00:37:31,723 --> 00:37:34,356
I like your apartment, Jenny. Real homey.

778
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,387
And I gotta compliment you
on your housekeeping skills,

779
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,618
everything is in its place.

780
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:41,516
And I've been admiring your photos,

781
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,848
I hope you don't mind.

782
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:46,746
And I've noticed kind of a theme.

783
00:37:46,779 --> 00:37:48,312
You and your boyfriend, I'm guessing.

784
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:49,944
Is that right?

785
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:51,043
Yes.

786
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:52,775
I hope it's not too serious.

787
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:55,275
We're getting married, Kevin.

788
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:56,973
Wow.

789
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:58,538
Who would have guessed?

790
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:00,304
When I saw you, you weren't exactly wearing

791
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:01,669
an engagement ring.

792
00:38:01,703 --> 00:38:03,169
So tell me about him.

793
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:04,435
Kevin, don't.

794
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't what?

795
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,066
I'm curious, can you blame me?

796
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,663
He's... he's just a guy that I met.

797
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:13,229
A guy you met.

798
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:15,294
What's that mean, a guy you met?

799
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:16,826
I just spent seven years
in prison with some guys.

800
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,624
Is that the kind of guy you mean?

801
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:21,290
You know what? I'm beginning to see that

802
00:38:21,324 --> 00:38:22,956
we need to talk about this in person.

803
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:25,486
Look, I told you that I'm in
the middle of a crisis here.

804
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,653
I can't. I don't have time.

805
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,518
You know what, Jenny? In my experience,

806
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:29,850
when something's important,
you make time for it.

807
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:31,017
Don't you think?

808
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:34,580
Jenny, are you there?

809
00:38:34,614 --> 00:38:35,814
Don't call me that!

810
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,813
What?

811
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:37,946
I said...!

812
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:39,878
You don't tell me what to call you,

813
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:41,909
what not to call you, you understand that?!

814
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:43,310
I'll call you whatever I want!

815
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:44,974
You don't tell me anything, Jenny!

816
00:38:47,273 --> 00:38:48,538
Now get back here.

817
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,203
I said...

818
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:54,834
that I will

819
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:56,899
as soon as I can.

820
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:59,665
Yeah, well, it better be soon.

821
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,839
That's him.

822
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,337
Looks like he's closing up.

823
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:43,534
Okay, we'll use these for comm so I can

824
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:46,167
hear you in case you get into trouble. Okay.

825
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,428
Hey.

826
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:56,060
This is your last shot.

827
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,360
You do not have to do this.

828
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:59,491
I know, but I want to.

829
00:40:18,312 --> 00:40:19,911
: We're closed.

830
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,608
What'd I say?

831
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,973
Renee.

832
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:30,570
Ziya.

833
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:32,303
Nice outfit. Not a lot

834
00:40:32,337 --> 00:40:33,835
of men can pull off a skirt.

835
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:35,367
When did you get out?

836
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,166
I thought you were serving seven-to-ten.

837
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:40,563
They let me out early. Good behavior.

838
00:40:40,597 --> 00:40:43,096
Good behavior.

839
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:44,428
With warden?

840
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:46,161
Well, eventually, yeah.

841
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,225
But it's like anything else,
you gotta work your way up.

842
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:55,753
So why you here?

843
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,552
I'm looking for Vladimir.

844
00:40:57,586 --> 00:41:00,350
Got a business proposition I
know he'd be interested in.

845
00:41:00,383 --> 00:41:02,382
What kind of business proposition?

846
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:05,847
Got a buyer, something big being sold.

847
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,911
Yeah? I don't know. Vlad disappear.

848
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:12,176
Hmm, maybe.

849
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:15,674
But you can find him.

850
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,839
Really? Why I do that?

851
00:41:18,872 --> 00:41:21,503
Why do you think?

852
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:23,335
I don't know.

853
00:41:23,368 --> 00:41:25,201
I'll cut you in.

854
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,465
Unless, of course,
you're making so much money here

855
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:29,431
that that's of no interest to you.

856
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,762
See? Your greedy little eyes are saying,

857
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:35,793
"Show me the money,
" so what's the problem, Ziya?

858
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:42,023
Parole bracelet?

859
00:41:42,056 --> 00:41:44,787
They know where I am 24-7.

860
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:45,854
I'm like dog.

861
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:47,187
I leave yard, I get shock.

862
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,051
Well, then just help me out.

863
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,650
Make some calls.

864
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:53,183
Make calls?

865
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:55,346
You know what happen I make
call asking where's Vladimir?

866
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,378
Tomorrow, have accident on way for work.

867
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:01,177
No, sensitive information,

868
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,276
done face-to-face, you know that.

869
00:42:03,308 --> 00:42:04,507
You're lucky.

870
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:08,871
You get out. Me, I'm still in prison.

871
00:42:08,905 --> 00:42:10,271
Let me see the bracelet.

872
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,037
No.

873
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,036
Come on. No.

874
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:13,169
Let me see it, Ziya. Hmm?

875
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:15,634
Ziya... What?

876
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,533
Have I ever messed you up ever?

877
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:20,131
Come on.

878
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:23,229
Let's see.

879
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,084
I can get this off, guaranteed.

880
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:42,682
You screw with this, you know what happen?

881
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:44,115
Cops come running in.

882
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:46,180
In two hours, I'm back inside.

883
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:48,146
Parole violation. Shh...

884
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:49,978
What? That's not gonna happen,
I'm telling you.

885
00:42:50,011 --> 00:42:51,576
I know how to get this off.

886
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,475
How do you know?
'Cause I'm constantly having

887
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:55,673
to deal with people like you, that's how.

888
00:42:57,606 --> 00:43:00,403
I can get it off if I
can just hold it steady.

889
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:13,795
But... you can't cut bracelet.

890
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:15,293
I'm not gonna cut the bracelet.

891
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:50,737
What have you done?

892
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,702
What the hell have you done?!

893
00:43:52,736 --> 00:43:54,334
Like he said, he was trapped here.

894
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:56,167
And think he's gonna help you now?!

895
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:57,666
That's it. This is over.

896
00:43:57,699 --> 00:43:59,099
This is over!

897
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:01,063
Maybe for you, Jack,
but I'm just getting started.

898
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,562
Find something to cauterize that wound.

899
00:44:11,622 --> 00:44:13,055
Damn it.

900
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:15,471
