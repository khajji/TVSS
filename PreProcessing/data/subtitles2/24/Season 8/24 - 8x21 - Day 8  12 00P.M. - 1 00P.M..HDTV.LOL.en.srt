1
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:14,436
Previously on 24:

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,381
I´ll be right back.

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,401
Renee!

4
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,936
(Jack grunts)

5
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:27,004
Oh, God...

6
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,738
(gasping breath)

7
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,943
You said you had video file
implicating people inside

8
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:34,978
the Russian government who were
responsible for Renee's murder.

9
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,947
I want that file.

10
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,582
<i>Tell me where that file is,</i>

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,684
now!
It's in a safety deposit box!

12
00:00:40,752 --> 00:00:41,652
Where?

13
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:43,053
DANA:
First Unity Savings.

14
00:00:43,054 --> 00:00:45,222
I had nothing to do
with Renee's death, Jack.

15
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:47,957
No.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,296
You never give up, do you?

17
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:53,630
(beep)

18
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:56,600
(loud pop)

19
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:00,404
LOGAN:
Bauer may have Walsh,

20
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:01,805
but he can't have
the evidence yet.

21
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:03,740
We've still got a chance
to stop him.

22
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:05,742
<i>I'm not the only one
who can prove</i>

23
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,277
that elements
in your government

24
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:09,146
conspired to undermine
the peace process.

25
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:11,048
So you expect me to
kill Bauer for you?

26
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:14,051
You have the covert assets
here to do the job.

27
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:15,786
Maybe I do.

28
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:18,255
But I don't have the
resources to find him.

29
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:19,389
CTU does.

30
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,358
And the man in charge
of the search now

31
00:01:21,426 --> 00:01:22,893
reports to me.

32
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:25,929
We got him.

33
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:28,832
<i>Once they have Bauer, I'll find
out where they're holding him.</i>

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,667
You'll have to take him out
while he's in custody.

35
00:01:30,735 --> 00:01:32,636
Freeze!
Police!

36
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:34,237
Do not move.

37
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:37,341
(cop grunting)

38
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,180
(woman screaming, gunshots)

39
00:01:46,317 --> 00:01:47,884
Jack...

40
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:49,453
tell me what I can do.

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,154
Nothing.

42
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,924
(gunshot)

43
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:57,861
(gunshot)

44
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:16,880
(over radio):
Mund, this is Captain Walleki.

45
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:19,783
I'm on scene. You got
that guy from the bank yet?

46
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,184
Just bringing him
up, Captain.

47
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:22,852
Right.

48
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,267
It's Cole Ortiz.

49
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:39,569
He says he's with CTU.

50
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:42,305
WALLEKI: You were with
this woman at the bank.

51
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:44,441
Do you care to tell
me who she is?

52
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,549
Her name is Dana Walsh.

53
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:53,950
Shot twice

54
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,519
at close range-
lot of powder residue

55
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:58,355
around one of the entries,
like an execution.

56
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:01,091
WALLEKI:
Thank you, Mund.

57
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,592
Get him to CTU,

58
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:04,327
now.

59
00:03:19,944 --> 00:03:22,012
DANA: The hit on
Hassan is all arranged.

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,414
Bazhaev and his people are
taking care of everything.

61
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,716
Well, I'm pleased
to hear it,

62
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:30,620
but you could have just as
easily called to tell me that.

63
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,491
DANA: I wanted to know if you've
spoken to your superiors...

64
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:37,961
told them that I'm out
after this goes down.

65
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:40,831
I told them
what you wanted.

66
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:43,100
He feels the same as me:

67
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,769
we have too much invested in you
to let you walk away.

68
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:50,240
You should be focused on getting
the E.M.P. device into CTU,

69
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:52,209
not on your boyfriend, Ortiz.

70
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:55,979
DANA: He's my fiancÃ©, and I
told you to leave him out of this.

71
00:03:56,047 --> 00:04:01,017
I warned you to stay away
from him, but you didn't listen.

72
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:04,621
And now you think
you have feelings for him?

73
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,390
You think you love him,
going to marry him?

74
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,459
Yes.

75
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,261
I am.

76
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,530
And if you
have a problem

77
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,333
wrapping your brain
around that fact,

78
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,769
maybe I should talk
to your boss in Moscow.

79
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:22,572
You talk to no one but me.

80
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:26,877
We're done here.

81
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:31,181
Don't contact me again
until Hassan is dead.

82
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:41,424
(phone rings)

83
00:04:43,694 --> 00:04:45,195
Yeah?

84
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:47,164
Hey, it's me.
I sent you

85
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,999
a DAT video file.

86
00:04:49,066 --> 00:04:50,967
Okay. I got it.

87
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:53,036
It's uploading right now.

88
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,839
Okay, I need you to get me an
I.D. of the man in the video.

89
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:57,774
Also, I'm coming in hot,
so whatever you have to do

90
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:59,509
to protect your systems from
getting flagged, do it now.

91
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:01,077
What about the woman?
You need an I.D. on her?

92
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:02,245
She's dead.

93
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll see you
in a few minutes.

94
00:05:03,948 --> 00:05:06,349
All right.

95
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:07,918
Jack Bauer's last known location

96
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:10,053
was First Unity Savings Bank
on Lexington,

97
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,354
where police responded

98
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:13,557
to a 911 call,
apparently from Dana Walsh.

99
00:05:13,624 --> 00:05:15,025
She's dead now.

100
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:16,326
Bauer killed her.

101
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:17,527
Cole Ortiz,

102
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:19,796
who is known to be
aiding and abetting Bauer

103
00:05:19,864 --> 00:05:21,298
is being brought here
for questioning.

104
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:22,499
Now, I need everybody

105
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,401
not committed
to the U.N. security task

106
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:26,403
to devote their full attention
to finding him.

107
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,406
I want all cameras routed
through facial recognition

108
00:05:29,473 --> 00:05:30,941
and all phone calls monitored.

109
00:05:31,008 --> 00:05:33,510
You don't have the bandwidth,
you steal it from other tasks.

110
00:05:33,578 --> 00:05:35,178
If you think you have a lead,

111
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:37,047
you bring it to me immediately.

112
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:40,083
Any questions?
Why did they go to the bank?

113
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,085
Dana said she
had evidence

114
00:05:42,153 --> 00:05:43,620
of Russian involvement
in Hassan's murder.

115
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:45,255
Maybe that's where
she was stashing it.

116
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:47,757
There's no evidence;
the president dismissed this.

117
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:51,094
<i>Well, she went to the bank
with Jack to get something.</i>

118
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:53,296
Yeah, what she got
was an explosive device

119
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:54,731
that made possible her escape.

120
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:56,199
It was her plan
all along.

121
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,101
Look, Jack Bauer
can't accept the fact

122
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,036
that Dana Walsh was
an enemy agent

123
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:02,272
working solely
with the I.R.K. opposition

124
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,740
to Hassan's government.

125
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:07,577
His... grief over Renee Walker's
murder is causing him

126
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:10,413
to create this fantasy
about a Russian conspiracy.

127
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:13,049
The simple truth is,
he's lost it,

128
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:15,952
and he's a danger to himself
and the community.

129
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,821
So let's stop second-guessing

130
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:20,156
the operation,
and find him.

131
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,724
(slaps table)

132
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:29,733
Something is
seriously wrong here.

133
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,268
Pillar's ignoring
the key questions,

134
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:33,637
and the questions that he
is answering, no one's asking.

135
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,005
What are you getting at?

136
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,940
I think Jack's right:
this is a cover-up,

137
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,174
and Pillar's involved.

138
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:39,743
That evidence was
at the bank, and Jack

139
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,011
has it.
You don't know that.

140
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:42,479
It's all
speculation.

141
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,148
It may be just like Pillar says.

142
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:47,417
Until I know otherwise,
I got my orders.

143
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,152
(scoffs)

144
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:50,854
I'm clear.

145
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,722
Well, you
weren't kidding.

146
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,325
You said you were
coming in hot.

147
00:06:55,393 --> 00:06:57,360
All the police scanners
are talking about you.

148
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:59,796
They said you shot
and killed some woman.

149
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:01,998
Construction site
on the East Side.

150
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,633
Was that the same woman
in the video

151
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:05,201
you sent me?
Yeah. Did you I.D. the man?

152
00:07:05,269 --> 00:07:08,071
No. I'm not going to, either...

153
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:10,106
till you tell me what the hell

154
00:07:10,174 --> 00:07:12,075
is going on, Jack.
You saw the video.

155
00:07:12,143 --> 00:07:13,576
Dana Walsh is a
Russian operative.

156
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:14,811
She facilitated
the assassination

157
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,546
of President Hassan
and the dirty bomb attack

158
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:18,848
that would have wiped out
the entire Upper West Side

159
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,083
if we hadn't
stopped it.

160
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:22,018
I don't want to know
about what happened today,

161
00:07:22,086 --> 00:07:23,787
and I don't care;
I want to know

162
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,356
why you're out there on your own
and why everybody's after you.

163
00:07:26,424 --> 00:07:28,625
Because the president tried to lock me down.
Why?

164
00:07:28,693 --> 00:07:30,360
Because I know she's
trying to cover up

165
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:32,362
the Russian's involvement
in today's attack.

166
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,097
Then why didn't you disappear?

167
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,798
Because I can't!

168
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:40,170
Listen, I want
to help you, Jack.

169
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:41,471
I really do.

170
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:43,606
I need you to be
straight with me.

171
00:07:43,674 --> 00:07:46,076
Tell me exactly
what's going on.

172
00:07:56,787 --> 00:07:59,856
The Russians took
something from me.

173
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:04,494
Her name was Renee Walker.

174
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:09,766
They killed her
inside my apartment.

175
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,702
And I need to make them pay.

176
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,675
All right.

177
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,413
Actually, I did I.D. the guy.

178
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:25,214
(typing)

179
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:29,085
There he is: Pavel Tokarev.

180
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:33,656
Primary operative,
Russian intelligence.

181
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,329
Where is he?

182
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:41,331
I don't know exactly.

183
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,966
He's in the USA.

184
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,435
Came in a month ago
on a diplomatic visa.

185
00:08:45,503 --> 00:08:48,104
(scoffs) Diplomat.
I tried to access

186
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:49,839
the Russian database
in the embassy.

187
00:08:49,907 --> 00:08:52,742
He didn't show up
in the consulate.

188
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,444
He could be
anywhere, Jack.

189
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:56,846
To keep everything quiet,
they'd have to be

190
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:58,848
a small unit, right?
Yeah.

191
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,984
I think I've got an idea.

192
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:02,819
Get me a secure line.

193
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:07,652
Meredith. I didn't expect
you'd still be here.

194
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:09,694
Oh, fact check called:
there are a few items

195
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:10,860
left on the
Hassan piece.

196
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,762
Abby can follow up
on it for you.

197
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,466
I know. I just... I need
to make sure it's right.

198
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:19,436
I know what he meant to you.

199
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:21,871
It shows in this
piece you wrote.

200
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:24,007
What a great man he was.

201
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:26,609
You've done him justice.

202
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,213
I hope so.

203
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:31,948
Miss Reed, there's
a call for you

204
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:33,950
on 3.
Thank you.

205
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:36,686
Let me know if
there's anything you need.

206
00:09:36,754 --> 00:09:38,387
Thanks, Gary.

207
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,258
(sighs)

208
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:46,229
(sets mug down)

209
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:50,687
This is Meredith Reed.

210
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:51,486
Miss Reed.

211
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:53,002
Who is this?
My name is Jack Bauer.

212
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,037
Please don't say anything;
just listen.

213
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:56,739
The people that you think
are responsible

214
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,674
for killing President Hassan
were not working alone.

215
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,143
They were being
funded and managed

216
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,911
by people working inside
the Russian government.

217
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:03,913
How do you know this?

218
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:05,848
I have proof of this:
a video file that was made

219
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,383
by a Russian agent
working out of CTU.

220
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:08,818
She made it
for her own protection.

221
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,453
It explains everything that
happened in the last 24 hours.

222
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:12,155
Have you contacted the
authorities about any of this?

223
00:10:12,222 --> 00:10:13,456
I can't.

224
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:15,625
I'm being set up, just
like you were yesterday.

225
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,593
I need to get
this evidence to you.

226
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:18,928
There's a coffee stand

227
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:20,163
on the third floor
of Turner's Department Store.

228
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:22,932
Do you think you get there
in the next 20 minutes?

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,634
(panting):
Miss Reed...

230
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:26,836
yesterday I helped
clear your name.

231
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:29,639
Right now I need you
to help clear mine.

232
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:30,907
Please.

233
00:10:30,908 --> 00:10:33,176
(sighs)
Of course I'll help you.

234
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:36,012
I- I want to know the truth
as much as you do.

235
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,613
Thank you.

236
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,929
Thank you.

237
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,902
Take a seat.

238
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,376
Where's Bauer?

239
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,412
I don't know.

240
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,547
You're in some trouble here,
Cole.

241
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:12,949
I assume you're aware of that.

242
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,117
Luckily for you,

243
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:17,186
I'm in a position
to make all that go away.

244
00:11:17,254 --> 00:11:18,888
I reviewed your record.

245
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:21,357
You've had a exemplary career
up to now.

246
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:23,926
You're Pillar.

247
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:25,461
That's right.

248
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:26,729
Jason Pillar.

249
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,964
I've been asked by the president

250
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:30,099
to oversee the effort
to retrieve Jack Bauer.

251
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,534
Madam President?

252
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:33,236
Yes.

253
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:34,871
So you're a part
of the cover-up?

254
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,676
Oh, I see here
you served in Fallujah.

255
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:41,844
I- I spent two tours

256
00:11:41,845 --> 00:11:45,248
in command of a marine unit
in Baquba myself.

257
00:11:45,315 --> 00:11:47,817
We're both soldiers.

258
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,021
So you understand, when
the commander-in-chief deems

259
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:54,190
a course of action necessary
to the national good,

260
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:57,226
it's not our place
to question it.

261
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,494
The truth is:

262
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:00,062
we're on the same side.

263
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,365
We both want what's best
for our country.

264
00:12:02,432 --> 00:12:03,799
Bauer doesn't care about that.

265
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,701
He didn't give a damn
about what happened to you,

266
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,970
just as long
as it served his needs.

267
00:12:08,038 --> 00:12:09,671
He used you.

268
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:14,010
So let's start over.

269
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:17,613
Do you know where Jack Bauer is?

270
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,718
Probably somewhere
with the evidence you guys

271
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:25,855
keep saying
doesn't exist.

272
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,790
You really don't want
to be playing with me.

273
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:32,328
(headset beeps)
What?

274
00:12:32,396 --> 00:12:34,263
Good news:
we may have a line on Bauer.

275
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,966
We intercepted a call.

276
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:41,470
Last chance.

277
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:42,972
You don't take it,
there's nothing

278
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,541
anyone can do
for you.

279
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:56,719
Take him to holding.

280
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,623
Arlo got a cell phone
intercept report

281
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,158
off of NSA's Echelon.

282
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,593
Keywords: Hassan, Russian
government, Jack Bauer.

283
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:07,196
Did Arlo hear any of the conversation? No, not yet
- all he's got

284
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:08,497
so far are
the data handles,

285
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:09,332
but he's processing
the voice matrix now.

286
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:10,499
Are we sure
it's Bauer?

287
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,902
No, not yet, but the
other side of the call

288
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,603
was a phone registered
to Meredith Reed.

289
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,672
She's the reporter
CTU arrested last night

290
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,541
before the first attempt
on Hassan's life.

291
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:20,176
Rumor has it she was
also his mistress.

292
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:21,310
If Bauer was going
to reach out

293
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,345
to someone with
the evidence,

294
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:23,779
she would be an
excellent choice.

295
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:24,880
Arlo, stop
what you're doing.

296
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:26,048
Tag and lock
the intercept download

297
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:27,483
and send it directly
to Eden's system.

298
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,656
She'll take it from there.
That's not necessary, sir.

299
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,745
I said I want Eden to handle it.
Thanks, Arlo.

300
00:13:56,183 --> 00:13:57,416
JACK: There's a video
file that was made

301
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:59,051
by a Russian agent
working out of CTU.

302
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,553
She made it
for her own protection.

303
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:03,155
It explains everything that
happened in the last 24 hours.

304
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:04,957
REED: Have you contacted the
authorities about any of this?

305
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,426
JACK: I can't. I'm being set
up just like you were yesterday.

306
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:09,205
I need to get
this evidence to you.

307
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,614
There's a coffee stand

308
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,421
on the third floor
of Turner's Department Store.

309
00:14:12,456 --> 00:14:13,599
Do you think you can get there
in the next 20 minutes?

310
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Jack Bauer.

311
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:15,601
PILLAR (over phone):
Yes, sir.

312
00:14:15,602 --> 00:14:16,769
We confirmed
the voiceprint.

313
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,504
So...

314
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:21,707
take it to the press-
that's his next move.

315
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:22,841
It appears to be.

316
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:24,109
Reed's connection
to Hassan means

317
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,211
she'd be
highly motivated

318
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:26,679
to help him.

319
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:28,547
And he hasn't shown
her anything yet?

320
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,049
No, sir.
Which still means

321
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,484
that we, we don't know what
the evidence actually is.

322
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:35,020
Well, it will be
in our hands soon enough.

323
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:37,022
This is a major
opportunity

324
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,657
to make everything
go away, sir:

325
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:39,858
Bauer and the evidence.

326
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:40,859
I've already dispatched

327
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,461
the Russian ops team
to the location.

328
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,096
They'll be in position
well before the meet.

329
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,197
NOVAKOVICH:
You need to deal

330
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:46,198
with local law
enforcement,

331
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,133
make sure Pavel
has room to move.

332
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:50,369
PILLAR: Yes, we're deploying
NYPD away from the site,

333
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:51,470
but we'll still
need your guys

334
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:52,738
in and out as
quickly as possible.

335
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:53,973
Understood.

336
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:57,009
Jason, this is, this is
a major break you've got,

337
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:58,577
<i>a major break.</i>

338
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:00,512
Thank you, sir.

339
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,681
We'll shut this down.

340
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:05,484
I want to stay on top of
this personally, Mikhail.

341
00:15:05,552 --> 00:15:09,088
So will you let me
have Pavel's number?

342
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,764
Can you make this room
less public?

343
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:29,508
You wanted me for something?

344
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:31,143
Yeah, the call
you intercepted-

345
00:15:31,211 --> 00:15:32,645
the one
that Pillar hijacked-

346
00:15:32,646 --> 00:15:33,712
do you think
it was from Jack?

347
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,047
I can't be sure.

348
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:36,949
The program hit on keywords
Hassan, nuclear, Bauer,

349
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,584
but all three have been
in the news

350
00:15:38,652 --> 00:15:39,852
in the last
few hours.

351
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:41,553
But the call was
to Meredith Reed's cell phone.

352
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:43,922
She's a journalist with
an interest in the Hassan story.

353
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,258
Plenty of people
could be calling her.

354
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:47,760
Doesn't have to be Jack.

355
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:49,628
Okay, then explain this.

356
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:51,196
Cell intercept report
comes in here.

357
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:52,631
Two minutes later

358
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:54,099
Pillar downloads
the entire conversation

359
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,701
into a segregated server
surrounded

360
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,136
by firewalls
like I've never seen.

361
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:58,804
Then what does he do?

362
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:00,539
Call one, call two,

363
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:01,974
call three.

364
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,275
Who'd he call?

365
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:04,677
I don't know.

366
00:16:04,744 --> 00:16:06,945
They're outside of CTU and
they're all completely masked.

367
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:09,281
So the question is this:
if the call was nothing,

368
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:10,783
then why are they
still hiding it?

369
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:12,818
If the call was Jack, then
why haven't they dispatched

370
00:16:12,886 --> 00:16:14,386
CTU SWAT team?

371
00:16:14,454 --> 00:16:17,256
Why haven't they alerted NYPD?

372
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,657
Arlo,

373
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:19,925
they're in on the cover-up.

374
00:16:19,926 --> 00:16:21,626
Look at them.

375
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,967
Why?
Why would they want to do that?

376
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,469
Because he knows
too much.

377
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,937
He's gotten a hold
of Dana's evidence,

378
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,339
which proves
the Russian involvement

379
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,473
in Hassan's assassination.

380
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,275
They can't let him
go public with that.

381
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,976
That's why I have
to find him,

382
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:40,179
and I need your help.

383
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:48,120
Okay.

384
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,989
How do you
want to do it?

385
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,324
I'm gonna talk to Cole.

386
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,026
He just spent the past two hours
with Jack and Dana.

387
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:56,462
He must have some idea
of what Jack's up to.

388
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,130
Pillar's got Cole
continuously monitored.

389
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,765
You can't get in there
without being seen.

390
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,335
We'll create a loop and graft it
into the security feed.

391
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:04,770
That's the
other problem:

392
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:07,206
they added an extra layer
of oversight to our system.

393
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,174
Second I try to move
beyond my security clearance,

394
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,943
I get an on-screen warning.

395
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,612
They're watching
everything we're doing.

396
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,681
Okay, fine.

397
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:25,324
We'll use this,
create a mobile hot spot.

398
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:28,660
That way we can work off
our own net without Pillar

399
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,229
breathing down
our necks.

400
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:32,364
Got it.

401
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,068
(beeps)

402
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:37,970
Setting up
alternate network

403
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:40,806
now.

404
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:46,578
We're up.

405
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:47,579
Okay, I'm restricting
access

406
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,481
to you and me.

407
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,584
How long will it take
you to make the loop?

408
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:53,919
I can only give
you 90 seconds.

409
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,287
Anything more than that,
somebody will notice.

410
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,656
Okay, text me
when you're set up.

411
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,176
âª âª

412
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:30,622
Fredericks,

413
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:31,824
McDermott was injured
in the E.M.P. blast,

414
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:32,825
so I need you
to collect

415
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:33,959
the night shift
time cards

416
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,194
and take them
to my office.

417
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,829
Okay.

418
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,297
Like now?

419
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:41,200
Yes, ma'am.

420
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,717
We put a loop
in the security feed.

421
00:18:58,785 --> 00:18:59,918
I've only got
90 seconds,

422
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,487
so I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

423
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:02,955
I need to find Jack

424
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:04,823
or else they're gonna kill him.
Who's gonna kill him?

425
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:06,458
Pillar and whoever
is working with him.

426
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,093
You need to tell me
where he is.

427
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:09,561
I got no idea.

428
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,129
You were at the bank with him;
he must have said something.

429
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,098
Hey, what Jack says
and what he does

430
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,633
are two very
different things.

431
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,968
He's trying
to expose the cover-up.

432
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:18,303
He doesn't give a damn
about any cover-up.

433
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:21,840
He's taking out anyone who was
anywhere near Renee's death,

434
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:23,675
starting with Dana.

435
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:26,645
She gave him the evidence
and he killed her anyway.

436
00:19:26,713 --> 00:19:28,680
She took the gun out
of the safety deposit box.

437
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:29,748
She was probably
shooting at him.

438
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:32,150
He shot her point-blank.

439
00:19:32,218 --> 00:19:35,721
He executed her,
just like she said he would.

440
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:38,657
There e no
good guys here.

441
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:42,794
Jack, Pillar...
they end up killing each other,

442
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,663
maybe it's
the best thing.

443
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:45,964
No, Jack's my friend.

444
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:48,033
If I can find him,
I can talk him down.

445
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:50,202
These people are just
going to kill him.

446
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,837
I need you to be
on my side.

447
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:53,138
(scoffs)

448
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:54,706
Everybody wants me
on their side.

449
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:57,409
Who am I
fighting for?

450
00:19:57,477 --> 00:20:02,114
If we can get to him,
we can expose the cover-up.

451
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:07,119
You just stay here
and feel sorry for yourself.

452
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,121
I'm gonna go find him.

453
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,156
Wait.

454
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,762
Look, it's not much, but Jack's
got to be working with someone.

455
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:17,963
Who?

456
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,131
I don't know; I never saw him,

457
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:20,499
but Jack showed up
with state-of-the-art

458
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,234
weapons and comms,
so he's got to have

459
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:23,569
a contact in the city.

460
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,371
You want to find Jack,
you find his supplier.

461
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:27,939
Thanks.

462
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,510
(exhales)

463
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,478
(dialing)

464
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:34,546
Arlo.

465
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,281
You got out in time.
You okay?

466
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:38,350
Yeah, I'm okay. Listen,
I know what Jack's doing.

467
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:40,953
Pull up his files, get me the
list of his known associates

468
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,488
in the tri-state area, anyone
he's worked with in the past.

469
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:44,556
Okay.

470
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:45,591
In the next half hour,

471
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,559
the man who has widely
been acknowledged

472
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:50,295
as the vital "third partner"
in the peace process-

473
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:52,497
Russian President
Yuri Suvarov-

474
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,333
will touch down at JFK.

475
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,368
He'll be ferried
into Manhattan by helicopter

476
00:20:56,436 --> 00:20:58,437
and then to the U.N.

477
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:00,572
(no audio)

478
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:12,317
(phone vibrates)

479
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:15,687
Yes.

480
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:17,823
Pavel, update, please.

481
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,992
My team is in position.

482
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,127
Any sign of Bauer?

483
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:24,529
Not yet.

484
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:26,698
I need to know.

485
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:29,801
What about the woman?

486
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:31,069
The woman?

487
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,207
The journalist, her disposition.

488
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,776
Ms. Reed is aiding and abetting
a terrorist.

489
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:40,479
She's a serious threat
to both our countries.

490
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,381
Do what you have to.

491
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:44,149
(phone beeps)

492
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:18,482
I see from Ethan's notes
that we still have not

493
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,981
completely resolved the issue
of site access

494
00:22:21,016 --> 00:22:22,566
for the
inspection teams.

495
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:24,117
I believe it was resolved.

496
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,350
President Hassan agreed

497
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:27,453
the inspectors would have right
of passage over

498
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:28,968
our entire country.

499
00:22:29,003 --> 00:22:30,622
But he exempted schools.

500
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:32,242
Only primary schools.

501
00:22:32,724 --> 00:22:34,157
Omar didn't think

502
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:37,260
ten-year-old children would be
building nuclear missiles.

503
00:22:40,498 --> 00:22:43,000
Of course.
I remember now.

504
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,834
I- I do apologize.

505
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:48,639
Are you all right,
Madam President?

506
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:51,942
It's been a long day.

507
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,477
I'm fine.
Thank you.

508
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:56,847
Madam President.

509
00:23:00,418 --> 00:23:01,985
If you'll excuse me

510
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:04,354
for a few minutes,
there's someone I need to see.

511
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:06,390
Of course.

512
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:07,624
Where is he?

513
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,126
He's in
the conference room, ma'am.

514
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:20,203
Thank you for seeing me,
Madam President.

515
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:21,338
I have good news.

516
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,572
We've located Bauer.

517
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,007
He-He has the evidence, but...

518
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:25,609
Charles, you assured me

519
00:23:25,677 --> 00:23:26,843
that that
wouldn't happen.

520
00:23:26,844 --> 00:23:28,045
Please, let me finish.

521
00:23:28,046 --> 00:23:31,448
We know exactly
where Bauer will be

522
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:33,517
and when, and-and
we have an operation underway

523
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,519
to reacquire him
even as we speak.

524
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:38,355
<i>Believe me, this is good news.</i>

525
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:40,757
(inhales and exhales loudly)

526
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:43,627
Let me know as soon
as it's resolved.

527
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:46,063
I need to get back
to the negotiations.

528
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,632
Just... There's just
one thing, Madam President.

529
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,137
Uh, we are three hours away
from the signing of the treaty.

530
00:23:54,205 --> 00:23:56,506
Isn't it time

531
00:23:56,574 --> 00:23:58,341
for my role in the process

532
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:01,178
to be officially recognized?

533
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:03,213
I was thinking

534
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:05,549
some kind of, uh, announcement

535
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,518
to the media, perhaps
by your press secretary,

536
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:10,954
or maybe even by you yourself,
Madam President.

537
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:16,093
It was, you'll recall,
our agreement

538
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,095
that I would have a public face

539
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,097
on this historic day.

540
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:25,068
I believe I've earned it.

541
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,409
I will talk to my
press secretary.

542
00:24:32,477 --> 00:24:34,678
She will make the announcement

543
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:36,913
in time for the
1:00 o'clock news.

544
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,982
Thank you very much,
Madam President.

545
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,367
We have contact.

546
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:59,302
Target heading
to the third floor escalator.

547
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,071
Acknowledged.

548
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:04,074
I see her now.

549
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:06,243
We have eyes on Reed.

550
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:13,583
Reed is confirmed.

551
00:25:13,651 --> 00:25:16,253
Units 2 and 3,
Reed is approaching you.

552
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,321
Confirm contact.

553
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,758
Reed confirmed.

554
00:25:21,826 --> 00:25:23,727
Approaching the meeting place.

555
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:25,162
Any sign

556
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,997
of Bauer?
Where is he?

557
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:28,765
He should be here.

558
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,333
No sign.

559
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:39,409
Pavel, do you see Bauer?

560
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:41,144
Not yet.

561
00:25:41,212 --> 00:25:43,747
Unit 1,

562
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:45,148
report.

563
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:47,150
We have no visual of Bauer.

564
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,531
WOMAN: Jason,
where are you going?

565
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,466
There he is.
He's heading up towards...

566
00:26:03,534 --> 00:26:04,701
Damn it, I lost him.

567
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:05,869
All units,

568
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,339
Bauer is on the third floor.
Do you see him?

569
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:10,740
I do not have him.
What?

570
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:12,776
He's there. We see him.
Get your eyes open, damn it!

571
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:14,778
I have not seen him.

572
00:26:14,846 --> 00:26:16,279
EDEN:
Got him.

573
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:18,381
PILLAR: Bauer is approaching
the target from the southwest.

574
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:20,217
He's got a brown
leather jacket and jeans.

575
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:25,689
EDEN:
There he is.

576
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:27,390
PILLAR:
Pavel,

577
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:28,592
he's in view.

578
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:29,926
He's closing in on the cafÃ©.

579
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:31,862
You should have a clean line
on him.

580
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:39,669
Pavel, if you have
a shot, take it.

581
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,238
I've got him.

582
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:46,542
Put it down.

583
00:26:49,547 --> 00:26:52,682
Everything's all clear
up at the top, Jack.

584
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,818
Got her. Come with me.

585
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,786
Do exactly what I say. Okay.

586
00:26:58,422 --> 00:27:00,857
All units, target is
in the open. Take him out.

587
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,226
I repeat: take him out.

588
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:10,567
You stay down here. You
don't move. Oh, okay.

589
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:12,135
Don't move!
All right.

590
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,144
(people screaming)

591
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:24,080
(gunfire)

592
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:25,749
(Meredith gasps)

593
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:27,651
(screaming continues)

594
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,357
JACK:
Move!

595
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:35,926
Okay.

596
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:38,395
What the hell just happened?

597
00:27:38,462 --> 00:27:41,898
He knew it was a trap.

598
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:44,467
Don't let them out
of your sight.

599
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:45,735
We lost him.

600
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:48,471
Just keep looking!

601
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,974
REED: Those people you shot
- who were they?

602
00:27:51,042 --> 00:27:52,542
Russian operatives.
You have any problems?

603
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,444
No.

604
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:58,682
Let's go.

605
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:21,680
(sighs)

606
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:23,415
Jason. Tell me.

607
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:26,051
I'm afraid I have bad news, sir.

608
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:30,589
All of Pavel's team is dead,
and Bauer has Pavel.

609
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:32,591
He was ahead of us
from the get-go, sir.

610
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:34,326
He must have anticipated
that we'd use Echelon,

611
00:28:34,394 --> 00:28:37,262
and he put out a series
of keywords, knowing

612
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,797
the listening stations
would pick them up.

613
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:40,332
He played us, sir.

614
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:42,668
He knew we'd use off-book
resources to deal with him.

615
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:44,703
He used that journalist
to draw them out.

616
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:48,340
Now, sir, I hardly need
to tell you that the situation

617
00:28:48,408 --> 00:28:49,575
is grave.

618
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,477
Pavel knows everything.

619
00:28:51,544 --> 00:28:53,612
He ran Walsh;
he set up the Russian ops.

620
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,281
If Bauer gets Pavel to talk...

621
00:28:56,349 --> 00:28:59,752
But at the moment, sir,

622
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,554
you still have
complete deniability.

623
00:29:02,622 --> 00:29:04,656
President Taylor made
all the decisions.

624
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:07,493
I think the time has come

625
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,496
for you to distance yourself
from this mess.

626
00:29:10,563 --> 00:29:12,498
It's regrettable,
sir, deeply so,

627
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,733
but I believe it's
what's best for you.

628
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,802
You...

629
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,905
20 minutes from now,

630
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:21,907
the president's press secretary

631
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:23,675
is going to make
an announcement.

632
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:25,411
She will say

633
00:29:25,478 --> 00:29:27,513
I have become part
of the president's team,

634
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,448
and-and I have been
indispensable

635
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:30,983
in bringing this peace process

636
00:29:30,984 --> 00:29:32,151
to a successful close.

637
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:34,586
Sir, may I say that
that is a bad idea?

638
00:29:34,654 --> 00:29:36,055
You need to distance yourself.

639
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,956
What? You keep using
that phrase.

640
00:29:38,024 --> 00:29:39,625
What-What does distance myself
mean?

641
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:41,160
Do I just slink away?

642
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:42,594
This isn't your fault, sir.

643
00:29:42,595 --> 00:29:43,996
There were circumstances
we couldn't have anticipated.

644
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:45,564
Namely Bauer.

645
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:47,966
Well, then, we find Bauer,
and we neutralize him.

646
00:29:48,034 --> 00:29:49,735
We're public now,

647
00:29:49,803 --> 00:29:51,503
Jason.

648
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:53,372
We're committed.

649
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,840
And I have worked...

650
00:29:54,841 --> 00:29:56,942
<i>We...</i>

651
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,278
<i>We have worked too hard</i>

652
00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:01,113
just to throw this all away.

653
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:02,347
Do you understand?

654
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:03,515
Yes, of course, sir,
but Pavel...

655
00:30:03,516 --> 00:30:04,783
No.

656
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:06,552
Pavel is a good soldier.

657
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:07,920
He won't talk,

658
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:10,856
whatever Bauer
does to him.

659
00:30:10,924 --> 00:30:12,858
I, uh...

660
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:15,294
I put you at CTU, Jason,

661
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:16,662
for a reason.

662
00:30:16,663 --> 00:30:18,564
They have huge resources.

663
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,399
You have intelligence
and tenacity.

664
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:24,036
You use those
capabilities.

665
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:26,038
Find Bauer.

666
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:27,306
Yes, sir.

667
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:29,074
I'll head down
to the scene myself.

668
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:31,543
Good.

669
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:33,612
Keep me posted.

670
00:30:36,816 --> 00:30:38,784
He wants to move forward.

671
00:30:38,852 --> 00:30:41,086
Does he understand
what actually happened?

672
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:44,323
Yes, but he says
we still have options.

673
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:47,993
(sighs)

674
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:50,329
I need to know
you're with me on this.

675
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:52,331
(sighs)

676
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:54,066
Yes. Yes, I'm with you.

677
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:55,567
Good. I'm heading out.

678
00:30:55,568 --> 00:30:58,270
I'll clean up the scene, remove
all trace of the Russians,

679
00:30:58,338 --> 00:30:59,638
and get on Bauer's trail.

680
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:01,740
I'll take CTU
SWAT with me.

681
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:03,909
Tell NYPD to put a two-block
perimeter around the store.

682
00:31:03,977 --> 00:31:05,511
No one goes in or out
without my say-so.

683
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:07,070
What reason do I give them?
National security.

684
00:31:07,105 --> 00:31:10,249
Anyone gives you a hard time,
invoke the White House.

685
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:11,983
(sighs)

686
00:31:16,856 --> 00:31:18,624
Any luck with
Jack's associates?

687
00:31:18,691 --> 00:31:20,492
No. Even discounting
dead people,

688
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,760
and people
from foreign countries,

689
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:23,195
it's still going to take hours.

690
00:31:23,196 --> 00:31:24,663
I think I can narrow it down.

691
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:26,198
I just picked up a 911 call

692
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:27,799
from Turner's in Midtown.

693
00:31:27,867 --> 00:31:29,134
There was a oot-out,

694
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:30,402
people killed.

695
00:31:30,403 --> 00:31:32,771
I managed to get into
the store's security system.

696
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:35,974
Oh, my God.

697
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:39,378
That's Jack.

698
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,147
They're trying to kill him.

699
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:43,515
Yeah, that part
of the plan

700
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:44,683
didn't go so well.

701
00:31:44,684 --> 00:31:46,518
I tagged the footage
15 minutes before

702
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:47,886
to 15 minutes
after the shooting.

703
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:50,122
If we run facial recognition
on the camera feeds...

704
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,724
We can match it to the database
of Jack's associates,

705
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:55,027
maybe find out who
he's working with.

706
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:56,495
Thanks, Arlo.

707
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:58,664
No problem.

708
00:31:58,731 --> 00:32:00,098
Copy the camera footage
to my screen.

709
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:01,966
I'll send you half
the personnel files.

710
00:32:06,906 --> 00:32:09,241
We're clear. Let's go.

711
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:17,416
Let's go.

712
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:20,886
Where are
we going?

713
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:22,888
Over here.

714
00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:38,036
Empty your pockets
right now here.

715
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:39,271
(Jack mumbles)

716
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:41,139
We'll be safe here
for a while.

717
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:42,874
(sighs)

718
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,477
(zippering)

719
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:51,450
(sighs)

720
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:53,452
RICKER: Jack? We
don't have much time.

721
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:58,624
(panting)

722
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:00,025
Take off your coat.

723
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:01,526
Now!

724
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,765
Those people
you killed...

725
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:09,167
you were ready for them,
weren't you?

726
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:10,569
You knew they
were coming.

727
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,603
Yeah.

728
00:33:11,604 --> 00:33:12,971
So you...

729
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:15,674
you knew they'd be listening
to our phone call.

730
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,543
Isn't that right?

731
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:21,613
You used me to draw them out,

732
00:33:21,681 --> 00:33:22,914
right?

733
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,249
That's right.

734
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,984
I could have been killed
back there!

735
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:27,586
You weren't.

736
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:32,391
Now, pick it up.

737
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:34,059
I said
pick it up!

738
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:36,228
REED: What about the evidence
you said you'd tell me?

739
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:37,862
Was that a lie, too?

740
00:33:39,499 --> 00:33:41,232
No.

741
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:46,305
The evidence is
on this memory card.

742
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:50,142
When you see it,
you'll know it's real.

743
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:51,876
Take it.

744
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:56,248
My partner's gonna take you
somewhere to show it to you.

745
00:33:56,316 --> 00:34:00,052
I'm sorry things had
to play out like this.

746
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,254
I didn't see another choice.

747
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:06,024
REED:
What are you gonna do?

748
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:08,593
Put your hands
behind your back. Now!

749
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,929
Don't do this, please. You
don't want to do this. Take her

750
00:34:10,997 --> 00:34:12,698
to the storeroom.

751
00:34:12,765 --> 00:34:14,199
No, I'm not going anywhere.

752
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,068
Please, you cannot do this.

753
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:17,569
The evidence
I gave you

754
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:19,071
doesn't tell me
how Walsh was involved.

755
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:20,906
He will.

756
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:22,140
Come on.
No.

757
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:23,342
He's a human being!

758
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:25,610
You cannot do this
this way!

759
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:29,981
Sit over there.

760
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,460
Springfield, M1A rifle.

761
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:45,664
.308 round.

762
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:53,305
You know, about four hours ago,

763
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,641
I had a friend of mine-
very good friend-

764
00:34:56,709 --> 00:35:00,412
named Renee Walker was killed
by a rifle just like that.

765
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,247
Go to hell.

766
00:35:04,317 --> 00:35:06,385
(grunts)

767
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,953
(chuckles wryly)

768
00:35:09,389 --> 00:35:11,857
You first.

769
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,268
DANA (on video): The hit
on Hassan is all arranged.

770
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,436
Bazhaev and his people

771
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:29,638
are taking care of everything.

772
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:32,641
You talko no one but me.

773
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:34,609
We're done here.

774
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:37,512
Don't contact me again
until Hassan

775
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,715
is dead.

776
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:49,624
To be honest with you,

777
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:53,495
Renee Walker was more
than just my friend.

778
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:56,331
But you already know
that, don't you?

779
00:35:56,399 --> 00:36:00,268
Because you saw us
in the bedroom of my apartment.

780
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:04,773
Now, you're either not very good
at what you do...

781
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:07,008
or you wanted her to suffer.

782
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:09,378
Because with that rifle
from that range,

783
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:11,413
it was an easy kill shot.

784
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:12,881
But instead,

785
00:36:12,882 --> 00:36:14,583
you shot her...
(quiet grunt)

786
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,084
right there...

787
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:18,320
two inches
below her heart,

788
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:20,455
so she would
bleed out slowly.

789
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:21,957
I watched her

790
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,992
gasping for air...

791
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,795
as the blood
slowly filled her lungs.

792
00:36:26,863 --> 00:36:28,463
She died in agony,

793
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:30,899
which is exactly what
I'm gonna make you do

794
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:33,802
unless you tell me
what I want to know.

795
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,005
(grunting in pain)

796
00:36:37,073 --> 00:36:38,607
(yells)
(gasping in pain)

797
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:40,409
(Pavel yelling in pain)

798
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,246
(yelling)

799
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,283
Start talking to me!

800
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:53,021
You want to know
I killed your girlfriend?

801
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:57,192
I killed her.

802
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,860
I kill your bitch!

803
00:36:58,928 --> 00:36:59,895
I did it!

804
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:03,298
(Jack yells, blows striking)

805
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:08,570
Please... please,
you've got to stop him. Please.

806
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:10,939
He needs answers,
and he's gonna get 'em.

807
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:12,541
I can use this.
There's enough here.

808
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,276
I don't need any more.

809
00:37:14,343 --> 00:37:15,710
Tell him I don't need
any more. Please.

810
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,112
You're not going anywhere.

811
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,647
(blows landing in distance)

812
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:19,981
(Jack grunting)

813
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:21,983
(yells)

814
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,121
(panting)

815
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:35,730
(indistinct radio transmission)

816
00:37:35,798 --> 00:37:37,398
MAN:
Let's go.

817
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:45,841
Move aside. Move. Move.

818
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:47,709
Please step back
from the bodies.

819
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:48,944
This is now

820
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:50,245
a CTU crime scene.

821
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:51,446
I need all weapons

822
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:53,215
and documents you found
on these people.

823
00:37:53,282 --> 00:37:54,816
This is all we got, sir.

824
00:37:54,884 --> 00:37:56,751
None of them
had I.D.s on them.

825
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:05,160
This is the man
we're looking for.

826
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:06,628
His name is

827
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:08,530
Jack Bauer.
Now, you need to spread out

828
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:09,731
and check every floor

829
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,166
and every exit.

830
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,669
He has a hostage with him,
so he won't have gotten far.

831
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:16,438
Bauer's armed
and extremely dangerous,

832
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,306
so if you don't want
to end up like these people,

833
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:20,141
shoot on sight.

834
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:22,511
Let's go.

835
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:33,455
Hey.

836
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:38,894
So, why don't we
start this again.

837
00:38:40,396 --> 00:38:43,899
I already know that
you killed Renee Walker.

838
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:46,635
What I want to know...

839
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,103
is the name...
(grunts)

840
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,871
of the Russian pig

841
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,773
inside your government
(grunts)

842
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:52,908
(grunts)

843
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:55,076
...that gave the order.
(grunts)

844
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:59,814
Give me a name, and
I'll end this quickly.

845
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,483
I give you my word.

846
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,768
You think you know about pain?

847
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,204
You don't know
anything yet.

848
00:39:24,507 --> 00:39:26,474
(screaming)

849
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:28,276
Give me the name of the person

850
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:30,111
inside your government

851
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:32,113
who wanted Renee Walker dead!

852
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:33,848
Give me the name!

853
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:35,317
(screaming)

854
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:37,319
Who gave the order?!

855
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:39,254
Who inside your government

856
00:39:39,322 --> 00:39:40,689
wanted Renee Walker dead?

857
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,625
All you got to do
is give me the name!

858
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:45,694
(low grunting)

859
00:39:54,003 --> 00:39:56,171
(flame whooshing)

860
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,508
You are so stupid.

861
00:40:00,576 --> 00:40:02,177
Renee Walker wasn't

862
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,511
a threat to you.

863
00:40:03,512 --> 00:40:05,847
Her work was finished.
She was done. We were out.

864
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:09,884
All you had to do
is leave us alone.

865
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:15,690
Now, why couldn't you
just leave us alone?

866
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:19,494
(screaming)

867
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:21,329
I want the name
of the person

868
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:23,832
who gave the order
to pull the trigger!

869
00:40:25,735 --> 00:40:27,369
Who gave the order?!

870
00:40:27,436 --> 00:40:28,603
Now!

871
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:30,138
Did it on my own!

872
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:32,273
You're lying. You're nothing.

873
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:34,376
You didn't have the authority.

874
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:36,144
I want the name!

875
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:37,278
Give me the name!

876
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:39,214
My name is Pavel Tokarev.

877
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:40,715
(clicks on flame)

878
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:43,418
(screaming)

879
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:46,220
(flame stops)

880
00:40:53,095 --> 00:40:55,096
(panting)

881
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:58,299
This isn't working.

882
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,368
Damn it!

883
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,581
Where's the SIM card
for your phone?

884
00:41:15,785 --> 00:41:17,318
Where's the SIM card?!

885
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,059
Where'd you drop it?

886
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:38,506
You dumb bastard,
you swallowed it.

887
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:40,208
You swallowed it.

888
00:41:41,677 --> 00:41:44,546
This is for my friend.

889
00:41:45,915 --> 00:41:48,216
(gasps)

890
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:49,784
(grunts)

891
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,989
âª âª

892
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:01,930
What do you got?

893
00:42:01,931 --> 00:42:03,098
Fine. There's another
service hallway.

894
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:04,566
Check all the service
hallways over there.

895
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:06,034
Make sure they're
locked down.

896
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:09,003
You guys, I want you to go up
there, stay on the third floor.

897
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,938
Do it now.

898
00:42:17,379 --> 00:42:19,380
(panting)

899
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:47,976
(panting)

900
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,886
PILLAR: You've reached the mobile
number of President Charles Logan.

901
00:42:57,953 --> 00:42:59,554
We can't take
your call right now,

902
00:42:59,622 --> 00:43:01,055
but if you leave a message,

903
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:03,892
we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.
