Hassan's security forces

3
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:15,697
in the Islamic Republic

4
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:16,965
are sweeping
through the capital,

5
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,634
arreing opposition
leaders.

6
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:22,271
And if he continues, it may
delegitimize the peace accord.

7
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:24,306
<i>I can't vouch for you</i>

8
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:25,941
as a reformer, Mr. President,

9
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,409
if you renege

10
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,077
on your human rights
obligations.

11
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,313
My brother tried to kill me,

12
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,981
helped by elements

13
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,083
within my own government.

14
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:36,652
Apparently,
killing President Hassan

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,620
was only part
of his brother's plan.

16
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:40,455
CTU now believes
he's also trying

17
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:42,658
to acquire weapons-grade
uranium.

18
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:44,660
When can I take possession
of the rods?

19
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:46,662
As soon as we have the money.

20
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,597
<i>JOSEF: I found a doctor
who can treat him.</i>

21
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,132
BAZHAEV:
No doctors.

22
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,100
The authorities know
about the nuclear material.

23
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:53,368
Putting Oleg

24
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:55,504
in a clinic would lead them
right to us.

25
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,972
Dr. Levine.

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,073
How did you get in here?

27
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,908
My brother is sick.
I'm gonna call you

28
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,443
an ambulance.
No.

29
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:02,945
No one can know about this.

30
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,681
(gasping):
No, no.

31
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:07,282
What do you want from me?

32
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,851
<i>You're a data analyst
for CTU.</i>

33
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,020
You got access to all sorts
of good stuff.

34
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:14,022
Yeah, but not unrestricted
access.

35
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,124
Payout's got to be at least
six figures.

36
00:01:16,192 --> 00:01:17,492
You were undercover
for nearly two years

37
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,961
with the Russian Mob.

38
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:20,963
You're asking me to go back in?

39
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,864
<i>Vladimir Laitanan was</i>

40
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:24,533
completely obsessed with her.
It turned violent.

41
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,667
Did he rape her?

42
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:27,803
It looks like he tried
a couple of times.

43
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,471
Can we talk
about this deal now?

44
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,039
I wish it were that simple.

45
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:32,507
Tie her up.
What?

46
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,976
Look, you're making
a mistake.

47
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,677
This is the chance
of a lifetimK]

48
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:36,878
JACK:
This operation's over.

49
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,880
Vladimir didn't take the bait.

50
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,649
<i>Renee, it's Jack.</i>

51
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:41,650
I know you can hear me.

52
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:42,884
I'm on my way now.

53
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:44,853
You don't want
to do this deal,

54
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,488
then you might as well
just kill me,

55
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:49,324
because this deal is
the only thing that I have.

56
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:51,326
Do it!

57
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:52,928
Pull the trigger!

58
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:57,199
I had to be sure.

59
00:01:58,468 --> 00:01:59,901
CHLOE:
Jack, are you there?

60
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:00,936
What's going on?

61
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,404
She's in.

62
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:03,805
They bought her cover.

63
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,967
JACK (over comm):
Renee, I've got a visual on you.

64
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,269
I'm going off comm
for a minute.

65
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:39,141
You all right?

66
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,412
(phone rings)

67
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,646
CHLOE:
CTU, O'Brian.

68
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,048
Chloe, it's Jack. I want you

69
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,883
to monitor Renee's comm.
I need to speak to Hastings.

70
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,051
Okay, I'll put you
through.

71
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:50,085
I'm here, Jack. Go ahead.

72
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:51,219
We need to pull
Renee Walker out now.

73
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:52,587
Based on what?

74
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,423
Because she's a danger
to herself and this mission.

75
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,825
Ten minutes ago, Laitanan
threatened to execute her,

76
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:57,926
and she said
she was sick of living

77
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:59,161
and wanted to die
and she meant it.

78
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:00,395
She must've been
playing him.

79
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:02,064
No. She doesn't care
what happens to her,

80
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,565
that's what makes
her dangerous.

81
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,233
She's like a bomb
ready to go off.

82
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,636
We need to get her out of there
before that happens. Look, I understand

83
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:09,604
your concern, but we can't
just roll up this operation

84
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,406
before we find those
nuclear rods.

85
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:12,541
We can arrest Laitanan.

86
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:13,809
If he knows how
to find the rods,

87
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:15,077
I will make him talk.

88
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:16,445
If you're saying
what I think you are,

89
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:17,879
we don't do that anymore.

90
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,748
Then you people do
what you do well-

91
00:03:19,816 --> 00:03:21,249
offer him immunity
or something.

92
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:22,918
This is the Russian
Syndicate.

93
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,187
They're very secretive,
they protect their own.

94
00:03:25,254 --> 00:03:26,755
It is highly unlikely

95
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:27,989
that Laitanan would
cooperate.

96
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,224
Then you better find
another way,

97
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,859
because I am not gonna
let Renee die

98
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:32,194
because CTU did
their job badly.

99
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:34,196
I will not let that happen.
Do you understand me?

100
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:36,198
Jack, if you can think
of something, I will listen.

101
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:37,532
But right now,

102
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,201
Renee's the only hope we have

103
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:40,535
of neutralizing this threat.

104
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:43,805
And on my order,
she stays in play.

105
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:48,243
Jack?

106
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:52,447
I'll find a way to get her out
when I go in as the buyer.

107
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:55,450
I'll sy under in her place.

108
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,452
Do we have a deal?

109
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,955
As long as you can do it
without risking the mission.

110
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,957
I give you my word.

111
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,792
Agent Ortiz will meet you

112
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,794
at the staging area
with a TAC team.

113
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:08,163
He'll have everything you need
for your cover.

114
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,498
Hold on.
They're moving.

115
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,133
I need to get
back on comm.

116
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,103
VLADIMIR:
We'll go back to my shop,

117
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,173
and we will discuss
this buyer of yours.

118
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:31,753
(engine starts)

119
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,128
(tires squealing)

120
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,997
HASTINGS: Dana... (gasps)

121
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:43,665
start forwarding mission

122
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,668
status reports to the Nuclear
Emergency Team at Fort Hamilton.

123
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:49,137
I want them ready to go
in as soon as we find

124
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,206
these nuclear rods.
I'm on it, sir.

125
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,299
(phone rings)

126
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,900
Ye.

127
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,068
It's me.

128
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,236
I've got something.

129
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:22,904
Damn, you're fast.

130
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,873
Okay, hold on.

131
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:26,875
Okay, go.

132
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,510
Let's hear it.

133
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,378
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

134
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:33,582
According to the manifest,
a local vice group

135
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,585
just impounded a stash
of drug money.

136
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,753
It'll be held there
for the next 48 hours.

137
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,188
How much?

138
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,590
$120,000.

139
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,660
All right, what's the plan?

140
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,095
You go in and take it.

141
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,398
(chuckles)

142
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:52,000
What do you mean,
break into a police station?

143
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,435
What, are you out of your mind?

144
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:54,836
It's not a police station.
It's a warehouse.

145
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:56,838
Most of the security
is automated.

146
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,506
I can manipulate it
from here.

147
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,508
You walk in, you walk out
with the cash.

148
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,410
I'll talk you through it.

149
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,614
I need to access
their security codes,

150
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,816
work up a keycard to get you
inside the warehouse.

151
00:06:07,883 --> 00:06:09,017
How long?

152
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,219
Meet me outside CTU
in 30 minutes.

153
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,221
ARLO: Did you take care
of your situation?

154
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,923
Situation?

155
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,292
The big mystery you had
to leave work for.

156
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,294
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

157
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,229
What do you need, Arlo?

158
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,065
I'm getting five percent lag
in my Drone's ABS controls.

159
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,434
With everything going on,
I think I'm just running hot.

160
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:29,104
Okay, I'll make sure
to free up some memory space

161
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,439
on the auxiliary servers.

162
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,108
Thanks.

163
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,110
You know, if there's
something bothering you,

164
00:06:35,177 --> 00:06:37,279
you've always got
my shoulder to cry on.

165
00:06:37,346 --> 00:06:40,115
Or any other body part.

166
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,650
I will keep that in mind.

167
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,385
But, for now,
why don't you focus on

168
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,986
running aerial support
for Walker and Bauer?

169
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,454
Okay.

170
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,851
âª âª

171
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,255
Lugo, take a break.

172
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:22,057
I want to talk to her alone.

173
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:35,603
All right,
you have my attention.

174
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:38,840
Tell me about this buyer.

175
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:41,543
His name's
Ernst Meier.

176
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,545
German arms dealer.

177
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:45,447
Never heard of him.
He does most

178
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:46,948
of his business in Asia;
he just started

179
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,183
branching out
into North America.

180
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,384
What's he looking to buy?

181
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,152
Weapons-grade uranium.

182
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,323
You're serious.

183
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,624
Very.

184
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,694
Someone in the Russian
Syndicate smuggled nuclear

185
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,529
fuel rods out of the Ukraine.

186
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,198
They're planning on selling them
on the open market.

187
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,303
I... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

188
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,305
I don't, Renee.

189
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:11,873
But you can find out.

190
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:14,876
You're very well
connected.

191
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:18,413
I have always admired
your ambition,

192
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,415
but you're chasing
the devil.

193
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:21,916
Dealing AK-47s-

194
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,918
no one really cares.

195
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:26,888
But nuclear material?

196
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:29,290
But the profit is worth it.

197
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,028
You need money, huh?

198
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,064
You can always
come work for me.

199
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:39,434
No, I'm doing this so I don't
ever have to work for anyone.

200
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,370
Have a seat.

201
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,739
If I could find out...

202
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,143
...what would it be worth?

203
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,413
30% of the deal.

204
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,014
I don't have
to tell you,

205
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,883
that is more money than
you could possibly know

206
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,252
what to do with.

207
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:00,922
Look, Meier says these rods
are going to be sold soon,

208
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,524
so if we want
to make a counter bid,

209
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:04,058
it has to happen fast.

210
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,695
If you don't know anything, tell
me, so I can go somewhere else.

211
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,998
How well
do you know this man?

212
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:11,199
You trust him?

213
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,201
There's no one I trust more.

214
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:14,736
I've been with him
for two years.

215
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,771
What do you mean "with"?

216
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,406
It's professional.

217
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,877
Can you help us or not?

218
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,585
I'll make a few calls,

219
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,587
see what I can
find out.

220
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,189
But, uh,

221
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:35,890
I'm going to have
to meet this Meier.

222
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,258
And I need a good faith

223
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,260
payment up front.
How much?

224
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,395
Five million.

225
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,964
That's a lot of money, Vlad.

226
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:45,033
Look, I'm taking big risk
just making these calls.

227
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,267
Besides, 5 million is nothing

228
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,136
compared to what your
buyer will have to pay

229
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:50,805
for nuclear fuel rods.

230
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,807
Fine.

231
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,610
I'll ask him, but I can't
make any promises.

232
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,279
If he wants my help,
that's the price

233
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,114
of admission.
Okay.

234
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,450
There's a parking garage

235
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,118
on the corner of 12th
and Market Street.

236
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,988
Someone will meet him
there, on the roof.

237
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,557
Once the money is
in our account,

238
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,393
they'll bring him back here,
we will talk.

239
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:14,863
I'll give him a call.

240
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,533
It's good to see you.

241
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,939
You're going to make me
start losing sleep again.

242
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,710
I'll let you know
what Meier says.

243
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,679
I'll tell my men.

244
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,749
I'll give you privacy
for your call.

245
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,348
Jack, were you listening?

246
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,483
Yeah, we're ready to wire

247
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:09,551
the money to
his account.

248
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:10,652
When can you be there?

249
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,287
As soon as I finish
prepping my cover.

250
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:13,621
I'm almost at the
staging area.

251
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,590
30 minutes tops.

252
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:17,992
How you holding up?

253
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,761
It's hard to be
in the same room

254
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:21,496
with this
son of a bitch.

255
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:22,897
I can handle it.

256
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,199
I'll be there as
soon as I can.

257
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,068
Okay.

258
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:46,556
Don't worry, Oleg.

259
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,091
You're going to be fine.

260
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:51,094
It, uh... it might
help me if I knew

261
00:11:51,162 --> 00:11:52,929
exactly what happened
to your brother.

262
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:56,399
How did he get exposed
to weapons-grade uranium?

263
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,034
Don't worry about that.

264
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,969
Just make sure he lives.

265
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,406
(phone ringing)

266
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:08,978
It's him again, isn't it?

267
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:10,780
The second time he's called.

268
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:12,549
You should
answer it.

269
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,054
Hello?

270
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:19,489
Why aren't you
picking up your phone?

271
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:20,724
I called you twice.

272
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,292
Must have been
in the tunnel.

273
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,761
Ulana says you're not
at the house yet.

274
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,229
Where are you?
Stuck in traffic.

275
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:27,964
Tell her it's going
to be a while.

276
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:29,032
How's Oleg?

277
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
He's okay.

278
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,434
Sleeping.

279
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,737
Let me know when you
get to the house.

280
00:12:33,804 --> 00:12:35,305
I will.

281
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:38,308
It was him, wasn't it?

282
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,879
Hey.

283
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,314
Don't worry, okay?

284
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:45,949
By the time he finds out,

285
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,285
you'll already
have been treated.

286
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,087
Then it won't matter.

287
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:55,592
(knock on door)

288
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,527
Hey, it's just
your brother's test results.

289
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,464
Okay.

290
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:05,135
You say or do anything
that I don't like,

291
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,237
and my men will kill
your wife and daughter.

292
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:09,139
Open the door.

293
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:12,709
The blood work
you ordered, Doctor.

294
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:13,943
Thank you.

295
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:15,278
Uh, I noticed there was

296
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,147
no patient name.
Uh, yeah, you're right.

297
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,616
I forgot to put that down.
Oh, well, I can do it for you.

298
00:13:19,683 --> 00:13:20,650
No, I'll take care of it later.

299
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,519
Is everything okay, Doctor?

300
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,255
Fine.

301
00:13:25,322 --> 00:13:26,856
I'm just working a little later

302
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:28,992
than I expected.
Okay.

303
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,330
You did good.

304
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,965
What does it say?

305
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,404
Your brother has been exposed
to at least 400 rems,

306
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:42,605
and the chemical toxicity

307
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,307
of the radiation
is causing renal failure.

308
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,209
I know it's serious.

309
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:48,111
Can you help him or not?

310
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:49,679
He needs
a bone marrow transplant.

311
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,181
That requires
a six-man surgical team

312
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,515
in a fully equipped facility.

313
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,717
There has to be something
you can do

314
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:57,220
right here, right now.

315
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:58,855
There are some drugs
I could give him

316
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:00,290
that will help
flush out the radiation

317
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:01,825
and stimulate
white blood cell repair,

318
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:03,793
but that's a half measure.

319
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:04,961
I can't guarantee

320
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:06,396
he'll recover.

321
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:10,800
My brother is not going to die.

322
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:13,002
It's up to you, Doctor.

323
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:16,372
Now get to work.

324
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,217
Okay, got it.

325
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:30,220
That was CTU.

326
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,554
Your offshore
account's in place.

327
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,856
They're forwarding
instructions to your PDA

328
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:34,157
on how to wire
the money.

329
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:35,525
Excuse me.

330
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,494
I spoke
with Hastings.

331
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:38,862
He said, as soon
as you're under

332
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,431
and we have confirmation
that Laitanan can get us

333
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:43,366
to the nuclear rods,
we're pulling Renee Walker out.

334
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:44,868
That's right.

335
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,537
What's going on, Jack?

336
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:49,339
Hastings said something
about her being unstable.

337
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:51,040
I don't have time
to explain it.

338
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,575
Just follow my lead.

339
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,377
How do you want to work this
without breaking cover?

340
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,612
I don't know yet.

341
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,380
All right.
Well, I got two teams

342
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,781
running coordinated
drive-bys.

343
00:14:58,849 --> 00:14:59,883
They'll be ready to extract her

344
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,884
when she's clear.
No.

345
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:01,885
These guys own
this neighborhood.

346
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:02,919
They'll have eyes everywhere.

347
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:04,254
Your men
will run the risk

348
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,089
of being spotted.
I've done this before, Jack.

349
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,157
I ran an operation just
like it in Fallujah.

350
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:09,359
And I'm in command.

351
00:15:09,426 --> 00:15:11,327
You're going to do
exactly what I tell you.

352
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:12,762
RENEE (over comm):
Jack, stand by.

353
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,597
I hear him coming.

354
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,032
Laitanan's back.

355
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,267
I need to listen to this.

356
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,935
Excuse me.

357
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:21,938
(knock on door)

358
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:24,040
VLADIMIR:
Renee.

359
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:26,609
I spoke to my men.

360
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,545
Did you get your buyer
on the phone?

361
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:30,013
He agreed
to the money.

362
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,881
He'll be at the parking garage
in 20 minutes. Very good.

363
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,484
We have a little time
to catch up.

364
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,185
Do you still like
your single malts?

365
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:37,220
Uh, not right now.

366
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:38,388
You sure?
It's a 30 year.

367
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:40,089
No, thanks.

368
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,128
What you said earlier-
down at the river-

369
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,163
you were tired
of living,

370
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:49,165
wanted to die.

371
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:53,102
What happened to you?

372
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,637
It's not important.

373
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,739
It is to me.

374
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,908
Look, you don't have
to worry about it.

375
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:02,545
Once I make this deal,
none of it will matter.

376
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,180
Well, you're not the only one

377
00:16:04,248 --> 00:16:06,282
who's been suffering
these past few years.

378
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:13,723
It's hard for
me to admit,

379
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:16,092
but, uh...

380
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,996
I never forgave myself
for what I did to you.

381
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,901
It's in the past.

382
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:26,502
Forget it.

383
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,938
VLADIMIR (over comm):
I don't want to forget it.

384
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:31,207
I had too much
to drink that night,

385
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,976
I wasn't thinking clearly.

386
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,244
Wow.

387
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:37,647
Never heard you apologize
for anything.

388
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:39,482
It's definitely
a first.

389
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,150
Look, I'm just trying
to make things right.

390
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,219
You dot have to be
such a bitch about it.

391
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,088
Was I being a bitch?
Maybe I should apologize.

392
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,289
Oh, you're
something else.

393
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:48,124
You never back
down, do you?

394
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:53,930
I've missed our
little arguments.

395
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:05,508
You're still
nervous around me.

396
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:08,144
I shouldn't be surprised.

397
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,380
It's not you.

398
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:12,982
VLADIMIR:
Someone else?

399
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,517
RENEE:
No.

400
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,452
VLADIMIR:
What is it, then?

401
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,987
Look, I'm just...

402
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,389
I'm just nervous about the deal.

403
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,190
Could be a lot of money
at stake.

404
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,826
There's more for you here
than just money,

405
00:17:23,894 --> 00:17:25,728
if you want it.

406
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,597
Look...

407
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:31,768
I didn't come here
for this.

408
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:34,737
Really. All the people
you could've gone to,

409
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,372
you knocked on my door.

410
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,940
Because you're connected.

411
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:40,009
That's the only reason?
Yes.

412
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:41,978
I don't believe you.

413
00:17:42,046 --> 00:17:44,213
That's your problem.

414
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:45,615
You should watch
your tongue.

415
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:47,884
You might lose
it one day.

416
00:17:47,951 --> 00:17:51,387
Uh... you said
that I could get cleaned up.

417
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:54,657
Yeah.

418
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,259
Bathroom has a shower.

419
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,727
Thank you.
Yeah.

420
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,702
Agent Ortiz, we
need to move now.

421
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:07,603
Now!

422
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,106
(releases held breath,
breathes deeply)

423
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,553
Renee called her buyer.

424
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,189
He agreed to pay
the $5 million up front.

425
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,623
I want you
to meet with him.

426
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,758
Take a couple men.

427
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:29,926
This is a mistake, Vlad.

428
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:31,294
Getting involved
in nuclear arms-

429
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,263
it doesn't matter how
much money is at stake.

430
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,065
I have no intention

431
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,167
of pursuing this deal.
What do you mean?

432
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:40,269
When you've
picked up the buyer,

433
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:43,039
when the money has been
transferred into our account,

434
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:45,808
you kill him, put him
in the river, keep the money

435
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,543
for ourselves.

436
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,378
What about Renee?

437
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:54,751
She'll be working with us
from now on.

438
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,619
We are going to
kill her buyer.

439
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:58,988
She's not going to
be happy about that.

440
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,323
You heard what she said.

441
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,390
She's got nothing left.

442
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,792
Nowhere to go.
Desperate woman.

443
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:07,096
I give her reason to live.

444
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:08,931
Okay?

445
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,933
I'll take care of it.

446
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,965
President Hassan's
security forces-

447
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,867
they're still cracking
down on the opposition,

448
00:19:25,935 --> 00:19:27,068
and they're not showing

449
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:28,703
any signs
of letting up.

450
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:30,438
ETHAN:
I'm afraid your warning

451
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:32,607
to President Hassan
has fallen on deaf ears,

452
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:33,641
Madam President.

453
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:35,210
Who filmed this?

454
00:19:35,277 --> 00:19:36,578
Stringer for the BBC bought it
from an eyewitness.

455
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:39,147
And they've already seen it
on Downing Street.

456
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:40,949
That's why Ethan wanted you
to see this now.

457
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:43,218
The rumors have already started
that the British

458
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:46,321
are pulling out
as signatories to the accord.

459
00:19:46,388 --> 00:19:48,223
Then I need to talk
to the prime minister.

460
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,391
It's not just the British,
Madam President.

461
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,426
The Germans and Egyptians

462
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,827
are also positioning
themselves

463
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:54,729
to pull out, and if we
lose their support...

464
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:56,064
The peace deal

465
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:57,298
is dead.

466
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,501
Maybe if they understood
the circumstances-

467
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,403
that Hassan is trying
to prevent his brother

468
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,072
from acquiring a nuclear weapon.

469
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:05,206
With respect,
Madam President,

470
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:06,307
sharing that intelligence

471
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,042
with the delegates
might spread a panic.

472
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,280
You're right, but I still need
to buy some time.

473
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,953
Assemble the representatives

474
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,022
from every signatory country
attending the conference.

475
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:25,660
I want to appeal to them myself
to stay the course.

476
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:27,562
What about President Hassan?

477
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,564
Shouldn't we include him?

478
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:30,899
Not until I've taken
the temperature

479
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,000
of the other delegates.

480
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,836
I don't want
to push him too hard.

481
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,312
What is it?

482
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,514
As you requested,
these are backgrounds

483
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:48,416
on all the detainees.

484
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:50,652
Our security police have
completed their initial sweep

485
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,953
of the capital city.

486
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:53,755
65 known members of the
opposition have been arrested

487
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:55,189
and are being
questioned.

488
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:56,324
Have you learned anything?

489
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:58,960
Were any of them working
with my brother?

490
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:01,029
It's too early to tell.

491
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,368
What's wrong, sir?

492
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:11,606
One of the suspects...

493
00:21:11,674 --> 00:21:12,840
has family connections

494
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:15,476
to a member of my
delegation here at the UN.

495
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:16,678
Who?

496
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:18,446
Jamot.

497
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:19,714
They are cousins.

498
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,652
That doesn't mean that Jamot
is involved in any of this.

499
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,688
We need to make sure.

500
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:29,290
We'll check his phone records
and other recent activities

501
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:30,558
for any suspicious behavior.

502
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:32,193
Good.

503
00:21:32,261 --> 00:21:33,995
But I also want him
taken into custody.

504
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:35,363
Sir?

505
00:21:35,431 --> 00:21:36,531
Arrest him.

506
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:38,499
Take him to our embassy
for interrogation.

507
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:42,036
Mr. President, with respect,

508
00:21:42,104 --> 00:21:44,472
Jamot is a trusted member
of your inner circle.

509
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,874
The evidence against him
is purely circumstantial.

510
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:53,181
I trusted my brother as well.

511
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,551
Are you sure
this is what you want?

512
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,119
He is
a public official.

513
00:21:58,187 --> 00:21:59,554
It will not go
unnoticed.

514
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:00,855
I don't care!

515
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,326
I don't care what anyone thinks.

516
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:10,531
I was almost killed today.

517
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,866
Or have you forgotten?

518
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:15,236
I was in the car
with you, sir.

519
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:17,872
Then you should know
what needs to be done.

520
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,475
Yes, sir.

521
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:51,939
(clears throat)

522
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:59,313
ARLO:
Forget about me?

523
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:00,314
What?

524
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:01,449
My name's Arlo Glass.

525
00:23:01,517 --> 00:23:02,984
I'm one of your
coworkers at CTU.

526
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:04,152
You said you'd free up

527
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:06,387
some memory space on
the auxiliary servers.

528
00:23:06,455 --> 00:23:07,822
I'm getting to it.

529
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,724
In which century? We're in
the middle of an operation

530
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,259
and my aerial feed is
running in slow-motion.

531
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:14,429
It's next on my list, Arlo.

532
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:15,463
Where are you
going now?

533
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:16,464
To the bathroom.

534
00:23:16,532 --> 00:23:18,533
Is that okay with you?

535
00:23:22,004 --> 00:23:23,938
Hey, O'Brian,

536
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:25,573
you notice anything
weird about Dana?

537
00:23:25,641 --> 00:23:26,841
Miss Perfect?

538
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:27,842
She seems
distracted,

539
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,777
always making excuses to leave.

540
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:31,512
Maybe she's avoiding you.

541
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,947
What?
Well, that's what I would do

542
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:34,849
if someone were drooling
over me all day.

543
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,117
You're lucky she
hasn't reported you

544
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:37,151
to Human Resources.

545
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,319
If you weren't so jealous,

546
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,721
you'd see I was asking you
a serious question.

547
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,523
Oh, yeah, I'm jealous.

548
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:46,194
Please, won't you stare
at my ass as I walk away?

549
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:59,273
Thank you.

550
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,342
You're welcome.

551
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,182
Stay here.

552
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,427
This has the address
and schematic

553
00:24:19,495 --> 00:24:20,795
of the evidence lockup.

554
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:22,864
You'll go through
the southeast entrance.

555
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:25,800
This keycard
will get you access.

556
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:28,703
How do we find the money?

557
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,805
The evidence bins are numbered.

558
00:24:30,873 --> 00:24:33,841
You're looking for 4301.

559
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:36,144
This is a dedicated comm unit.

560
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:37,612
It's an earpiece; you'll
be able to hear me.

561
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,480
Do exactly
what I tell you to do

562
00:24:39,548 --> 00:24:40,481
and you'll be in and out.

563
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,916
No one will know
you were there.

564
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,355
Listen...

565
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:50,925
I help you do this
and you never call me again.

566
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:52,994
That's the deal, right?

567
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:57,865
Sure, Jen, that's the deal.

568
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:04,639
I'll call you
when we get to the lockup.

569
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,440
Okay.
Okay.

570
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:37,772
(water running, turns off)

571
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,382
You look thin.

572
00:25:49,418 --> 00:25:51,719
Be out in a minute.

573
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:54,555
I don't want to wait that long.

574
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:59,193
Vladimir, please,
just let me get dressed.

575
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:00,595
Why waste the energy?

576
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:03,164
I'll just have to get you
undressed all over again.

577
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,705
Look, I already told you
I didn't come here for this.

578
00:26:10,772 --> 00:26:13,507
That's what you say, but part
of you came here to see me.

579
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:14,609
Admit it.

580
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:16,777
RENEE:
There's nothing to admit.

581
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:19,547
VLADIMIR: Why is it so hard
for you to admit the truth?

582
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,883
You want this just
as much as I do.

583
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:24,552
I'm not going
to tell you again.

584
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,954
Leave me alone
and let me get dressed.

585
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,424
Come here.

586
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:34,629
I said come here.

587
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,268
(glass shatters)

588
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:43,237
Come here or get out.

589
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:46,107
I call my men
and the deal's off.

590
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:22,543
I'll, um... I'll take
that drink now.

591
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:26,180
Dry yourself off.

592
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:27,815
Come out when
you're ready.

593
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:43,964
JACK:
Renee, do you copy?

594
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,366
Yeah, Jack.

595
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:46,934
You don't have
to do this.

596
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:48,169
I've got a team
standing by.

597
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:49,537
We can get you
out of there now.

598
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:52,973
Where would that leave us?

599
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,575
I've got to stay under.

600
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:58,612
We'll find another way.

601
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,316
There is no other way.

602
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:05,853
Renee, don't do this.

603
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,021
Renee...

604
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:08,289
Go meet Vlad's men.

605
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:09,724
I'll see you when you get here.

606
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,092
Why won't you listen
to me?

607
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:12,059
I'm going dark.

608
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:13,361
Renee, wai...

609
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:43,502
These arrests are making
it very difficult

610
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,737
for my government
to continue

611
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:46,005
to support the
peace agreement.

612
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:47,306
President Hassan

613
00:28:47,374 --> 00:28:49,609
can't ignore the repercussions
of what he's doing.

614
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:51,110
I know President Hassan.

615
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:53,446
He is a rational man,
a good man.

616
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:55,081
There must be a reason
for these actions,

617
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:56,983
and I'm not just speaking
as his delegate

618
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,184
but as his friend.

619
00:28:58,251 --> 00:28:59,685
Well, as his friend,
you need to let him know

620
00:28:59,753 --> 00:29:03,389
that my government is not the
only one with grave concerns.

621
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:05,024
This conference is at
risk of falling apart...

622
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:06,826
Excuse me,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

623
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:09,195
Mr. Jamot, may I speak
with you privately?

624
00:29:09,262 --> 00:29:10,363
Yes, of course.

625
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,364
Excuse me.

626
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:12,365
Of course.

627
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:14,867
What is it?

628
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:16,302
I've been ordered
to escort you

629
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,937
to the embassy to
answer some questions.

630
00:29:18,005 --> 00:29:20,239
Regarding?

631
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:21,440
An internal
security matter.

632
00:29:21,508 --> 00:29:23,609
Please come with us.

633
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:24,944
Well, I-I would like

634
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:26,312
to know
what this is about.

635
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,080
We'll explain everything
to you at the embassy, sir.

636
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:29,115
Well, it will have to wait.

637
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:30,349
I am about to go
into a meeting.

638
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:32,251
It cannot wait, sir.

639
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,721
We need to go
right now.

640
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:41,861
Are you arresting me?

641
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:44,930
It would be best
if we kept this discreet.

642
00:29:44,998 --> 00:29:47,566
This is outrageous.

643
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:49,068
I demand to speak
with President Hassan.

644
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:52,204
President Hassan is the one
who gave this order.

645
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:54,607
I will not
ask you again.

646
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:56,809
Come with us.

647
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,215
Very well.

648
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:04,250
Take him
to the car.

649
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:06,318
I'll be
right there.

650
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:13,292
Is everything all right?

651
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,427
Everything is fine, sir.

652
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:15,695
Please excuse me.

653
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:24,870
(phone rings)

654
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:26,072
Hello.

655
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:27,940
It's me. Are you alone? Yes.

656
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:29,975
What's wrong?
You sound upset.

657
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:31,210
I didn't want
to burden you with this,

658
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,012
but I need to speak
with you about your father.

659
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:36,749
What is it?

660
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:38,617
I have to go to the embassy
right now.

661
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:42,521
I'll meet you in private
when I get back.

662
00:30:42,589 --> 00:30:44,990
You're going to give him
vindesine twice daily,

663
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:46,325
morning and night.

664
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,094
Inject it right into
the I.V. bag,

665
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:50,429
just like I'm doing.

666
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:52,431
You're going to want
to be careful.

667
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:53,532
Radiation poisoning

668
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,802
is transferable
through bodily fluids.

669
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,537
Are you paying attention?

670
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:00,506
Yes, I see.

671
00:31:00,574 --> 00:31:03,843
He's also going to get
cisplatin every other day,

672
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,511
but he can take
that in pill form.

673
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:08,314
I'm going to give you
three weeks' worth.

674
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:10,316
How will I know
if he's getting better?

675
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:13,119
If the treatment's working, his
symptoms will begin to subside

676
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:15,554
in seven to ten days.

677
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,024
We're going to be
leaving soon.

678
00:31:19,092 --> 00:31:20,726
Where? To the country house.

679
00:31:20,794 --> 00:31:22,394
The doctor's giving me

680
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:23,929
everything I need
to treat y.

681
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,164
You're going
to get better, Oleg.

682
00:31:25,232 --> 00:31:27,199
(knocking on door)

683
00:31:27,267 --> 00:31:31,403
That's the nurse with
the rest of the medicine.

684
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,617
(gunshot)

685
00:31:44,684 --> 00:31:47,686
Throw down
your weapon, Josef.

686
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:52,458
Do what I said.

687
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:54,760
Don't make this worse
than it is.

688
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,767
Drop it!

689
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,909
You son of a bitch.

690
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:12,678
Who else knows about
Oleg's sickness?

691
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:14,713
Who else knows?

692
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:15,714
Just the doctor.

693
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:16,715
Are you sure?

694
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:17,716
I'm sure.

695
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:18,851
Undo him.

696
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:24,390
Hey, wait, stop.

697
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:26,025
What are you doing?
Your father sent us

698
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:27,593
to bring you home.

699
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:29,562
Now, Josef.
OLEG: Josef...

700
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:30,963
it's okay.

701
00:32:31,031 --> 00:32:32,231
Just do what he says.

702
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:39,438
I have him.

703
00:32:45,345 --> 00:32:47,446
We found them.

704
00:32:47,514 --> 00:32:48,480
Where were they?

705
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:50,249
A clinic in Mount Vernon.

706
00:32:50,317 --> 00:32:52,117
How many people found out
about Oleg?

707
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:53,752
Only one- a doctor-

708
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,987
but we've
taken care of him.

709
00:32:55,055 --> 00:32:56,288
Nobody will know
we were here.

710
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:57,423
Good.

711
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,091
Now, bring my
sons to me.

712
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:00,392
<i>Da.</i>

713
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:03,963
Let's go.

714
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,457
Meier?

715
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:33,525
That's right.

716
00:33:34,728 --> 00:33:36,228
You are from Germany.

717
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:37,830
Bremen.

718
00:33:37,898 --> 00:33:40,633
But I grew up traveling
with my father.

719
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:43,636
(speaking German)

720
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,041
Are we going to do business
or not?

721
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:23,475
Where is the $5 million?

722
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:25,978
You don't see any money
until I talk to Laitanan.

723
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:27,880
If you
have questions,

724
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:29,014
ask me.

725
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:30,649
I don't want to talk to you.

726
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,786
Get him on the phone
or I drive away.

727
00:34:33,853 --> 00:34:35,421
Now.

728
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:47,533
(phone rings)

729
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:50,336
Yes?

730
00:34:50,403 --> 00:34:51,737
LUGO:
Meier is here.

731
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,472
He won't transfer
the money

732
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,307
until he speaks
with you first.

733
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:57,810
Put him on.

734
00:35:01,715 --> 00:35:03,582
This is Meier.

735
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,950
Yes, Mr. Meier.

736
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:06,385
What's the problem?

737
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:08,287
After you
get your money,

738
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,489
how long till I get
my information?

739
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:12,424
Not very long; I just
have to make a few calls.

740
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:13,826
No more than an hour.

741
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:14,960
Where is Renee?

742
00:35:15,028 --> 00:35:17,129
She's busy.

743
00:35:17,197 --> 00:35:18,630
I would like
to talk to her.

744
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:20,566
VLADIMIR: You can see
her when you get here.

745
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:21,967
We have nothing
more to discuss

746
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:23,035
until the money's
in place.

747
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:24,403
Now, get Lugo
on the phone.

748
00:35:25,438 --> 00:35:27,172
Fine.

749
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:33,779
Go ahead.

750
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:36,015
Once the money is confirmed
into our account,

751
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:38,117
you know what to do.

752
00:35:38,184 --> 00:35:40,386
Yes.

753
00:35:41,554 --> 00:35:44,089
I need your account number.

754
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:55,701
JACK:
I'm transferring the money

755
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:57,569
through multiple accounts
so it can't be traced.

756
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:59,605
This will take
a moment.

757
00:35:59,672 --> 00:36:01,507
We'll wait.

758
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,729
Is it done?

759
00:36:17,797 --> 00:36:19,164
Not yet.

760
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,866
My partner's good
for the money, Vladimir.

761
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:22,501
You should be making calls,

762
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:23,568
tracking down
the rods.

763
00:36:23,636 --> 00:36:25,036
I'm not going
to make any calls,

764
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:26,972
'cause there isn't going
to be any deal

765
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,039
with your partner.

766
00:36:28,107 --> 00:36:29,474
What are you talking about?

767
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:32,911
Once we have the money...

768
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:34,012
it's over.

769
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,247
We don't need him anymore.

770
00:36:35,314 --> 00:36:37,382
And we'll be
$5 million richer.

771
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,017
You son of a bitch.

772
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:40,752
Hey, I'm not a fool, Renee.
I'm not about

773
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,654
to get involved with the kind
of people who traffic

774
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,689
in nuclear arms. Okay, Vladimir,
listen, you can't do this.

775
00:36:44,757 --> 00:36:46,558
Why? This man
mean something to you?

776
00:36:46,626 --> 00:36:48,627
No, but I worked for more
than a year to make this deal.

777
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:50,896
I'm not just going to let it go
because you don't have the guts

778
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,397
to see it through.
Hey, this isn't about guts.

779
00:36:52,465 --> 00:36:53,431
This is about being smart.

780
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:54,533
Really?

781
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,134
Is it smart
to keep selling small arms

782
00:36:56,202 --> 00:36:57,335
for the rest of your life?

783
00:36:57,403 --> 00:36:58,870
I bring you the score
of a lifetime,

784
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,071
and you just piss it away?

785
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:01,106
For what- for $5 million?

786
00:37:01,174 --> 00:37:02,641
How long is that
going to last you?

787
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:03,675
Long enough.

788
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:05,844
You're more
than all this.

789
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:07,546
I know it.

790
00:37:07,613 --> 00:37:10,115
It's why I brought this deal
to you.

791
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:13,752
We can do this.

792
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,987
Together.

793
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:19,858
Once we've made the deal
and we have the money,

794
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:21,927
we can be together.

795
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:25,764
We could start over.

796
00:37:25,832 --> 00:37:28,700
Make our own moves.

797
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:31,203
But I need my buyer.

798
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,305
Alive.

799
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:38,543
Sorry.

800
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,779
This is the
way I want it.

801
00:37:40,847 --> 00:37:42,013
You'll see.

802
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:43,849
It's for the best.

803
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:47,786
What are you doing?

804
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:50,088
Making a call.

805
00:37:50,156 --> 00:37:52,090
Put down the phone.

806
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:54,426
I said put it down!

807
00:37:57,797 --> 00:37:59,631
Don't ever
go against me!

808
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:04,269
Renee, you should
know that by now.

809
00:38:04,337 --> 00:38:06,304
Okay?!

810
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:30,562
How much longer?

811
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,098
It's almost done.

812
00:38:37,803 --> 00:38:39,337
There.

813
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:44,075
The money's in
your account.

814
00:38:44,143 --> 00:38:45,243
LUGO:
Thank you,

815
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:46,411
Mr. Meier.

816
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:48,647
(gunshots)

817
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:55,287
Drop the weapon.
Now! Drop it!

818
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,060
You really think
I'm that stupid?

819
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:04,229
That I'd come
here alone?

820
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:06,197
Call your man. Do it!

821
00:39:10,169 --> 00:39:12,771
Give me the phone.

822
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,839
(phone ringing)

823
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,976
I see we have the money.

824
00:39:18,044 --> 00:39:19,611
Is Meier dead?

825
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:21,680
Not exactly, but I've just
taken out three of your men,

826
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:23,782
and I'm ready
to take out the fourth.

827
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:25,083
Meier.

828
00:39:25,151 --> 00:39:27,919
You really think you can
roll me for $5 million?

829
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:29,621
Where's Renee?

830
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:31,489
She's right here. She's fine.

831
00:39:31,557 --> 00:39:33,458
I want proof now!

832
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:36,695
Say something to your partner.

833
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:38,596
Meier, are you okay?

834
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,366
Satisfied?

835
00:39:41,434 --> 00:39:43,802
Renee told me you were ready
to take your organization

836
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:44,803
to the next level.

837
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,971
Apparently, she was wrong.

838
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:47,172
Not necessarily.

839
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:49,107
I'm willing to reconsider
the situation.

840
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:51,509
The only thing you should
consider yourself is lucky.

841
00:39:51,577 --> 00:39:53,378
And I still want
this deal to happen.

842
00:39:53,446 --> 00:39:54,813
Otherwise,
you'd be dead.

843
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,948
You try something like this
again, we're going to war,

844
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:58,683
and that's the last
thing you want.

845
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,119
Let me talk to my man.

846
00:40:01,187 --> 00:40:02,120
Fine.

847
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:04,189
(breathing heavily)

848
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,625
Yes?

849
00:40:07,693 --> 00:40:09,894
Bring him back here.

850
00:40:09,962 --> 00:40:11,629
Are you sure?

851
00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:13,298
Yeah.

852
00:40:17,203 --> 00:40:18,837
He wants to see you.

853
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:20,605
Get up.

854
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:28,813
Move to the driver's-side door.

855
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,582
Slowly.

856
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:41,092
Get in.

857
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,936
I'm sorry, Oleg.

858
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:55,006
(footsteps approaching)

859
00:40:55,074 --> 00:40:56,408
Leave us.

860
00:41:03,449 --> 00:41:05,550
I couldn't let him die.

861
00:41:05,618 --> 00:41:06,684
He's my brother.

862
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:09,554
And he's my son.

863
00:41:09,622 --> 00:41:11,756
Do you think this
is any easier for me?

864
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:13,892
It would've worked.

865
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:15,627
The doctor was treating him.

866
00:41:15,694 --> 00:41:18,129
You disobeyed me, Josef.
You put this family

867
00:41:18,197 --> 00:41:19,397
at risk.

868
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:21,366
<i>You put this family
at risk when you sent</i>

869
00:41:21,434 --> 00:41:23,401
those men into the clinic.
They killed

870
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:24,803
three people!

871
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,271
What do you think's
gonna happen when

872
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:27,739
the police start
to investigate?!

873
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:32,277
Who are you to question
my judgment?

874
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:34,245
You are my first-born.

875
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:35,980
You, of all people,
should give me respect.

876
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:38,583
I do respect you.

877
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:39,951
But this time you're wrong.

878
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,321
The doctor said that
Oleg could be treated.

879
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:45,590
He showed me how!

880
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:47,058
All we need is

881
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:49,127
the medicine!

882
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:51,463
There are rules, Josef.

883
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,497
(grunts)

884
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:53,998
They are simple rules.

885
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,267
(Josef grunts)

886
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:58,670
And they must never be broken!
Never endanger

887
00:41:58,737 --> 00:42:00,939
the family; never.

888
00:42:01,006 --> 00:42:02,774
And never disobey an order
from your father.

889
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:05,844
Papa... (speaks Russian)

890
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:08,113
JOSEF:
No, please,

891
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,247
No, please.

892
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:11,216
You made me do this, Josef.

893
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:14,152
Please. Please don't.

894
00:42:18,357 --> 00:42:19,724
I'm sorry, my son.

895
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,467
Get up.

896
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:32,303
Get up!

897
00:42:34,406 --> 00:42:36,441
Now, call Father Gregor.

898
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:38,743
He'll pray over Oleg.

899
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:42,380
When he's finished,
we'll bury your brother.

900
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:50,822
Never disobey me again.

901
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,225
