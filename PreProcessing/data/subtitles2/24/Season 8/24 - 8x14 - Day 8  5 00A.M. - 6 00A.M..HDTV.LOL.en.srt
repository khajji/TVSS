1
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,508
There's an irk splinter cell
trying to smuggle weapons-Grade

2
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:16,680
Uranium into the city.

3
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,349
Just read the threat assessment.

4
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:19,797
Look, i need you to shut down
all bridge and tunnel traffic

5
00:00:19,844 --> 00:00:21,073
Into the city.

6
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:23,552
where'd he go?

7
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:25,010
There's only one way
for them to get in.

8
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:27,806
Across the east river.
That's right.

9
00:00:27,873 --> 00:00:29,811
Ctu was just hit by an emp.

10
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,783
All of our systems are down.
It's a real mess.

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,984
Where's jack?

12
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,819
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

13
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:36,087
We need to find him.

14
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:38,322
You need to get ctu
back on line as soon as you can.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,489
Once you acquire
jack's position,

16
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:40,658
You can direct me to him.

17
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,662
I have a faster way
to get us back on line.

18
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,198
They won't listen.
then you need

19
00:00:44,266 --> 00:00:45,200
To make them listen, chloe.

20
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:46,703
Do what you have to do.

21
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:49,538
Frank haynam, senior engineer
at the new york field office.

22
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:51,675
I hope that you're here to help,
because we can damn well use it.

23
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:53,299
You going in through
the clr processor?

24
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,179
That's right. We're gonna
create a brand-New subnet.

25
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,514
That'll take forever.

26
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:58,349
I think
i can create a workaround.

27
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,150
Why not tap directly
into the trunk line?

28
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:02,051
What i'm suggesting
will be a lot faster.

29
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,220
I'm here to clean up your mess.
You need to leave.

30
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:05,487
You get out.

31
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:06,922
Get out!

32
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:12,794
We got power to comm.

33
00:01:12,861 --> 00:01:13,995
Load the rods into the zodiac.

34
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:15,295
<i>It'll be short work</i>

35
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:18,098
<i>Once we get the rods
across the river.</i>

36
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:19,564
a vehicle is coming.

37
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,298
<i>wait until the suv's in range,</i>

38
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:22,866
<i>Then take them out.</i>

39
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,034
Get down! Now!

40
00:01:28,738 --> 00:01:31,240
I've got two men
leaving the doc in a boat.

41
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:33,141
They're carrying a box
the right size and shape

42
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,209
For the rods, jack.

43
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:44,585
Jack, i got through to ctu.

44
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:45,920
They just got back on line.

45
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:47,188
Nypd's sending choppers.

46
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:48,456
We still got a real good shot
of finding them.

47
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:50,124
oh, god.

48
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,593
I know you're involved
with that robbery, miss walsh.

49
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:54,761
What?

50
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:56,062
<i>You are out of your mind.</i>

51
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,597
I'm not leaving here
until i know the truth.

52
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:07,073
Ctu is back on line.

53
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,274
I know.

54
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:10,609
Their helicopter's
searching the river.

55
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:11,943
They're getting close.

56
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,778
We're going to need your help
getting clear.

57
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:15,410
I will get you
out of there.

58
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:18,478
Stand by. I'll call you
in a few minutes.

59
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,785
You have grade iii
level bruising.

60
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,454
Are you sure you don't
want any painkillers?

61
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,722
They're wrapped tight.
They'll be fine.

62
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,990
I can't know
if the ribs

63
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,191
Are broken without an x-Ray.

64
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,493
You should see a doctor.

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,628
Any more stress could cause
the lung to collapse.

66
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,263
Trust me,
they're not broken. Thanks.

67
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:45,565
Renee: are you sure
you're okay?

68
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,099
Fine.

69
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,135
Where are we at
with the fuel rods?

70
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,603
We found the zodiac
partly submerged

71
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,337
In the river
near 11th street, empty.

72
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,439
The rods are
in manhattan, jack.

73
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,841
It's not over yet.

74
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,308
Ctu doesn't think we're more
than a few minutes behind.

75
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:58,476
Who's running the ground op? Cole?
Yeah.

76
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:00,478
Okay, i want you
to contact chloe.

77
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,312
Get her to download archival
photos from 11th and the river.

78
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,314
Have her date 'em
back 15 minutes.

79
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:06,249
Fire it up. I want you ready
to go as soon as

80
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:08,251
We've got a target.

81
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:17,792
Sir, just spoke to a witness
who said he saw four men

82
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,993
Unloading the contents of a
metal crate into a yellow cab.

83
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:21,161
He didn't get a plate.

84
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:22,529
Chloe, can we roll back
satellite?

85
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:24,297
We can now. Nsa
just rerouted them.

86
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:26,132
I'm logging onto
their server now.

87
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:31,636
This is from
one minute ago.

88
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:36,039
I'm rolling back in
30 second increments.

89
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:38,373
This is from six
minutes ago.

90
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:39,674
Find them
in real time, chloe.

91
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,776
Arlo, alert nypd. Dana?

92
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:43,144
Right here, sir.
Contact hazmat

93
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,512
And nest teams,
get them mobilized.

94
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,880
Right on that.

95
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:47,981
Almost there, sir.

96
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:49,349
okay, i'm live.

97
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,150
Suspects are proceeding
west on 14th street.

98
00:03:52,218 --> 00:03:53,518
Cole did you get that?

99
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:54,986
Yes, sir.
On the move.

100
00:03:57,089 --> 00:04:00,624
they've located you
on satellite.

101
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:01,992
How far away are they?

102
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,493
Not very. Hold on.

103
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:05,294
Arlo: nypd confirms
they have units on the way.

104
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:06,862
Hastings: how far out?
Ten blocks

105
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,664
Coming from the north.
Head to the south.

106
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:11,666
Turn left.

107
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:18,606
Suspect just turned
south on seventh.

108
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,173
Got it.

109
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,612
I hear sirens.
Hurry up.

110
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,146
Just a second.

111
00:04:28,214 --> 00:04:30,081
I'm inserting
the machine code now.

112
00:04:30,148 --> 00:04:31,348
Just get ready.

113
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:35,918
Satellite will be disabled
for 30 seconds.

114
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:37,320
On my mark.

115
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,025
Go.

116
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:46,192
What happened?

117
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,393
The trunk line just went out.

118
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,861
Get it back!

119
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,569
Cole, we just lost picture.
Last known location--

120
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,430
Seventh and waverly.
Copy that.

121
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:02,370
Where are you now?

122
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,438
On the hudson,
heading uptown again.

123
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:05,940
You'll run into ninth avenue.

124
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,875
You'll be able to blend
into cab traffic there.

125
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:20,650
Back up.

126
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:22,385
Cab's gone.

127
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:24,654
Find it!
Scanning.

128
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:25,889
Arlo, help me
widen the grid.

129
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,490
You take west of seventh,
i'll take east.

130
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:28,657
Widening it now.

131
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:30,192
anything?

132
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,226
Not yet.

133
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:32,493
You, chloe?

134
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,195
No. We were out for 30 seconds.
They could be anywhere.

135
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,963
Cole, we're back up,
but we lost them.

136
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,798
I'll have nypd cordon off
the area.

137
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:39,032
You have them check

138
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,800
Every garage, warehouse,
loading dock.

139
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,035
They must have pulled in
somewhere.

140
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,203
Yes, sir.

141
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,271
Get me the president.

142
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:47,807
Are we clear?

143
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,041
Yes.

144
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,809
Good. We're moving
the weapon into place

145
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:52,911
As soon as it
is assembled.

146
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,813
I need you to send me nypd
patrol patterns and checkpoints.

147
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,114
As soon as it's safe.

148
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,281
That's not good enough.

149
00:05:58,349 --> 00:05:59,749
I need them now.

150
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,784
My instructions
were to help you,

151
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,385
Not jeopardize my cover.

152
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:06,720
I will call you back
when i can.

153
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:10,957
Madam president,
i'm afraid i have bad news.

154
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,627
Despite our best efforts,

155
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:16,162
The terrorists have gotten
the nuclear rods into manhattan.

156
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,096
How good
is your intelligence?

157
00:06:18,164 --> 00:06:19,360
Are you sure?

158
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,527
We are, sir.

159
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:21,993
In fact we had a visual
on the suspects

160
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:23,161
Until a few moments ago.

161
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:24,262
What happened?

162
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,630
We lost them.

163
00:06:25,697 --> 00:06:28,133
We're launching a
multiagency search

164
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:29,969
In the area we
think they're in.

165
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,638
<i>That you think they're in?</i>

166
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,473
Will you be able
to find them, or not?

167
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,274
We're doing everything
in our power, mr. Kanin,

168
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,608
But right now i don't
have an answer for you.

169
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:44,046
Madam president, i'm sorry
to have to tell you this...

170
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:48,782
I can no longer guarantee
the safety of manhattan.

171
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,885
How the hell
could this happen?!

172
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,820
Ctu had one priority: to make
sure this didn't happen!

173
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:56,155
It's unacceptable!

174
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:58,690
Mr. Hastings, i want you
to consider the entire resources

175
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:00,258
Of the government
at your disposal.

176
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:03,094
Whatever help you need,
we must find those rods.

177
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,929
I understand, madam president.

178
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,964
We also need to
prepare for the worst.

179
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:09,199
I want all branches of
local law enforcement ready

180
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:12,067
To respond to an imminent
radiological attack.

181
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:14,301
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:16,803
Ethan, set up a situation room

183
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,036
And assemble
the national security team.

184
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,806
Has president hassan

185
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:26,640
Been evacuated from the un yet?

186
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,108
He will be shortly,
but as of right now,

187
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:29,342
He's still at the un.

188
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,180
Get me jack bauer.

189
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:39,285
Yeah, but how long
was the satellite was down?

190
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:40,486
What, 30 seconds?

191
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:41,986
Yeah. I know what
you're thinking, jack.

192
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:45,021
Odd we lost the feed just as we
were closing in on the target.

193
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,056
Who was running point at ctu?

194
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,992
Chloe o'brian.
You know her from before, right?

195
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:50,593
yes.
And you trust her?

196
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:51,861
With my life.

197
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,129
Mr. Bauer, i have
president taylor for you.

198
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:56,064
Cole, i've got to call you back.

199
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:57,798
I got the white house
on the line.

200
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:58,965
Hello?

201
00:07:59,033 --> 00:08:00,966
Jack, it's president taylor.

202
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,633
I'm calling to ask you a favor.

203
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:03,900
Anything, ma'am.

204
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,802
President hassan and his family
are being evacuated

205
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,204
From the un and brought here,
and i would like

206
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:10,006
For you to supervise
that operation.

207
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,207
With all due respect,
madam president,

208
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,175
I think i'd be much more helpful
staying in place

209
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,677
Here with
ctu. Besides,

210
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,511
Secret service
is more than capable.

211
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,848
Well, that may be true,
but i'd feel a lot better

212
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,150
Knowing you were on the job.

213
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:22,752
Jack, in light
of the threat to new york,

214
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,986
President hassan's role

215
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:27,055
In securing a lasting peace
is more crucial than ever.

216
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,690
I need him safe.

217
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,858
I understand, ma'am.

218
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,159
I'll leave
for the un immediately.

219
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,427
Thank you, jack.

220
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:34,261
I'll see you when you get here.

221
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:35,463
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,431
She wants me
to supervise hassan's evac

223
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,999
To mcguire air force base.

224
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,267
All right, let's go.

225
00:08:40,335 --> 00:08:41,735
Renee.

226
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,371
Renee, i need to do this
on my own.

227
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:45,939
We're not going
through this again.

228
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,408
I'm coming with you,
end of discussion.

229
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,371
Do you have the rods?

230
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,739
In the trunk.

231
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:34,207
Where is ali?

232
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:36,509
He didn't make it.

233
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,777
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,579
Tarin will take his place
as driver.

235
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,414
How long before
the device is functional?

236
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:45,782
All we have to do
is load in the fuel rods.

237
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:48,984
Tarin.

238
00:09:51,821 --> 00:09:53,587
Get ready to leave.

239
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:55,087
I want to place the bomb

240
00:09:55,155 --> 00:09:57,022
As soon after i talk
to the president as possible.

241
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,575
agent o'connor.

242
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:32,110
Jack bauer.
I know who you are, sir.

243
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:33,778
I've been briefed
by command at mcguire.

244
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:34,946
Ms. Walker.

245
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,247
Agent o'connor.

246
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:37,549
We're cleared
for a subterranean evacuation.

247
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,917
The feeling is
that president hassan

248
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,552
Will be safer
underground in the event

249
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Of a radiological attack.
Agreed.

250
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:44,055
How many agents?
There are seven secret service,

251
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:45,956
Including myself, two of
hassan's internal security,

252
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,591
And now you and ms. Walker.

253
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,159
What's the time frame?
Ten minutes.

254
00:10:49,226 --> 00:10:50,993
There's a service tunnel
that runs parallel

255
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:52,561
To the path lines
leading into new jersey.

256
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,129
We're just waiting
on the vehicles now.

257
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,231
I'd like to see the exact route.
Of course.

258
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,599
I have the maps
and evac protocols

259
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,867
In the conference room,

260
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:00,468
But president hassan is asking
to see you first.

261
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,669
He's in the council chamber.

262
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:03,671
Fine. You two get started.

263
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:05,906
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

264
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,113
Sir.

265
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:18,883
Mr. Bauer.

266
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,785
President taylor
wanted me to supervise

267
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:22,119
The evacuation
of you and your family

268
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:23,453
To mcguire air force base.

269
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:24,788
So i'm told.

270
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:25,990
And i'm glad for it.

271
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:27,225
How long will it take for you

272
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:29,327
And your family to be ready?
We're ready now.

273
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,161
My wife and daughter
are in the residence

274
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:32,496
Awaiting your instructions.

275
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:33,764
Give us ten minutes

276
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:35,132
And then we'll evacuate you
and your family

277
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:36,366
Through a service tunnel
under the building

278
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,135
And straight on to new jersey.

279
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:42,439
And here i thought i would be
leaving the united nations today

280
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:45,909
At the head of a peace march
down fifth avenue.

281
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:48,845
My president still thinks
that might happen, sir.

282
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:52,282
I hope she's right, mr. Bauer.

283
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,718
Me, too, mr. President.

284
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,155
Give us ten minutes.

285
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,331
We need to talk about
a response, madam president.

286
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,132
I've prepared three

287
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,633
Retaliatory
strike scenarios

288
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:12,834
Against targets inside the irk.

289
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:14,202
do i need to remind you,

290
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,039
General brucker,
the islamic republic

291
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,608
Is an ally?

292
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,774
You don't.
But what good is an ally

293
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,108
If its citizens can

294
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:22,876
Attack us
on their own?

295
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,210
Madam president,

296
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:25,977
A call's come into
the white house switchboard

297
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,007
From a man claiming to be in
possession of the nuclear rods.

298
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:29,908
He wants
to talk to you.

299
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:32,511
Do we believe
he's who he says he is?

300
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,745
Confidence is high, ma'am.

301
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:35,245
He's offered details

302
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,313
Of recent events that no civilian
could know, plus he's

303
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,981
On an anonymous icc
channel that's scrambled

304
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:40,248
And impossible to trace.

305
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:42,216
Put him on speaker.

306
00:12:48,322 --> 00:12:50,222
This is president taylor.

307
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,923
Good morning,
madam president.

308
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:54,192
This is going to be
a short conversation.

309
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,161
Who are you
and what do you want?

310
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:58,364
You know i have
the fuel rods.

311
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,766
You know i got them
into manhattan.

312
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:03,035
What i want now
is to convince you

313
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,905
That i have no desire to
harm innocent americans.

314
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:09,374
And yet you're
threatening them with a bomb.

315
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,743
Actually, a radiological
dispersal device,

316
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:14,279
Madam president,
capable of contaminating

317
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:15,747
40 square blocks under
a dense radiation cloud.

318
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:18,549
Any attack
on the united states

319
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,885
Will prompt a retaliation
against your country.

320
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:23,620
I would expect
nothing less.

321
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,421
But you should
listen to me.

322
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:29,392
What i'm asking
for is simple.

323
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,061
Turn over
president hassan.

324
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:34,198
What?

325
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:36,034
He's a traitor to his people
and must stand trial

326
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:38,036
For his crimes.

327
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:40,038
That will never happen.

328
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:44,176
You have exactly one hour
to change your mind.

329
00:13:44,244 --> 00:13:46,078
Mr. Woods knows
how to contact me.

330
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:48,881
Madam president...

331
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,150
The clock starts now.

332
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,221
40 squares blocks--
How many people is that?

333
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:58,758
Between a 100,000 and 150,000.

334
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:00,627
Rob, inform

335
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:03,329
Ctu of the threat,
but the ransom demand

336
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:05,264
Stays in this room.

337
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,997
Tim, call up
the new york guard

338
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,732
To support first
responders,

339
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,634
And have the military
police execute

340
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:13,769
An evacuation plan.
Yes, ma'am.

341
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,970
Madam president?
What is it, rob?

342
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:18,805
Well, i'm just going to say it.

343
00:14:18,873 --> 00:14:20,473
We should consider
the alternative.

344
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,308
What alternative?

345
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:24,076
We have an out here.

346
00:14:24,144 --> 00:14:25,677
I think we should take it.
You mean, give in

347
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,479
He demand to turn over

348
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,047
President hassan?
No one man

349
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:30,615
Is worth the lives
of tens of thousands.

350
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,049
And you know what? I bet

351
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:33,392
He would agree.
Madam president,

352
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:35,106
are we really having
This conversation?

353
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,787
Doesn't it
Deserve a conversation?

354
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,921
Not unless you're intent
on destroying

355
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:40,423
Our moral authority.

356
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,159
This country's unique place
among nations, maybe forever.

357
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,528
As opposed to what?
The irradiation

358
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:47,296
Of all those people?

359
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,032
Real businesses,
real homes

360
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,335
Uninhabitable
for a hundred years or more?

361
00:14:58,243 --> 00:14:59,644
Madam president,

362
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:01,780
I agree.

363
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:03,148
Giving up hassan is wrong,

364
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:05,317
But a 40-Block wasteland
at the heart of new york city

365
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:06,919
Is unthinkable.

366
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,436
This country would
never be the same.

367
00:15:08,437 --> 00:15:10,690
The country would Crucify us
if word ever got out

368
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:12,025
That this could
have been avoided.

369
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,493
Now we're talking politics,
for god's sake?

370
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,896
We're talking about the primary
role of government--

371
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:18,031
Any government-- Which is

372
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:20,868
To protect its citizens.
It could also escalate,

373
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,169
Madam president.

374
00:15:22,237 --> 00:15:23,637
They attack us,

375
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,740
We attack them back.

376
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:28,042
The entire region could be
drawn into the conflict

377
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,911
And destabilized.
Excuse me, general,

378
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,546
But weren't you the one
just advocating

379
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:33,382
For a retaliatory strike?

380
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:34,750
Well, in the military,

381
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:37,019
We like to talk about facts
on the ground.

382
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:39,689
Well, they have changed,
madam president.

383
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:42,425
Now, we have
a viable option.

384
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,028
Viable?

385
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:47,597
Is that the sense
in the room then?

386
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:49,399
That surrendering

387
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,767
President hassan
is somehow viable?

388
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,835
In the first place,

389
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:57,071
The people who are offering us
this deal cannot be trusted.

390
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:59,172
How do we know they won't
detonate the bomb anyway?

391
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,074
Secondly, president hassan

392
00:16:01,142 --> 00:16:03,410
Is a guest of this country.

393
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,113
He is my partner in peace.

394
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:07,715
And i will not sell him out

395
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,951
To the very terrorists
that we are determined

396
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,520
To defeat.
And finally,

397
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:15,757
Caving to any terrorist demand

398
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:18,160
Weakens this nation
immeasurably.

399
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:20,797
Now, we have 60 minutes

400
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:22,898
To find these
bastards.

401
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,565
And i believe we will.

402
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,305
But if we don't,
and the worst happens,

403
00:16:27,373 --> 00:16:29,307
We will deal with it.

404
00:16:29,374 --> 00:16:32,910
We will pick ourselves up off
the floor and deal with it.

405
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,947
Why? Because that's what
we do.

406
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:38,316
Americans don't stay down.

407
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:41,519
We rise up together
in times of crisis.

408
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,421
We carry on.

409
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,823
Is that clear?

410
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:56,232
Start the calls, tim.

411
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,800
Yes, ma'am.

412
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:14,884
Chloe, i need
an updated list

413
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,452
Of road closures
and checkpoints.

414
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,854
I thought arlo was
interfacing with nypd.

415
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,923
He is, but national guard
units are on their way,

416
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,357
So are teams
from fbi new jersey.

417
00:17:22,425 --> 00:17:24,493
I want to know where the holes
are, so i can plug them.

418
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,494
I'll forward it
to your screen now.

419
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,729
Thank you.

420
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:36,835
yes?

421
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,002
It's me.

422
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,871
Do you have the roadblock
information?

423
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,704
I'll have it for you
in five minutes.

424
00:17:41,772 --> 00:17:43,671
Did you speak
to president taylor?

425
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,206
I did.

426
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,508
Her response
was as i anticipated.

427
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,144
But as the time pressure builds,
she'll change her mind

428
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,246
And give up hassan.
I'm certain of it.

429
00:17:53,314 --> 00:17:54,480
What if she doesn't?

430
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:56,982
Then we'll strike
a hard blow against the city.

431
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,252
Either way,
the peace process dies.

432
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,728
It's ready.

433
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,968
I don't have time to deal
with these anymore.

434
00:18:17,036 --> 00:18:18,203
Mr. Weiss?

435
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,571
Can i have a word?

436
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:22,273
Certainly.

437
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,508
I thought
secretary kanin's

438
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:25,943
Point was a good one.

439
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,878
If we simply turn
hassan over,

440
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:30,479
We risk damaging the good
name of the united states.

441
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,581
What are you suggesting?

442
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,916
Uh, a third way.

443
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:38,419
A covert action
in which we

444
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,120
Deliver hassan
to the terrorists,

445
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:42,355
But make it look like
they took him hostage.

446
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:46,225
Two birds, mr. Weiss.

447
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,060
We spare new york

448
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,728
And we preserve our reputation

449
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,462
In the eyes
of the world.

450
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,732
I admit, i'm intrigued.

451
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,866
But...?

452
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,934
It'll never fly.

453
00:18:58,002 --> 00:18:59,736
You heard the president.
She won't go for it.

454
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,570
Not in a million years.
No, of course, she won't.

455
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:03,605
The question is,

456
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,239
Will you?

457
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:11,343
I'm asking

458
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,845
For your cooperation, mr. Weiss.

459
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:15,813
For the good of the country.

460
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:21,716
Well, even if i agreed to help,
it's too late.

461
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:23,384
Hassan's already
on his way here.

462
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:25,352
No, it's not. A wet ops
team was mobilized

463
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,921
In the event of a strike
against the irk.

464
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:31,323
If you get me hassan's exact
route, i can redirect them

465
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:33,090
To intercept
his security detail.

466
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:35,059
I don't have access
to that information.

467
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:36,226
It's being handled through

468
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:37,360
The secretary
of state's office.

469
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:38,894
Then we just have to get it
from mr. Kanin.

470
00:19:40,663 --> 00:19:43,063
It's sedition, general brucker.

471
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,333
Are you familiar with the fourth
nuremberg principle?

472
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:50,635
If the orders
of the president

473
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:52,070
Are illegal,
it is our

474
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,338
Moral obligation
to disobey them.

475
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,373
And you think they are? Illegal?

476
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:58,141
The president
is letting her idealism

477
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,708
Get in the way
of her responsibilities

478
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:02,043
As commander in chief.
It's hardly the same thing.

479
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:03,578
You don't think so?

480
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:06,413
With the fate of
an american city in the balance?

481
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,716
"The primary role
of government is to protect

482
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,752
Its citizens."
Your words, mr. Weiss.

483
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,656
It's time to decide
whether or not you meant them.

484
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:02,171
The white house just received
credible intelligence

485
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:04,240
That the terrorists
we've been tracking

486
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:07,243
Plan to detonate
a radiological device

487
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,412
In new york city
in less than 50 minutes.

488
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:17,517
all of us in this building
have friends

489
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:19,820
And family who live in the city.

490
00:21:19,888 --> 00:21:21,154
We know we are

491
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:24,523
Bound by law not to warn them.

492
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:28,360
But we also know it is still
in our power to protect them.

493
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:31,796
We are their
last line of defense.

494
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,798
That is our job.

495
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:35,166
That is what we will do

496
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:38,302
With every second
of every minute we have left.

497
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,870
Starting now.

498
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:41,906
Go back through
all your leads.

499
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:45,276
Appeal to your sources
one more time.

500
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,446
Find that bomb.

501
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:09,402
I just heard from our source
inside ctu.

502
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,738
Based on the roadblocks,
amsterdam is closed off,

503
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:14,742
But there's a potential
target area just to your left.

504
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,410
You'll be avoiding
nypd checkpoints

505
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:17,711
To the south and west.

506
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:20,614
All right.

507
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,649
Turning.

508
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,018
Can you park
in that block?

509
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:27,688
Yes.

510
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:30,457
Good. The fallout radius
will include a good part

511
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,526
Of the upper west side.

512
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:36,596
I'll wait for your call.

513
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,457
How many men
on the detail?

514
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,792
Eleven. Hassan's own security,
secret service,

515
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,260
And two former agents--
Jack bauer and renee walker.

516
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,128
Why is bauer involved?

517
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:22,462
The president trusts him.

518
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,897
And believe me, he's not
someone to be taken lightly.

519
00:23:24,965 --> 00:23:26,598
Oh, he's up against
an elite team

520
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,302
Who will have the advantage
of surprise.

521
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,706
Bauer and his people
don't stand a chance.

522
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,515
The loss of life is regrettable,
mr. Weiss.

523
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,116
No one feels this more keenly

524
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:42,218
Than a soldier
who's led men into battle.

525
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:44,653
But right now,
we don't have a choice.

526
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:59,499
ethan.

527
00:23:59,566 --> 00:24:00,766
What's going on?

528
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:01,934
Oh, i'm sorry.

529
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:04,136
I thought you were
with the president.

530
00:24:04,204 --> 00:24:06,137
I was.

531
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:08,539
What are you doing in here?

532
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:10,007
Oh, i asked mr. Weiss

533
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,275
To pull up the latest
white house readiness protocols.

534
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:14,109
He couldn't log on
from his computer,

535
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:15,578
So we were trying from yours.

536
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:24,284
I was also reviewing
president hassan's itinerary

537
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:27,553
To see if we could facilitate
a military escort.

538
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:29,922
Hmm.

539
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,964
Open the door.

540
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:44,467
I'm afraid
i can't do that, mr. Kanin.

541
00:24:44,535 --> 00:24:46,536
Then get out of my way.

542
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,241
Rob?

543
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,842
Ethan, listen, i...

544
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,609
No, you listen to me.

545
00:24:58,111 --> 00:24:59,912
I think i have a
pretty good idea

546
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,079
What's going on here.

547
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:02,213
Sit down, mr. Kanin.

548
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,848
There are some things
you need to know.

549
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,050
There sure as hell are.

550
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:09,353
But i'll stay where i am,

551
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:10,921
If you don't mind.

552
00:25:10,989 --> 00:25:12,022
Ethan, do what he says.

553
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:13,356
Sit down, please.

554
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,059
this is bauer. Go ahead.

555
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:19,028
I said, go ahead.

556
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:22,931
Give me your phone.
General...

557
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,866
Get your hands
off of me!

558
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,434
wait!

559
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:32,472
This is beyond madness.

560
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:37,375
The two of you will spend the
rest of your lives in prison.

561
00:25:37,443 --> 00:25:38,376
Maybe, mr. Kanin.

562
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:39,977
But my guess is that one day,

563
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:42,480
The country
will thank us for it.

564
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:50,786
Rob... i'm begging you.

565
00:25:50,854 --> 00:25:52,854
Don't do this.

566
00:25:54,856 --> 00:25:56,856
Don't betray your president.

567
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,661
ethan? Ethan?

568
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,632
All right.

569
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,135
Ethan!

570
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,538
My god! Ethan!

571
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,541
Ethan!

572
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,809
Okay.

573
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:20,810
Oh!

574
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,211
Okay.

575
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,980
Ethan, here, here, here.

576
00:26:25,048 --> 00:26:26,315
Call 911.

577
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:27,616
We call for help,
the first thing

578
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,117
He does is get word
to the president.

579
00:26:29,185 --> 00:26:31,620
But he's having a heart attack!
We can't just do nothing!

580
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:33,122
We didn't do nothing;
you gave him his medication.

581
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,024
Well, it's not working.

582
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:37,294
Look, i realize
that you two are close.

583
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,463
But this is not
an emotional decision,

584
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:42,165
This is a tactical one.

585
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,501
We wait to acquire hassan

586
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:46,169
Before calling an ambulance,
understand?

587
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,272
What if he doesn't
make it that long?

588
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,109
We have to pray that he does.

589
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:05,124
All right?

590
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:07,195
All right.

591
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:11,366
Come on.

592
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:16,406
We pick up the service tunnel
under third avenue.

593
00:27:16,474 --> 00:27:18,242
From there, the trip
to mcguire by convoy

594
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,409
Is less than 30 minutes.

595
00:27:19,477 --> 00:27:20,844
Thank you, ms. Walker.

596
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:28,119
Secretary kanin,
this is jack bauer.

597
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:30,721
I can see on my phone
that you just tried to call me.

598
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,523
Please call me back
as soon as you can.

599
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:33,524
Thank you.

600
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,962
This is bauer. Patch me through
to mcguire air force base.

601
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,235
How far are you from an access
point into the tunnels?

602
00:27:47,607 --> 00:27:49,208
Uh, based on
what i'm looking at,

603
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:50,542
Less than two miles.

604
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,211
Well, the security detail's
already on the move.

605
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,479
Can you get there in time?

606
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,914
Yeah, if we haul ass.

607
00:27:54,981 --> 00:27:56,248
And the ambush
happens where?

608
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:57,316
At the vehicle, sir.

609
00:27:57,383 --> 00:27:59,017
Remember, the objective
is president hassan.

610
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,019
Do what you have to do
to take him alive.

611
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:02,187
Yes, sir.

612
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:04,255
Good luck.

613
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,926
Thank you. Have him call me back
as soon as possible.

614
00:28:08,994 --> 00:28:10,095
renee.

615
00:28:10,163 --> 00:28:11,597
Yeah?

616
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:13,399
Secretary kanin
tried to call me.

617
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:14,667
Now he's not
answering his phone.

618
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,135
The operator at
mcguire air force base

619
00:28:16,203 --> 00:28:17,369
Can't find him either.

620
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:18,370
Something's not right.

621
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:20,940
Keep your eyes open.

622
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:37,164
Hold up.

623
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,700
We set?
Yeah, the vehicles

624
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,168
To transport the
hassans are 200 meters

625
00:28:42,236 --> 00:28:43,702
Up the tunnel.
There is a section

626
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,004
Of construction we
couldn't get by.

627
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:47,139
unit one, this is mcguire.

628
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:50,009
Your route to gate 4
has been secured.

629
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,043
Did you walk it?

630
00:28:51,111 --> 00:28:52,444
Yes, sir. All clear.

631
00:28:52,512 --> 00:28:54,612
Get the family.

632
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,180
This way.

633
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:00,251
Our suvs are a short hike
up the tunnel.

634
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:01,619
Stay together as we
move towards them.

635
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:04,522
This is bauer.

636
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,058
Patch me through
to secretary kanin.

637
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:11,196
here they come.

638
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:12,964
Man 2:
is hassan with them?

639
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:14,532
Yes.

640
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,434
Masks on.

641
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:18,502
Take your positions.

642
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:23,473
Wait until the targets
are in the kill zone.

643
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,475
Remember, we need
to take hassan alive.

644
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:39,891
secretary kanin?

645
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,959
Just a minute.

646
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:53,508
Yes, what is it?

647
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,977
Excuse me, sir, but jack bauer's
calling for secretary kanin.

648
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,711
Well, the secretary
is busy with me right now.

649
00:29:57,779 --> 00:29:58,712
I understand
that, sir,

650
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,980
But mr. Bauer's persisting.

651
00:30:00,047 --> 00:30:01,181
He says it's very important.

652
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:02,515
He's holding on line one.

653
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,016
All right, thank you.

654
00:30:04,117 --> 00:30:05,584
I'll take care of it.

655
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,027
Jack, hi. It's rob weiss.

656
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:23,029
sir, we're in
a service tunnel under...

657
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:24,630
I'm sorry,
you're breaking up, jack.

658
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,898
Can't hear you.

659
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:28,767
I said, we're in
a service tunnel under the un.

660
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,201
We're evacuating president
hassan and his family.

661
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:31,902
Is everything all right?
You tell me.

662
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,570
Secretary kanin tried
to get ahold of me

663
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:35,238
About ten minutes ago
on his private cell.

664
00:30:35,306 --> 00:30:37,340
I've been trying him ever
since; he won't pick up.

665
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:38,440
Well, the secretary's tied up

666
00:30:38,508 --> 00:30:39,842
With the joint chiefs
right now, jack.

667
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:42,377
Do you know what he wanted
to talk to me about?

668
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:43,378
Honestly couldn't say.

669
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:44,513
I could've been anything.

670
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:45,781
I don't think so.

671
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,116
He knows we're conducting
a sensitive evac.

672
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:48,552
He called me during it.

673
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,854
There's got to be
some kind of a connection.

674
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:51,890
Well, i'll make sure
he gets the message.

675
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:52,891
Mr. Weiss,

676
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:53,925
I don't think you understand.

677
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:55,898
I need to talk
to secretary kanin now.

678
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,566
That's not possible.

679
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:58,968
What do you mean,
it's not possible?

680
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:00,135
We're dealing
with an imminent

681
00:31:00,203 --> 00:31:01,370
Terrorist attack
on our soil!

682
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:03,205
Just do your job
and let us do ours!

683
00:31:03,272 --> 00:31:05,373
all due respect, sir,
i am doing my j...

684
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:06,808
Hello? Hello?

685
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,576
Son of a bitch
just hung up on me.

686
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:10,346
He's under a lot of
stress; they all are.

687
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:12,583
I don't give a...
agent o'connor, stop.

688
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:16,787
Start walking
them back now.

689
00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:18,155
Something's not right.

690
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:20,090
We're gonna head back
to the un, reassess there.

691
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:21,158
Let's go.

692
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:25,196
President hassan,
i'm very sorry,

693
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:27,165
But you're too exposed
down here.

694
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,667
Whatever you think
is right, mr. Bauer.

695
00:31:28,734 --> 00:31:30,235
They're turning around.

696
00:31:30,303 --> 00:31:32,404
How far are they?

697
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:33,471
About a hundred yards.

698
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:37,675
Okay, take out
as many as you can.

699
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:55,093
Renee!

700
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:56,494
I need you to get
president hassan

701
00:31:56,562 --> 00:31:59,864
And his family to the side
tunnel and back to the un!

702
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:01,165
What about you?!

703
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,299
I'll be right behind you!

704
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,300
President hassan,

705
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:05,670
You need to go.
Now. Now!

706
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:13,612
Okay, go.

707
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Go, go.

708
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:32,131
Go! Go!

709
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:47,380
Your orders are to
stay with president hassan.

710
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:50,082
You need to go.

711
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,684
I know what
i have to do, sir.

712
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,321
Good luck.

713
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,056
Thank you, sir.

714
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:58,192
You ready?

715
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
I'm ready.

716
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:01,328
Now!

717
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,485
See if you can get wide
and outflank them.

718
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:21,086
I'm going to try to draw them
into a crossfire.

719
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:23,321
Shoot only on my command.

720
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:28,292
Engage.

721
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:00,256
Mr. President, we
need to keep moving.

722
00:34:00,324 --> 00:34:01,758
Your people are being
slaughtered, mr. Bauer.

723
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:02,926
We need to help them.

724
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:04,194
They're buying us
the time we need.

725
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:05,361
Don't let it
be in vain.

726
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,597
We need to go now!

727
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:44,811
Give me a weapon. No.

728
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:45,812
I've been a soldier,
mr. Bauer.

729
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,480
I can handle a gun.
I'll fight with you.

730
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:49,248
Mr. President, my job
is to protect you.

731
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:52,018
You need to do what
i say. Now, go!

732
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:57,122
We to keep moving.
Come on.

733
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,791
come on. We got to go.

734
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:06,766
Renee, we're not
going to make it.

735
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:07,968
Take cover.

736
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:09,770
Go! Go!

737
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:21,188
I'm going to head up the middle.

738
00:35:21,256 --> 00:35:23,527
As soon as i set these off,
i want you to start firing.

739
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:24,762
Doesn't matter if
you hit anything.

740
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,033
Just make some noise.
Mr. President?

741
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:30,840
You take care
of your family.

742
00:35:30,908 --> 00:35:32,878
You ready?
Yeah.

743
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:35,250
Let's go.

744
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:05,529
Mathis! Donner! Go!

745
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,533
Move! Move!

746
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:15,873
Move! Move! Move!

747
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,534
I'm going to take
the high ground.

748
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,604
In about five seconds,
start giving me cover fire.

749
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:47,840
Okay?

750
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:24,444
Take the weapon off.

751
00:37:24,512 --> 00:37:26,479
Take the weapon off now!

752
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,548
Now!

753
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,860
Who are you?

754
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:43,198
You're making
a huge mistake.

755
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:47,368
You're american.

756
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:49,069
Why did you attack us?

757
00:37:49,137 --> 00:37:51,338
Because a dirty bomb will
be detonated in new york

758
00:37:51,406 --> 00:37:53,741
Unless we deliver hassan
to the terrorists.

759
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:55,310
What are you
talking about?

760
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:57,545
A ransom demand has been made.

761
00:37:57,613 --> 00:38:00,782
Him for the bomb
by 06:15 hours.

762
00:38:03,919 --> 00:38:06,221
Jack, that's less
than 20 minutes.

763
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:08,556
Does the president
know about this?

764
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:10,625
She's refusing to deal
with the terrorists.

765
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:12,060
This is
general brucker's operation.

766
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:14,162
Get up. Get up!

767
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,330
What are you doing?

768
00:38:15,397 --> 00:38:17,398
I'm going to get you
up to the street level,

769
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:18,700
Where i can make
a phone call.

770
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:20,869
There's no time for that.
This is on you now.

771
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:23,571
You have to deliver
hassan to the terrorists.

772
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,072
I don't take orders
from anybody

773
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,907
But the president of the
united states. Now, move.

774
00:38:47,687 --> 00:38:50,222
keep moving.

775
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:05,366
Yes?

776
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:08,136
Why haven't i heard from you?

777
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:09,570
Because i don't know anything.

778
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,838
What does that mean?

779
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:13,206
Are the americans
handing over hassan, or not?

780
00:39:13,274 --> 00:39:14,574
The only information we have

781
00:39:14,642 --> 00:39:16,642
Is that he's being transported
to mcguire air force base.

782
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,710
We lost communication
with his security detail

783
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:20,345
About 20 minutes ago.

784
00:39:22,147 --> 00:39:25,716
So president taylor
doesn't intend to give him up.

785
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:28,985
Samir... think for a minute.

786
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:32,188
You use that bomb,
you lose your leverage.

787
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:35,290
The president leaves me
no choice.

788
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,293
The blood will be on her hands.

789
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:39,995
Samir!

790
00:39:53,541 --> 00:39:54,641
tarin?

791
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,242
Yes?

792
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,845
The president
has not responded.

793
00:39:58,912 --> 00:40:00,846
Start the countdown.

794
00:40:00,914 --> 00:40:03,549
You need to stay with the bomb.

795
00:40:03,616 --> 00:40:06,719
Make sure no one interferes
with it.

796
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:08,087
Tarin, did you hear me?

797
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:11,790
Yes, i heard you.

798
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:14,193
Your name will never
be forgotten, my friend.

799
00:40:15,828 --> 00:40:18,697
Your family will be
honored above all others.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
