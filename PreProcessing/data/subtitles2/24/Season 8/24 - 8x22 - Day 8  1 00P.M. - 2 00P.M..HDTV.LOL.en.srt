00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:13,287
Previously on 24.

3
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,653
This is Meredith Reed.

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,837
Ms. Reed, the people that you
think are responsible

5
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:20,560
for killing President Hassan
were not working alone.

6
00:00:20,628 --> 00:00:22,777
They were being funded
and managed by people working

7
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:24,042
inside the Russian government.

8
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:26,173
<i>How do you know this?</i>

9
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:28,003
I'm being set up, just like you
were yesterday.

10
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,738
I need to get this evidence
to you.

11
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:33,476
Arlo got a cell phone intercept
report off NSA's Echelon.

12
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:34,975
Keywords: "Jack Bauer."

13
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:36,606
<i>PILLAR:
We confirmed the voiceprint.</i>

14
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:37,706
Reed's connection
to Hassan means

15
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:38,972
she'd be highly motivated
to help him.

16
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:41,671
Take it to the press.
That's his next move.

17
00:00:41,738 --> 00:00:43,671
This is a major opportunity

18
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:45,870
to make everything
go away, sir:

19
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:47,269
Bauer and the evidence.

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,670
I need to find Jack...

21
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:50,505
<i>or else they're gonna kill him.</i>

22
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:53,674
If we can get to him,
we can expose the cover-up.

23
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,709
Jack's gotta be working
with someone. Who?

24
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:58,210
I don't know. I never saw 'em,
but Jack showed up with

25
00:00:58,278 --> 00:00:59,912
state-of-the-art
weapons and comms.

26
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,414
Pavel, do you see Bauer?

27
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:03,248
If you have a shot, take it.

28
00:01:03,316 --> 00:01:05,680
I've got him.

29
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:07,414
Put it down.

30
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:09,345
Everything's all clear
up on top, Jack.

31
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:11,844
Come with me.
Do exactly what I say.

32
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:15,048
(shouting and screaming)

33
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:17,348
Move!

34
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,749
<i>PILLAR:
He knew it was a trap.</i>

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,183
The evidence is on
this memory card.

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,050
Take it.

37
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:24,218
<i>As soon as you see it,
you'll know it's real.</i>

38
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:25,752
DANA: The hit on Hassan
is all arranged.

39
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,385
Bazhaev and his people are
taking care of everything.

40
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:30,585
I already know
that you killed Renee Walker.

41
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:33,288
What I want to know is the
name of the Russian pig

42
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,355
inside your government
that gave the order.

43
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:38,289
Where's the SIM card
for your phone?

44
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,925
You dumb bastard,
you swallowed it.

45
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,692
This is

46
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,926
for my friend.

47
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,760
(grunts, crunching)

48
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:56,494
MAN: You've reached the mobile
number of President Charles Logan.

49
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:09,438
ANGELA: As a principal
player in this

50
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:12,073
unprecedented and historic
peace initiative,

51
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:14,676
Secretary of State Kanin's
untimely decision

52
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:19,180
to withdrew for health reasons
was a difficult one.

53
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:22,539
However, the president wishes it
to be known

54
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:26,072
that in Secretary Kanin's
absence and per his own

55
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,941
recommendation, she has sought
and gained the counsel

56
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,275
of former President
Charles Logan.

57
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:34,377
Now, the president

58
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,946
is acutely aware that this
decision bears some controversy.

59
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:42,449
But President Logan's experience
with foreign policy

60
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,750
and his skills in negotiation

61
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:46,751
have already proven
to be a great asset

62
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:49,820
in these final hours before the
signing of the peace agreement

63
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:51,354
with the Islamic Republic.

64
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,622
Once Mrs. Hassan...

65
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,856
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

66
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:56,190
...and the IRK delegation...

67
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:58,658
Your car to the heliport
is ready and waiting downstairs.

68
00:02:58,726 --> 00:03:00,492
Has, uh, President Suvarov's
plane arrived yet?

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,827
It should be

70
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:03,327
touching down at JFK
within the next 20

71
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:05,095
to 30 minutes,
and then he'll be choppered in

72
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:06,329
to the 93rd Street
Heliport.

73
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,497
Thank you, Ellen.

74
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:08,831
Tell them
I'll be down in a moment.

75
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:10,465
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,633
ANGELA (on TV):
Once Mrs. Hassan

77
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:16,104
and the IRK delegation
have hashed out a few remaining

78
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,405
points of protocol
with President Taylor...

79
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,639
(phone ringing)

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,876
...the signing will commence
as scheduled.

81
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,479
Tell me
you have a lead on Bauer.

82
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:31,714
PILLAR:
I'm sorry, sir.

83
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,482
We tracked him
to an adjacent building,

84
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,083
but Bauer managed
to get out of the cordon,

85
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:38,618
along with the reporter
Meredith Reed.

86
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,518
Also, he's killed Pavel.

87
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,153
I've taken
jurisdictional control

88
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,854
over the scene from NYPD.

89
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:46,756
We should be able to keep
this contained, but it...

90
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,490
it's not gonna matter

91
00:03:48,558 --> 00:03:50,525
if Bauer's already
passed along the evidence

92
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:52,626
he got from Dana Walsh
to the press.

93
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,961
The story's going to come out.

94
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:56,462
No, not necessarily.

95
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:58,497
We still might be able
to manage this.

96
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:00,031
Look, sir,
I- I know you've told me

97
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,599
that you're committed
to seeing this through,

98
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,801
but you can still extricate
yourself from this mess.

99
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,702
There's no evidence
of your involvement yet.

100
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,470
You can still delay
the press announcement.

101
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,971
It's too late
for that, Jason.

102
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,839
The White House
Press Secretary just announced

103
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,640
my role in the
peace process.

104
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,241
There is no turning back.

105
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:15,976
And there's something else
you should know.

106
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:18,879
Bauer didn't just kill Pavel.

107
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:20,614
He butchered him.

108
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:23,817
He beat him savagely,
and then he eviscerated him.

109
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:25,318
I don't think
Bauer's just looking

110
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,786
to expose the Russians'
involvement

111
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,654
in the plot against Hassan.

112
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:30,656
This guy's out for blood.

113
00:04:32,224 --> 00:04:35,193
Then you better find him
and stop him, hadn't you?

114
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,761
Yes, sir.

115
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,663
Keep me posted.

116
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,636
I'm not going any further

117
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,071
till you tell me
what happened back there.

118
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:50,538
You killedhat man, dn't you?

119
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,973
Ms. Reed, your
life is in danger.

120
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,707
You want to get through
this thing alive,

121
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,642
you're gonna do
exactly what I say.

122
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,077
Do you understand?

123
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,645
Jack, I can't get a locate

124
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:01,013
on the number you called
from this phone.

125
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,248
It's restricted.

126
00:05:02,249 --> 00:05:03,482
I'm gonna have
to route a back trace.

127
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:04,550
Can you do it here?

128
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,152
No. I need the equipment
at my place.

129
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,587
Get back to me as soon
as you got a location.

130
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:08,722
All right.
Let's go.

131
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:10,124
Who is it
you're looking for?

132
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,526
Someone who can give me the
names of everyone se involved.

133
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:14,527
And what are you gonna do
when you finthem?

134
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,329
It doesn't concern you.
How can I trust you

135
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:18,765
if you don't tell me
what you're doing?

136
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,833
Because I'm not the person
who's trying tkill y.

137
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:23,235
The video file
that I gavyou

138
00:05:23,302 --> 00:05:25,904
is the onlproof of
the Russians' mplicity

139
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,339
President Hassan's
assaination.

140
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,175
But the conspicy doesn
end with the Russians.

141
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:30,843
There are people within
our own government

142
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:33,246
that are trying cer this
up, including President Taylor.

143
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:34,981
Why would the president
want this covered up?

144
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:38,052
Because she's trying to keep the
peace accord alive with the IRK.

145
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:40,054
And she knows if
Dalia Hassan finds out

146
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,522
that the Russians had a hand
in the death of her husband,

147
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,757
she'll never
sign the agreement.

148
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,692
What do you want from me?

149
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,561
I need you to break the
story in casI don't make it.

150
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:54,365
I think Presidt Hassan
deserves that, don't you?

151
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:56,600
Leme see
your cell phone.

152
00:05:56,667 --> 00:06:00,402
Okay.

153
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,937
Wait.
at are you doing? I...

154
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:03,237
They've seen
you with me.

155
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,939
The authorities are
going to start monitoring

156
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,473
your usual forms
of communicaon.

157
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:09,043
You can't go home, you
can't go back to your office.

158
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:11,479
Is there anyone that you
work with that you trust?

159
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,480
Uh, my edito Gary Klausner.

160
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:15,415
You need to try and
get him the evidence.

161
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,650
I can get you as
far as a pay phone.

162
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:20,456
After that,
you're on your own.

163
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:22,059
I'm glad we were able
to come to terms.

164
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:23,494
So am I.

165
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:25,529
Thank you, Madam President,
for your pience with me.

166
00:06:25,596 --> 00:06:27,097
I am still new to this.

167
00:06:27,164 --> 00:06:29,332
You are a natural
leader, Dalia,

168
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,700
and you have a superb
advisor in Minister Jamot.

169
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:34,403
I appreciate the endorsement,
Madam President.

170
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,637
Pardon me...

171
00:06:35,638 --> 00:06:37,039
for interrupting.

172
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,607
We were just finishing up.

173
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:39,975
Dalia Hassan.

174
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,910
Charles Logan.

175
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:44,413
I'm honored to finally
meet you, Mrs. Hassan.

176
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,481
I was a great admirer
of your husband.

177
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,016
I'm so sorry for you loss.

178
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:49,183
Thank you.

179
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:50,550
President Taylor tells me

180
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:51,884
you were instrumental

181
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,684
in convincing the
Russian delegates to stay

182
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:55,686
at the negotiating table.
I'm honored to play

183
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:58,455
even a sll part
in such an historic event.

184
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:04,394
Madam President, may I
have a few moments with you?

185
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,597
I'll see you
at the signing.

186
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,168
You still haven't found out

187
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,570
how Logan convinced
thRussians to stay?

188
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,804
I've investigated it,

189
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,271
but I learned nothing
from the delegates.

190
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,073
I can have our intelligence
service look into it.

191
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,309
No. Thank you, Jamot.

192
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,244
I trust President Taylor.

193
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,613
We have to assume
that if she involved Logan,

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,380
it was for a good reason.

195
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,759
The operation to capture
Jack Bauer was unsuccessful.

196
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,428
He got away,
along with the evidence

197
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,929
that he took from Dana Walsh.

198
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,998
You said you had the
situation under control.

199
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:50,735
Clearly,
I was overly optimistic.

200
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:53,504
And in my optimism,

201
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,972
I neglected to tell you

202
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,874
that Bauer made contact
wi a journalist.

203
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,108
Meredith Reed.

204
00:07:58,109 --> 00:07:59,476
My God...

205
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:01,511
You need to call her
publisher right away.

206
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:05,147
Deny any foreknowledge of
whatever evidence she has,

207
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,715
and demand that they
do not run the sto.

208
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:10,084
You're suggesting
muzzling the press?

209
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:12,653
Have you forgotten
that freedom of the press is

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,054
Constitutionally
protected?

211
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,956
You are the president,
for God's sake.

212
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,491
Invoke national security.

213
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:20,193
You tell them this
story will start a war.

214
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:22,195
Innocent lives
will be lost.

215
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:23,863
New lies to cover the old ones.

216
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:26,399
The time has passed for hand
wringing, Madam President.

217
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:28,767
If you don't use the
power of your office

218
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,268
to shut this story down,

219
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:34,105
your peace agreement
won't be the only casualty.

220
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,409
You don't need me to
tell you the damage

221
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,744
that your criminal
prosecution will do

222
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,246
to this country.

223
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,381
This country survived
your presidency.

224
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:47,118
But it won't survive yours.

225
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,754
Me- I inherited
my presidency.

226
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,255
I was never

227
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:54,324
nearly as popular as you are.

228
00:08:54,392 --> 00:08:58,128
And most of my alleged
misdeeds never made the press.

229
00:08:58,196 --> 00:09:02,199
But if you were
to bare your sins

230
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,568
to the people who put
you in office...?

231
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:09,639
You are a beacon
of righteousness,

232
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:13,243
not only for Americans, but
for the rest of the world.

233
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,878
You are the president

234
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:19,182
who had her own
daughter arrested

235
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,184
rather than see
justice go unserved.

236
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:23,252
You're a poison.

237
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:27,822
I never should have
let you to do this.

238
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:32,660
With due respect,
Madam President,

239
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:35,729
I- I gave
recommendations,

240
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:39,433
I made whatever arrangements
needed to be made.

241
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,434
But every decision
was yours.

242
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:45,036
Let's not pretend
otherwise.

243
00:09:47,406 --> 00:09:49,575
I've-I've studied you

244
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:51,911
for a number of years, Allison.

245
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:54,881
I pride myself on being
a good judge of character.

246
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,883
You're a smart woman.

247
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:59,051
You've always known
what needed to be done

248
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,453
and were willing to do it.

249
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:01,754
Which is why I know

250
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:03,655
you will call
Meredith Reed's publisher

251
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,723
and make sure he
kills the story.

252
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,125
I would suggest
you do it now.

253
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,526
You, uh...

254
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,195
You have a signing
ceremony to prepare for.

255
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:20,600
And I need to go meet
President Suvarov.

256
00:10:34,977 --> 00:10:37,177
Chloe,

257
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:39,211
you need to see this.

258
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,712
What is it?
I just

259
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:42,513
tapped into a live feed
from Pillar's team.

260
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:44,248
This guy was found strung up

261
00:10:44,315 --> 00:10:46,684
and sliced open
in an abandoned building

262
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,953
across from the department
store. He's got Russian papers

263
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,423
on him, but I can't make 'em
out; the rez is too low.

264
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:54,960
Looks like someone left
a sniper rifle at the scene.

265
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:56,795
What's the caliber?
Bring it up.

266
00:10:56,862 --> 00:10:59,964
They tagged it
as a.308 Springfield.

267
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,867
That's the gun
that killed Renee.

268
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:05,269
That's got to
be the shooter.

269
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,904
Jack did this,
and you still think

270
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:08,072
you're gonna be able

271
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:09,940
to talk him down?
I gotta try.

272
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:13,277
Pillar and his people
are just gonna kill him,

273
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:14,677
and I can't
let that happen.

274
00:11:14,678 --> 00:11:16,345
(beep)

275
00:11:16,413 --> 00:11:18,881
Got a match from the department
store security feed- 82%.

276
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:21,149
That's the guy
helping Jack?

277
00:11:21,217 --> 00:11:23,151
Yeah, James Ricker-
Ex-Green Beret, Special Ops.

278
00:11:23,219 --> 00:11:25,019
He served with Jack in the Gulf

279
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:26,687
before Jack was
enlisted by CTU.

280
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:27,955
Just one problem.

281
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:29,022
He's dead.

282
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,891
It says he was killed in

283
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,025
a chemical plant explosion
in Basra seven years ago.

284
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,360
Yeah, well, then he must have
a twin who was there

285
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,061
when Jack reversed the ambush.

286
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,399
You better go
back to your station.

287
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:45,367
Pillar's watchdog
is getting suspicious.

288
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:47,470
Arlo,

289
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:48,638
cross-reference
Ricker's photo

290
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,872
with State DMV database.

291
00:11:49,873 --> 00:11:51,874
He must be living
under an alias in the city.

292
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,309
We find Ricker, we find Jack.

293
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,976
Okay.

294
00:11:58,347 --> 00:12:01,115
(phone ringing)

295
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:02,584
JACK:
Yeah?

296
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:03,752
You get the location?

297
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:05,354
<i>RICKER:
You didn't tell me that was</i>

298
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:07,957
Logan's phone that I was
tracing, Jack. Does it matter?

299
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,358
Yeah, it kind of does.

300
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,925
I think you
know it, too,

301
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:13,560
or else you would've been
straight with me.

302
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:16,196
Listen, taking out a bunch
of Russian spooks is one thing,

303
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,264
moving on an ex-president,
that's quite another.

304
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:20,599
That's a seriously line
you're crossing there, pal.

305
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,933
I know exactly what I'm doing.

306
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,901
Are you gonna give me
the location or not?

307
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:27,971
Logan's in a vehicle.

308
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,939
He's moving west
from the U.N.

309
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:33,209
I'm syncing up with the
Secret Service deployment grid.

310
00:12:33,277 --> 00:12:34,777
I'll upload his route
to your tablet.

311
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:36,345
Hold on.

312
00:12:39,848 --> 00:12:41,282
Okay, I've got it.

313
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,885
Listen, Jack, I sure hope
you know what you're doing,

314
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:45,251
because this path you're on,

315
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:47,086
there ain't no
coming back from it.

316
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:49,623
I wasn't planning
on coming back.

317
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:51,158
Look, you're right,
you've already done

318
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,993
more than I had a
rit to ask for.

319
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:55,259
I want you to start erasing
all your connections to me.

320
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:57,795
Jim...

321
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:00,698
thanks for everything.
Good-bye.

322
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:39,962
Oh. Thank you.

323
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,601
Are you sure that's all you
need? Should I call the doctor?

324
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,102
It's just a headache.

325
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:48,904
I'm fine. Thank you.

326
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:51,139
You wanted to see me,
Madame President? Yes, Tim.

327
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:52,874
Please sit down.

328
00:13:58,114 --> 00:14:00,716
You remember the reporter
CTU arrested last night?

329
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:03,352
Yes, uh, Meredith Reed.

330
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,486
It has been brought
to my attention

331
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,955
that she intends to publish
an unfounded story

332
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:09,724
regarding Omar Hassan's murder.

333
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,660
What is she
gonna be writing?

334
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:17,264
I need you to contact the FBI,

335
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:20,202
<i>have them search
the Sunday Magazine offices,</i>

336
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:22,103
locate Reed,

337
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,935
and seize whatever evidence
she purports to have.

338
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:27,802
Um, I-I... I don't understand.

339
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,337
Her allegations are false,
but the allegations alone

340
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,972
could derail the peace process.

341
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,040
Well, even so, Madam President,
you have to be aware,

342
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,541
they'll accuse you
of censoring the press.

343
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,742
Tim, I did not ask
for your counsel.

344
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,743
I know exactly what
I'm ordering you to do,

345
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,744
so please just do it.

346
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:51,415
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:24,142
(grunts)

348
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:36,620
Hey, drop-off
and receiving?

349
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,188
Uh, yeah, straight ahead.

350
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:40,090
Right there.
Thanks.

351
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:45,929
Just make sure Duggan knows
he's covering the Logan profile.

352
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:48,464
Tell him we'll work out
the byline later.

353
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,200
(phone rings)

354
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:52,502
Editor's desk.
This is Klausner.

355
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,003
REED:
Gary, it's me.

356
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,203
Look, a-are you alone?

357
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,438
Can you speak freely?

358
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,205
Yeah.

359
00:15:58,273 --> 00:15:59,840
Yeah, wh-what's going on?

360
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,441
I don't have a lot of time;
I have a lead on a story.

361
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:04,743
I'm listening. I have a
digital video recording

362
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:07,545
indicating that the IRK
terrorists who killed Hassan

363
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:10,147
were being funded and run
by Russian operatives.

364
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,482
(scoffs)

365
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,184
Uh, y-you sure it's legit?

366
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:14,752
Where did you get it?

367
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,521
From Jack Bauer.

368
00:16:16,588 --> 00:16:17,755
Bauer?!

369
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:19,023
The man's a fugitive.

370
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:21,359
Look, Gary, it's really
not safe for me to talk.

371
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,861
I'll explain more
when I see you.

372
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:23,928
Can you meet me?

373
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,227
Sure, of course.

374
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:28,330
All right, that diner
with the coffee you hate.

375
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:30,732
I can be there
in, uh, 15 minutes.

376
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,301
Okay. And, Gary,
don't tell anyone.

377
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,368
All right?

378
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,436
I got it.

379
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,604
Meredith... be safe.

380
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:39,572
Yeah. You, too.

381
00:17:06,764 --> 00:17:08,364
There's no need to panic.

382
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:10,866
NOVAKOVICH: Do you know
what he did to Pavel?

383
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:13,602
He was beaten savagely,
gutted like a pig.

384
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,103
His men shot dead.

385
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,005
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that,

386
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:19,573
but we both knew that, uh...

387
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:22,076
Bauer would be
a difficult problem to solve.

388
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:24,077
You know what he's doing,
don't you?

389
00:17:24,145 --> 00:17:25,445
He's eliminating
everyone involved,

390
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:28,380
working his way up-
how long before he gets to me?

391
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,581
That's not
going to happen.

392
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,116
How can you be so sure

393
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,918
Because you
told me yourself

394
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,053
your man would
never talk,

395
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,921
and if that's
true, then...

396
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:37,489
nobody outside
of your inner circle

397
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,858
can point
the finger at you.

398
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,193
I promise you...

399
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,863
Bauer's never
going to know.

400
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,131
And on the upside,
his recent activities

401
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,233
have given us
a bit of an advantage.

402
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:53,468
What advantage?

403
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,837
CTU orders concerning him
have been upgraded

404
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,938
to "shoot on sight."

405
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,506
First you have to find him.

406
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,575
They're going to find him;
don't worry.

407
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:06,410
He can't... he can't stay
under the radar forever.

408
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,780
I'll keep you posted.

409
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:33,873
(tires screeching)

410
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:35,542
(horns honking)

411
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,311
(gunfire) DRIVER:
Come in! Come in!

412
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:39,214
We're under assault!
We are trapped

413
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,782
in the 4th Street
underpass.

414
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:46,254
DRIV: Unit LEZ-1,
requesting immediate backup.

415
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:48,290
Both entrances are blocked.
We are boxed in.

416
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,659
Oh, that's... that's Jack Bauer.

417
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:52,159
That's got to be.

418
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,560
Did you hear what I said?!

419
00:18:54,628 --> 00:18:56,128
That's Jack Bauer!

420
00:18:56,196 --> 00:18:58,164
DRIVER: I repeat: we
need immediate assistance.

421
00:18:58,231 --> 00:18:59,666
Don't just sit there!

422
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,266
He's coming for me!

423
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:03,836
Sir, stay in the vehicle.

424
00:19:03,837 --> 00:19:05,938
We're armored and
the glass is bulletproof.

425
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,274
(gunfire)

426
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:12,075
LOGAN:
Close the door!

427
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:15,343
DRIVER: We are being
attacked by automatic gunfire.

428
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:25,518
The assailant is masked.

429
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,119
It may be
Jack Bauer.

430
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,460
Close the door! Secure the
vehicle! Close the door!

431
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:42,165
(grunts)

432
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:55,675
Kill him!

433
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:20,730
(Logan gasps)

434
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,937
(gas hissing)

435
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:30,341
(coughing)

436
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,210
(continues coughing)

437
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,915
(coughing, hacking)

438
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,458
(gagging)

439
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:54,328
JACK: Mr. President, get up,
or I will kill you right here.

440
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:56,029
Move!

441
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,734
(gunshot)

442
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:08,408
Move!

443
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,043
I just got your flash.

444
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,478
What'd you find out
about Ricker?

445
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:24,879
You were right.

446
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,214
DMV records show Ricker
living in Suffolk County

447
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:28,683
under the name Simon Strocker.

448
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,818
I tried to confirm,
found out he moved from there

449
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:32,586
18 months ago,
but he left

450
00:21:32,654 --> 00:21:34,121
a forwarding address
with the postal service-

451
00:21:34,122 --> 00:21:35,956
it's right here in SoHo.

452
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:39,456
Hey, Devon,
what's going on?

453
00:21:39,524 --> 00:21:41,424
Pillar's people are requesting
backup for the team

454
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:42,958
in the field.
Why?

455
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:44,158
You didn't hear?

456
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,826
Jack Bauer just kidnapped
Charles Logan.

457
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:52,496
How the hell
did he pull that off?

458
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:54,397
Charles Logan?

459
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,535
I need to hear what's going on
in that room. Follow me.

460
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,243
How far out are you?

461
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,645
We're approaching
the tunnel now.

462
00:22:08,646 --> 00:22:10,680
How the hell did
Secret Service let this happen?

463
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:12,481
Bauer hit the town car
with tear gas.

464
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:14,350
The agents were too
incapacitated to pursue.

465
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,851
PD's got the
tunnel locked down.

466
00:22:15,852 --> 00:22:17,285
I'm working on getting
you schematics.

467
00:22:17,286 --> 00:22:19,020
Hurry up.

468
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,490
(tires squealing)

469
00:22:25,728 --> 00:22:27,929
CTU! Make a hole!

470
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:36,205
(man coughing)

471
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,279
Where did Bauer take
President Logan?

472
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:44,680
I don't know.

473
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:45,915
(coughing continues)

474
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,218
You must have
seen something.

475
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:50,087
(coughing)

476
00:22:50,155 --> 00:22:51,789
me on- tell me
you saw something.

477
00:22:51,856 --> 00:22:53,224
Sorry, sir.
Nothing?

478
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,225
No one saw
anything.

479
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,503
Eden, they went through
an underground service gate.

480
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:10,737
I need those schematics.

481
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:11,939
Sending them to you now.

482
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,941
Go.

483
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,984
All right, Kirsch,
take the corridor.

484
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:24,318
Brown, you're down there.

485
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,553
Ames, you're with me.

486
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,121
Remember, unless it poses
an immediate threat

487
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:28,956
to President Logan,
you shoot Bauer on sight,

488
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,224
and you shoot to kill.

489
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:31,891
Let's go.

490
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:36,029
(Logan panting)

491
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:38,099
Through here.

492
00:23:39,468 --> 00:23:41,068
(grunts)

493
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,772
Look at me.

494
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,908
I said look at me!
(whimpers)

495
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:47,943
You're going to tell me
everything I want to know.

496
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,779
Jack, you're making a mistake.

497
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,081
Don't you even try and pretend
you're not a part of this.

498
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:54,383
I found the man
who killed Renee Walker:

499
00:23:54,451 --> 00:23:56,018
the Russian operative
Pavel Tokarev.

500
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,320
I got his cell phone.

501
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,721
The last call he
got was from you.

502
00:23:58,722 --> 00:23:59,922
I know how it looks.

503
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:01,357
You got to let me
explain. Explain what?

504
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,359
That you sent for him
to kill me?

505
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:05,093
You sent him to
kill me, right?

506
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,727
Yes! Damn it, yes!

507
00:24:06,794 --> 00:24:08,462
Why did you take out a hit
on Renee Walker?

508
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:09,930
I had nothing
to do with that.

509
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:11,798
I was brought in
after that happened.

510
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,066
Who brought you in?

511
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,600
President Taylor
needed my help

512
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:16,402
to bring the Russians
back to the table.

513
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:17,903
I- I called my
sources in Moscow.

514
00:24:17,904 --> 00:24:19,871
They told me that people
in their government

515
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,907
were behind Hassan's
assassination.

516
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:24,409
I- I told the Russian delegation
I had evidence of that fact

517
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:25,678
and the names of
everybody involved.

518
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,046
It was just to keep
them at the conference.

519
00:24:27,047 --> 00:24:28,214
What evidence?
What evidence?!

520
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,382
It doesn't exist.

521
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:30,650
I was playing poker.

522
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,218
It was a bluff. It worked.

523
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:34,587
It kept Taylor's peace agreement
on the table, but you...

524
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:36,221
You were determined
to screw things up.

525
00:24:36,288 --> 00:24:37,989
And to... Oh! Oh!

526
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:40,758
Ow! Easy. Jack!
Jack! Jack! I admit.

527
00:24:40,825 --> 00:24:42,360
I admit,
I was part of the cover-up,

528
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:43,995
but I'm not part
of the Russian conspiracy.

529
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:46,296
I had nothing to do with
the terrorist attack

530
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:47,730
or your friend's death.

531
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:50,666
I- I... I'm... I'm not
the bad guy here.

532
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:52,668
Okay, but you know who is.

533
00:24:52,735 --> 00:24:55,003
You know the name of the person
inside the Russian government

534
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,670
who's giving the orders.
I want that name.

535
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,171
Jack...
Give me the name!

536
00:24:58,172 --> 00:25:00,240
Jack... You got five
seconds before I put a bullet

537
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:01,775
through your head. No! No!
You don't have to do that.

538
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:02,976
Five...
I'll tell you.

539
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,745
four... three...
Mikhail Novakovich.

540
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:06,680
He's the head of the
Russian delegation.

541
00:25:06,748 --> 00:25:08,015
He's been trying

542
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:09,950
to kill the peace treaty
from the start.

543
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,286
(panting)
You're lying.

544
00:25:12,353 --> 00:25:14,354
No! No! No! I'm not lying
to you! No! No! No! No!

545
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:16,056
You got my call
from Pavel's phone.

546
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:17,390
You check the
previous calls.

547
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,091
There's a dozen more
from Novakovich.

548
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:20,426
I'm telling you.

549
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:21,526
He's the one you want.

550
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:22,560
(door thuds open)
Shut up!

551
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:23,995
(muffled groan)
Say another word,

552
00:25:23,996 --> 00:25:25,529
and I'll drop you
right here.

553
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:36,805
(Logan gasping anxiously)

554
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:38,807
Get on your knees.

555
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,010
Oh, no. Please.

556
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:42,279
Don't shoot me, Jack.

557
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,316
If I was gonna kill you,
you'd already be dead.

558
00:25:45,384 --> 00:25:47,385
(choking)

559
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,826
(gags)

560
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:20,985
PILLAR: Bauer was
just here- find him!

561
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:23,755
Mr. President?

562
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,457
Are you okay?
Can you hear me?

563
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:28,592
Eden, I need a med unit
at the 49th junction.

564
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:29,826
On its way.

565
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:32,159
Is it Bauer?

566
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:33,593
PILLAR:
No. It's the president.

567
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:34,961
He's unconscious.

568
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:37,396
Bauer escaped. I'm gonna need
you to redirect the pursuit.

569
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,664
I'll stay with the president.

570
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,432
Understood.

571
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,034
They still might
catch up to him.

572
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,935
They haven't yet.
Do you have Ricker's file?

573
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,370
Yeah, including
his current address.

574
00:26:47,438 --> 00:26:50,006
I'm sending it
to you now.

575
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:51,436
How are you planning
to handle this?

576
00:26:51,437 --> 00:26:53,404
We can't send any tactical units
to pick this guy up

577
00:26:53,472 --> 00:26:54,772
without Pillar finding out
about it.

578
00:26:54,773 --> 00:26:55,773
I'm not using
any of them.

579
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:57,608
Then who are you
going to get?

580
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:59,277
All of our agents are fully
deployed in the field.

581
00:26:59,344 --> 00:27:01,179
There's nobody to send.

582
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:03,249
There's one.

583
00:27:05,318 --> 00:27:07,319
(sighs)

584
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,591
Ms. O'Brian?

585
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:23,825
Ms. O'Brian?!

586
00:27:23,826 --> 00:27:25,460
I just saw the
flash from division.

587
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:26,793
They approved
your request

588
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,494
to release Agent Ortiz
into your custody?

589
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:30,027
Yeah, I'm in a hurry, so...

590
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:31,531
What do you think
you're doing?

591
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,701
He's a non-cooperative witness
who is facing federal charges.

592
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:35,002
In case you haven't noticed,

593
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,670
I'm still in charge
of UN Security,

594
00:27:36,737 --> 00:27:38,338
and you've taken away
all my resources.

595
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,206
And not that
it's any of your business,

596
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:42,241
but Agent Ortiz designed
the entire UN operation.

597
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,143
The signing is in less
than two hours.

598
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:46,445
His assistance
in the field is vital.

599
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:48,814
I'm going to have to
clear this with Pillar.

600
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:51,450
Do what you want, but to me,
you have bigger problems,

601
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:53,051
like not finding Jack Bauer.

602
00:27:55,087 --> 00:27:57,489
(sighs)

603
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:15,809
(sighs)

604
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,711
Are you Meredith?

605
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,480
Yes.

606
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:22,681
There's a Gary Klausner
on the phone for you.

607
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,317
It's up
by the cashier.

608
00:28:24,385 --> 00:28:26,387
Thank you.

609
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:33,064
Thanks.

610
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:35,299
Where are you?

611
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,702
Meredith, the FBI is here.

612
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,470
Showed up before I could leave.

613
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:41,206
They're looking for you,
questioning everyone,

614
00:28:41,273 --> 00:28:42,507
including me.

615
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:44,175
You didn't tell them anything,
did you?

616
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:45,409
Of course not.

617
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,610
But they've got
an executive order

618
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:48,012
from the president.

619
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:49,680
They say you're in possession
of materials that pose

620
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:51,048
a national security risk.

621
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,316
It's a cover-up, Gary.

622
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:54,719
The White House is trying
to suppress the story.

623
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:55,953
You can't let them.

624
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:58,356
Look, until we clear this up,

625
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:00,494
you have to protect
that evidence.

626
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:02,731
I told them I haven't had
any contact with you,

627
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:04,734
but for all I know,
they're tracing this call.

628
00:29:04,802 --> 00:29:06,470
You better get the hell out
of there.

629
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,006
And go where?

630
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:10,074
Mr. Klausner.

631
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:12,009
We said no communication
outside of our presence.

632
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:14,678
I- I I'm canceling
an appointment.

633
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:16,480
Gary, they're going
to bury the truth.

634
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:17,982
Not if I can help it.

635
00:29:17,983 --> 00:29:19,751
I'll-try to put a call in
to Ed Sampson

636
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:20,985
at the Justice Department, but

637
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:22,186
until then, lay low.

638
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:23,354
Now go.

639
00:29:23,355 --> 00:29:25,123
Okay.

640
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:48,986
Let's go.

641
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,153
Where are we going?

642
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:51,455
I have to go to
the U.N., and

643
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,522
division has given you

644
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:53,692
a temporary furlough
into my custody.

645
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,795
Since you had earlier
command of UN security,

646
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,596
I'm gonna need your help
coordinating protocols

647
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:59,164
and deployment for
the signing ceremony.

648
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,466
And Pillar's okay with this?

649
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,869
I'm still provisional
Director of Operations.

650
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,303
I don't need his consent.

651
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,171
So, are you coming,
or would you rather

652
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,874
wait here for your
federal prosecution?

653
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,343
(scoffs)
Let's go.

654
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,982
I'll take him from here.

655
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:18,586
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

656
00:30:18,654 --> 00:30:21,289
Yeah.

657
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:24,092
You were right
about Jack.

658
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,927
He is working
with somebody.

659
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:29,797
It's James Ricker,

660
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:31,132
ex-CIA Op.

661
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,669
We found him living
at a place on Mercer Street

662
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:34,970
under the alias
Simon Strocker.

663
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:36,238
Maybe he's still
with the company.

664
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,307
No. I checked with Langley.
He was listed as deceased.

665
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:40,843
More than likely, he's gone
into business for himself,

666
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:42,679
dealing arms or intel.
In any case,

667
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:44,114
he's not going to be happy
we tracked him down.

668
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:45,616
Wait a second.

669
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:47,185
Why are you telling me this?

670
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:49,220
I need you to talk to him.

671
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:51,690
Get him to tell us
where Jack is.

672
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:54,026
Are you good with that, or
have you still not taken sides?

673
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:56,696
I want to expose this cover-up
as much as you. I'm in.

674
00:30:56,764 --> 00:30:58,797
Good. Log sheets

675
00:30:58,865 --> 00:31:00,565
will show you
accompanying me to the UN.

676
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,734
I've secured you a separate
vehicle waiting at the gate.

677
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:04,537
Is there any more
intel on Jack?

678
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:05,906
Has he resurfaced again?

679
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,008
Yeah, you could say that.

680
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:12,474
Sir, I just
received word.

681
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,973
President Suvarov's plane has
touched down at Kennedy Airport.

682
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,640
Tell Ivan to bring
the car around.

683
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,172
I want to be at the UN
when the president arrives.

684
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:28,579
(phone ringing)

685
00:31:47,392 --> 00:31:49,360
Where's Novakovich?

686
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:51,895
I'm not going to
ask you again. 11th.

687
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:53,130
11th floor, suite 1170.

688
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:54,564
How do I get up there?

689
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:56,699
Secure elevator
inside of garage.

690
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,233
Where's your keycard?
I don't have one.

691
00:31:58,301 --> 00:32:01,235
(grunting)

692
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:02,470
Where is your keycard?

693
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,938
I don't have one, I swear.

694
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,406
His personal guards have them
at elevator.

695
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:07,474
How many?
Two.

696
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:08,575
And upstairs?

697
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:10,076
One outside the suite,
two inside.

698
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,445
Another by elevator.

699
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:12,612
Where else?

700
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:13,814
Where else?!

701
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,482
That's all.
That's all I know.

702
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:19,386
(grunting)

703
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:48,282
(bell chimes)

704
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,621
(grunting)

705
00:32:57,324 --> 00:32:59,258
(blade slashing)

706
00:33:02,495 --> 00:33:04,329
(bell dings)

707
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:08,633
(groans quietly)

708
00:33:37,846 --> 00:33:40,213
Do you really need an arsenal?

709
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,081
Better to have
it than to not.

710
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,216
Besides, Ricker's
a trained killer.

711
00:33:44,284 --> 00:33:45,818
He's gone to a
lot of trouble

712
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:47,386
to stay off the grid.
Fair enough.

713
00:33:47,454 --> 00:33:49,421
I also have to consider
the possibility

714
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:50,789
that Jack's with him.

715
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,192
Listen, Chloe,

716
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,660
I can't be worried
about Jack anymore,

717
00:33:54,661 --> 00:33:56,630
not after what you told
me he did to Logan.

718
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:59,133
Obviously, Logan's
part of the conspiracy.

719
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,935
He terrorized a tunnel
full of commuters

720
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:02,470
with automatic
weapon fire.

721
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:04,272
He shot Seet Service agents.

722
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,943
He shot to wound.

723
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,879
He's careless, and he
only cares about revenge.

724
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:12,048
Does that sound like
the man you know?

725
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,650
Like the man
you're trying to save?

726
00:34:13,717 --> 00:34:17,488
This is about exposing
the Russians' cover-up.

727
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,223
It's not about Jack.

728
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,292
Are you sure about that?

729
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,094
Because if
Jack's there,

730
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,130
and he makes any move
other than complete surrender...

731
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,001
...I'm putting him down.

732
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:31,971
You still want me to go?

733
00:34:31,972 --> 00:34:34,373
I don't really have a choice.

734
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:39,378
Whatever happens,
call me at the U.N.

735
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:41,545
You got it.

736
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,579
(engine starts)

737
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,449
You'll approach
the rostrum

738
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:54,715
immediately prior to the signing
ceremony, and take a seat here

739
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:56,983
in position three,
next to your mother.

740
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,484
I'm honored.

741
00:34:58,485 --> 00:35:00,085
But is that appropriate?

742
00:35:00,153 --> 00:35:01,954
I may be her daughter,

743
00:35:02,022 --> 00:35:03,956
but I don't have any
official role in government.

744
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:05,591
(knocking on door)

745
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,927
Excuse me.

746
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:12,463
Ms. Hassan, there's a call
on your father's secure line-

747
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,830
a woman demanding to speak
with your mother.

748
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:15,164
She's in a meeting.

749
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:16,666
That's what I said,
but this woman

750
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:18,667
is quite insistent.
Who is she?

751
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:19,868
She won't say.

752
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:20,969
We're done,
Ms. Hassan.

753
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,503
I'll see you in
the staging area.

754
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:23,904
Thank you.

755
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,138
Line two.

756
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:26,473
Thank you.

757
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:27,907
Hello. Who is this?

758
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:30,677
Ah. Is this Kayla?

759
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:32,011
Who are you?

760
00:35:32,012 --> 00:35:33,513
Sorry, um...

761
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:35,281
my name is Meredith Reed.

762
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,550
I need to speak to your mother.

763
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:39,185
I know who you are.

764
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,887
What do you think
you're doing calling here?

765
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:42,422
I- I know I'm the
last person that

766
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:44,257
either of you wants
to talk to right now...

767
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:46,359
You're right.
I'm hanging up now.

768
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:49,462
No, please, please, your mother
needs to hear what I have to say

769
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,332
before she signs the agreement
with President Taylor.

770
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,302
What is it that is so important?

771
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,271
I- I'm sorry, I need to speak
to your mother directly.

772
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:00,540
Haven't you caused
my mother enough pain?

773
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,208
Leave us alone!

774
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:04,911
It's about the people who
really murdered your father.

775
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:08,514
What are you talking about?

776
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,549
We know who was responsible.

777
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:13,185
What you don't know is,
those people were working

778
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,787
under the orders
of Russian agents.

779
00:36:15,855 --> 00:36:17,722
What?!

780
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:23,227
Hello?
When your mother gets back

781
00:36:23,295 --> 00:36:24,828
from her meetings,
have her call me

782
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:26,496
at this number- can
you take this down?

783
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,098
(panting)

784
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:31,201
Go ahead.

785
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:35,038
It's 212-555-0121.

786
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:37,507
I'll explain everything
to her then.

787
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:39,075
Wait...!

788
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:47,582
Meredith Reed?

789
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,183
FBI. Get your hands where

790
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:51,085
we can see 'em. Wait,
wait, what-what is this?

791
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:52,553
What is this?

792
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:53,787
Wait. Wait.

793
00:36:53,788 --> 00:36:55,589
You have no right
to take that.

794
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:56,923
I- I haven't done
anything wrong.

795
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:58,625
What is this?

796
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:01,895
You're under arrest.

797
00:37:01,962 --> 00:37:03,897
I
- I've done nothing wrong. Let's go.

798
00:37:03,965 --> 00:37:06,133
I've done nothing wrong!

799
00:37:14,977 --> 00:37:16,744
(knocking on door)

800
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:19,980
Yes?

801
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:21,514
Mr. Woods, ma'am.

802
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:26,753
I've just received word
from the FBI.

803
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,588
Reed is in custody,

804
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:30,823
and they've secured
a data card they found on her.

805
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,161
(sighs)

806
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:37,098
No one sees what's on it but me.

807
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,667
Understood.

808
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,111
MAN:
Sir, we'll take it from here.

809
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:52,812
No, you won't
- I'm riding with him to the hospital.

810
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:53,979
(clears throat)

811
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,446
Give him some space.

812
00:37:56,648 --> 00:37:59,449
(weakly):
Nova... Novakov...

813
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:01,250
Nova...

814
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:03,285
Novakovich.

815
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:04,786
Warn...

816
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:07,488
Bauer knows.

817
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,690
Warn Novakovich
Bauer's coming after him.

818
00:38:10,757 --> 00:38:13,125
PARAMEDIC: Sir, we gotta
get going. Not yet. Just do

819
00:38:13,193 --> 00:38:14,793
what you can for him here.
Understood.

820
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,832
(phone ringing)

821
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:28,569
(ringing continues)

822
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:38,145
(ringing continues)

823
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:48,094
(ringing continues)

824
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,065
Yes?

825
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:53,405
Mr. Novakovich?

826
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:55,307
Hello? Hello?

827
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,942
It's Berkov.

828
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,310
We've been attacked.

829
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,445
It was Bauer.

830
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:02,213
Where's Novakovich?

831
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,914
He's dead.

832
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:05,749
Everyone is dead.

833
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,756
Berkov, did Novakovich
say anything to Bauer?

834
00:39:11,823 --> 00:39:14,192
I need an ambulance.

835
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,727
Just answer my question.

836
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,528
What did Novakovich
say to Bauer?

837
00:39:17,596 --> 00:39:19,931
Nothing. Bauer
just came in shooting.

838
00:39:19,998 --> 00:39:22,166
But he was bleeding.

839
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,602
I think he was wounded
by one of the guards.

840
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,072
All right, sit tight;
an ambulance is on the way.

841
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:33,678
Go.

842
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,514
(quietly):
Novakovich is dead.

843
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,851
Bauer killed him,
killed all of his men...

844
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,920
(continues
indistinctly)

845
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:06,607
(phone ringing)

846
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:10,511
Yes?

847
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:11,946
LOGAN (clears throat):
Yuri.

848
00:40:12,014 --> 00:40:13,714
Charles Logan.

849
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:16,017
I was under the impression
you were going to be

850
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:17,485
at the heliport for my arrival.

851
00:40:17,486 --> 00:40:19,386
Yes, well...
(raspy chuckle)

852
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:21,956
...I ran into some trouble.

853
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:23,925
I'm afraid I have bad news.

854
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:26,461
It appears that
Mikhail Novakovich

855
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:28,763
was just murdered
by Jack Bauer.

856
00:40:28,831 --> 00:40:31,165
What?! Yeah, and,
uh, Bauer learned

857
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,668
that, uh, Novakovich
was responsible

858
00:40:33,735 --> 00:40:35,303
for ordering and...

859
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:39,574
coordinating Omar Hassan's
assassination, as well as

860
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:41,142
the rest of Samir's activities.

861
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:42,977
Where would he get that idea?

862
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:44,478
From me.

863
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:46,648
The lunatic was
gonna kill me, Yuri.

864
00:40:46,715 --> 00:40:47,849
What can I say?

865
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,351
Think of it as, uh,

866
00:40:49,418 --> 00:40:51,820
sacrificing
a rook for a king.

867
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:54,356
Then Bauer has no idea

868
00:40:54,424 --> 00:40:56,993
that Novakovich was operating
under my orders?

869
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:58,228
None.

870
00:40:58,229 --> 00:41:00,630
Uh, according to a witness,

871
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:04,100
Mikhail didn't have a chance to
give you up, even he wanted to.

872
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,635
As far as, uh,
Bauer is concerned...

873
00:41:07,703 --> 00:41:09,870
the trail ended
with Novakovich.

874
00:41:09,938 --> 00:41:11,504
And he's being hunted

875
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:14,306
by every law enforcement
agency in the city.

876
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:16,741
And I've-I've heard
that, uh... (chuckles)

877
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,643
he's been wounded.

878
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:22,315
unded- there is nothing more
dangerous than a wounded animal.

879
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:24,016
Look, if you're
so worried about Bauer,

880
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:25,718
you never should
have given the order

881
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,186
to kill Renee Walker.

882
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:29,821
That's what stirred up
the hornet's nest.

883
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:33,224
If I had known that
yowere going to find out

884
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:35,360
about our activities
and use that information

885
00:41:35,427 --> 00:41:36,728
to blackmail me

886
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:38,529
into signing
Taylor's peace agreement,

887
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,999
I wouldn't have bothered
with the woman.

888
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,035
Water under the bridge, Yuri.

889
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:46,471
I needed an opportunity
to put myself back in the game.

890
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:49,341
I'm sorry that it has
come at your expense.

891
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:52,044
You wouldn't begrudge
an old friend

892
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:55,447
his second chance in the sun.

893
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,715
LOGAN (over radio):
All right, then, I will, uh,

894
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,951
I will meet you
at the United Nations...

895
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:02,020
(clears throat)
as soon as I can.

896
00:42:04,256 --> 00:42:06,257
