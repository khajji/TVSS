1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,596
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:16,561
Welcome to the first of three debates
between President David Palmer,

3
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,434
and Senator John Keeler.

4
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,422
My office has just learned,

5
00:00:20,465 --> 00:00:24,736
that the woman with whom the President is
currently involved: Dr. Anne Packard

6
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:29,228
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial.

7
00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:33,588
Did the President know of these accusations
and choose to ignore them?

8
00:00:33,805 --> 00:00:37,989
Kim, your dad's trying to break out Salazar.
When's the last time you heard from him?

9
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:43,291
About half an hour ago. He asked me to
issue a transfer order for Ramon Salazar.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,576
- And you did it?
- Yeah, he said that Salazar needed to be moved.

11
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:50,128
- But now you're telling me this isn't true.
- No Kim, I'm sorry your dad lied to you.

12
00:00:50,138 --> 00:00:51,764
What's gonna happen to him?

13
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,706
The best way out of this whole
situation is to find Kyle Singer.

14
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,294
Then your dad'll give up Salazar.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,647
What are you doing? There is
no way out of here.

16
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,347
If I die, the virus is dying with me.

17
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:05,889
Wait! No!

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,671
I got it, a patrol car just found
the truck Kyle Singer was in.

19
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:16,021
Hype this into the teams on stand- by.

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,549
Assume everyone on site is contagious
and use level 1 CDC protocol.

21
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:23,034
If I get out of this thing,
you're gonna have to trust me.

22
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,427
- Chase!
- What are you doing Jack?

23
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:29,456
I've got to get Salazar in the air
in that chopper in the next 60 seconds

24
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:32,655
or a hundred thousand of people will die.
You choose.

25
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:36,874
This is Warden Mithell, I want all teams
to stand down, I repeat, stand down!

26
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,264
Congratulations!

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,844
Now you are an even bigger enemy
to your country than I am.

28
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,821
The following takes place
between 6:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M.

29
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,918
Do we have enough fuel to get to Mexico?

30
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:07,560
- We're not going to Mexico.
- What do you mean? Why not?

31
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:10,266
If we make a run for the border,
they'll just try and force us down.

32
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,887
You're gonna have to trust me.

33
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:18,718
- Field office, O'Brian?
- Chloe, it's Chase.

34
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,159
Jack disarmed his locator but the military
should have him on radar by now.

35
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:25,841
They're feeding us the stream now Chase,
I'm sending it to you.

36
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,302
He just banked.

37
00:02:32,344 --> 00:02:35,381
- He's heading west towards downtown.
- Downtown.

38
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:38,221
He knows they can't shoot him
down over a populated area.

39
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:42,835
We may be able to override what he did to his com
unit through an emergency hailing frequency.

40
00:02:42,836 --> 00:02:44,722
We have to get through to him Chloe.

41
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:46,988
- We gotta let him know we found Kyle Singer.
- On it.

42
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:51,933
Major Blanchard, this is Ryan Chappelle,
what's the status of your pursuit craft?

43
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:54,976
I have 2 helicopters that have
just taken off from down here.

44
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:58,024
- How quickly will they intercept?
- Well that's changed.

45
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:00,549
Bauer just turned, he's no longer
heading south toward us.

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,384
Where is he heading?

47
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:03,155
Looks like he's heading towards the city

48
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:07,270
At he's current speed it will take us 10
minutes before we get within range.

49
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:10,538
You go to force him down,
even shoot him down if it comes to that.

50
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,463
But we can't do that while he's over the city
without incurring serious collateral damage.

51
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:18,924
Then you have to do it before he gets to the
city, if he lands, they'll be difficult to catch.

52
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,601
- Yes, sir.
- Keep this line open.

53
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:25,615
Michelle, I'm taking over for Tony, Division wants
a senior officer in charge of CTU.

54
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,999
Give me an update.

55
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:29,869
We're trying to make contact with the Chopper.

56
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,397
Now that we have Kyle Singer and the virus
has been contained, we need to contact Jack,

57
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:36,007
let him know that the attempted
escape of Salazar is pointless.

58
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:40,191
Ok, assemble all the department heads in the
conference area, I want everyone on the same page.

59
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,916
What about C- Band?

60
00:03:46,957 --> 00:03:49,639
It's a SWAT chopper.
They wouldn't be using those frequencies.

61
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:54,598
Adam, tie up whatever you're doing,
we have a briefing in the conference area in two.

62
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:00,535
Kim, over here.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,529
What do you need?

64
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,340
I need you to anchor this list for Chloe,
while she is trying to find an admitting channel for the Chopper.

65
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,737
I'm on it.

66
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:16,450
- Sorry, I lost it in your dad's office.
- It's ok.

67
00:04:16,492 --> 00:04:19,007
Did you tell Michelle about the
drug you found in there?

68
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,395
Yeah.

69
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,905
- What are they gonna do?
- I don't know.

70
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:26,882
Everything came in right after that
so no one has had time to process.

71
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:31,222
- Send me the first 2 groups.
- Sure.

72
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,830
We'll make every attempt to communicate with Jack,
trying to resolve this peacefully.

73
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:48,858
But if we can't, I need everyone
absolutely clear on this.

74
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,531
Salazar's terrorist connections are
a serious threat to this country.

75
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,701
We cannot let him leave.

76
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:57,582
Now that we've got Singer,
should it come to it,

77
00:04:57,623 --> 00:05:00,337
both Salazar and Bauer are expandable.

78
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:03,979
Why aren't we focusing on other options that would
bring down the Chopper without force.

79
00:05:03,996 --> 00:05:05,906
Jack is not giving us any options.

80
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:08,051
He's on a suicide mission either way.

81
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:12,607
Once he hands Ramon off to Hector, they'll have
no use for him, they're going to kill him.

82
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:15,041
I just got off the phone with Major Blanchard.

83
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,120
He has pursuit crafts tracking Jack.

84
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:21,558
However if they're not able to catch him
by the time he reaches his metro airspace

85
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:23,970
then we have an all new set of problems.

86
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:26,675
We need to coordinate with local authorities now.

87
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,538
Hector, relax.

88
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:43,146
Why can't I reach Gael?

89
00:05:43,982 --> 00:05:45,736
He can't get away.

90
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,661
I need to know what's going on with Ramon now!

91
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,745
The Government is probably releasing him,
it's just taking some time.

92
00:05:57,776 --> 00:05:59,646
They're not releasing him.

93
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,394
- I didn't want to tell you.
- Tell me what?

94
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:14,108
The plan has changed, Jack Bauer is the
one who's going to deliver Ramon.

95
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,687
What is that? A joke?

96
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,595
- No.
- But how is that possible?

97
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:29,856
I mean Ramon will never accept help
from the man who put him in prison.

98
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:32,655
Oh no, he is accepting his help.

99
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:39,397
Bauer, is now a criminal in his
own country for doing this.

100
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,684
Hector, what's going on?

101
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:44,222
How could you let Bauer come to us,
that's too dangerous.

102
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:46,828
- Don't worry about it Claudia.
- No I am worried.

103
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:50,342
Look what he's already done to us,
is that some kind of trick?

104
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:54,498
Don't worry about Jack Bauer,
I have plans for him.

105
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:00,034
Yes?

106
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:02,740
I don't have a lot of time,
we're in the middle of this.

107
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:08,916
- Is Ramon alive?
- Yes, he and Bauer have escaped in a helicopter.

108
00:07:08,948 --> 00:07:12,235
- Have they contacted their pilot yet?
- No, no, no, they're being pursued.

109
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:15,219
Everything will be decided
in the next few minutes.

110
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:33,014
Hey, what did Chappelle say in the briefing?

111
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:36,319
He said a lot of stuff.

112
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:42,039
- Are they gonna try and shoot at my father?
- If they have to, yeah.

113
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:45,580
But if they can contact him first,
it won't come to that.

114
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:48,510
- Chloe, where are you at?
- No progress on the hailing frequency.

115
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:50,407
Without that we can't get through to Jack.

116
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:55,120
Ok, here some new ones to try, use a tree
search, we gotta get through that chopper.

117
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:57,073
- Kim?
- Yeah?

118
00:07:57,338 --> 00:08:00,392
- I need to speak to you.
- Sure.

119
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:14,449
Ryan and I feel you shouldn't be here,
until the situation with your father is resolved.

120
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,054
- I'm qualified to handle the work, Michelle.
- Your qualifications are not an issue.

121
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,935
- Your emotions are.
- I can control my emotions.

122
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:28,504
My father is doing this
so the virus won't get out.

123
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:31,467
If he knows that Kyle Singer is in custody,
he'll give Salazar back.

124
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:33,680
I know but we can't reach your father.

125
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:37,467
Not yet, but Chloe and Adam are
getting there, and I can help them.

126
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,237
I'm a resource Michelle, don't do this.

127
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:45,917
Ok, go back and help them.

128
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:55,788
If we have to fire on that chopper,
I want her out of here.

129
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:07,552
What's going on?

130
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,688
- It's military.
- How can you tell?

131
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:13,116
Their formation, their range of speed, they're
gonna be on us in the next 3 to 4 minutes.

132
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,648
And then what?

133
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:17,257
As soon they got on us, they
shoot us out of the sky.

134
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:35,765
Chappelle?

135
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,849
I just spoke with someone at CTU, they said you
authorize to use the force against the chopper.

136
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,281
That's right Chase, I did.

137
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,385
Does President Palmer know about this?

138
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:47,709
Palmer? First of all he's in the
middle of a national debate.

139
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,612
And I don't need his authorization.

140
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:52,308
Bauer just help Ramon Salazar
break out of prison.

141
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,217
He did that to make sure Salazar's
people don't release the virus.

142
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:58,431
I don't care, but this is my jurisdiction.

143
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:01,786
All I'm saying is that getting
Palmer's authorization,

144
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,804
might be the smart play here.
Think about it.

145
00:10:03,821 --> 00:10:06,687
Jack Bauer has a personal
relationship with the President.

146
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,692
He saved his life more than once.

147
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,549
Palmer has interceded on his behalf before.

148
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:16,670
Our mandate does not bend to accommodate
personal relationships.

149
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:21,750
You're right Ryan. And after you shoot Jack down
you can personally explain that to the President.

150
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:32,771
Chappelle?

151
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:35,607
Our aircrafts are about to make
visual contact with Bauer.

152
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,512
- We can be ready to fire and...
- Do not fire!

153
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:42,293
Repeat, do not fire until
you hear back from me.

154
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:50,052
The President has spoken of his administration
support for the American worker,

155
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:54,859
but I'm sure these words sounds hollow
to Armando Rodriguez of Galveston,

156
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,955
Sean Brown of Baloxi,

157
00:10:57,998 --> 00:10:59,647
to Kendall Taylor of Tampa,

158
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:04,368
and to a hundred thousand of their
fellow workers who have lost their jobs,

159
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:09,330
because of trade agreement signed
by President David Palmer.

160
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:17,576
- Wayne Palmer.
- Mr. Palmer, Ryan Chappelle call.

161
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:21,086
Mr. Chappelle what's the latest
on the bio- threat?

162
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:26,342
Kyle Singer, who we believe to be the only
carrier of the virus has been taken in a custody.

163
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:29,472
Do you tell me there is no longer a
risk of this virus being released?

164
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:32,204
- That's what I'm saying.
- Oh thank God!

165
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,932
Yes, we still have the Bauer
situation to deal with.

166
00:11:35,974 --> 00:11:37,617
What's the status on that?

167
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:40,798
Bauer is taking Salazar from
the prison in an helicopter,

168
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:43,737
We have our men on site, but we
aren't able to communicate with.

169
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:45,059
So, what do you plan on doing?

170
00:11:45,093 --> 00:11:47,925
Salazar can't be allowed to leave the country.

171
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,006
I'm afraid our only alternative is
to shoot him down.

172
00:11:51,056 --> 00:11:53,995
Mr. Chappelle, my brother is not
gonna like that alternative.

173
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,850
I understand, that's why I'm calling.

174
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,611
I don't want to fire on Bauer without
the President permission.

175
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,521
Yeah, well the President is in the middle
of televised debate right now,

176
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:05,554
- so I'm sorry but this is gonna have to wait.
- It can't wait.

177
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,516
In a few minutes, their helicopter's
going to be over downtown LA,

178
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:12,491
and we will be unable to shoot it down without
risking significant civilian casualties.

179
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,461
- I'm gonna get back to you alright?
- Soon Mr. Palmer.

180
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,516
Otherwise Bauer will be able to land that chopper
and disappear with Salazar into the population.

181
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:22,700
Yeah.

182
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:32,363
Senator Keeler.

183
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,087
Who's the economic experts?
The administrations?

184
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:40,211
I, for one, cannot accept the blurred numbers

185
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:46,338
being projected, by the so called
economic experts of this administration.

186
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:50,468
David it's me, the biological
threat has been eliminated

187
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,572
We have Kyle Singer in custody.

188
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:56,958
However Jack Bauer doesn't know this
and now he is facilitating Salazar escape.

189
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,725
and they're in a chopper in the
outskirts of the city.

190
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:02,723
Now listen to me carefully David.

191
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,848
It may be necessary to shoot him down.

192
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:09,634
I would like to hear the President
answer to that question.

193
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,095
Are you prepared to authorize this?

194
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,872
Mr. President, your response.

195
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:19,754
Come on David, what do you want to do?

196
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:26,129
I think the entire American work force
would like to hear his answer.

197
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:28,476
Mr. President?

198
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:31,843
My fellow Americans,

199
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:36,924
I have just been informed of an impending national
emergency that requires my immediate attention.

200
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:40,775
Therefore I must withdraw from this debate.

201
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:42,658
Excuse me.

202
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:45,941
Now what is this?

203
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:49,454
This is to say the least
an unusual situation.

204
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:55,945
I need this room cleared.

205
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:58,017
Get this people out of here!!!

206
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,482
Help!

207
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,531
Where they're taking me?

208
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,234
Where do you taking me?

209
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,486
Why don't you talk to me?

210
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,941
Hey! What are you doing?

211
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36,520
Where are you going?

212
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:53,338
What's going on?

213
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,976
- Talk to me! Please!
- Kyle, I'm doctor Duncan.

214
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,333
- I need you to calm down.
- Where is my girl friend?

215
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:01,301
Where is Linda?

216
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:03,668
We have here in another part of the facility.

217
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,972
- Is she ok?
- Yes, she is fine.

218
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:08,535
There's an incubation
period of 14 hours.

219
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:11,769
With this particular virus if you
haven't become symptomatic,

220
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,736
You haven't transmitted it.

221
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:16,313
And my parents?

222
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,059
- They will be ok too?
- Yeah.

223
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,564
They're on their way.

224
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:29,854
What happens when I do become

225
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:33,041
symptomatic?

226
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,046
It's like that Ebola thing, isn't it?

227
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:45,739
It's gonna eat me alive?

228
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:50,683
We'll keep you has
comfortable has possible.

229
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:08,453
Alpha 1, Zebra 1, we have visual.

230
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,540
They've got us.
They've locked onto our heat signature.

231
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:16,326
- Then, why aren't they firing?
- I don't know.

232
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,494
Chloe! Come one, give me the hailing frequency!

233
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:26,130
I can't make the servers go any faster, OK!

234
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:31,811
Mr. Chappelle we've just locked on to the chopper.

235
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:35,708
It is not yet over a populated zone.
I need an answer.

236
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:38,941
How much time do we have precisely?

237
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:42,805
Before collateral damage becomes
an issue, Mr. we've 4 minutes.

238
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:47,344
Stay on course Major, I'm waiting to
hear back from the President.

239
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:51,999
We still haven't got any indication as to
the nature of this national emergency.

240
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:57,992
And Senator Keeler's staff is questioning whether
or not this emergency actually exists.

241
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:04,513
If this indeed is a national emergency of any sort,
it would challenge the nation at this critical time.

242
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:18,814
Could you give us a moment please?

243
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:38,024
David, I'm sorry but we
don't have a lot of time here.

244
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:41,534
So what do you wanna do about
shooting down this chopper?

245
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:47,257
- I can't give the order to kill Jack Bauer.
- But you can't let Salazar go either.

246
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,542
Is this Salazar you're worried about?

247
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:55,911
Or you worry that if Jack Bauer lives,
he'll talk about our arrangement.

248
00:17:55,928 --> 00:18:00,011
It's a fair question to be blunt, yeah I'm
worried about that, even if you're not.

249
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:03,654
But you still have to think about
national security David.

250
00:18:03,705 --> 00:18:07,830
I mean Salazar not only runs a drug cartel,
but he's connected to terrorist organizations.

251
00:18:07,973 --> 00:18:14,059
And he has proven to us today that he has the
infrastructure to launch a biological attack on our soil.

252
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:16,484
How we can allow him
to do that again?

253
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:19,445
Jack Bauer sacrificed everything
to prevent that attack.

254
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:20,877
Jack Bauer volunteered.

255
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,007
Jack Bauer knew the risks,

256
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:28,259
now David you have got to make this decision
as if that wasn't Jack Bauer on that helicopter.

257
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,384
You have to do what's right
for this country David.

258
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,040
Listen.

259
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,490
This is your call.

260
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,781
But you gonna make it now.

261
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:50,892
Get me Chappelle.

262
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:55,837
We now have just over one
minute until they reach the no fire zone.

263
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:59,520
- I repeat, we have over just...
- Hold on Major.

264
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:02,742
- Ryan Chappelle?
- This is President Palmer.

265
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:05,425
Why can't you force down that
chopper without firing it?

266
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,068
Bauer won't communicate with us
Mr. President, he's forcing our hand.

267
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,527
How much time do we have?

268
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,158
In 60 seconds he'll be out of reach.

269
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:15,540
Sir?

270
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,444
You have my authorization to fire.

271
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:21,996
Yes, Sir.

272
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:25,113
- Major, shoot him down.
- Yes, Sir.

273
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:28,559
This is Alpha 1 to Zebra 1 and Zebra 2.

274
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,675
Proceed, you have a go,
I repeat, you have a go.

275
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,696
Roger that Alpha 1, preparing to launch.

276
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,254
Damn it! What's happening?

277
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,711
They gave the order.

278
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,707
No please.

279
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:51,465
?? 6 do you copy? I don't have a shot.

280
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,184
He's changing course, get under,
get under!

281
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,145
Do you have a shot?

282
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,330
Negative, negative. He knows where I am.
He knows you're in the way.

283
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:04,003
- I've got him again. Rocket's engaged.
- You're clear for shot.

284
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,301
Target locked. I'm taking the shot.

285
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:08,397
Hold fire, hold fire, standby.

286
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:12,008
Alpha 1, he's reaching downtown.
Please advise, do we still fire?

287
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,998
No, stand down, I repeat,
do not fire, do not fire.

288
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,792
Roger that Alpha 1, standing down

289
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,217
Hold on we're going in.

290
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:26,335
All right! Everyone!
Fall back to B protocols.

291
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:28,582
Have all units on the ground and prepared.

292
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:31,284
Wherever Bauer lands,
I wanna be on top.

293
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,925
- Dessler?
- Michelle, what's going on?

294
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,004
They're not firing.
He takes over the city.

295
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,771
Can you get him on the
hailing frequency yet?

296
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,227
Chloe is getting close.

297
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,227
Ok, he's putting it down, I gotta go.

298
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,248
Get me to Chloe!
Get me to Chloe!

299
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:06,969
Yeah?

300
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:08,425
Chloe?

301
00:21:08,754 --> 00:21:09,688
Chloe?

302
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:10,858
Any seconds left Chase?

303
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:13,451
There is no time damn it!
I need to get through before he lands.

304
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:29,655
I got it Chase, I got it.
Patching you through, you're in, go.

305
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,995
Jack, we found Kyle Singer.

306
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,614
I repeat, we found Kyle Singer.
The virus is contained.

307
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:37,685
No need for you to doing this.

308
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:02,518
Mr. and Ms. Singer,
I'm Doctor Duncan.

309
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,286
- Hi.
- Hello.

310
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,433
One more second.

311
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,853
That's good.
Get this.

312
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:13,901
But our options of retrievement
are limited.

313
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:16,019
I don't understand.

314
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:19,766
If he's not sick yet, why isn't
there any way to treat him?

315
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,772
Once someone is exposed and
starts incubating the virus,

316
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,766
there is nothing we can do.

317
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,491
So, how long does he have?

318
00:22:30,887 --> 00:22:32,515
The lab tests haven't come back yet,

319
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:36,627
- once we do we'll have a more...
- Please! Just give me some idea.

320
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:40,654
Hours, not days.

321
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:42,929
I'm sorry.

322
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,504
- Can we see him?
- Of course.

323
00:22:58,321 --> 00:23:02,275
- Come on honey.
- I can't! I can't!

324
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:06,453
Hey, Helen he needs to know
that we're not angry with him.

325
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:27,889
Kyle? Your parents would
like to speak with you.

326
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:34,319
They can hear you through the intercom.

327
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:40,653
Take your time, I'll be just outside.

328
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,254
- The doctor told us everything.
- But maybe they're wrong!

329
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:58,516
Maybe it isn't as bad as they think.

330
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:00,987
They're not wrong.

331
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:06,022
I deserve what I'm getting.

332
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:13,987
Don't say that, all you deserve is
a father who could do better for you,

333
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:19,192
so you wouldn't have to go and get money
and bring it home because i couldn't.

334
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:28,605
I'm sorry, Kyle, I'm so sorry.

335
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:31,297
I love you.

336
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:41,274
You've always taking care of me.

337
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:45,491
Now I've never...

338
00:24:46,342 --> 00:24:48,613
now I've never told you this.

339
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:53,132
But you made me feel safe.

340
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,201
Even now...

341
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,079
you make me feel safe.

342
00:25:01,615 --> 00:25:04,189
You did the best you could dad.

343
00:25:22,451 --> 00:25:23,931
I will die.

344
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,282
- I will die.
- No, no.

345
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:41,261
Edmunds, CTU, anybody seen him.

346
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:44,516
Witnesses saw your suspects run down at
to the station over 5 minutes ago.

347
00:25:44,535 --> 00:25:46,116
- How many trains have left?
- Two.

348
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:47,868
One made a stop 10 blocks east of here.

349
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:49,329
We got officers searching that area.

350
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,673
We stopped another train in the
tunnel, they're searching it now.

351
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:53,349
Jack's not gonna let himself be trapped in a train.

352
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:55,385
You think he's still down the tunnel.

353
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,075
CTU, Bauer?

354
00:25:57,086 --> 00:26:00,059
Kim I need the entire schematic
of the Pershing Square station.

355
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:01,548
What's going on Chase?

356
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:06,023
Your dad got out of the Chopper before I can tell
about Kyle Singer, he and Salazar are on the run.

357
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,000
Hang on, ok I've got the schematics.

358
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:10,510
How many tunnels emergency access
are their between here and Grant.

359
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:11,338
Heuuu?

360
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:13,542
- Kim?
- I'm looking.

361
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:14,819
Come on, let's go.

362
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:17,632
There is one, in the alley.

363
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:19,661
Just off 6th street south- west corner.

364
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,882
How far is that from here?

365
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,661
One block, but they are one ways
so you'll be better off on foot.

366
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,872
Ok, I'll get back to you.

367
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,806
Hey! Are we coordinating with you guys or not?

368
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,265
Michelle, I just get off the phone with
Chase, he's at the metro station.

369
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:01,555
- What did he want?
- Information about the subways.

370
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,242
Whatever you gave him,
copy to all other agents.

371
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:04,336
- I did.
- Good.

372
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:10,454
They know not to use lethal force, right?

373
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:11,898
Mandate is the same.

374
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:14,230
Stop Salazar by any means necessary.

375
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:22,952
But now that they're on the ground, they can
probably do that without harming your father.

376
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,289
Right.

377
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:47,165
Dessler?

378
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:51,027
Michelle, it's Chase, Jack got out of a
tunnel to a maintenance access of mission (?? )

379
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,756
the 900 block, you need to redeploy
all your people this area.

380
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,194
- seal off a 10- block radius.
- I'm on it.

381
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:17,866
Come on, get in.

382
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:46,006
The exit of the President did come
at a critical time of the debate

383
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:49,170
and even pondered?? on both side of the isle

384
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,958
are speculating that it is
quite odd, to say the least,

385
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:54,753
Yeah, I will.

386
00:28:55,838 --> 00:28:57,080
I will tell him, thanks.

387
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:00,639
It was CTU.

388
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,769
They still haven't found Bauer or Salazar.

389
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,942
LAPD is placing an?? area
where the Chopper landed.

390
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:11,074
Hopefully they'll be picked
up without an incident.

391
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:12,546
Yeah.

392
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,054
Yeah, it's probably more likely
that Bauer sneaked through.

393
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,202
David, listen.

394
00:29:18,818 --> 00:29:22,216
You gonna have to stop thinking about
his welfare for the moment.

395
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:26,320
That Bauer breaking Salazar out
of prison has already leaked to the press.

396
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:30,807
Now you gonna have to go out there, and explain
to them that's why you ended this debate.

397
00:29:30,877 --> 00:29:33,799
And then explicitly denounce
what Bauer did.

398
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,938
So Jack puts his life on the line to stop
the fire so we hang him out dry.

399
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:44,112
David we cannot allow anyone to
know that we sanctionned what he did.

400
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:48,773
That would do irreparable damage
to you, to the office.

401
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:52,216
Now you know what I'm saying is true.

402
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,859
No sorry but you gonna
have to let him go.

403
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:19,599
Who are you calling?

404
00:30:19,756 --> 00:30:20,852
The pilot.

405
00:30:21,339 --> 00:30:24,347
Your brother gave the FBI contact
instructions in his last call,

406
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:27,148
he's got a plane circling
waiting to pick you up.

407
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:30,278
So CTU knows about the plane.
Would that be a problem?

408
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:32,452
Not for a long.

409
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,008
Yes?

410
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:39,095
Yes, this is Jack Bauer,
I've got Salazar.

411
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:44,243
I'm on a secure cell:
7, 1, 1, *, 6, 5, 5, 9.

412
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:46,809
Reconfigure your frequency
and call me back.

413
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:49,504
- I get confirmation.
- That's right.

414
00:30:51,114 --> 00:30:53,075
- Is this the real thing?
- Yes.

415
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:55,788
Yes it is, he's got Salazar, call him
back and make arrangements.

416
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,384
And you'll buffer from CTU.

417
00:30:58,584 --> 00:30:59,669
It's handled.

418
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:04,302
Yeah?

419
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,409
Where are you?

420
00:31:07,297 --> 00:31:10,260
2700 block of Figerow. We're heading south.

421
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:11,360
All right,

422
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,294
the closest safe airstrip is Santa Margarita.
Do you know where that is?

423
00:31:15,315 --> 00:31:17,830
Yeah, I can get there in
about 10 minutes.

424
00:31:19,996 --> 00:31:22,437
You really are the best Jack.

425
00:31:22,796 --> 00:31:26,372
When you were down there with us
I had no idea your were an agent.

426
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,359
We accepted you.

427
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:32,274
You didn't have to put the needle in your arm.

428
00:31:33,373 --> 00:31:35,241
You did that for other reasons.

429
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:39,050
Same reason as all junkies,
to kill the pain.

430
00:31:40,751 --> 00:31:42,421
What's your pain Jack?

431
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:46,056
What does the needle make go away?

432
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:00,650
Make sure to call Division, tell them that
they need to move their men out of Downey.

433
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,920
- Same place?
- Yeah, we need everyone downtown.

434
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,038
Michelle Dr. Linzer on line 3.

435
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:06,935
It will take a few minutes, is that all right?

436
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:09,536
- Yeah call me back with confirmation.
- All right.

437
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:14,641
- Yeah Doctor?
- Well, your husband is out of surgery.

438
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:15,653
How is he?

439
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,950
Their was no nerve damaged, the
injury was entirely vascular.

440
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:23,370
It's what we're hoping for, right?

441
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:24,163
Yes.

442
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:25,822
He should recover fully.

443
00:32:27,282 --> 00:32:28,733
Thank God!

444
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,000
Now, he is going in a post- op now so
he should be awake in the next hour or so.

445
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,632
I'll be there.

446
00:32:37,226 --> 00:32:38,301
Thank you.

447
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:40,837
Thank you Doctor.

448
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:52,942
It was the hospital.

449
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,725
Tony is gonna be ok.

450
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,729
That's good news.

451
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:04,578
Thank you Ryan.

452
00:33:05,486 --> 00:33:07,312
Have you heard back from INS?

453
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,783
Yeah we send out an alert.

454
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,861
And we cover from Baha to New- Mexico.

455
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,042
How about local airfields?

456
00:33:16,702 --> 00:33:18,946
We're trying to shutdown
everything we can but,

457
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,856
we're getting a little bogged
down with the FAA.

458
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:23,805
Have Gael run a pattern
analysis on local air traffic,

459
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:25,474
we may come up with an anomaly.

460
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:26,831
It's a good idea.

461
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,432
- Kaufman?
- Adam, where's Gael?

462
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:42,235
Hmmmm, Tech. 1.

463
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,175
Kim and I are just about to head down there,
do you need me to tell him something?

464
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,348
- No, just send him over to my office
- Ok.

465
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,602
- I'll let him know.
- Thanks.

466
00:33:57,978 --> 00:34:00,775
Once you get back in
the air I'll be offline.

467
00:34:00,952 --> 00:34:04,510
You comute your frequency every 15 minutes,
I'll pick you up in 22. 7.

468
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:05,314
Roger that.

469
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,036
I'll get back to you.

470
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:22,346
So everything on the system hasn't
been updated since 11am.

471
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:24,265
So that's where you should start.

472
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,133
Ok.

473
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:26,611
Gael?

474
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,647
Michelle needs to see you in her office.

475
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:29,457
Ok.

476
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,733
- You can use the station right here.
- Great.

477
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:33,521
What are you doing?

478
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:37,117
Ah, bringing the logs back up to date, we got really
behind when everything hit the fan today.

479
00:34:37,126 --> 00:34:39,442
I can do that a lot faster than she can.

480
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,656
No, Michelle needs to see you now.

481
00:34:57,942 --> 00:34:58,750
Ok.

482
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,978
- You're all set.
- Great.

483
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,658
- See you in a bit.
- Yeah.

484
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,173
Sir?

485
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,370
- Can you give me a moment?
- Yeah.

486
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:26,251
Have these 2 paragraphs inverted.

487
00:35:26,313 --> 00:35:29,068
And have the secretary
meeti me in the morning.

488
00:35:30,658 --> 00:35:32,458
- All right?
- Yes sir.

489
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:37,620
Is everything ok?

490
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:42,185
No we had to make some fast choices
and I couldn't do that while I was on stage.

491
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:43,211
Yes.

492
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,620
- Everything is ok now.
- Are you sure?

493
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,980
This is just damage control.

494
00:35:50,512 --> 00:35:52,046
David I'm sorry, I just...

495
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:56,240
I still can't believe Keeler would repeat
those lies in a national debate.

496
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,479
You don't have to apologize
for anything.

497
00:35:58,511 --> 00:36:00,149
You didn't sink to their level.

498
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,975
And in the long run,

499
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,206
it's gonna pay off.

500
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:05,147
I hope you're right.

501
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:07,776
But I'm more concerned about you.

502
00:36:07,828 --> 00:36:10,876
You've only been brought into this because of me.

503
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:13,952
I'm fine.

504
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,759
Yes, you are.

505
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:23,113
David, Jerry has scheduled
a press conference.

506
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,388
They're expecting a
statement this evening.

507
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,483
Fine.

508
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,779
We've got to get right on a response
to Keeler's accusation about Anne.

509
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,239
What did the quick post tell us?

510
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,224
Well I'm not gonna lie to you.
We got hit hard.

511
00:36:35,947 --> 00:36:38,875
Voters who are on a fence may
have just fall into Keeler's camp.

512
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:41,568
But that is ridiculous once they'll
find out that Ted was lying.

513
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:44,099
But how are they supposed
to do that Anne?

514
00:36:44,112 --> 00:36:47,094
I mean it's he said, she said,
see this is politics,

515
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:49,567
it's not medicine, so do me a
favor and stay out of it.

516
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:51,999
Stay out of it?
I am it!

517
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:52,706
That's enough.

518
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,794
Wayne, you gonna have to be patient.

519
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:02,801
Anne's not going anywhere,
and we are not changing our strategy.

520
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:07,069
- David we really...
- Right now, it's Mr. President.

521
00:37:13,383 --> 00:37:14,583
Yes, Sir. Mr. President.

522
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:27,606
I may not agree with his bedside manner,

523
00:37:28,368 --> 00:37:29,922
but I think he's right.

524
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:32,948
You don't need this right now.

525
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,722
Now, what are you saying?

526
00:37:35,187 --> 00:37:38,218
I think we should put our relationship
on hold until after the election.

527
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:40,012
Wow, wow, first of all,

528
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:42,590
that won't resolve anything,

529
00:37:42,642 --> 00:37:44,844
and second of all, I need you.

530
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,842
Then I'm right here.

531
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,025
That's my lady.

532
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:10,709
Wait a minute.

533
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:14,861
How can that be?

534
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:17,491
- Have we rechecked these results?
- 3 times Doctor.

535
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:19,307
- You're sure?
- Very sure.

536
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:24,202
Ok, thanks.

537
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:34,793
Yeah, get me Chappelle at CTU,
put him through to my cell.

538
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:55,682
What's going on?

539
00:38:57,163 --> 00:39:00,033
There is no trace of the
virus in your blood.

540
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:01,750
What?

541
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:03,853
We've rerun the tests
several times,

542
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,450
and have them double checked
in another lab.

543
00:39:06,513 --> 00:39:07,420
You're clean.

544
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:10,123
Ohh! My God!

545
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,884
- Duncan?
- Nicole? Chappelle.

546
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,983
Kyle Singer's tests
came back negative.

547
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:26,130
How is that possible?

548
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:28,781
It's only possible if he
was never infected.

549
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:32,120
So you're telling me this
whole virus scare was a bluff?

550
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:33,622
Hard enough I'd say that.

551
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,504
That dead body they dropped off this morning,
was definitely infected.

552
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:38,549
Then why wouldn't have
infected the boy?

553
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:40,469
What the hell is going on here?

554
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:42,713
I don't know, you tell me.

555
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:54,494
What the hell is going on?

556
00:39:54,536 --> 00:39:57,958
You didn't think I was gonna let you
just deliver me and leave, did you?

557
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,897
Get him off.

558
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,264
Ramon!

559
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:03,040
What the hell is going on Ramon?

560
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,789
- Thanks for the ride Jack.
- Ramon!

561
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:16,886
Hector said to bring him back,

562
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:17,815
alive.

563
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:24,927
Fine.

564
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:26,954
Let's go.

565
00:42:16,915 --> 00:42:17,979
Adam!

566
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,955
Adam, there is something
seriously wrong.

567
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:25,618
I've just remembered.

568
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:29,823
I forgot to close that file.



9999
