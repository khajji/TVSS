1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,701
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,805
Tony, someone just dropped out
a dead body infected with the virus.

3
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,408
Based on the autopsy, at the end of the first week,

4
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:21,200
9% of the Los Angeles county would be infected.

5
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:23,001
It's over a 1 million people.

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,208
We want the release of Ramon Salazar.

7
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:29,507
If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.

8
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:32,108
Jack, you know Salazar
better than anybody else here.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,302
Who do you think we're dealing with?

10
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:38,100
Without a doubt his brother.
Hector was next in command. He went underground the second Ramón was taken into custody.

11
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,008
Have you made the call to the FBI?

12
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:41,506
Yes, I did.

13
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:43,004
What about our boy?

14
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:44,508
I'm watching him now.

15
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:47,105
What are you into here man?
You're selling dope?

16
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:51,303
This guy he paid me $5000 to
bring some coke over the border.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,604
I did that last night.

18
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:55,003
Today, I drop it off, I get another $5000.

19
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:56,703
When did FBI get this call?

20
00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:58,307
About 20 minutes ago.

21
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,104
And we don't know who we're dealing with?

22
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,307
It was a scrambled voice on an open line.

23
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:04,006
Do we cancel the debate?

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,907
They are discussing whether or not
we should stay in Los Angeles.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,201
Chase, no day is a good day.

26
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:14,005
We said it we will tell him if we're
still together after two months.

27
00:01:14,105 --> 00:01:15,106
It's almost three.

28
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:17,603
Why don't we just tell him
and get it over with?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,002
Listen Jack.

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,900
You were under of Salazar for 6 months.

31
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,407
I know what they did to you.
You look like hell.

32
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:27,607
I'm concerned about you, Jack.

33
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:31,101
The things you did to get me here,
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

34
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:48,008
The following takes place
between 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm.

35
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:12,106
The president is not gonna make any decisions
until he knows what we're dealing with so...

36
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:13,801
give me all the parameters Tony.

37
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:17,603
Well, basically, what we have here is a terrorist demand.

38
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:21,106
Someone close to Ramón Salazar,
we're guessing his brother, Hector,

39
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,200
is demanding his release.

40
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:26,805
If we don't comply, he's threatening to initiate
an operate of a very deadly fast acting virus.

41
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:29,801
How do we know if these people
are really in possession of it?

42
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,904
Wayne, I've got Dr. Sunny Macer on the line.

43
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:35,807
She is technical director of National Health Services. I let her address that.

44
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,901
Mr Palmer, about an hour ago,

45
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:40,208
a dead body was anonymously delivered to our office.

46
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:44,903
It was infected with a type 3 immuno- virus
deliberatery introduced into its system.

47
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:49,903
This virus kills within 24 hours of exposure
and there is no none antidote or vaccin.

48
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:53,104
What's particurlaly disturbing is how fast it spreads.

49
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:54,307
Take a look.

50
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,503
As you can see,

51
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,300
it's latent for several hours,

52
00:03:58,402 --> 00:03:59,704
but once the symptoms present,

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,105
it consumes the host rapidly.

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Our office will be sending you preliminary projections of casualties

55
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,006
in case something like this should be unleashed.

56
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:11,008
And Wayne, I've gotta tell you, it's pretty bleak.

57
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,403
I don't understand this.

58
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:15,502
I mean, I thought we knew what biological threats were out there.

59
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:19,904
And how do we find ourselves up against the wall
so suddenly

60
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:21,208
with something that isn't even on our radar?

61
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,003
This is a strain we've never seen.

62
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:26,007
The autopsy is confirming that someone is engineered this virus

63
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:29,004
to kill 10 times faster than its ordinary genotypes.

64
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:32,008
Ok. Ok, I see.

65
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:35,500
Sir, I can't underscore enough how potentially devastating

66
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,800
it would be if this virus were released by terrorists.

67
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:42,406
By giving this information, what options
would the President be looking at?

68
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:45,201
It's the unweathering policy of the USA to stand firm

69
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:47,002
against any terrorists demands.

70
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,003
And I know the President, Tony,

71
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,803
He will not free Salazar.

72
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,205
No matter what the threat.

73
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:57,403
All right then we can't waste any time
on standard protocole today.

74
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,708
We've been giving five hours to comply.

75
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:01,607
If we're gonna find these people and stop this threat

76
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,103
then CTU has to have any possible resources at its disposal.

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,107
You'll have it.

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,600
All right. Now if we've nothing else to discuss,
I'd like to get my team back to work.

79
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,105
- Understood.
- Thank you.

80
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:14,504
Bauer.

81
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,900
Dad, it's me.

82
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,008
What, Kim?

83
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:18,806
Adam and I just found something on Goss.

84
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:21,405
We're working it up now.
We should have an address for you pretty soon.

85
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:22,605
Ok, good work.

86
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,206
And...Dad, remember, I want to talk to you.

87
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:27,007
What? Something wrong?

88
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:30,008
No. I was just wondering if I could come up for a few minutes.

89
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:31,904
Something personal.

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,504
Sweetheart, right now is not a good time.

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,001
As soon as I've got a moment I'll come down, ok?

92
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:38,408
Yeah, thanks.

93
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:41,807
They're getting close to Goss.

94
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,408
You didn't shoot up, did you?

95
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,705
What? You think you'll hide it from me?

96
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,102
I am not trying to hide it from you.

97
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:49,406
I am trying to quit!

98
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,104
Ok, people don't just quit Jack.

99
00:05:51,304 --> 00:05:54,002
I've been tempering off.

100
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:55,908
OK, now it's time to stop.

101
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,802
It doesn't look like it's time.

102
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,806
All right, today is not a good day for you

103
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:00,906
to be needing a fix.

104
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,902
Why don't you go work with Chloe

105
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,804
and see if you can pin down a location on Hector Salazar?

106
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,001
What's wrong with the methadone program?

107
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,606
Ok, it takes a little time but it works.

108
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:14,708
I am not going on record with a citation, do you understand me?

109
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:19,601
OK, so right now, you're the only person who knows
about it. It's gonna stay that way.

110
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,601
OK, this is nothing to be ashamed of.

111
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:22,801
You did this in the line of duty.

112
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,800
Doing junk whas the only to get close to Salazar

113
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,108
Nobody is gonna knock you for that.

114
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,906
I know what I did, Chase.
This conversation is over.

115
00:06:30,206 --> 00:06:31,307
Just get back to work.

116
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:33,704
Yeah.

117
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:43,907
Chase?

118
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:44,702
What?

119
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:47,873
I was just looking at playback
of the Health Services briefing.

120
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:48,611
What about it?

121
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:50,607
The government is not letting this happen,
are they?

122
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,101
I mean Salazar is just one person no matter how bad he is.

123
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,204
Free it all that Chloe. We need to operate under orders

124
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:57,006
that is to find the carrier of this virus.

125
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,902
Find the carrier? In the next 4 hours?

126
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:01,302
Come on Chase! That's not likely, is it?

127
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:03,268
Not if we sit here and debate it.

128
00:07:03,593 --> 00:07:06,437
Who is just supposed to find and modify
the list of Goss' associates?

129
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:07,508
Kim is bringing it up now.

130
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:14,604
Great. Then, go over the autopsy report.
See if there's anything they overlooked.

131
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,604
Fine.

132
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:28,406
Here are the files on Goss.

133
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,707
I heard you talking to your dad when I was in his office.

134
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:38,401
Why do you want to tell him today?

135
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,601
Because it's not a big deal.

136
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:43,908
Well, it is a big deal, ok?
Now not only do I work for him

137
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,306
but I'm also a field agent.

138
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:47,605
It's the last thing he wants for his daughter.

139
00:07:47,707 --> 00:07:48,703
How do you know that?

140
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:50,003
I know.

141
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,201
Ok? I mean, he talks about things.

142
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,803
About how he was never there for you,

143
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:57,401
or you mum...

144
00:07:59,607 --> 00:08:01,604
Ok? He doesn't believe that a field agent can have

145
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:03,200
a relationship outside of work.

146
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:05,802
Well, did you ever start to think that
maybe it would make him happy?

147
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:09,003
That his daughter has found someone she loves?

148
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:13,906
Look, I love you too. Ok?

149
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:17,005
I just don't think today is a good day.

150
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:19,402
Chase, I need you to copy me on that list.

151
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,404
Ok, what's this column?

152
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,308
Hmm...That's family and that's legal.

153
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:33,808
- Great.
- Ok.

154
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:39,053
Yeah, I understand but just watch to cross- reference those files with our Latin America files.

155
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:41,076
Yes. I want all the names to printed out.

156
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,088
Ok. Just give that over to my office. Thanks.

157
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,206
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, sweetheart.

158
00:08:53,307 --> 00:08:54,505
You're all right?

159
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:56,804
Yeah. Well, what's going on?

160
00:08:56,905 --> 00:08:58,500
Chase said you were really stressed out.

161
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:01,807
Stressed, what do...what do...
what do you mean'stressed'?

162
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:02,602
You know...

163
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:05,608
Salazar and the terrorists threat.

164
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:07,500
Yeah.

165
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,801
Yeah! Yeah but I think we gonna get it under control. We just got a lot of work to do.

166
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:12,803
Listen, can I talk to you now?

167
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:14,903
Yeah, yeah sure, come in.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,901
Take a seat.

169
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:28,904
Hey, what's going on?

170
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,300
After all we've been through,

171
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:35,504
I find it very difficult to keep things from you...

172
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:38,804
Ok, what's up?

173
00:09:42,403 --> 00:09:45,201
Chase and I have been going out for a while

174
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,502
and it's starting to get serious.

175
00:10:01,004 --> 00:10:03,304
I mean...I think he wanted to be the one to tell you

176
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:06,803
but he was worried that it would
cause a problem between you two.

177
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:11,500
I see...

178
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:15,602
How long are the two of you been seeing each other?

179
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:18,201
Three months.

180
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,602
I really care for him dad.

181
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:33,106
So what do you think?

182
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:36,603
I don't know what I think.

183
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,102
I'm really surprised.

184
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:44,403
And, I'm sorry, I'm a little bit distracted
with everything that's going on today but...

185
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,600
I know but...

186
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:50,406
Forget it. I just had to let you know.

187
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,905
No, no, I'm glad you told me.

188
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:53,603
Ok.

189
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:56,702
- I love you.
- I love you too.

190
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,208
I told him.

191
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,504
What did he say?

192
00:11:15,303 --> 00:11:16,403
Nothing.

193
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:28,697
- Dessler.
- Michelle, it's Sunny.

194
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:30,501
I think I found something that
might be helpful to your guys.

195
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,303
What's that?

196
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,408
I told you I found something odd in Goss's system...

197
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,502
We found an unmetabolised virus particule.

198
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,401
I'll skip techno
- babble. Bottom line: It looks like the virus was delivered in a crystalline form.

199
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:44,402
I mean, maybe what you're looking for is a white powder.

200
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:48,101
So, it would look like a bag
of cocaine or heroine?

201
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:49,404
Yeah, that may be the strategy.

202
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:51,301
Someone thinks that they're selling a bag of coke

203
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,400
well in fact they're handling a virus.

204
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:57,108
Look, Kyle, I'm not gonna do it, ok?

205
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:59,202
I don't care how much you pay me, it's stealing drugs.

206
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,901
Tim, you're my best friend.

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Come on, you've gotta come. Do it for me.

208
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:07,703
Well, look Kyle, you should talked to me before
you went down to Mexico and bought a bag of coke!

209
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,906
I'm not...I'm not asking you to do anything but wait in the car. I'll make the delivery.

210
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:13,202
I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna go with you.

211
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,508
Fine.

212
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,806
Yeah.

213
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:21,908
Kyle, it's Zack.

214
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,499
Zack, hey! What's up?

215
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,204
- We need to talk.
- Hold on a second, man.

216
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:28,507
Who's Zack?

217
00:12:28,702 --> 00:12:29,702
It's nobody.

218
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,500
What's with you guys today?
Everything is a secret.

219
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,907
He's got family stuff going on.

220
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:38,504
What's going on, man?

221
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:39,908
You tell me! You've got the powder?

222
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:41,205
Yeah, yeah, of course I do.

223
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,507
Just tell me when to drop it off.

224
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:44,806
Tonight. Come by around 7:30.

225
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:45,800
7:30, yeah.

226
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:49,600
Can we just go over one more time?
I'd like...how this all thing is gonna go down?

227
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:50,902
Go over what?

228
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,207
You drop off the coke, I give you the money.

229
00:12:53,402 --> 00:12:54,806
Is that too much for you to handle?

230
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:55,507
No!

231
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,808
No, that's totally cool, man.

232
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,206
It'd better be.

233
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:20,800
Yeah.

234
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:21,804
Jack, it's Michelle.

235
00:13:21,908 --> 00:13:23,806
We've got the last known address on David Goss,

236
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:25,800
the infected body that was dropped off
at Health Services.

237
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:26,604
How recent?

238
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:27,702
Two months.

239
00:13:27,804 --> 00:13:30,001
Okay. Have LAPD send over perimeter team.

240
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,202
Tell them hands off until Chase and I get there.

241
00:13:32,305 --> 00:13:33,201
Got it.

242
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:37,703
Chase, let's go around.

243
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,901
You get an address?

244
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:42,806
Yeah.

245
00:13:46,903 --> 00:13:48,607
Make sure they understand.

246
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:50,504
They are not to go in
until Jack gets there, ok?

247
00:13:50,702 --> 00:13:53,907
Hey! Peter just told me you've got
an address on Goss?

248
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,100
Yeah. I'm bringing it over to Jack now.

249
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:57,806
You're sure there's nothing more recent?

250
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,004
We could spend another hour looking,
but there's no guarantee we find anything better.

251
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:05,903
Yeah, we don't have one hour to waste, do we?
Look, put transmitters on Jack and Chase.

252
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:09,208
I wanna be analizing all their interactions
so we can work it up in real time, all right?

253
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:09,905
Ok.

254
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:16,505
Jack.

255
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,708
What have you got?

256
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:21,706
This is everything we have on Goss.
Here is the address where he was arrested for dealing.

257
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:22,503
How recent?

258
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,004
Two months ago. It's all on the file,
you can check it on the way.

259
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:25,704
Good.

260
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,607
- Medical kit that health services has put together for you.
- Thanks, baby.

261
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,605
Be careful.

262
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:37,602
Let's go, Chase!

263
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,703
We've gonna have to wait until we get
there to see what the set- up is.

264
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:50,907
LAPD is locking it down now.

265
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:55,701
And I know Kim told you about us.
I was going to tell you myself, I just couldn't find the right time.

266
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,705
I thought you should know. It's getting serious.

267
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,705
That's what she said.

268
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,800
What does the CTU have to say?

269
00:15:21,902 --> 00:15:24,104
That it could be a very dangerous situation.

270
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:28,704
Almeida sent me a breakdown of what could happen if this virus is released and it's not good.

271
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,302
Give CTU carte blanche.

272
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,107
- Whatever they need, make sure they get it.
- I did.

273
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:36,103
We should cancel the debate.

274
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:36,700
What?

275
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:41,604
It's a mistake to continue preparing for tonight while there is an imminent bio- terrorist threat against this country.

276
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,805
First of all, we don't know that is imminent, David.

277
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:49,807
And you know just as well as I do
that we get threats everyday.

278
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,301
Not like this one.

279
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:54,405
They said the body was infected
with a weaponized virus.

280
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:56,104
Ok, let's say you're right.

281
00:15:56,806 --> 00:16:00,006
What do really think you could do
if you put your full attention on it?

282
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:08,405
I just wanna make sure that you're not advising me how to fear that my image will suffer if we cancel.

283
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,201
Oh no, it will suffer.

284
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:17,900
But I still think the best thing to do is to procede
as planned and respond when we have more information.

285
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,401
Keeler's here.

286
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:28,808
Come on, let's go this way.

287
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,203
Don't worry, Wayne.

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,907
John!

289
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:38,007
Mr. President. You don't have to come away down here just to welcome me.

290
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,206
No, it's no trouble.

291
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:42,505
I spoke with your old friend Jacob Weisz
yesterday at a fund raiser.

292
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:43,902
You stopped at South Dakota?

293
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:44,902
Just for dinner.

294
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:46,302
How is he feeling?

295
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:49,404
Better. Much better.
He's even playing a few rounds of golf.

296
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:50,908
That's him.

297
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,534
Well, I don't wanna keep you John.

298
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:56,801
I know you have a lot of last minute cramming to do if you wanna survive this debate.

299
00:16:57,436 --> 00:16:59,023
I woon't argue with you there, Mr. President.

300
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:03,330
Your resource staff - compliments of the tax payers -
outnumbers mine, three to one.

301
00:17:03,435 --> 00:17:05,103
I actually have to pay some of them myself!

302
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:06,305
Touché!

303
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:08,608
I'll see you inside, sir.

304
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,007
You certainly will, sir.

305
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,206
Wayne, we're ready.

306
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:27,503
What were you talking to him about?

307
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:30,105
I think we may have a opportunity.

308
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:32,208
What kind of opportunity?

309
00:17:33,107 --> 00:17:34,708
Not now, after.

310
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,407
I'm sorry if you think
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

311
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,404
Ok? But I can't help the way I feel.

312
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:57,100
Chase, what do you think
I put Kim at CTU?

313
00:17:57,307 --> 00:17:59,407
Behind a desk, working on a computer?

314
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:02,202
So I can keep an eye on her,
make sure she's safe!

315
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:05,003
Not so she can start dating some field agent!

316
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:06,200
Safe?

317
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:09,103
You know you're talking about her like she's 12 years old. She's a grown woman.

318
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:11,702
Damn it Chase, you've seen what this job can do to you.

319
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:14,708
You've seen what it's done to me.
It ruined every relationship I ever had!

320
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:16,505
- That's you, Jack...
- No!

321
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:18,408
No, it's the job!

322
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:20,401
I don't think so.

323
00:18:21,106 --> 00:18:23,404
You don't think so...
What the hell do you know?

324
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,602
My wife died because of this job.

325
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:30,508
And I almost lost Kim too.
I'm not gonna let that happen again.

326
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:34,704
I will do everything I have to to protect her.
Do you understand me? Everything!

327
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:42,105
Damn it Chase, you cannot have a normal life
and do this job at the same time.

328
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,207
So, you're saying that I shouldn't have
any relationship with anyone?

329
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:48,802
That's exactly what I'm saying.

330
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,105
And especially with my daughter.

331
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:00,104
Agent Bauer?

332
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,601
Jack, it's Luis.

333
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,404
What's up?

334
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:07,700
You tell me. I've tried to move Salazar back
to solitary but there is a lockdown from Division.

335
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:09,107
What's that all about?

336
00:19:09,206 --> 00:19:10,508
I can't tell you right now.

337
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:14,301
Jack, the bastard murdered his attorney right in front of us.

338
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,800
What the hell is Division doing protecting him?

339
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,402
They're not protecting him.

340
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:19,106
Then what?

341
00:19:20,005 --> 00:19:21,100
I can't get into it right now.

342
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:22,203
Can't get into it?

343
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,801
You're not the only one who gave up
a chunk of his life to put this guy away!

344
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:27,400
I need to be in the loop Jack!

345
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:32,900
This information doesn't go anywhere
after you hang up the phone.

346
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:33,702
What?

347
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,307
Salazar might walk.

348
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:37,506
Walk?

349
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:38,306
What are you talking about?

350
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:43,004
Look, I don't think it's gonna get to that.
But someone on the outside has got a lot of leverage.

351
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:43,802
Who?

352
00:19:45,003 --> 00:19:46,400
I think it's his brother, Hector.

353
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't believe this!

354
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:51,807
- Just hang tight. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
- Yeah. All right.

355
00:19:55,702 --> 00:20:01,103
You'd better star thinking about what we're gonna do when we get there. We'll talk about this later.

356
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:01,907
Fine.

357
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:10,208
Open the door.
Let's go.

358
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,500
- Open 12.
- Copy that.

359
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,551
¿Luis, me hace encontrado nuevo abogado ya?

360
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:45,100
No, I haven't found your new lawyer.

361
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,806
About an execution day?

362
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:51,405
Uh! Someone's not happy?

363
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,907
What do you know, Ramón?

364
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:54,308
About?

365
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:10,608
- Talk to me.
- Talk to you about what?

366
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:13,701
What is your brother trying to do?

367
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:16,803
Hector? Have you heard from him?
How is he?

368
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,308
His birthday's coming up next week.
I don't even know what to get him.

369
00:21:21,607 --> 00:21:23,905
You keep talking trash, man.

370
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:26,503
You're not going anywhere!

371
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:29,702
Maybe not!

372
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,003
But let me insure you of one thing:

373
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:37,786
If something does happen and
I am unexpectedly allowed to go free,

374
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,820
I have no doubt that you'll come looking for me.

375
00:21:42,103 --> 00:21:45,102
Especially after the death of your wife, Elise.

376
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:50,504
And your two boys, what are their names?
Thomas and Luis Junior?

377
00:22:03,302 --> 00:22:06,505
- Any follow- up phone calls from the terrorists?
- No.

378
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:09,903
So basically, there's nothing new to report to the President?

379
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:13,702
Not until I hear from Bauer. He's following a lead right now.

380
00:22:13,803 --> 00:22:15,006
All right, Tony. Thanks.

381
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:20,405
So, if you excuse me until this evening's debate? Thank you.

382
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:26,107
That went well.

383
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:29,002
Yes, it did.
So, what's the latest?

384
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:33,901
Nothing yet. CTU is working a lead.
Trying to figure out who dropped off the dead body.

385
00:22:34,002 --> 00:22:35,904
So, they still don't know who's behind this threat?

386
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,104
No, they're still speculating on Salazar's brother, Hector.

387
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,705
What they don't is if it's a bluff staged to release Salazar.

388
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:47,700
And how can it be a bluff?
The virus has been confirmed.

389
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:52,981
Yes but dropping off a dead body is one thing, David. Being able to infect an entire city,

390
00:22:53,032 --> 00:22:54,394
that's something different.

391
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:58,105
All right. I guess we'll know soon enough.

392
00:23:00,106 --> 00:23:00,707
Hey! Wayne.

393
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:04,800
You spoke earlier about an opportunity.

394
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:10,005
Yeah...Yeah but I'm not really sure that's
something we need to discuss right now.

395
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,403
Which means...

396
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:17,502
whatever it is fell through or you know I'm not
going to like it so you're proceding without me.

397
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,501
No, that's not it. I just think that because of
this threat, I don't wanna divert your attention.

398
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:28,100
Like walk and chew gum at the same time.
What is it?

399
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,107
Keeler's playbook.

400
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:37,103
What if I can get us a copy?

401
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,707
What exactly do you mean by "playbook"?

402
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:42,000
His entire prep for tonight's debate.

403
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:47,103
How's he gonna answer the questions,
what issues he's gonna try to review up on. Everything.

404
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:51,607
And how would we get it?

405
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:53,600
You don't need to know the details.

406
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm surprised.

407
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,706
About what?

408
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:09,806
The question. You know there's no way
on Earth that I would ever agree to this.

409
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:15,100
David I'm not...I am not talking about pulling a Sherry and stealing it.

410
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:19,603
Now it may just drop in our laps.
And if it does why shouldn't we look at it?

411
00:24:20,802 --> 00:24:24,600
Wayne, you are not in the private sector anymore.

412
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:28,502
You have to get use to how
my administration works.

413
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:32,701
And I'm just trying to give your
administration 4 more years.

414
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:42,601
Ok...Ok, if that's how you want it.

415
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,101
That's how I want it.

416
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:01,106
Hey! Kim, you are all caught up?

417
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:04,401
Pretty much. I just have to refresh
the data of my dad's panel.

418
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,000
Great.

419
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,402
Can I ask you a question about you and Tony?

420
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:12,401
Me and Tony what?

421
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:15,700
I don't know, I was just wondering is it...

422
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:20,206
a problem working with your
husband in the same office?

423
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,202
No, no, it's...not a problem.
Why do you ask?

424
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:26,402
It's not a big deal.

425
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:27,600
No, it's ok, we have a minute.

426
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:33,506
Well, I've been dating Chase and
I don't think my dad's too happy about it.

427
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:38,303
I see. Well...

428
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,307
I'm sure your dad is just trying to protect you but...

429
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,902
ultimately, it's just between you and Chase.

430
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:46,804
Yeah, I know.

431
00:25:48,306 --> 00:25:50,006
Right, let me know when you
finish those panels, ok?

432
00:25:50,101 --> 00:25:51,005
Sure.

433
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,900
Analysits just called.

434
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:06,908
They determined that if Hector Salazar is orchestrating this bio- threat, he's probably operating in the Northen Mexico.

435
00:26:07,006 --> 00:26:09,003
So, we're gonna need a list
of his properties down there.

436
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:12,600
Chloe's working on it, she's going through
the brief files that Jack turned in after the bust.

437
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,207
All right. I'll talk to her.

438
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:15,203
Also...

439
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:20,208
Fire up all our contacts and just in case Hector was stupid
enough to show his face in the last couple days, all right?

440
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:21,405
Ok.

441
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,100
Is the boy still in place?

442
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:31,106
Yeah.

443
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,305
And the President has been informed?

444
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:36,307
Yeah and he's not cancelling the debate.

445
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,300
He's got some'cojones', I'll give him that.

446
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:43,404
Let's see what kind of tough guy he is when
there's a couple of million lives in the line.

447
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,400
¡Sólo quiero lo mejor para ti!
¡Y no quiero preocuparme!

448
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,800
- Papa, no tengo miedo. Sé lo que estoy haciendo.
- ¡No sabes hija!

449
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:57,650
Soy suficiente grande para hacer mis proprias decisiones!

450
00:26:58,008 --> 00:26:59,308
Claudia!

451
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:07,207
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Everything's fine.

452
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:10,907
Don't tell me nothing!
Why are you arguing with your father?

453
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,606
Please, Hector, it doesn't matter.

454
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,206
He's not happy with how I live my life.

455
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:25,200
You mean he doesn't like
you being with me?

456
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:34,508
¿Piensa que su hija es muy buena para mi?

457
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:36,100
Por su puesto que no, señor.

458
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:45,600
Don't raise your voice to your father ever again.

459
00:27:48,706 --> 00:27:49,808
Claudia, no!

460
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:56,206
How I conduct myself with my father is my concern. Not yours!

461
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:17,505
Good.
Now that's said.

462
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:22,305
Tell Lucia and to prepare supper, ok?

463
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:36,406
Ok, I'll tell him.

464
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,007
- Almeida
- Tony, it's Chloe. I just get off the phone with Jack. They've just arrived.

465
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:46,403
All right, is there a problem?

466
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,501
Jack's not going to use the transmitters.

467
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,204
Why not?

468
00:28:49,305 --> 00:28:51,502
He says that would take too long to wire them up.

469
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:58,202
Whatever. Look, you're learning point from his side, any information he digs up I want it right away. You got it?

470
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,706
Ok, you don't have to yell.

471
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:02,901
No one's yelling, Chloe.

472
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:05,305
Look, we got a body infected with a deadly virus.

473
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:08,302
Somehow, we have to tie it to Salazar in the next 3 hours.

474
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,807
Right now, Jack's location is our only lead.

475
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:13,505
So, I need you to keep me up to the minute.
Understood?

476
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:17,000
- I already said ok.
- Good, then get on it.

477
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:26,305
Detective Fisher.

478
00:29:26,403 --> 00:29:27,402
Yeah, you're Bauer?

479
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,204
Yeah. He's my partner, Chase Edmunds.

480
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:30,301
What's the activity?

481
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,203
No one's get in and out since we got here.

482
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:33,701
How is the inside layout.

483
00:29:33,803 --> 00:29:35,807
About 30 people total,
spread out on all floors.

484
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:39,407
The apartment you asked the case is
the corner one there on the third floor.

485
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:40,902
You didn't go in there, right?

486
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:42,708
I was ordered to stand down until you got there.

487
00:29:42,901 --> 00:29:45,406
- Good.
- How much back- up you want?

488
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,302
None. Right now I want your men just to cover the exits.

489
00:29:48,408 --> 00:29:49,802
None? There's 30 scumbags in there.

490
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:51,807
Yeah, we don't want to set off any alarms.

491
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:53,602
Two of us can sneak in without a fight.

492
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:54,705
You're sure about that?

493
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:58,105
Yeah. Get this open on channel 1, we'll let you know when we want you to come in.

494
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:58,803
You're ready?

495
00:29:59,308 --> 00:30:00,201
Let's go.

496
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:01,103
You got it.

497
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,106
The stair is not open to the public?

498
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:58,312
Just take it easy, sport.
We're not here to take anybody down.

499
00:30:58,464 --> 00:30:59,625
We just want a little information.

500
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,507
They come!

501
00:31:15,604 --> 00:31:16,502
Chase!

502
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,300
Get back!

503
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:24,508
Come on!

504
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:40,003
Chase, we got a runner!

505
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:31,405
Don't even think about it!

506
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:33,301
I'm clean, I've got nothing on me!

507
00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:35,003
Shut up, stupid!

508
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:37,107
You've just fired a federal agent.

509
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,801
You'd better start talking to me.

510
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:41,407
Or I will let you bleed to death right here on this landing.

511
00:32:41,504 --> 00:32:43,701
Chase! I got him, we're down there!

512
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:46,101
Hey Fisher, we got him. We got our suspect.

513
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:50,206
- Who is David Goss?
- Goss is a dealer, I just score for him sometimes.

514
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,503
Well not anymore. He's dead.

515
00:32:51,608 --> 00:32:53,602
Ok, he's dead.

516
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:56,207
Don't be a smartass.

517
00:32:56,303 --> 00:32:59,900
Who is his supplier?
Who is his supplier?

518
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:03,104
Chase!

519
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:12,807
A guy Carlos Corretja,
he works in Tijuana!

520
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,808
Corretja is one of Salazar's mid- level distributors.

521
00:33:15,901 --> 00:33:17,208
You're doing business with him?

522
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,220
I'm supposed to call him tonight.

523
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:23,223
Corretja wanted me to find a mule,
someone clean without a record.

524
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:23,807
What for?

525
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:26,802
He wanted to move a small bag of coke across the border.

526
00:33:26,902 --> 00:33:29,065
- It didn't make any sense to me!
- Why not?

527
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:31,102
He payed $10, 000 to bring it up.

528
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,208
Coke isn't even worth that much.

529
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:36,804
- Where's the bag of coke now?
- The guy who brought it across still has it.

530
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:40,808
- What's his name?
- His name is Kyle, Kyle Singer.

531
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:46,200
Sorry Helen, it's business...

532
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,300
What is...What is this?

533
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,301
It's a final announce.

534
00:33:52,103 --> 00:33:57,801
If you don't pay the rent by tomorrow morning 8 am, I'm calling city services and they start the eviction process.

535
00:33:57,908 --> 00:34:02,808
Don...Don't do this, no please!
I'm gonna have it in a couple of days.

536
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:04,201
I can't take care of you.

537
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:18,405
I'll get back.

538
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,508
How much you own him, 'ma?

539
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:28,806
- Stay out of this.
- How much?

540
00:34:29,107 --> 00:34:34,808
$800. But don't you worry about it because your father is gonna talk to uncle Stanford.

541
00:34:49,706 --> 00:34:51,471
Hey! $800, right?

542
00:34:57,103 --> 00:35:01,802
And frpm now, if you have a problem,
talk to me or my dad. Ok?

543
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,403
Leave my mum out of it.

544
00:35:04,808 --> 00:35:06,502
I expect your receive in the mailbox.

545
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,601
Where did you get that money?

546
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:22,904
It doesn't matter. Ok?
We needed it.

547
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:24,306
I got it.

548
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,304
Can I have everybody's attention, please?

549
00:35:30,901 --> 00:35:33,407
Everyone should be working
on the name Kyle Singer.

550
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:36,906
All right, I want points chief from department's heads on my desk in the next 5 minutes.

551
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,500
Everything there is to know about Kyle Singer,

552
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:39,402
I want it.

553
00:35:39,506 --> 00:35:41,001
Where he lives, where he works,

554
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:43,400
and most importantly,
where he's likely to be right now.

555
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,604
Also, keep an open channel to Fields Ops so that Chloe can forward anything that comes in back to Jack.

556
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:48,908
All right. Let's go!

557
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,000
- What are you doing?
- Narrowing the search space.

558
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:06,203
I can't believe you're so stupid, Kyle.

559
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:08,302
So, this is how you're gonna your family?

560
00:36:08,406 --> 00:36:09,803
By dealing drugs?

561
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:15,203
I'm not dealing them. Stupid delivery.
It's quick money which my folks need right now.

562
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,206
But where they're gonna get the money to bail you out of jail, Kyle?

563
00:36:26,206 --> 00:36:27,502
Ok, you're right.

564
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,606
It's stupid. I know that.

565
00:36:32,104 --> 00:36:33,702
But I did it.

566
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,806
And I'm in this now.

567
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:38,103
I'm in the middle of this...

568
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:41,908
Look, I'll make this delivery tonight. All right?

569
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:45,800
I promise, it's gonna be over. I promise you!

570
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,807
I'm not waiting until tonight,
it's over now.

571
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:51,303
What are you talking about?

572
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:56,802
I can't be with someone who does stuff like this.

573
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:00,704
I'm sorry.

574
00:37:03,106 --> 00:37:04,000
Linda!

575
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,704
Linda, please.

576
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:07,807
Over, Kyle.

577
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:12,806
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

578
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:17,208
We just have a little disagreement, that's all.

579
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:18,803
Where did you get the money to pay Don?

580
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:20,300
Mum, forget about it, please.

581
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,608
What's your dad gonna say when he finds out?

582
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:25,408
He's not gonna take "forget about it" as an aswer.

583
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:31,708
I don't know.

584
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,200
Would you excuse us, please?

585
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:46,104
I'm sorry, Anne.
Our schedule has been way off today.

586
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:47,908
No! I think you were unable to join me so...

587
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:50,605
I am not.
I have a couple of minutes.

588
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,303
I'm having your security level upgraded.

589
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,804
I'm gonna need your advice today.

590
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,201
What's going on?

591
00:37:57,307 --> 00:38:01,000
What do you know about type 3 immuno- viruses?

592
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:04,106
Not a lot, they're fairly new.

593
00:38:04,204 --> 00:38:08,700
As far as I know there are several strains, most of them fast acting and all are deadly.

594
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:12,408
Someone's threatening to release
a virus here in L. A.

595
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:13,004
Oh God!

596
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,201
I need to talk to a Doctor Sunny Macer
at National Health Services.

597
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:18,304
Yeah, I know...I know Sunny.

598
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,507
But David, don't you think there's a remote possiblity that this thing is for real?

599
00:38:23,606 --> 00:38:26,003
You need to get out of Los Angeles.

600
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:27,505
That's not possible.

601
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:29,406
The debate is in little over two hours.

602
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,806
No, don't tell me about the debate.

603
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:32,501
We're talking about an outbreak here in the city.

604
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:36,505
This isn't something the Secret Service
can't protect you against this.

605
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:42,604
I know...I know Anne. We are prepared
to leave if the situation warrants it.

606
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:45,507
But right now, I need you
to talk to Dr. Sunny Macer

607
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:47,505
and learn everything you can about this thing.

608
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,500
I will.

609
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,704
That's ok, that's all right.

610
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:06,508
Your brother would like to speak with you, sir.

611
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:07,608
Well, send him in.

612
00:39:07,707 --> 00:39:10,800
He's downstairs. He requests
that you come see him.

613
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:12,004
Come see him?

614
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,504
Yes, sir.
He has something to show you down there.

615
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:16,600
You go ahead, I'm gonna call Sunny.

616
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,302
See you later.

617
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:25,305
No, I'm gonna check that out myself.

618
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:29,103
Chase is bringing the suspect in the CTU.
I want you to set up a wait room for him now.

619
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:32,202
I need you to take Parker down to CTU.

620
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:33,008
What about Kyle Singer?

621
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,502
I'm gonna take care of Singer.
I want you to take care of Parker.

622
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:38,300
Anybody can take him at CTU and set him up,
I'm going with you to get Singer.

623
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:39,802
No, you're not.

624
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:42,103
Why are you trying to get rid of me?

625
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,402
I'm not trying to get rid of you.

626
00:39:43,502 --> 00:39:46,404
I still think that Parker's got more information
and I want you to get it out of him.

627
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:47,608
Is this about Kim?

628
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:50,304
Are you punishing me for dating your daughter?

629
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:51,208
You listen to me.

630
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:57,702
That kid is walking around a bag of cocaine that's got the virus and he doesn't know it. I need to find him and stop him from putting it into circulation. ~

631
00:39:57,807 --> 00:39:59,600
Yeah, I know. That's why I wanna help you.

632
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,603
But you can't, it's too dangerous.

633
00:40:01,704 --> 00:40:02,507
Too dangerous?

634
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:05,202
You can have a both ways, Chase.

635
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:07,207
My daughter loves you, you wanna be with her?

636
00:40:07,308 --> 00:40:09,402
Then, I have to stop putting you in harm's way.

637
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,401
You're kidding, right?

638
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:15,005
Take Parker to CTU, that's an order.

639
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:32,304
Yeah. I call you right back.

640
00:40:35,805 --> 00:40:38,704
Excuse us for a minute.

641
00:40:40,903 --> 00:40:42,905
What is it, Wayne?

642
00:40:47,806 --> 00:40:51,104
Don't be angry, David, but I got
a copy of Keeler's playbook.

643
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,800
Damn it! I told you to drop that!

644
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:55,861
You just listen to me.
If you don't wanna use it then don't.

645
00:40:56,503 --> 00:40:58,800
But there is something you need to see.

646
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:01,001
There's nothing I need to see.

647
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:03,003
It's about Anne.

648
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:08,205
Keeler is too smart to play
the race card or the girlfriend card.

649
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:10,903
It's not the one of those
which is why I'm bringing this to you.

650
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,803
It's something that we didn't know about her.

651
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:19,403
Something that, if true, could...

652
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:24,406
David, it could damage all of us.

653
00:41:24,502 --> 00:41:27,208
Just take a look at it.

654
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:07,607
Yeah.

655
00:42:07,706 --> 00:42:09,608
Give me an update.

656
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:11,001
Kyle is still in his house.

657
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,406
What about the package?

658
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:14,003
It's with him.

659
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:15,005
And Ramón?

660
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:16,704
Just waiting to come home.

661
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:17,900
Good.

662
00:42:50,104 --> 00:42:52,103
Gael, there you are.

663
00:42:52,207 --> 00:42:53,802
Chloe has been looking for you.

664
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,602
Where is she?

665
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:55,806
She's in I. T.

666
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:56,707
All right.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
