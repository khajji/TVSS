1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,794
Hope?

2
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:05,730
The child is Hope?

3
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:12,034
I’m sorry.  I never meant to lie.

4
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:15,220
Xena, I couldn’t kill her.

5
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,167
She’s my daughter.
You’re a mother,

6
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:19,827
you know this!
I had to save her.

7
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:22,387
Maybe it’s not too late.
She’s young.

8
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:24,387
Poison’ll kill her if her
powers aren’t mature.

9
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,233
Poison?
Xena, she is my child!

10
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:29,690
She is not a child!

11
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,984
She is a body, a vessel,
an instrument for evil.

12
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:35,659
That is all!

13
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:03,713
I’m ready!  I’m ready!  I’m ready!
I’m ready!

14
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:17,506
Gabrielle?  Hey, you OK?

15
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:19,725
I can’t.

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,539
What’s the matter?  Huh?

17
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,792
I can’t do this.

18
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:28,870
OK.  Uh, then, then, we won’t.
We don’t have to.  Uh,

19
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:31,801
never again.
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,341
I have to go.

21
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:35,769
Go?  Go where?

22
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,083
Hey, Xena told us to meet her
near the temple of Mnemosyne.

23
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,004
I don’t think it’s such a great idea

24
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:42,243
to be walking around these, wait.

25
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,584
Wait!  Hey!  Hey.  Hey, hey, hey,

26
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:49,725
Look, OK, I, I don’t know what’s up.

27
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:51,633
But I know something’s wrong.

28
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,683
Maybe I can help you.

29
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:54,021
No one can help.

30
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,962
It’s my memories.
I can’t shake them.

31
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:00,180
I, I can’t sleep.

32
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:01,084
I can’t eat.

33
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:02,324
It’s like I’m paying for something,

34
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,334
but I don’t know what it is.

35
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:07,024
I have to find the answer.

36
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:08,899
OK, OK, OK, we’ll- we’ll,

37
00:02:09,115 --> 00:02:10,976
meet up with Xena later, OK?

38
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,557
Joxer, I have to do this alone.

39
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,193
Wait here.

40
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,229
Wait!  How long?

41
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:17,673
I don’t know.

42
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:27,399
That’s long enough.

43
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:37,358
Is this the temple of Mnemosyne?

44
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,314
Was I supposed to bring something?

45
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:45,882
An offering?

46
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:48,864
Hello.

47
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:55,568
Wait.

48
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,372
Sorry, do I know you?

49
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,974
No.  I’m not from here.

50
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:03,125
Am I?

51
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,153
Excuse me?

52
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:09,652
Wait, did you see her?

53
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,263
You saw the Priestess of Mnemosyne,
didn’t you?

54
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,266
And your memories

55
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:31,241
The Priestess will see you now.

56
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,246
Will I end up like her?

57
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,605
You have questions that
need to be answered?

58
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:37,609
Yes.

59
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:42,292
I have pain, incredible pain.

60
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:45,187
I want it to end.

61
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:48,110
Erasing the pain of memory
comes with a price.

62
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:51,115
Are you prepared to lose everything
you’ve ever known?

63
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,461
Yes, I’m prepared.

64
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,021
Enter.

65
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:23,593
Mnemosyne, goddess of memory.

66
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:25,888
You are haunted by memories,

67
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:28,033
images from your past.

68
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:31,123
You want to understand
why they still haunt you.

69
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:33,093
How did you know that?

70
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:35,600
When you entered the temple,

71
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:39,062
your memories became  Mnemosyne’s,
became mine.

72
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:42,833
We know more about you than
you know about yourself.

73
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:45,092
But then, that is why you’re here,

74
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,718
to find that part out about you,
that you don’t know.

75
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:50,905
Can you help me?

76
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,904
Perhaps.

77
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,245
Your memories are like a body of water.

78
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:59,166
Some flow deep, out of your reach.

79
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:01,528
Others flow easily on the surface.

80
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:05,044
Ah, this one’s  yours.

81
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:10,684
You could open a pottery shop.

82
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,277
Fill the bowl from the jug.

83
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:20,908
There is one bowl filled

84
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:22,945
for every person who comes to us.

85
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:24,969
Filled with what?

86
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,624
Memories, answers.

87
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,947
Gabrielle, you’re about to take

88
00:06:30,137 --> 00:06:31,325
a journey through your memories.

89
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:33,499
Like a dreamscape?

90
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,885
Do not confuse dreams
with memories.

91
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,810
Your memory has three rivers.

92
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:40,072
To find the answer to your pain,

93
00:06:40,338 --> 00:06:41,687
you must cross them all.

94
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:43,354
Once you find the answer,

95
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:44,886
you will have to decide.

96
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:46,665
Decide what?

97
00:06:47,216 --> 00:06:49,978
On whether to keep your
past or forever lose it.

98
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,933
This bowl will hold everything you know.

99
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,402
If it is ever emptied,
so goes your memory.

100
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:00,937
Do you understand the risk?

101
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:07,138
I’ve decided.
I need to know.

102
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,761
Tough guys, eh?

103
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,198
Well, my friend’s in there,
and I wanna see her!

104
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:23,380
You can see her when she comes out.

105
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,847
She is with the Priestess of Mnemosyne,
now.

106
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,008
Oh, yeah?

107
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:29,995
Well, um, I got news for ya.

108
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,710
I’ll be back.

109
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:39,511
You’re both on my list.

110
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:43,375
And I’m not taking any names!

111
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:04,865
Gabrielle?
Gabriellllle!

112
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:16,768
Ha!  Now I will destroy you
with the ultimate power!

113
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,836
Gabrielle!

114
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,422
She is on her journey, Joxer.

115
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:35,784
That Gabrielle is just an empty shell,

116
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:37,188
with no realization of her past.

117
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:40,862
Get away from her.

118
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:44,125
How’d you know my name?

119
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,751
I have your memories, ow.

120
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:48,533
Whatever.

121
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,110
I’m gettin’ her out of here.

122
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,469
Don’t try and stop me.

123
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:56,024
Your feelings give you away.

124
00:09:58,486 --> 00:09:59,303
If you love her,

125
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:02,378
allow her the chance to
lose the pain she carries.

126
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:03,752
It’s in her memory.

127
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,802
Yeah? Well, I can make her forget.

128
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,899
I’m a very forgettable person!

129
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,095
I wouldn’t do that if I were you.

130
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,593
What are you doing here?

131
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:48,960
You don’t know?

132
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:53,353
Oh, yeah, the memory thing, right?

133
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:55,592
Got a problem up here?

134
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,778
Bad thoughts keeping you up nights?

135
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,076
Believe it or not,

136
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:03,192
I’m here to protect you.

137
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:05,999
Remember when you,

138
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,603
stole my powers with that whole,
scroll business?

139
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:11,375
I know, call me a big softie, but,

140
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,032
I decided I like you after all.

141
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,032
Maybe you’re here for your
own selfish reasons.

142
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,314
Aren’t you?

143
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:29,875
It’s called the ‘River of Wailing.’

144
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,092
And just remember,
I did warn you.

145
00:11:45,276 --> 00:11:46,812
This isn’t so bad, Ares.

146
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,983
‘River of Wailing,’
is it?

147
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,642
Ah!   Look out!

148
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:13,851
Gabrielle!

149
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,592
I thought you were different from her.

150
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,173
I thought you had a regard for life,
no matter whose.

151
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:39,898
You’re not going to die,
Crassus.

152
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,547
I said I’d switch you.

153
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,993
if the guards recognize
who you are,

154
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:46,429
I have no control over that.

155
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:48,514
Don’t rely on that.

156
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,245
Most of Rome doesn’t
know what I look like,

157
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,638
let alone the prison guards.

158
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:56,275
You will with this,
your imperial ring.

159
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:59,275
It identifies you in every province.

160
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,166
Show this to the guards
once we’re gone.

161
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,887
I’m, sorry about
what I said.

162
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,177
Wait.  What’re you, ?
I’m not Vercinix!

163
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:09,274
I’m Crassus!

164
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:11,522
I’m not Vercinix!
I’m Crassus!

165
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,051
you, my ring!  My imperial ring!

166
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,559
Tell them who I am!

167
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,732
Yeah!
Caesar!  No!

168
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,424
Caesar!

169
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:14,514
‘The River of Woe.’

170
00:14:15,027 --> 00:14:15,783
You know?

171
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:17,087
It isn’t any better than the

172
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:18,310
one you just went through.

173
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:22,376
Think about it.

174
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:24,919
I have.

175
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,800
The last one took me by suprise, but,

176
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:29,387
I’m ready for this.

177
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:32,347
I hope so.
This river runs deep.

178
00:14:54,377 --> 00:14:55,351
Oh.  OK.  Wait here.

179
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:00,795
These are your scrolls.

180
00:15:01,044 --> 00:15:02,018
You wrote them.

181
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:04,871
This is your bag.

182
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:13,092
This, is your staff.

183
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,215
Sound familiar now?

184
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:22,089
Sorry,
Jerkster.

185
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:23,340
Joxer.

186
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:26,122
Joxer?
Nothing seems familiar,

187
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:27,481
In fact,

188
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,121
I don’t even know
what familiar feels like.

189
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:31,326
High priestess was right,

190
00:15:31,768 --> 00:15:33,499
gates are open,
but no one’s stormin’ the castle.

191
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:45,915
Now, I, am going to,

192
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,790
teach you about yourself.

193
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,673
I’m going to give  you
your memories back.

194
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,687
OK?  But, just the good ones,

195
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:57,315
none of the painful ones.

196
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,538
That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?

197
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,595
I don’t know.

198
00:16:05,604 --> 00:16:06,504
Sit down.

199
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:11,868
Sit!  Sit!

200
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:19,509
I’ll fix this right now.
OK.  Good!

201
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,401
The first one, ‘Sins of the Past.’

202
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:28,082
‘It was a, warm day in,Poteidaia

203
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,022
when the bard awoke.

204
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:31,910
As she, moved softly through the,
Excuse me.

205
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:32,868
Y-yeah?

206
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:34,284
What’s a Poteidaia?

207
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,948
So, found a bit of an ice bridge.

208
00:16:57,822 --> 00:16:59,228
Good, very good.

209
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:00,010
If I can,

210
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:01,306
if I can just stay above the water,

211
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,729
it can’t hurt me.

212
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:04,544
interesting.

213
00:17:04,978 --> 00:17:06,526
There’s an analogy here, of course,

214
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,040
the water representing our torments,

215
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,776
the ice, the thin layer of control

216
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:11,532
we’d like to believe that we have over it.

217
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:12,302
Shut up!

218
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:13,990
But it’s a false confidence

219
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,959
if the ice should suddenly develop a,

220
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:23,272
Help me.

221
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:24,799
Not my job, my dear.

222
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:26,392
Well, not yet, anyway.

223
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:39,883
I’m sorry, Xena.

224
00:17:39,987 --> 00:17:41,266
I couldn’t let you do this.

225
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:43,892
Is the green dragon a person?

226
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:45,331
Yes.

227
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:46,613
Which person?

228
00:17:48,437 --> 00:17:49,833
The one I’m gonna kill.

229
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:52,832
So, you have nothing
to say in your defense,Xena.

230
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:59,893
Xena.
So be it.

231
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,242
Tomorow, at dawn,

232
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:03,767
you’ll experience this
life for the last time.

233
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:15,816
You owe someone so much,

234
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:17,394
that you would just throw

235
00:18:17,565 --> 00:18:18,739
away these last few years.

236
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,363
Yes.

237
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,165
Yah!  Say it!

238
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:35,643
Xena, if you promise them,

239
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,146
they will banish you.

240
00:18:40,194 --> 00:18:43,759
Please,
we can ride away from this.

241
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,678
Prepared for that, were you?

242
00:18:58,257 --> 00:19:00,082
I can’t continue.  I-it’s too much.

243
00:19:05,301 --> 00:19:07,275
That’s the spirit.  Let it go!

244
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,773
I mean, what does it matter?

245
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:11,054
Pain is just nature’s
way of saying, ‘Hey!

246
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:14,803
You’re alive.’  Accept it.
Who needs the true?

247
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:18,523
I can go back.  I have the answer.

248
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:20,802
Do you, now?
Yes.

249
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,163
I thought that I’d never come to terms,

250
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:25,802
with my mistakes.

251
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:30,778
But I did, when I visited Xena,

252
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,097
in Ming T’ien’s prison.

253
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,987
Can we talk?

254
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,083
Of course not.

255
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:50,647
I betrayed you.

256
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,558
The pathetic thing is,

257
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,864
I thought I was saving you.

258
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,901
My reverence for life kept a
brutal tyrant in power,

259
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:06,992
and led to my best
friend’s execution.

260
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:12,431
I know you hate me, Xena,

261
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,404
no more than I hate myself.

262
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,933
Scratch my nose, will you?

263
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:38,978
Come on.

264
00:20:51,467 --> 00:20:53,855
You see?
Now I know.

265
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,121
Is this something you,
just realized?

266
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,199
Yes.  I, I have come to terms with it.

267
00:21:04,902 --> 00:21:06,845
I just didn’t realize it.

268
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:10,248
It has to be the answer- swer, right?

269
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:17,374
You, are such a smart little girl.

270
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:21,279
That’s what I like about you.

271
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:25,434
Now go, back through
the ‘River of Woe’,

272
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:29,532
toward home.

273
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:32,702
Don’t worry.

274
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,733
If anything happens,
I’ll be here to save you.

275
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:36,108
That is, if it doesn’t bother

276
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:37,674
you owing a favor
to the god of war.

277
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:54,089
I was right.

278
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:57,298
I can’t see my memories anymore.

279
00:22:05,031 --> 00:22:05,312
No!

280
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:07,571
What is this?!

281
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,214
Stop it!

282
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,225
No!

283
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:51,263
I guess you were wrong.

284
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:52,802
Nice try, though.

285
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:56,336
You, said you’d, save me.

286
00:22:57,118 --> 00:22:58,414
No, no.  What I said was,

287
00:22:58,575 --> 00:23:01,108
‘I would be here to save you,
and I am.

288
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:03,396
I can’t go back.

289
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:04,304
I can’t go forward.

290
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,261
I don’t know what to do.

291
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:10,023
Well, seems to me
the answer’s obvious.

292
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:14,961
You could stay here for
all eternity or, death.

293
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:19,615
Just tryin’ to help.

294
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:28,867
It’s very strange.

295
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,263
With every story you tell me,

296
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:32,884
this thing I’m wearing gets smaller.

297
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,585
Is it enchanted?

298
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,934
Uh, yeah.  They, uh, they are.  It is.

299
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,319
Gotta, be around here, somewhere.

300
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:46,463
I know sh, you wrote about it.

301
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,163
Jerkster, do I live around here?

302
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:54,060
It’s Joxer, not Jerkster.
It’s Joxer.  And no, you don’t.

303
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,504
You, wander around, with,

304
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:59,192
me and Xena, doing good stuff,

305
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,444
like, you know, the stuff

306
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,568
I, told you about in the scrolls.

307
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,726
I’m looking forward to meeting Xena.

308
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,852
You think she’ll like me?

309
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,818
Probably.

310
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:10,883
Oh, Ok, I got it!  I got it.

311
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,412
Come here, sit down.

312
00:24:13,348 --> 00:24:14,768
Are you going to sing that ‘Jerks, ’ that,

313
00:24:14,908 --> 00:24:17,341
‘Joxer the Mighty’ song, again?ç
I like that song.

314
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:19,269
Are you kiddin’ me?
You hate it.

315
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:21,162
I do?

316
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:26,022
No, uh, you love it.
Uh, but,this,

317
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:28,148
is the story of Callisto.

318
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:29,983
Callisto?
Yeah.

319
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:31,297
Do I like her?

320
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:36,079
No, but, uh, I want you to hear
when we first met.

321
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,864
‘this mus,’ yeah,
‘Suddenly, there he was.

322
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,237
He called himself,

323
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:44,705
Joxer, a warrior.’

324
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,269
Huh, well-termed phrase, I must say.

325
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:52,956
‘But a warrior like no other,
so inept, so clumsy, s, ’ uh,

326
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,394
so, cleverly disguised,

327
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,288
as a bumbler, that, uh, no one

328
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,143
suspected his true warrior nature.

329
00:25:03,438 --> 00:25:04,352
That’s nice.

330
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:07,409
Yeah, yeah, it gets better, lots better.

331
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:10,363
Then I realized, that’s,

332
00:25:10,582 --> 00:25:12,894
you talking, then I realized that

333
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,988
I was completely taken
by this handsome,

334
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:17,019
mysterious, dark leader of men.

335
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:19,457
I’m in love with you?

336
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,831
Yes.  Yes, you are.

337
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,523
I think I knew that.
Go on.

338
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,847
So, a thousand men attacked Joxer.

339
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:39,412
He battle them bravely, one by one.

340
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:53,355
I’m here, Ares.

341
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:56,210
So, you are.  I wondered.

342
00:25:58,817 --> 00:25:59,989
I have to go on.

343
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:03,052
The priestess said the answer’s
on the other side.

344
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:06,513
What she told you means nothing.

345
00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:09,336
If you survive,
the answer might be there.

346
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:13,277
Is it all worth it?

347
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:16,497
Is the quest for knowledge
worth all this pain?

348
00:26:16,902 --> 00:26:18,715
Yes.  It has to be.

349
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,687
Otherwise,
what’s the point of living?

350
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,655
Point,
there is no point to living.

351
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,333
Don’t you get it, Gabrielle?

352
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,639
Maybe,
that’s the source of all your pain,

353
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,782
all you’ve been through with Xena,

354
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,115
all she’s put you through.

355
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,219
Maybe, you finally realized it
all adds up to a big, fat zero.

356
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,531
You’re wrong,
not with Xena.

357
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,593
We were lost, once.

358
00:26:38,773 --> 00:26:41,532
But Solon, he took us to Illusia
to give us one more chance.

359
00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:43,126
We found ourselves.

360
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:04,230
Hatred It begins very small,

361
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:06,044
Seems like nothing much at all.

362
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,090
Just a germ,

363
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,167
just a speck,

364
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:09,978
just a grain.

365
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:12,073
But the seed has been sewn,

366
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:14,137
And before you know it's grown,

367
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:17,813
It has spread through
your life like a stain.

368
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:20,106
And its power will strangle

369
00:27:20,293 --> 00:27:21,605
Your love and your joy.

370
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:23,503
And its hunger consumes,

371
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:26,292
For it lives to destroy!

372
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,097
Hatred, Gabrielle,

373
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:28,448
that's what we're
fighting hatred.

374
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:29,792
Hate is the star;

375
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:31,449
It becomes who you are.

376
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:33,561
Not the hated but the hater,

377
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,157
Has a torment that's greater.

378
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:36,778
It will eat you alive,

379
00:27:37,012 --> 00:27:39,073
Consume you and spit you out.

380
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:40,826
Hate's gonna win,

381
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:42,478
That there's no
doubt about!

382
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:44,218
Hate doesn't care

383
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:45,323
Who you are!

384
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:46,887
Hate is the star!

385
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,043
Learning hate is an art.

386
00:27:51,286 --> 00:27:52,608
Even people who are smart

387
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:53,544
Can be caught,

388
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:54,551
can be crushed,

389
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:56,136
can be creamed.

390
00:27:56,543 --> 00:27:58,109
It has swallowed you whole.

391
00:27:58,323 --> 00:27:59,828
Did you think you're in control?

392
00:28:00,051 --> 00:28:00,845
Hate you thought,

393
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,764
hate you spoke,

394
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:03,318
hate you dreamed.

395
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:05,496
All your hate gave
me substance,

396
00:28:05,655 --> 00:28:06,958
Your lives are undone.

397
00:28:07,122 --> 00:28:08,966
It's your eve of destruction,

398
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:11,778
Your hatred has won!
No!

399
00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:12,809
Gabrielle!

400
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,029
I never dreamed that we'd be

401
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:29,713
Distanced by a hate,

402
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:33,810
That all the trust
we had would go.

403
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:36,239
How could I hate you?

404
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:37,800
How could it come to pass,

405
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:40,143
This awful twist of fate?

406
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:41,656
How could I hurt you?

407
00:28:42,027 --> 00:28:44,436
This madness can't be so,

408
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:46,092
I can't believe it.

409
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,814
I never dreamed

410
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,049
That any barriers could rise.

411
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:53,217
Or that I'd ever see

412
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:56,325
The stranger in your eyes.

413
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:59,265
Our hearts were hurting
both the same.

414
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:01,626
The hurt was tearing
up our souls.

415
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,030
The fury in us made us blind.

416
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:06,405
We could not see
beyond the pain.

417
00:29:06,563 --> 00:29:08,871
If we can turn again to love.

418
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:11,060
If we can heal these
open wounds.

419
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,173
We'll leave this hatred far behind.

420
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:15,812
So not a trace of hate remains.

421
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,816
and We'll overcome
our damaged past!

422
00:29:20,153 --> 00:29:24,064
And we'll grow stronger
side by side!

423
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,063
To stand together
through the storms!

424
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:33,647
We're safe 'cause love
will be our guide!

425
00:29:56,207 --> 00:29:57,643
It was worth it.

426
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,959
Then why are you still here?

427
00:30:02,817 --> 00:30:03,957
Answer me.

428
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:23,177
Gabrielle,

429
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,879
I am catching a ship
here that will carry me

430
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:26,270
close to the kingdom of Ch’in.

431
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,519
If there was ever a time to
turn back, it’s now.

432
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:33,410
I understand.

433
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:39,240
You owe someone so much,

434
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,740
that you would just throw away
these last few years.

435
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,460
Yes.

436
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:08,709
You!   Noooooooo!

437
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,117
Noooooooooo!  Nooooooooo!

438
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:43,725
Yes, now you know.

439
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:46,555
But your strength is gone.

440
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:48,013
The truth you looked for,

441
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,961
it’s done you no good.

442
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:56,153
You’re wrong!  Wrong!  Wrong!
Wrong!  Wrong!  Wrong!

443
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:06,491
You aren’t Ares.

444
00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:07,608
You aren’t a god!

445
00:32:08,045 --> 00:32:09,057
You’re from within me.

446
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:10,932
You’re that part of me

447
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:12,244
who wants to hide the truth.

448
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:13,360
Call me what you will,

449
00:32:13,671 --> 00:32:14,860
your guilt, your denial.

450
00:32:15,147 --> 00:32:18,212
You can’t defeat me.
You’ll only die trying.

451
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:26,714
That’s why you’re here as Ares.

452
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:31,528
Yeah, Ares is the key.

453
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,141
But he’s only half the answer.

454
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:35,571
I know, it’s because of what I did.

455
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:38,558
It’s because of why I did it.

456
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:53,298
Well, there she goes without you.

457
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:58,400
Kind of makes you feel second best,
doesn’t it?

458
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:02,887
Leave me alone, Ares.

459
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:05,855
Xena has her own decisions to make.

460
00:33:06,753 --> 00:33:07,670
Really?

461
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,751
Sounds more like an obligation to me.

462
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,423
Yeah, Lao Ma must be important,
all right.

463
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:16,754
Xena would never do
anything like this for you.

464
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:19,263
Funny, isn’t it?

465
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:20,769
You give up your family,

466
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,542
your home,
your blood innocence,

467
00:33:22,673 --> 00:33:23,569
your daughter,

468
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:25,766
all because of Xena.

469
00:33:27,477 --> 00:33:28,331
And yet it’s,

470
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,615
like nothing compared to the
debt she owes this woman.

471
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,362
Of course, you could always stop her.

472
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,675
I could never get to Ch’in fast enough.

473
00:33:39,902 --> 00:33:41,708
Xena’s sure to take the fastest route.

474
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:43,630
That is true.

475
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:46,455
You’re only mortal, after all.

476
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:50,675
You could do it.

477
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,259
You could get me there ahead of her.

478
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:58,083
Is that what you want?

479
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:00,552
‘Cause you have to ask me, that is,

480
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:02,646
if it doesn’t bother you owing
a favor to the god of war.

481
00:34:04,116 --> 00:34:07,240
Send me there,
I’m asking.

482
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:11,992
To prevent a murder,
for the sake of friendship.

483
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:16,629
Yeah, for friendship.

484
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:21,544
I wanted to get there
before Xena,

485
00:34:23,107 --> 00:34:24,224
so that I could betray her.

486
00:34:26,515 --> 00:34:27,920
I wanted to betray her.

487
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:29,580
I gave her everything

488
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,016
and it meant nothing to her.

489
00:34:32,126 --> 00:34:34,203
I hated her for loving
someone else.

490
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,297
I wanted her to hurt!

491
00:34:38,235 --> 00:34:39,923
I wanted her to be punished!

492
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:43,034
And I almost got her killed.

493
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:49,485
Why, my hatred and jealousy

494
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,232
almost destroyed
my best friend.

495
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:58,728
So, now you have the answer.

496
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,048
The question is,
can you live with it?

497
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:31,067
Drink.Empty the bowl.

498
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:34,661
If the bowl is ever emptied,
so go my memories.

499
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,193
And the pain, all that pain.

500
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,445
And the memories of my youth,

501
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,987
my parents,
my loves.

502
00:35:46,505 --> 00:35:47,310
The betrayal,

503
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,036
the killing,

504
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:49,349
the death of your child.

505
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,253
And Xena.

506
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:56,191
Bottom line, Gabrielle,

507
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,496
you won’t miss
what you never knew.

508
00:36:11,939 --> 00:36:14,041
Yep.  That’s it.

509
00:36:14,857 --> 00:36:15,981
That’s your whole life,
right there.

510
00:36:16,386 --> 00:36:17,092
By the gods,

511
00:36:17,418 --> 00:36:19,261
I am so incredibly
in love with you.

512
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:22,200
I wish I could feel that again.

513
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:23,669
Yeah, so do I.

514
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:27,462
Take me, Joxer, now.

515
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:28,366
Like the time,

516
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:29,927
just before you saved Ulysses.

517
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:31,701
OK.

518
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:39,460
Wait.

519
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:42,242
I wanna remember!

520
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:46,422
Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, OK,
yeah, so do I, so do I,

521
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:49,075
but not like this!

522
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:54,574
Is this that centurion
gladiator game

523
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:55,778
we used to play?

524
00:36:57,121 --> 00:37:00,589
No.  N- no.  N- n- no, no, Gabrielle.

525
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,194
Look, I, I,

526
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,400
elaborated a little bit on,

527
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:07,391
some of the things I told you
 about you and I,

528
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:13,553
uh, a little,
a little bit, lot, lots.

529
00:37:13,967 --> 00:37:15,863
Well, a lottta littles.

530
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,266
I lied.

531
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:22,543
You lied.

532
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:26,809
What’s a lie?

533
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:29,310
A lie is,

534
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:31,973
me thinking I could give you back

535
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,380
all your happy memories.

536
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:37,521
I’m just, not a part of those,

537
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:38,788
and I really wanted to be.

538
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:43,350
Look, I didn’t rescue Ulysses,

539
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:44,818
that was Xena.

540
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:46,571
And I didn’t get Ares
back his godhood.

541
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:47,583
That was Xena, too.

542
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:50,464
And I didn’t convert Hercules
back from being evil.

543
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:51,927
That was, well,

544
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:53,353
it was complicated.

545
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:55,726
And, Callisto’s not my love kitten,

546
00:37:56,153 --> 00:37:56,881
but look, Gabrielle,

547
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,914
I just want the old Gabrielle back,
you know?

548
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:01,827
The one that used to
smack me on the forehead

549
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:02,914
and gouge out my eyes,

550
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,105
and, just,

551
00:38:08,023 --> 00:38:09,576
forget everything
I’ve told you.

552
00:38:11,037 --> 00:38:12,239
It’s not who you are.

553
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:18,105
Except the part about,

554
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:19,966
dancing nude in the rain,
that is you.

555
00:38:22,692 --> 00:38:23,344
Joxer.

556
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:26,126
Jerkst, hey!  Ahh!

557
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,815
I have never, nor will I ever,

558
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:29,938
dance in the nude in the rain

559
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:31,337
with you anywhere near me.

560
00:38:33,785 --> 00:38:38,128
Gaby, you’re back!

561
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,223
Yes, she is.

562
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,642
Xena,

563
00:38:46,143 --> 00:38:47,360
you knew all along.

564
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:49,358
That’s why,

565
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:50,639
you wanted me to wait at

566
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:52,110
the temple of Mnemosyne, right?

567
00:38:53,547 --> 00:38:55,768
I wondered how you
made it to Ch’in ahead of me.

568
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:58,672
I figured Ares might
have a hand in it,

569
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:01,173
but what I couldn’t understand was
why?

570
00:39:04,262 --> 00:39:05,640
Nightmares can
tell you a lotta things.

571
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:06,246
Thank the gods,

572
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,482
you talk in your sleep.

573
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,448
I knew this was one
journey you had to

574
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:13,685
make without me.

575
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:17,369
I’m just glad you made it back.

576
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,348
If I didn’t have the
painful memories,

577
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,115
then I wouldn’t know

578
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:24,751
what the good ones
were like, right?

579
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,246
I, I just couldn’t let it go,

580
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:28,878
Xena, no matter what the pain.

581
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,007
I’m sorry.
No,

582
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,339
no, it’s over.

583
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:37,338
Welcome home.

584
00:39:41,697 --> 00:39:43,587
Hey, aren’t you forgettin’ about me?

585
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:48,622
No, Joxer, not even Mnemosyne
could help her with that.

586
00:39:48,962 --> 00:39:54,527
