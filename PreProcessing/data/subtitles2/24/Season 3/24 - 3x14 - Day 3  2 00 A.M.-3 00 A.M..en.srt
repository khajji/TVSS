1
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,137
Previously on 24

2
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:15,204
Tony Almeida from CTU
has just informed us

3
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:19,088
that they were unable to confiscate
this Cordilla virus in Mexico.

4
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,159
This man Amador,
where is he now?

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,976
Latest working theory is that
Amador has this virus,

6
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:25,994
and is headed back
here to Los Angeles.

7
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:28,182
I let you live.
Tell me what you know.

8
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:30,729
Any time Amador does business
on the west coast,

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,275
he washes his deal through
a man named Alvers.

10
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:35,943
How does Amador contact this Alvers?

11
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:37,620
I don't know.
I've never met him.

12
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:40,790
Hello?

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,254
Marcus, it's me.

14
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:43,782
I'll be there in an hour.

15
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:44,826
Got the virus?

16
00:00:44,827 --> 00:00:46,069
Yes.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,069
Just be ready.

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,068
I will be.

19
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:50,406
I got to go see Julia Milliken.

20
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:53,556
No. I don't want you to go
anywhere near her or Alan tonight.

21
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:55,123
Do you think I'm scared of you?

22
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,386
Julia...

23
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,800
My pills.

24
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:00,825
No, don't.

25
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,928
- What are you doing?
- Don't.

26
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,030
- Sherry?
- This is your way out.

27
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:07,914
- We killed him.
- No.

28
00:01:08,114 --> 00:01:10,441
There's one thing you're
going to have to be really clear about,

29
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:13,051
when the authorities come
around questioning you.

30
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:14,595
I was never here.

31
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:21,851
The following takes place
between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m.

32
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:26,061
Point Mugu Naval Air Station

33
00:01:58,567 --> 00:01:59,777
I got her.

34
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:01,111
- Agent Bauer.
- Yeah?

35
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:03,259
I'm Jason Carusone from Division.

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,533
These men will be escorting
the prisoner back to CTU.

37
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:06,822
She doesn't leave my sight.

38
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:08,705
I know. You can accompany her
in the lead van.

39
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:09,792
Let's go!

40
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,763
This is Carusone.

41
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:18,746
Yeah. Yeah, he's right here.

42
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,454
Agent Edmunds.

43
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:22,418
It's Chloe O'brian from your office.

44
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,320
Hey, Jack, I'll take another car.

45
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,426
Okay.

46
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:26,820
Yeah, Chloe?

47
00:02:26,935 --> 00:02:28,152
Chase, they found out.

48
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:29,368
Who found out what?

49
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:30,838
Everybody here
found out about Angela.

50
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,650
They all know she's your daughter.

51
00:02:32,724 --> 00:02:34,721
What? How?

52
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:38,326
The baby-sitter flaked. She had
a family emergency and brought her here.

53
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:40,215
You brought Angela into CTU?

54
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:42,035
What was I supposed to do?
Your sister's out of town.

55
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,156
There is no one else.

56
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:45,653
You have no idea what I've been
through in the past couple of hours.

57
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:47,036
Okay, okay, okay.

58
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:48,479
Chloe, thank you for covering.

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,097
I appreciate it.
But where is Angela right now?

60
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:53,714
She's downstairs with Marcy
until you get back.

61
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,946
Did Kim find out?

62
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,981
Chloe, did Kim find out?

63
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,120
Yes, yes, Kim found out.

64
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,959
How did she react?

65
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,279
Uh, gosh, Chase, I think
she's kind of pissed.

66
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:10,364
All right, listen.
I'm coming back to CTU right now.

67
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,496
I'll take care of everything.

68
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:12,605
Bye.

69
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:16,977
Here's the situation:

70
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:21,108
We believe Michael Amador is
in possession of the Cordilla virus.

71
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:24,640
We believe he is either headed to
LosAngeles or he's here already.

72
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:29,281
We estimate he has enough of the pathogen
to take out a major metropolitan area.

73
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,071
Our only lead is Nina Myers, who's
being brought back to CTU right now.

74
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,627
She thinks Amador is meeting
with a man here in Los Angeles

75
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:38,781
by the name of Marcus Alvers.

76
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,933
Adam's done a workup on him.

77
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:45,804
We have some background, but there's nothing
that places him definitively in Los Angeles today.

78
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:47,935
That's it?

79
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,088
What about interpol?
What do they have on Alvers?

80
00:03:51,089 --> 00:03:52,791
Our data tracking's a little behind,

81
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:55,641
so we weren't able
to access that report.

82
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,447
Why are we behind?

83
00:03:57,448 --> 00:04:00,628
We didn't update the European
contact logs while I was down.

84
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,644
Michelle,

85
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:05,353
you were the ranking agent.

86
00:04:05,493 --> 00:04:07,714
I didn't think Europe was a priority.

87
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:10,093
Obviously it was.

88
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,438
There was a lot going on at the time.

89
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,880
All right.

90
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:14,538
Let's get back to work.

91
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,020
And let's try to ease up on the
mistakes for the rest of the night

92
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:20,121
as there are millions of lives
depending on us.

93
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:29,612
Michelle...

94
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:36,691
Come.

95
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:39,418
I just got off with CTU.

96
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,788
What's the status on the virus?

97
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:42,970
Well, it's not good.

98
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,680
The limited intelligence they have
supports their original suspicion.

99
00:04:46,899 --> 00:04:48,900
It's on its way to Los Angeles.

100
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,320
David, it may already be here.

101
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:55,985
Then we should be prepared
in case they target other cities.

102
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:58,142
Our people in the security
envelope have been alerted.

103
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:00,207
Trust me, it's being handled.

104
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,774
Now, why don't you try
and go get some rest?

105
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,285
I'm on this.

106
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:04,462
Mr. President,

107
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,351
Mrs. Palmer's here to see you.

108
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,824
Send her in, please.

109
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,723
Start waking people up.

110
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,212
Set up a conference call with
the appropriate cabinet members:

111
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,824
Homeland security, FBI,

112
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:20,435
National Health Services.

113
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:21,901
We're going to need
everyone on this one.

114
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:23,231
Yes, sir.

115
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,499
Wayne?

116
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:35,816
Sherry, I asked you here to help me,

117
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:37,266
not make things worse.

118
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,714
I did not want you going
to Alan Milliken's house.

119
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:43,137
Well, relax, David.
I didn't go there.

120
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:46,076
- You didn't go?
- No.

121
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:48,572
When we spoke on the phone,

122
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:52,025
you told me it was crucial
that you speak to Julia in person.

123
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:55,478
Yes, and I changed my mind.
I-I spoke to her over the phone.

124
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:57,036
About what?

125
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:59,237
About Kelly's disappearance.

126
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:01,466
I asked her if she would check
Alan's cell phone and

127
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:03,861
see if there were
any recently made calls.

128
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:05,335
And?

129
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,700
She wouldn't do it.

130
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,159
You don't take no
for an answer, Sherry.

131
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,457
What aren't you telling me?

132
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,392
Nothing, David, I swear.

133
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:25,171
What have you been up to since we
last talked if you weren't at Milliken's?

134
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:26,946
Making calls.

135
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:28,233
You could have made
them from here.

136
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:30,061
Yes, but I didn't.

137
00:06:30,062 --> 00:06:31,578
I parked on the side of the road,

138
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:34,601
I started making calls
because I didn't want to wait.

139
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:38,361
I told you we have a small
window of opportunity here.

140
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:42,039
I wanted to exploit the fact
that Milliken may not have had time

141
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,421
to cover his tracks
when he had someone grab Kelly.

142
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:50,906
All right.

143
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:56,816
I have other things to attend to.

144
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,135
Okay.

145
00:06:58,136 --> 00:06:59,707
Is there anything else?

146
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,285
That's it.

147
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,436
Hello, Nina.

148
00:07:32,628 --> 00:07:34,560
Take her to interrogation 819.

149
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:35,947
Yes, sir.

150
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:40,470
What's the security configuration?

151
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:43,015
Don't worry about it, Jack.
We're handling Nina.

152
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,985
Ryan, you know
what she's capable of.

153
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,911
That's none of your
concern right now.

154
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,764
I'm sending you to medical
to get checked out.

155
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:50,012
I'm fine.

156
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:51,566
I don't think you are.

157
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,677
What's this about?

158
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:57,173
We found evidence
you've been injecting heroin.

159
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,438
Tell me I'm off here, Jack.

160
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,251
Tell me I'm wrong.

161
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,949
I didn't think so.

162
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,668
Ryan, I haven't missed a step.

163
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,004
I'm fine.

164
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,745
I have to cover my ass.

165
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:14,147
- I need to get you checked out.
- You're wasting time.

166
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,786
- Kim.
- Yeah?

167
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,538
I thought you'd want to
know your dad's back.

168
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:26,899
What about Chase?

169
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,078
Uh, he's a few minutes behind.

170
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,755
Thank you.

171
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:01,521
Kim.

172
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:02,828
Dad.

173
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,209
Oh, god. Hi.

174
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,585
She's here.

175
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:12,708
I know, sweetheart.
I know. Come here.

176
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:35,381
Look, I have to debrief Chappelle.

177
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,328
I'll see you in a minute, okay?

178
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:42,073
Dad, I know about
your drug problem.

179
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:50,662
Why didn't you come
to me with this?

180
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,700
Come here.

181
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,498
Come here.

182
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,655
I'm sorry, baby.

183
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:05,143
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,135
I was embarrassed.

185
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,487
And it wasn't your problem,
and it still isn't.

186
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:18,506
I didn't want you to worry.

187
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,169
Well, is it over?

188
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,263
No, not exactly.

189
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:28,542
I think I'm going to have to go into
a program, and get some help.

190
00:10:33,597 --> 00:10:36,794
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

191
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:43,988
Chappelle wants me to go into
the clinic and get checked out.

192
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:45,942
- We'll talk about this later, okay?
- Okay.

193
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,908
Don't worry.

194
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:52,012
- I love you.
- Me, too.

195
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,382
Okay.

196
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,538
Jack.

197
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,694
I'm glad you're back.

198
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:01,349
It's been difficult without you.

199
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,732
Thanks, Chloe.

200
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,482
- Chase.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:19,250
- Need to talk to you.
- Okay.

202
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:20,944
Why don't you take a few minutes
and come to my office.

203
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:22,560
Yeah, sure.

204
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,863
Mr. Milliken?

205
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:51,481
Mr. Milliken? Oh, my god.

206
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,969
Mrs. Milliken!

207
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,610
Come quickly!

208
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:01,518
Quickly!

209
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,025
Hey.

210
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,072
How's the hand?

211
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,535
It's fine.

212
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,146
How'd Chappelle find out?

213
00:12:17,147 --> 00:12:18,707
I don't know,
it doesn't really matter.

214
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,149
What's going on out there?

215
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,611
Almeida's going to be
interrogating Nina,

216
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:23,051
and I'll follow it from a feed.

217
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,039
Okay, good.

218
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,463
Make sure Tony puts double
security on the doors.

219
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:28,887
Get back to me as soon
as she gives you anything.

220
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:30,483
Agent Bauer, keep pressure here.

221
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,367
Sure. Thank you.

222
00:12:35,644 --> 00:12:37,818
Jack,

223
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,143
you're about to find something out about
me that's not going to make you happy.

224
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,267
What are you talking about?

225
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:45,668
Excuse me. Do you mind?

226
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,272
I've got a daughter.

227
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,568
- A daughter?
- It was sprung on me a month ago.

228
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:01,729
Her mother dropped her off,
and she split.

229
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:03,497
It's a long story.

230
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,310
Does Kim know about this?

231
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,416
Yeah.

232
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,244
From you?

233
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:13,014
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her myself yet.

234
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:16,195
You square this with her, Chase,
you understand me?

235
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,560
Just make that right.

236
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:22,229
And get back to me as soon
as Nina gives you anything.

237
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,680
I will.

238
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:40,939
Are we up yet?

239
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,812
Yep. Video's piped in,

240
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:44,641
voice analysis,
vitals, transcription.

241
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:46,348
- We're all set.
- Nick, do you copy?

242
00:13:46,349 --> 00:13:48,324
- Yeah, I read you.
- We're ready to go.

243
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:50,300
All right, recording
to hard drive now.

244
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,427
So, Tony's doing this?

245
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:56,893
Yeah.

246
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,930
Is that going to be weird for you?

247
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,322
What do you mean?

248
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,770
Didn't-didn't he and Nina go out?

249
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,899
Yeah.

250
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:12,018
We set?

251
00:14:12,202 --> 00:14:13,857
Yeah.

252
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:15,042
All right.

253
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,831
I want you to do
a hi-res on her eyes.

254
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:19,370
She's tired.

255
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:21,531
We might be able to pick up a tell.

256
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:23,644
Okay.

257
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,160
So, we all right?

258
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,806
Yeah. We're fine.

259
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,687
All right.

260
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,248
Let's do this.

261
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:45,320
I got the hi-res on monitor two.

262
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,989
Tony.

263
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,235
Didn't know I was gonna
see you today.

264
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:59,367
You know what we want.

265
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:05,079
We need to find Michael Amador
before he unloads the virus.

266
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,556
I've already told Jack
everything I know.

267
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,844
Well, I want you to tell me.

268
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:14,067
First Jack, now you.

269
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:17,099
Hmm... what does that
remind me of?

270
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:26,110
You told Jack that Amador might
try to contact a Marcus Alvers.

271
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,519
So, where do we look for Alvers?

272
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:36,842
That's a nice ring.

273
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:39,706
Who's the lucky girl?

274
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:42,501
Hope you did a background
check, though, 'cause

275
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,891
you don't want to make
the same mistake twice.

276
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,556
You're going back to prison.

277
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:49,882
There's a good chance
you'll be executed as a traitor.

278
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,834
Now you know if you cooperate,
you may be able to save your own life,

279
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,479
but you're stalling.

280
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:56,543
Which means you know something

281
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:58,827
and you still think there's
a play you can make,

282
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:01,548
only now's not the right time.

283
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:05,527
Very incisive.

284
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:09,349
I hope your wife appreciates
that about you.

285
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:16,126
Why don't you tell me
about Alvers?

286
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:21,129
All I know is that he works
only with Amador.

287
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:23,463
I don't know him personally.

288
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:28,461
All we've been able to dig up on him
are a few random medical records

289
00:16:28,546 --> 00:16:30,463
under one of his known aliases.

290
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:33,381
He had an MRI on
one of his knees,

291
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:36,442
there's a prescription for antibiotics,

292
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,009
treated for HIV...

293
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:43,844
Her pulse is spiking.

294
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:46,054
Someone hasn't been using
protection with Marcus Alvers.

295
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,458
She's probably had sex with him.

296
00:16:51,504 --> 00:16:52,969
See, Nina,

297
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,562
my colleagues in the next room
tell me that something in those

298
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:58,062
medical records concerns you.

299
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:00,561
I'm guessing
it's not the knee.

300
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:23,316
I'm here to see Alvers.

301
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:34,418
Marcus.

302
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:36,043
Michael.

303
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,887
How was your trip?

304
00:17:40,209 --> 00:17:41,907
Interesting.

305
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:45,442
I still don't understand why you
risked so much down in Mexico,

306
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:47,473
why you didn't
come here directly.

307
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,086
240 million dollars
made it worth the risk.

308
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:00,684
What about Nina?

309
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,201
If she wasn't killed by the bomb,

310
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:07,890
I'm sure our buyers took care of her once
they found out she didn't deliver the virus.

311
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:11,949
Either way,
she's out of the picture.

312
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,555
I hope so.

313
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:15,801
She can point to both of us.

314
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:20,946
We'll be long gone
before anyone starts looking.

315
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:42,092
Kim.

316
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:45,982
Look, I know we haven't talked
since I got back.

317
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:47,696
No, we haven't.

318
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,757
I know what you must be thinking,

319
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,411
but you need to give me
a chance to explain.

320
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:55,516
I don't know what to think.

321
00:18:55,722 --> 00:18:57,811
Look, I'm happy that you're okay,

322
00:18:57,812 --> 00:18:59,662
but this thing...

323
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,379
you have a baby, Chase.

324
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,438
We've been together for
more than three months,

325
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,521
and you kept this secret from me.

326
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,729
Who's the mother?
Where does she fit into this?

327
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,704
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

328
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:13,746
I didn't know I had a daughter
until a month ago.

329
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:15,827
How could you not know?

330
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:18,172
Angela's mother and I
went out last year.

331
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,029
Okay, it's over.
And when it ended,

332
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,886
she never told me
she was pregnant.

333
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:25,415
Now she calls a month ago
and tells me she has a baby,

334
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,218
and that I'm the father.

335
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:30,001
And she's in trouble,
and she can't handle it.

336
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,719
I was afraid to let
people find out.

337
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:38,234
I was afraid it was
gonna mess us up.

338
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:41,477
But you told Chloe.

339
00:19:41,478 --> 00:19:43,138
Chloe and my sister have been
helping me take care of the baby.

340
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,041
She's a good friend.

341
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:48,376
Excuse me. Chase?

342
00:19:48,377 --> 00:19:51,228
You wanted me to let you know
when Angela woke up.

343
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,704
- Thank you.
- Sure.

344
00:19:57,659 --> 00:20:00,310
Kim, I'm just as confused as you are.

345
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:02,452
But all I know is
that I love you.

346
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,777
And I'm falling in love
with Angela, too.

347
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:07,227
And I need to make this work.

348
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:10,862
Go on.

349
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:36,942
What's happening with
Nina in interrogation?

350
00:20:36,943 --> 00:20:38,215
They're getting something.

351
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:39,187
What?

352
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:42,073
The connection between Alvers
and Nina might be deeper than we thought.

353
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,865
You'd better hope she's not
just spinning your wheels,

354
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:46,362
because she knows how to manipulate
our interrogation protocol.

355
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:47,929
Tony knows what he's doing.

356
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,860
Okay, fine. Look, I need to
get together with Chloe.

357
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:51,973
I need everything that she's got
on the Amador investigation.

358
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:52,922
Not yet.

359
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:54,889
Ryan, look,
you're wasting my time.

360
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,854
Now, I humored you
with the physical.

361
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,984
And we both know that my blood
work's gonna come back

362
00:20:58,985 --> 00:21:01,113
with trace amounts of opiates,
but enough is enough.

363
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:03,736
Rae Plachecki from the inspector
general's office is here.

364
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,312
She wants to talk to you.

365
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:08,138
- Well, this is not the time.
- Actually, it is.

366
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,447
You'll talk to her,

367
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:12,388
then we'll evaluate whether you
can go back to work or not.

368
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:13,745
Come on.

369
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:26,013
Rae Plachecki,
this is Jack Bauer.

370
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:28,542
You know the drill, Jack.
I'm gonna ask you some questions,

371
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:30,772
but I want you to know,
I'm on your side.

372
00:21:30,773 --> 00:21:35,201
We just want to establish that this heroin
addiction was a necessary part of your cover.

373
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:37,690
It was necessary
to maintain my cover.

374
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,466
Are we done now?

375
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,241
Sit down, Jack.

376
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,289
This is Rae Plachecki.

377
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,468
The time is 2:31 A.M.

378
00:21:54,469 --> 00:21:58,254
This is the interrogation of Jack Bauer,
director of field ops, CTU.

379
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,748
Ryan Chappelle is present.

380
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:01,860
Jack,

381
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:06,022
tell us how you established
your cover with Ramon Salazar.

382
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:09,321
I first came in contact
with the Salazars

383
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:10,378
approximately two years ago.

384
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:13,640
They were an up-and-coming
narcotic cartel, coming out of Mexico.

385
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:16,076
So, when did you meet Amador?

386
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:24,260
Did you know him when
you were working at CTU?

387
00:22:28,468 --> 00:22:30,402
Tell me something, Nina,

388
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:34,502
what kind of a deal
you think you're gonna cut?

389
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,018
You've betrayed
everybody you know,

390
00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:39,776
including me.

391
00:22:40,273 --> 00:22:42,818
You murdered Jack's wife.

392
00:22:43,999 --> 00:22:48,092
You helped terrorists smuggle
a nuclear bomb into this country.

393
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,861
You're helping to unleash a deadly
virus into the general population.

394
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:00,950
Help me understand this.

395
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,318
What do you want?

396
00:23:04,568 --> 00:23:07,479
What is it you get out of
being a mass murderer?

397
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:20,531
Your neck is bleeding.

398
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,575
Dalton, what do you got?

399
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:56,349
So far, the only reactions we're
getting from her are subliminal.

400
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,378
If she's not gonna say anything,
we need to be more plugged in to her vitals.

401
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:02,176
We can take her down to seven,
give her a passive response test.

402
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:04,219
Seven's not secure enough.

403
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,108
She stays here.

404
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:07,780
Where's Richards?

405
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,213
He's waiting.

406
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,436
All right, let's bring him in.

407
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:15,697
Send Darren in.

408
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:42,756
Nina, I don't think you've
met Darren Richards.

409
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:44,880
He joined us after you left.

410
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,966
Hello, Darren.

411
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:55,210
Don't take it personally.

412
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:57,546
He doesn't talk much.

413
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:19,511
Uh, something's not
connecting up for me, Jack.

414
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:22,617
You say that you weren't in with
the Salazars until early February,

415
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:25,969
but the first time you started
using was late December.

416
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,321
That's six weeks of shooting up
for the benefit of no one.

417
00:25:29,322 --> 00:25:30,631
Am I missing something?

418
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:32,367
I was trying to pass
myself off as a junkie.

419
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:33,971
I wanted to be prepared.

420
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:35,320
What do you mean, "prepared"?

421
00:25:35,321 --> 00:25:38,051
The Salazars lived their
entire lives in the drug world.

422
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:40,957
If I couldn't handle the narcotics
that went with that territory,

423
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,251
they'd have known I was a cop,
and they'd have killed me.

424
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,270
I needed to be able to handle it.

425
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:47,589
Yeah, that makes sense,
but in January,

426
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,907
when you were
putting needles in your arm,

427
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:51,610
you didn't have a meeting
on the books with these guys--

428
00:25:51,611 --> 00:25:54,062
it could have been a year,
for all you knew.

429
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:55,581
What are you saying?

430
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:59,447
I am trying to establish incontrovertible
evidence that you did drugs

431
00:25:59,448 --> 00:26:01,733
as part of your cover--
if I submit what you just told me,

432
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,482
it's not gonna hold up, Jack.

433
00:26:03,483 --> 00:26:05,231
What do you want me to say?!

434
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:07,418
I did drugs to get in
with these people,

435
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:09,710
and I got in with them!

436
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:16,186
And no matter how difficult
it's been, I don't use anymore.

437
00:26:16,386 --> 00:26:17,942
Look,

438
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:20,519
I'll write it up that way,
and maybe it'll fly,

439
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,656
but I just think you're
gonna have a problem

440
00:26:22,657 --> 00:26:26,073
because you never told anyone,
not even your partner.

441
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:28,101
That's suspicious.

442
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,761
Rae, you know my history.

443
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:38,578
I've had a very difficult time
since my wife passed away.

444
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,350
If I'd told anyone that I was
using drugs to develop a case,

445
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,629
they would have misinterpreted,

446
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,907
and I couldn't afford that risk.

447
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:51,206
Yeah, well, that's what
they're gonna do now.

448
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,995
Rae,

449
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:58,287
let's put down that Jack started
using heroin in late January,

450
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:01,213
after the first meeting
with Salazar was established.

451
00:27:01,214 --> 00:27:03,241
I appreciate what you're
trying to do, Ryan,

452
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:05,405
but that's not what happened.

453
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:08,053
Just trying to save us all
some paperwork.

454
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:09,668
I'm okay with that.

455
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,359
I'm not.

456
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:15,675
I started using in December.

457
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,175
I've got nothing to hide.

458
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:20,677
This office demands results,

459
00:27:20,678 --> 00:27:22,992
and that's what I provide:

460
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:25,014
Results.

461
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,642
Fine.

462
00:27:28,512 --> 00:27:30,397
Can I get back to work?

463
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:32,620
Not quite yet, Jack.

464
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:37,934
No, it's secure and we have it.

465
00:27:39,127 --> 00:27:40,969
It will be as arranged.

466
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:46,287
He'll be here in an hour.

467
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:50,827
Just as long as we have enough time to leave
the country before they let this virus out.

468
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:57,032
Please be seated.

469
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:02,723
Five hours ago,

470
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:07,049
I went public with a statement that
there was a domestic terror threat,

471
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,303
but it had passed.

472
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:12,539
And now it appears that
that was premature.

473
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,449
Ladies and gentlemen,

474
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,847
do we or do we not have a threat
of this virus being released?

475
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:19,864
Sir,

476
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,430
I'm afraid we can't answer that
question with any kind of certainty.

477
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:25,247
What can you tell me,
Mr. Hammond?

478
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:27,871
What few leads we have
indicate that Michael Amador has

479
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,331
the virus and is in Los Angeles.

480
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:32,530
For what purpose,
we can't say.

481
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:37,514
Then we have to prepare
for defensive action here in Los Angeles.

482
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:40,188
And for that matter,
in all of our major cities.

483
00:28:40,189 --> 00:28:41,336
Mr. President,

484
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:43,840
you know our position
here at homeland security.

485
00:28:43,841 --> 00:28:46,343
We think being forthright
with the public and

486
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:50,664
making such preparations in
the open is the correct course.

487
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:53,624
Again, we have to assess
the downside of that course.

488
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,667
I have no problem
with that, Mr. President,

489
00:28:55,668 --> 00:28:59,415
as long as we realize
we are working against a clock.

490
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:03,035
I want all departments present
to work up an open versus covert

491
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:06,407
containment strategy
and report back to me in 30 minutes.

492
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:09,778
In the meantime, I want
Health Services to issue guidelines,

493
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,141
but only to be
distributed internally.

494
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:14,923
That is all.

495
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:16,329
I'll be in my office.

496
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,247
David.

497
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:30,607
Give us a second, please, Aaron.

498
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:32,461
Of course, sir.

499
00:29:38,421 --> 00:29:40,684
Secret Service just
received a phone call

500
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,948
from the west Los Angeles
police department.

501
00:29:44,556 --> 00:29:47,100
Alan Milliken is dead.

502
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:48,907
What?

503
00:29:49,026 --> 00:29:51,246
He was found 15 minutes ago
in his home.

504
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,021
All signs point
to a heart attack.

505
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:57,296
It isn't possible.

506
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,761
Well, apparently, it is.

507
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:06,677
You told me Sherry was on her way
over there about an hour ago.

508
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:07,930
She changed her mind.

509
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,029
Made some phone calls
from her car.

510
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,736
Came straight back here.

511
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:15,887
David, is that what she told you?

512
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:19,345
Yeah.

513
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,739
And where is she now?

514
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:23,693
Resting.

515
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:29,229
Aaron, take me to Sherry.

516
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,668
Yes, sir.

517
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,837
She's right this way.

518
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:34,275
Hasn't your shift ended?

519
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:35,460
I stayed on.

520
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:38,890
I sense it's a difficult day, and
I wanted to be here for you.

521
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:42,274
- I appreciate that.
- Right in there, sir.

522
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,561
Sherry.

523
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:54,383
David.

524
00:30:56,892 --> 00:30:58,625
What's wrong?

525
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,839
Alan Milliken is dead.

526
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,871
What? How?

527
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:04,965
Why don't you tell me?

528
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:06,842
What do you mean?

529
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:08,208
I told you,
I didn't go there.

530
00:31:08,209 --> 00:31:09,629
I know what you told me.

531
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,268
You sat in your car,
you made some phone calls,

532
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,600
and you came straight here.

533
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:13,930
Yes, and that's the truth.

534
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:16,064
Then you won't mind the police
checking your cell phone

535
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:18,507
and the car you used tonight.

536
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,314
You know...

537
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:22,830
you asked me

538
00:31:22,831 --> 00:31:26,229
to take care of a problem, and I did.

539
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,475
If you want the police
to check phone logs, then

540
00:31:28,476 --> 00:31:30,298
have them check yours first.

541
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:32,363
Because remember?
You called me tonight.

542
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:35,454
I am here because
of you, David.

543
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:45,340
What happened, Sherry?

544
00:31:55,389 --> 00:32:00,723
I went over to the house
just to speak to Julia.

545
00:32:01,657 --> 00:32:03,736
Alan interrupted us.

546
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:06,146
There was an argument and...

547
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,479
he had a heart attack.

548
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,303
There's going to be an investigation.

549
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,381
You're going to have to
tell the truth about this.

550
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:31,907
The truth isn't going to
save either one of us.

551
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:36,157
All they're going to hear
is that I was there on your behalf

552
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:39,387
to prevent Alan from meddling
with your presidency,

553
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:42,195
and that he died
from natural causes.

554
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:45,028
Now, how do you think
that's going to play out

555
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,861
in the New York Times
for the next six months?

556
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:53,918
What did you do to Alan?

557
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:58,498
Honestly, David,

558
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:03,769
nothing.

559
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:06,737
Absolutely nothing.

560
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,161
Kim,

561
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,788
I transferred that feed
to your system.

562
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,344
Do you want me
to pull it up for you now?

563
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:15,391
Yeah

564
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,608
I don't think she's going to
give them anything.

565
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,032
We're going to have to find
Marcus Alvers by ourselves.

566
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,834
What can I do?

567
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:34,516
Um, I followed up on some
of those Asian connections,

568
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,814
but in the meantime, there's
something I want you to look at.

569
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:38,739
- It's a long shot.
- What is it?

570
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,345
A list of cities where Marcus Alvers
has been in the last three years.

571
00:33:41,346 --> 00:33:42,832
Each time only
for a couple of days.

572
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,649
Maybe he was meeting somebody.

573
00:33:44,736 --> 00:33:46,742
Cross it with the other suspects
in our database.

574
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:48,053
Let me know what
you come up with, okay?

575
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:49,451
Okay.

576
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:57,062
Look, I don't know why we
have to go through this again.

577
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:59,272
I already answered that.

578
00:34:00,945 --> 00:34:02,193
What is it, Edmunds?

579
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:04,373
Just wanted to give you
an update on Nina.

580
00:34:04,374 --> 00:34:06,385
Rae, could you pause that?

581
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:08,898
She give us anything
new on Alvers?

582
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,356
No,

583
00:34:10,357 --> 00:34:12,092
other than the probability
she knew him personally.

584
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,489
She's not cooperating.

585
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,886
What are we doing?

586
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:18,297
Richards is working on her now.

587
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,079
I think that's a mistake.

588
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,109
Why? /I don't think anybody should be
in there that hasn't worked with her before,

589
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,277
doesn't know what she's capable of.
She'll manipulate him.

590
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:30,625
All Richards does is inflict pain.

591
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:33,615
There's no way for her
to manipulate him.

592
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:36,682
All right.

593
00:34:50,747 --> 00:34:54,556
How much more of this
you want to endure, Nina?

594
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:02,952
I think this is about it.

595
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,644
- She hit an artery!
- Michelle, call medical!

596
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,989
No, she's bleeding too much.
We got to take her there now!

597
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,616
- Tell security!
- We need someone from medical.

598
00:35:10,617 --> 00:35:12,856
- Interrogation room 819.
- Uncuff her.

599
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:14,512
Now!

600
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,137
So what did Sherry have to say?

601
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,726
That Alan had a heart attack.

602
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:35,021
And you believe her?

603
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:39,424
I'd be a fool to believe anything
Sherry says to save herself.

604
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,317
But murder?

605
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,371
I can't imagine she'd do that.

606
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:48,324
David, we can't allow ourselves
to be caught off guard this time.

607
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:50,966
Now we have to assume the worst.

608
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:56,419
Then we'd also have to assume
that Julia was somehow involved.

609
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:58,418
What?

610
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:02,001
Whoa, whoa, listen.

611
00:36:02,002 --> 00:36:06,699
David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not
the same kind of person that Sherry is.

612
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:09,826
When we find out all the facts,

613
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:12,642
we'll proceed from there.

614
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:16,041
I have to go over
the morning brief with Jerry.

615
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:17,884
All right.

616
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:39,645
- Hello?
- Julia, it's me.

617
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,276
Wayne?

618
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:43,865
I just heard about Alan, and I...

619
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,178
are you alone?

620
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,419
The police are here.

621
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:50,069
I'm was just going to speak
with one of the officers.

622
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,683
All right, tell me
what happened.

623
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:54,693
Wayne, Sherry was here
when it happened,

624
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:56,601
but she told me
not to tell the police.

625
00:36:56,602 --> 00:36:59,725
Julia, I need for you to tell me exactly
what happened over there, all right?

626
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:03,326
We were talking with Alan.

627
00:37:03,878 --> 00:37:05,428
He got excited,

628
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:08,324
then he started to gasp for air.

629
00:37:08,533 --> 00:37:10,120
He gets angina.

630
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:11,874
So you called 911, right?

631
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,431
No, no.

632
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:15,668
I-I tried to give him
his medication.

633
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:17,966
What do you mean you tried?

634
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:21,127
Sherry stopped me.

635
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:23,378
I went to help Alan,

636
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:25,611
but she grabbed my arm.

637
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:27,843
I just stood there.

638
00:37:27,986 --> 00:37:30,521
I-I couldn't,
I couldn't move.

639
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:32,015
I... I...

640
00:37:32,943 --> 00:37:34,709
- I killed him, Wayne.
- Shh, shh, shh.

641
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,373
All right, listen to me
carefully, all right?

642
00:37:36,374 --> 00:37:37,416
I killed him.

643
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,667
Call Alan's lawyer, and
do not say anything,

644
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:41,396
anything to anyone
until he gets there.

645
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:43,175
You understand me?

646
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:48,586
Wayne, could you come
down here and help me?

647
00:37:48,587 --> 00:37:50,987
No, and please don't call me.

648
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,816
I will help you, Julia, I will,

649
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:55,703
but for right now I have to keep
my distance, I'm sorry.

650
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:00,444
Excuse me, coming through.

651
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,929
- Let's move, right here.
- Okay, swing it.

652
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,711
Come on, come on, let's go!

653
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,553
One, two, three.

654
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:13,258
Carotid's been lacerated.
Start a twilight drip.

655
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:14,538
Yes, doctor.

656
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:16,948
Clamp.

657
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,290
Clamp.

658
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,418
Keep steady pressure.

659
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:28,610
3-0 silks.

660
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:30,651
3-0 standing by.

661
00:38:30,972 --> 00:38:31,957
More gauze.

662
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,629
Gauze.

663
00:38:34,317 --> 00:38:36,713
- Got it open.
- Okay, clamp it.

664
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,684
Here you go, doctor.

665
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,769
- Keep the pressure on.
- Yes, sir.

666
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,427
Let's get some more
gauze in here.

667
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:48,329
Okay, she's under.

668
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,498
I want you two
stationed right here.

669
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:51,949
Do not leave unless
you hear directly from me.

670
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,840
Okay, Jack, those are all
the questions I'm obliged to ask.

671
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:07,695
If you got anything else
you want to add, Jack,

672
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:08,991
now would be the time.

673
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:11,707
That's my statement, as it is.

674
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,409
My god, Tony.

675
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:17,303
Nina tried to commit suicide.

676
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:18,806
She jammed her neck
into Richards' needle,

677
00:39:18,807 --> 00:39:19,888
ruptured an artery.

678
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:20,969
Where is she now?

679
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,704
She's in the clinic
being operated on.

680
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:23,537
Who's with her?

681
00:39:23,538 --> 00:39:24,697
Don't worry, Jack, she's sedated.
I saw her go under.

682
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:27,719
Who's with her now?
Tony, who's with her?!

683
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,199
Damn it!

684
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,267
Which way did she go?

685
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,551
Lock down the building!

686
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:55,672
This is Ryan Chappelle.

687
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,123
Nina Myers is loose
in the building.

688
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:59,053
Lock it down, now!

689
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:57,542
Nina,

690
00:40:57,777 --> 00:40:59,066
drop the gun

691
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:01,877
and put your hands
on your head,

692
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:04,020
now!

693
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:09,689
Kim.

694
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,049
What the hell are you doing?

695
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:14,078
You don't want to be
any part of this.

696
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,887
Shut up.

697
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:19,069
Just turn around

698
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,116
and walk away.

699
00:41:21,516 --> 00:41:25,612
If you leave now,
you won't get hurt.

700
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:32,076
Kim.

701
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:37,057
Don't do it, Nina.
I swear to god, I'll shoot you.

702
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,332
You won't kill me.

703
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,245
Nina, damn it.

704
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:44,551
Kim, back up.

705
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:45,989
Back up.

706
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:54,211
Kim, I want you to go back into
CTU, tell them we got Nina.

707
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:58,323
- Dad, listen to me. We need...
- Kim, go now!

708
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,977
Please, baby, just go.

709
00:42:03,131 --> 00:42:04,389
Go.

710
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:22,749
You don't have any more useful
information, do you, Nina?

711
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:25,865
I do.

712
00:42:34,915 --> 00:42:36,720
No, you don't.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
