1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,480
Don't worry about that.I'll finish up.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,770
Jim's got the late shift,
so no one's waiting at home.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,140
Oh, i don't mind.

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,990
No one's waiting for
me at home, neither.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,690
Is ned out with his basketball friends?

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,990
Not exactly.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,060
Ok, what's going on?

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,710
Nothing.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,840
Or at least that's what
i keep telling myself.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,240
Ned's on a date.

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,260
Like a date-date, with a girl?

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,970
Is it his first one? Because...

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,260
You don't seem very pleased.

14
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,350
I am trying so hard not
to be overprotective.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,500
Well, what is there to protect
him from? He's on a date.

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,260
What's there to protect
him from? Are you kidding?

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,900
He could get his heart broken,
he could catch a disease.

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,520
And what do i know
about this girl? Right?

19
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,840
She could be into drugs, she
could be into self mutilation,

20
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,270
She could be into animal sacrifice.

21
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,490
Animal sacrifice?

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,050
You know what i mean.

23
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,870
Not really, no.

24
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,830
What wouldn't a teenage boy do if
you promised to take your shirt off?

25
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,240
What wouldn't jim do now?

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,290
You think this is funny.

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,500
Yes. Look, i love you, but you
are not making any sense.Ok?

28
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,940
Ned is a smart kid.

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,410
Besides, it's his first date, right?

30
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,280
So they probably haven't
even held hands yet.

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,400
Was that ok? I mean...

32
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,780
I hope that it's ok that i kissed you.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,530
So... It was ok then.

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,740
Um, maybe we can get
together again sometime?

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,660
Yeah. I'd like that.

36
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,550
Great. Awesome.

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,340
I gotta get in, it's late.

38
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,270
Hey, lisa, you forgot
your sweatshirt--

39
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,270
Lisa?

40
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,340
I'm just dropping your sweater inside.

41
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,490
I'll see you at school, ok?

42
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,420
Your mom just left.

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,860
I know. I watched her go.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,080
What happened to your nose?

45
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,180
I walked into a door.

46
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,410
Here, let me help you.

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,000
Now what happened, really?

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,560
If i tell you something,
you promise not to tell her?

49
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,320
No, i do not keep secrets from
your mom, and neither should you.

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,830
It might be about a ghost.

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,740
Well, maybe your mom doesn't
need to know about that.

52
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,810
What happened?

53
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,050
Ever since i started being with
lisa, it's felt like we weren't alone.

54
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,070
Maybe i'm just a loser who doesn't
know how to act around girls,

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,210
But with all the weird stuff that
happens whenever i'm with her;

56
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,640
All the accidents and whatever, it's
like there's something else going on.

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,340
And then when she told me that
her dad had died a while ago.

58
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,660
Now, i know what you're thinking.

59
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,400
That you never should have taught me about
ghosts, because now i see them everywhere.

60
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,510
Uh, no, that's--that's
not what i was thinking.

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,880
What, did you see something?

62
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,460
I see things all the time.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,880
Doesn't have to mean anything.

64
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,630
How did lisa's father die?

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,880
Some kind of accident.

66
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,370
She doesn't talk about it much.

67
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,680
Well, i'll make you a deal.

68
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,190
Um, if you can stay away from lisa for a
little while, i'll look into it for you.

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,810
Come on, why can't i see her?

70
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,290
Or i can talk to your mother.

71
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,690
Ok, fine.

72
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,720
Hey, ned?

73
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,160
Be careful.

77
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,550
You promise you wouldn't tell about a ghost
that's haunting her son?

78
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:55,264
Yeah, and i feel even worse that ned's
out there unprotected, but what can i do?

79
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:57,012
I mean, i can't follow
him around all day,

80
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:00,053
And it doesn't do any good to scare
delia when i don't know anything.

81
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:03,201
Best way i can protect ned is to figure
out who this ghost is and cross him over.

82
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,340
And you think the ghost is
ned's girlfriend's father?

83
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,939
Maybe. Check this out.

84
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,309
According to this, 2 years ago nathan
benton died in his auto repair shop

85
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,165
When a car fell on top of him.

86
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,496
When you saw the ghost, was he
wearing a mechanic's uniform?

87
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:17,721
No, but that doesn't mean anything.

88
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:19,748
He could have died later in
the hospital or something.

89
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,970
What else do you remember about him?

90
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,248
He had a lot of bruises on his face.

91
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:25,851
Kinda like you'd have
if a car fell on you?

92
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,647
Well, i mean that would
explain the nasty mood.

93
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:32,527
Lisa: why weren't you
in campbell's class?

94
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:35,188
Ned: oh, i was in the
library studying for bio.

95
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:36,524
I've got a test tomorrow.

96
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:40,852
That's good, because i was beginning to get
the feeling that you didn't want to see me.

97
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:43,788
Not at all. You have no idea.

98
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:47,584
I don't want to scare you away, but...

99
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:49,609
My life's been kind of weird lately.

100
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:54,321
And it just means a lot to have
someone like you; someone who listens,

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,080
And you make me feel like
i have some place safe.

102
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,769
Oh, my god!

103
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:25,108
Oh, my god, ned, this can't happen!

104
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,076
She's gonna kill me!

105
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,272
Who, your mom?

106
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,119
I can't get in trouble!

107
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,624
You don't know what's
going to happen to me!

108
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,453
Don't worry. I'll just
say that it was my fault.

109
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:33,575
I can't let you do that.

110
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,867
Maybe it won't matter. Maybe nobody saw.

111
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:39,581
Out of the car. Both of you.Now.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,890
You two are so lucky nobody got hurt.

113
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,934
Lisa, where's your mom?

114
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,194
I just called her.

115
00:06:49,212 --> 00:06:50,952
She should be here any minute.

116
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:52,423
Well, i don't know what
she's going to do with you,

117
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:56,022
But i can tell you ned is going to
pay for his share of the damages.

118
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:59,523
Since both of you were in the backseat,
it's kind of hard to tell who's at fault.

119
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:01,165
- Mom!
- What, ned?

120
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:02,975
Is there something i'm missing here?

121
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:04,515
Lisa! Get in the car.

122
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:07,105
You're in a lot of trouble.

123
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,921
Um, excuse me. I'm
ned's mother.Who are you?

124
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,630
I'm sorry. My name's
amy.I'm lisa's sister.

125
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:15,616
Where's your mother?

126
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:19,602
She's at work, and she feels incredibly
bad, but she just couldn't get away.

127
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:22,136
She said to tell you she'll
call you as soon as she can.

128
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:23,852
Ok, well, i hope it's soon.

129
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,922
Definitely. Bye.

130
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:32,454
Ok.

131
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:36,384
Start at the beginning, and
don't leave anything out.

132
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,027
Hey, is everything ok with ned?

133
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,550
Did you tell him that the ghost of his
girlfriend's father was haunting him?

134
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:49,473
I saw a ghost around ned, and i told him
that i would find out if it was haunting him.

135
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:50,677
I didn't ask if you saw a ghost.

136
00:07:50,694 --> 00:07:56,674
I asked if-- we are talking about
you keeping secrets with my son,

137
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,891
Which frankly, i don't understand how you
can do after what happened with his father.

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,990
Ok, i knew that you were going
to get upset about this topic,

139
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,963
And i shouldn't have kept it from you.

140
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:06,255
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,587
Ok.

142
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:12,019
Look, i know you're trying
to help, but next time--

143
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:14,384
I will tell you everything i know.

144
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,458
Ok.

145
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,049
Well, what do you know?

146
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:25,755
Lisa's father died in an
accident in his auto repair shop.

147
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:28,587
So he knew about cars, which might
explain the parking lot business,

148
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:31,384
And it seemed like he
had a logical motive--

149
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,231
Protecting his child.

150
00:08:33,282 --> 00:08:34,792
From ned?

151
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:37,072
I remember that you had
the same fears about lisa.

152
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:39,715
Yes, and i was right.

153
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:41,716
Have you talked to her mother yet?

154
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,914
She called. She apologized up and down.

155
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:47,077
She said it was all her daughter's fault,
that she wasn't going to charge ned a thing.

156
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,296
So we're gonna get together
later and talk about it.

157
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:52,246
Good.

158
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:56,207
Look, melinda, maybe...

159
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,931
You shoul  go over there
and snoop around, you know?

160
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:02,548
If there really is a ghost...

161
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:05,541
That was my next move.

162
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,410
Who is it?

163
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:14,307
Hi, uh, i'm melinda gordon,
a friend of ned banks.

164
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:15,601
Oh, hi.

165
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,869
Ned's talked about you before.

166
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:17,947
You work with his mom.

167
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:20,273
Are you lisa?

168
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,670
Did you want to talk to my mom?

169
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,482
I do, but i'd actually like to
talk to you first if you don't mind.

170
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,999
Can i come in?

171
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,654
You know what, it's
such a nice afternoon.

172
00:09:29,674 --> 00:09:31,824
- Why don't we just sit out here?
- Ok.

173
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,743
Look, i came here because...

174
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,399
I know that ned likes
you, and i want to help.

175
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:45,151
So do you mind if i
ask you a few questions?

176
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:46,708
About what?

177
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:51,407
I don't know if you'll understand the connection,
but i wanted to know more about your father.

178
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:54,721
Hi, i'm amy.

179
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:55,466
I'm lisa's sister.

180
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,120
Did i overhear that
you're a friend of ned's?

181
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,990
Yes, hi. Melinda, nice to meet you.

182
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,028
Did lisa offer you anything to drink?

183
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,510
Some tea, maybe?

184
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,399
You know, i don't think i even gave her the
chance, but that would be great, thank you.

185
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:10,003
- I'll tell mom you're here.
- Ok.

186
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:13,545
Go say hello, henry.

187
00:10:15,984 --> 00:10:17,934
Hi, i'm henry. It's nice to meet you.

188
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:19,426
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

189
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:22,795
I've never met such a polite family.

190
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:27,543
Woman: lisa, sweetheart, can
i talk to you for a minute?

191
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,435
That's mom. I'll be right back.

192
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,456
Ok.

193
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:39,701
So, how long have you
guys lived in grandview?

194
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:42,458
Oh, what was it... 3 years?

195
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:43,435
I lose count.

196
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:46,511
3 1/2. I was 9.

197
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:50,411
Mom says she's getting a migraine.

198
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:53,073
She's seeing her shapes and spots.

199
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,519
Yeah, i think i know what that's like.

200
00:10:55,564 --> 00:10:57,644
We're going to go help her out.

201
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,687
- Bye.
- Bye.

202
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:03,045
You know, i should just
come back later, maybe,

203
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,120
'Cause it sounds like you need
to go and take care of your mom.

204
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:09,112
Yeah. Come back tomorrow
when she's feeling better.

205
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:13,266
Ok. I will.

206
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,442
Really nice garden.

207
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,786
I've never seen such
beautiful snapdragons.

208
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,860
Oh, they're hybrids. Thanks.

209
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:37,852
Are you a friend of the bentons?

210
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,910
A new friend, yes.

211
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:43,945
They haven't had the
best of luck, have they?

212
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,557
Hmm, not really.

213
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:50,416
You know, i didn't know
nathan... Very well.

214
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:52,047
What was he like?

215
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,976
He wasn't a very nice person.

216
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:55,358
Not just to me.

217
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:56,656
What does that mean?

218
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:01,294
He was always yelling at me to trim my trees,
even if they hung over one inch into his yard.

219
00:12:01,343 --> 00:12:05,183
Said he was afraid that the branches were
going to fall on the kids, but honestly!

220
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,796
So he was a little overprotective.

221
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:09,682
You should have seen the
way he treated those kids.

222
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:11,963
I have never seen anything like it.

223
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:15,197
He didn't let them out of that house for
the whole first month that they lived there,

224
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:18,977
Not even for a minute. I mean...

225
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,740
I'm not saying things are
any easier for karen now.

226
00:12:21,776 --> 00:12:26,616
She has to work 2 shifts at that phone
rep job just to support the kids. But...

227
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:29,618
I think things are starting to look up.

228
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:30,714
How so?

229
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:36,041
Well, i see her getting dressed up
and going out every once in a while.

230
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,923
I think she's finally met someone.

231
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:42,870
And she's gardening again, and
she says the sweetest things

232
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:46,494
about my flowers, and my trees.

233
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,556
Good to hear.

234
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,075
Thanks.

235
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:03,168
Stay away!

236
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:06,637
My family belongs to me!

237
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:19,298
The ghost is behaving in death
the same way he did in life--

238
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:21,415
Overprotective, smothering, controlling.

239
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:24,588
Yeah, but the weird part is, it's
like they all knew he was there.

240
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:25,207
How do you mean?

241
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,061
Well, if he's dead, you know,
why be on your best behavior?

242
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,418
These kids were being so polite.

243
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:34,842
And the mom, when she got her migraine,
said that she was seeing shapes and spots.

244
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,759
I mean, maybe she's actually just
seeing a manifestation of him.

245
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:38,597
Is that possible?

246
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:39,342
I don't know.

247
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:42,736
But if he moves enough stuff around, they
don't have to see him to know he's there.

248
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:43,637
Yeah.

249
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:46,942
Well, you know you're describing
the behavior of an abuser.

250
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:48,702
That's exactly what i was thinking.

251
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:53,653
Well, they isolate people from any relationship
that will take their victims away from them.

252
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,037
Well, i know he doesn't
want lisa to be with ned,

253
00:13:57,063 --> 00:14:00,723
And i'm guess he's not a big
fan of his wife's new boyfriend.

254
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:02,236
And you.

255
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,895
I'll be careful, ok?

256
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:05,075
- I promise.
- Ok.

257
00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:07,372
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

258
00:14:09,257 --> 00:14:10,497
Hi, delia.

259
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:32,009
I know you're down here.

260
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:34,035
Nathan?

261
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,559
Please talk to me.

262
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,823
I just want to help you.

263
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,327
I want to help your family.

264
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,569
Melinda, are you ok?

265
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,918
What happened to you?

266
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:53,746
I don't... Know.

267
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,727
A vision, i think?

268
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:58,919
I was reliving someone
else's experience.

269
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,688
Of what?

270
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:04,473
Of being hit, knocked to the ground.

271
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:06,242
Is this about ned's ghost?

272
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:09,253
Is ned in any kind of danger?

273
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,530
This is so wrong.
It's so totally unfair.

274
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:14,321
No, it's not, ned.

275
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:16,762
If your child was in danger,
you'd do the very same thing.

276
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:17,946
In danger from what?

277
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:20,694
From the whole bad situation!

278
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,880
What situation?

279
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:24,607
The house, that family, everything.

280
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:25,984
You mean the ghost.

281
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:28,472
Ok, the ghost.

282
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:29,957
You're such a hypocrite!

283
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:31,896
First you yell at melinda for
talking to me about ghosts,

284
00:15:31,928 --> 00:15:33,748
And now you say i can't
see lisa because of one.

285
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:35,299
What am i supposed to think?

286
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,729
The first time you see her,
you get your nose bloody.

287
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,073
It wasn't the first time.

288
00:15:39,091 --> 00:15:41,911
The first 5 times you had no
problem, until i said the word "date,"

289
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,169
And all of a sudden you
started freaking out.

290
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,966
Yes, and then the next time you saw
her, you get into a car accident.

291
00:15:46,023 --> 00:15:50,423
I have been trying to meet with her mother
ever since, and she keeps rescheduling on me!

292
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,000
She's a widow trying to raise
her kids alone, just like you.

293
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:55,562
She is not like me, ned.

294
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,211
I keep my appointments.

295
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,501
What are you really
afraid of, mom? Tell me.

296
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,065
Because i'm pretty sure it's not ghosts.

297
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,395
I am not afraid of anything.

298
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,189
Good. Then i can see lisa.

299
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,820
No. No, ned, you can't.

300
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,616
Try and stop me.

301
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,939
Ned...

302
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:17,225
Ned, come back here!

303
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:21,064
She's so overprotective, it's nuts.

304
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:22,756
She won't let me out of her sight.

305
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:23,526
I feel ya.

306
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,551
Your mom ever get like that?

307
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:28,233
My mom, my dad.

308
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:31,065
I hope it's ok melinda came over.

309
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:32,846
She wanted to ask about your dad.

310
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,637
Ned, do you ever think that
maybe your mom might be right?

311
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:37,474
About being with me?

312
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:39,355
No way. Why?

313
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:43,307
Remember i told you
before that my family...

314
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:45,451
My life's been a
little bit weird lately?

315
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:47,913
Yeah.

316
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:49,811
Never mind.

317
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,340
Look, i can't explain.

318
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:56,247
Maybe we should just try and be friends.

319
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,899
Lisa, wait.

320
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:03,199
Whatever it is you don't think you
can tell me, maybe i'd understand.

321
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:04,781
Maybe i already do.

322
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:07,821
I'm sorry, i gotta go.

323
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,815
Nathan?

324
00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:51,275
I know you feel like you're doing what's
best for your family and your children.

325
00:17:51,312 --> 00:17:53,672
Maybe you think you're
being a good parent.

326
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,707
But you're not.

327
00:17:55,729 --> 00:17:58,679
You're hurting them, still.

328
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,727
Uh, excuse me?

329
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:03,039
But what are you doing here?

330
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:06,633
Amy. Look, um...

331
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,110
I know that you lost your dad, and
that's hard for you and your mom.

332
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,650
But i think you've seen some
things and felt some things that

333
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:19,216
Maybe you can't explain,
and that's really scary.

334
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:24,021
No, no, what's scary is you, sneaking
into our yard when our mom isn't here

335
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,231
And asking us all sorts
of weird questions.

336
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:29,184
I really need you to hear this.

337
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:32,382
Your father is still
here, i've seen him.

338
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,921
What are you talking about?

339
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,650
I know it sounds strange,
but i can see ghosts.

340
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:41,485
You've seen dad?

341
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:42,436
What does he look like?

342
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,472
She's lying. Don't ask her that.

343
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:50,514
I can only see them the way that they died, which
means that he may not look how you remember  im.

344
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,241
He's wearing a sweatshirt, and
there's bruises on his face--

345
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:55,238
Ok, you know what...

346
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,210
You need to leave.

347
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,062
Come on, let's go inside.

348
00:18:58,077 --> 00:19:01,357
Amy, please just tell your mom.
If you don't, i will.But your--

349
00:19:01,387 --> 00:19:04,367
Your father needs help
crossing into the light.

350
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:07,735
I said... Leave.

351
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:23,791
Hey, i got your call. What's wrong?

352
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:28,523
We didn't want to admit it, but you
and melinda, you sorta guessed right.

353
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,565
Things aren't right at our house.

354
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,590
Admit what? Lisa?

355
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:40,441
Mom's gone. She's missing.

356
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:45,921
We were afraid to tell anyone, 'cause
people might say she's not a fit mom.

357
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:47,727
What people?

358
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:49,338
Social services.

359
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:51,787
People like that.

360
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,382
See, she started seeing this guy.

361
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:58,342
His name's steve, but he lives
out of town, like an hour's drive.

362
00:19:58,402 --> 00:20:00,852
She wanted to be with him.

363
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:06,727
We said that it would be ok on our own
for a night, but we haven't seen her since.

364
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,123
How long's she been gone?

365
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:11,077
2 days.

366
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:15,149
We keep calling her cell, and nothing.

367
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:22,139
I don't know what to do,
ned. I don't know what to do.

368
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:24,386
First thing?

369
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,740
We tell the police.

370
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:49,587
Keep your eye on the
kids. Take them with you.

371
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:51,412
Really? They had to bring the kids here?

372
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,753
They just need somebody to
identify the mother's belongings.

373
00:20:53,777 --> 00:20:55,217
Her belongings? What did they find?

374
00:20:55,236 --> 00:20:58,576
Nothing. Her purse is on the front
seat, keys are in the ignition,

375
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,017
Driver's side door is wide open,
there's not a scratch on this car,

376
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,001
And the engine started right up.

377
00:21:03,023 --> 00:21:05,473
The kids say she was on her
way to meet her boyfriend.

378
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:08,828
So do they think she was
carjacked, the police, or kidnapped?

379
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,799
Probably, but, uh...

380
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:13,091
More important, do you?

381
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:18,288
No That's the good news.

382
00:21:20,036 --> 00:21:22,246
Bad news is...

383
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,050
He's here.

384
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:37,996
Thank you. And thank
you very much for coming.

385
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:39,985
Man: absolutely.

386
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,504
Hey, henry. Are you ok?

387
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:50,469
Yeah.

388
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,870
What book are you reading?

389
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,772
It's nothing.

390
00:21:57,031 --> 00:21:59,011
Can i see it?

391
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:02,477
Memory book for dad.

392
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:04,284
Did you make this?

393
00:22:04,305 --> 00:22:06,645
We all did.

394
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:12,087
It's beautiful.

395
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:15,625
You really loved your dad, didn't you?

396
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,684
Must be hard...

397
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,668
To hear things that are critical.

398
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,880
It's hard to hear things that arewrong.

399
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:25,939
What do you mean?

400
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,676
My dad wasn't like that.

401
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:29,706
He wasn't mean or scary.

402
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:32,409
He was awesome.

403
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:37,396
Well, i-- i really want
to believe that, but...

404
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:39,155
What about when you first moved here?

405
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:41,996
I mean, someone told me that he
wouldn't even let you out of the house.

406
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:44,233
We had measles. Of course not.

407
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:45,367
You had measles?

408
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:48,863
Yeah. That's when we made
our first memory book.

409
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:51,465
I think it was called
the great outdoors.

410
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:54,670
Dad quit his job to come home and
stay with us until we got better.

411
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,770
those flowers...

412
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,413
Amy: oh, my god, mom. Oh, my god!

413
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,879
I'm so glad you're ok!

414
00:23:00,897 --> 00:23:02,607
Where have you been?

415
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:04,828
The whole town's been
going nuts worrying!

416
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:05,731
You called.

417
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:08,297
No, no there are no
messages, we didn't get any.

418
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:09,882
When are you coming home?

419
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:12,096
Ok.

420
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:15,225
Ok, well, call back as soon as you can.

421
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:18,644
I'm so glad you're ok. I love you.

422
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:20,845
Bye.

423
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:22,788
That was mom!

424
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,940
She's ok! She's coming home!

425
00:23:26,362 --> 00:23:27,712
Henry: that's great!

426
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,690
She's all right. Awesome.

427
00:23:31,352 --> 00:23:34,172
Bye. Thanks.Bye.

428
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,210
You guys...

429
00:23:37,227 --> 00:23:39,267
She's still here.

430
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:53,630
Everybody's left. Is
there something you need?

431
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:55,787
Morning glories.

432
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,860
Were those one o  her favorites?

433
00:23:57,893 --> 00:24:00,083
Your mom?

434
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,990
You know, i noticed them before.

435
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:05,108
It just... Didn't hit me.

436
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:10,416
These only bloom early in the morning, and the sun's
pretty high in the sky right now, and look at 'em.

437
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:14,219
Wide open, beautiful.

438
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:17,339
Her spirit's affecting them.

439
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:19,921
They can sense her just like you have.

440
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:23,536
Wait, so first you're seeing dad's ghost, and
now you're--you're saying you're seeing mom's?

441
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:25,868
Was it cancer?

442
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:27,252
Is that how she lost all her hair?

443
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:31,071
'Cause i saw a picture of her inside,
and she looks so different now.

444
00:24:31,104 --> 00:24:32,884
She's still sick?

445
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:34,415
- Is she hurting?
- Henry...

446
00:24:34,434 --> 00:24:36,234
No, sweetheart.

447
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,235
She's not hurting anymore.

448
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,371
All the pain's gone.

449
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:41,148
No, i just talked to mom, she's fine.

450
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:44,095
Yeah, i found this, where you left it.

451
00:24:44,123 --> 00:24:47,673
There was an outgoing call made to
this house at exactly the same time

452
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,024
You said you were on
the phone with your mom.

453
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,229
Ok. Whatever you think you're
doing for us, we're not interested.

454
00:24:54,264 --> 00:24:55,994
- We're going inside, come on!
- Is this how she wanted it?

455
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:58,795
She wanted her death to be a secret?

456
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:02,404
Is that why you buried her here?

457
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,699
You guys...

458
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,560
How could you be so stupid?

459
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:10,241
How could you bring her here?

460
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:11,111
Is she here?

461
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:13,006
How long have they lived alone?

462
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:15,848
They're not alone,
that is the whole point!

463
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:17,695
You've ruined everything!

464
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:20,836
You've destroyed my family!

465
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:40,623
So one call from you and police send over
their burliest men with picks and shovels.

466
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,160
I said you told me the truth, so for your
own sake, please don't make me a liar.

467
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:49,142
You said your mom was sick.

468
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,397
She fought it so hard.

469
00:25:52,557 --> 00:25:57,497
She had so many rounds of chemo,
and that's why she lost her hair.

470
00:25:57,537 --> 00:26:02,427
She got weak and thin, and any
little thing would bruise her.

471
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:09,329
Why? It's not fair!

472
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,761
So the spirit you saw...

473
00:26:13,786 --> 00:26:15,336
We knew you were talking about your mom,

474
00:26:15,355 --> 00:26:19,615
And we knew it would only be a matter
of time before you realized that, too.

475
00:26:19,651 --> 00:26:21,541
So you pretended she was kidnapped.

476
00:26:21,563 --> 00:26:25,883
You weren't the only one looking for her,
so we had to buy time, figure out what to do.

477
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,089
What made you decide to hide her death?

478
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:29,482
It was mom's idea.

479
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,321
She wanted us to be
together no matter what.

480
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:36,061
How long have you guys been on your own?

481
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:41,688
Mom died last fall.

482
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:44,635
We wanted her to always be with us.

483
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:48,123
It was the only way to keep her close.

484
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:10,227
I'm gonna be 18 in a few months, and
the  i can legally file for custody.

485
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:12,548
How many months?

486
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:16,173
i don't understand.

487
00:27:16,194 --> 00:27:19,244
The neighbors said that she saw
your mother leaving on dates.

488
00:27:19,272 --> 00:27:21,522
We had a sitter.

489
00:27:21,546 --> 00:27:26,646
She'd come at night and help henry with
his homework and do some grocery shopping.

490
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,187
And let me guess, she just
happens to look like your mom.

491
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:34,349
So the voice that i heard coming from inside
the house, the woman on the phone with delia,

492
00:27:34,384 --> 00:27:39,204
The one that's been talking to all
the neighbors, that's--that's all you.

493
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:42,427
Mom taught me how to do her job.

494
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:47,042
She taught me how to be her.

495
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,840
Mom knew she was dying.

496
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:02,914
Her job has benefits--
health insurance.

497
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:04,607
And it's not like we're stealing.

498
00:28:04,627 --> 00:28:06,017
I'm doing the work.

499
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:11,306
And the house is kept clean, we're
fed, lisa and henry get straight as.

500
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:13,588
What about you?

501
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:16,102
How many days of school have you missed?

502
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,867
Do you even have friends anymore?

503
00:28:18,904 --> 00:28:21,264
I'm fine.

504
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:23,508
We're fine.

505
00:28:23,532 --> 00:28:27,332
And it's hard, but mom was tough,
so we have to be tough, too.

506
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:30,667
You're not fine.

507
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:32,605
Look around you.

508
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,847
Do you have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

509
00:28:39,015 --> 00:28:40,335
mom!

510
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:42,331
Mom!

511
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,236
Henry

512
00:28:46,823 --> 00:28:49,323
Henry, wait.

513
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,563
I warned you to leave them alone.

514
00:29:00,586 --> 00:29:03,426
I couldn't, because you did.

515
00:29:03,453 --> 00:29:06,063
Look, i didn't know that you were
sick, and i'm sorry that you died,

516
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:08,069
But you have to move on,
you have to let them go.

517
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:10,321
Go? Go where?

518
00:29:10,365 --> 00:29:12,935
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

519
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,931
There are people who
will take care of them.

520
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,993
The county, you mean.

521
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:19,036
Didn't you have any
relatives? Did your husband?

522
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:20,468
There's no one.

523
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:22,257
Well, what about friends?

524
00:29:22,277 --> 00:29:25,577
I mean, you went through the
trouble of doing all this planning.

525
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:28,648
Didn't you make out a will
or specify any custody?

526
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:31,196
Do you think i didn't try?

527
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:34,102
Who wants 3 grieving
orphans in their home?

528
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:37,409
The system can hardly
place 2 siblings together.

529
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:42,269
There's a social worker now.

530
00:29:43,174 --> 00:29:46,574
I just wanted them to stay a family.

531
00:29:46,605 --> 00:29:48,525
That doesn't have to change.

532
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:52,017
You couldn't be more wrong.

533
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:02,778
Lisa: i just wanted to say i'm sorry.

534
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,233
I couldn't tell you, i just couldn't.

535
00:30:05,258 --> 00:30:07,418
Ned: no, i feel bad.

536
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:12,491
If i hadn't pushed to get closer, maybe
you guys could have just gone alone.

537
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:18,182
None of this would have happened
if i didn't like you so much.

538
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,356
I do, ned.

539
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:23,049
You hear me, right?

540
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:26,671
Yeah. I hear you.

541
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,019
I have to go.

542
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:41,701
Can i see you tomorrow?

543
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,410
I'd love that.

544
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,364
You kids are incredible.

545
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,085
You didn't let me cook,
at least let me clean up.

546
00:30:57,112 --> 00:30:58,852
We have an alternating chore list.

547
00:30:58,872 --> 00:31:00,072
We like to stick to it.

548
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,440
Look, i--i know that
foster care sounds...

549
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,730
Scary, but it's not.

550
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,070
I don't know very much about it.

551
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,210
Yeah, the social worker seemed nice.

552
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,662
Let me get that.

553
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:23,172
To think after all these months you were
here by yourself, it just breaks my heart.

554
00:31:27,325 --> 00:31:32,465
Lisa, we should take henry upstairs and get his
schoolwork together for the social worker tomorrow.

555
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:35,226
Oh, well, i'll come
up and help you kids.

556
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,343
This lock is broken.

557
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,556
Could you have mr. Alden fix it?

558
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,010
Oh, i'm not
sure.I, um--

559
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:52,624
could you call him?

560
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:57,088
Because if they take us from the house tomorrow
and the door's broken, someone might break in.

561
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,595
- Oh, yeah, ok.
- Thanks.

562
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:02,475
Come on, guys, it's late.

563
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:08,802
Hi, honey, can you call me on the cell?

564
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,456
I'm over here
with those poor--

565
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,803
kids, are you all right?

566
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:15,982
Amy: yeah, we're fine.

567
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,570
Um, there's a fuse box in
the cellar. Can you get it?

568
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:24,379
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, honey, i'll get it.

569
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:44,287
Come on.

570
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:45,951
Did you get the tickets?

571
00:32:45,971 --> 00:32:47,671
- Where are we going?
- Just walk.

572
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:51,246
The cashier at the bus
station cut up the credit card.

573
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,083
"deceased," she said.

574
00:32:52,098 --> 00:32:54,488
I took off before she
could call security.

575
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:56,163
It's ok, we still have cash.

576
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:56,963
How much cash?

577
00:32:56,978 --> 00:32:58,148
How long can it last us?

578
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,055
Just keep walking.

579
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,530
Where are we going to go,
what are we going to do?

580
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,519
I don't know. We'll figure it out.

581
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,192
What about the house?

582
00:33:04,222 --> 00:33:06,302
What about mom and dad's
stuff? What about our life here?

583
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:08,854
Don't you get it? That's already gone.

584
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,980
We're not gonna be in that house.

585
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:14,753
And you can pack up your stuff and take
it to some orphanage or halfway house

586
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,896
- or whatever will take you.
- All right, stop.

587
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,499
You're scaring me.

588
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:20,868
Yeah, well, you should be scared.

589
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:25,913
Because if you think you're gonna end up with a
nice family with lisa tucking you in every night,

590
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:28,053
- You're not.
- Shut up.

591
00:33:29,052 --> 00:33:30,512
Look...

592
00:33:30,823 --> 00:33:33,773
I'm almost 18, but you guys...

593
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:35,741
Who's going to want you

594
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,593
Freaks who stuck their
own mother in the ground.

595
00:33:40,994 --> 00:33:44,704
Now, i'm scared, too, but
this is what mom told us to do.

596
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:48,927
We have to stick together,
we have to be tough.

597
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:51,296
Ok.

598
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:53,417
We have to go.

599
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:57,032
Henry? Henry?Henry!

600
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:58,832
Where'd he go?

601
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:01,763
Henry? Henry?

602
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:09,058
Henry: sorry, you guys.

603
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:12,945
But i just can't do this anymore.

604
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:17,979
Yeah, murph overheard the a.d.a
and the social worker talking.

605
00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:21,009
Medical records have
confirmed their mom had cancer,

606
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:24,417
Nobody wants to press charges,
but lockin' up the neighbor?

607
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:25,478
It was the ghost.

608
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:28,514
Yeah, but they could
charge amy with a crime.

609
00:34:29,116 --> 00:34:30,866
Try her as an adult.

610
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:33,237
She's here.

611
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:36,021
- Can you give me a second?
- Yeah.

612
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:39,267
They're splitting them up!

613
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:43,427
Henry's going to some foster home,
while amy and lisa are being detained.

614
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:44,483
I knew it!

615
00:34:44,509 --> 00:34:47,569
This is what happens to
families when both parents die!

616
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:51,498
You can't control their lives anymore, and
every time you do, you just make it worse.

617
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:54,982
The best thing that you can do is just help
them understand what's happening to them.

618
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:57,143
You're the one who doesn't understand!

619
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:00,576
You keep saying that,
but understand what?

620
00:35:00,607 --> 00:35:03,387
What is it that you're not telling me?

621
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:07,344
Because you're afraid of something, and
it has nothing to do with the county.

622
00:35:08,494 --> 00:35:11,334
Or is itsomeone?

623
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:15,092
Is it someone who'd
get them when you died?

624
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,390
I need to talk to the
officer who found henry.

625
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:22,383
Sure, what's up?

626
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:25,229
This ghost is hiding a
lot more than her death.

627
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,866
OK

628
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:33,091
she kept saying she knew this would
happen, the kids would get torn apart.

629
00:35:33,124 --> 00:35:34,984
Officer: actually, the country
prefers to keep siblings together.

630
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:36,405
Where was she getting her information?

631
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:40,994
Well, that's what i was wondering, but then
it made me think, what if she has someone?

632
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:46,351
A sibling who is in foster care or
adopted, someone that the kids never knew?

633
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,524
You're talking about family
services records. They're sealed.

634
00:35:49,553 --> 00:35:51,793
Come on. Not for you.

635
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,177
Please.

636
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:57,095
That little boy had everything to
lose when he came to you for help.

637
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,922
He's lost so much already.

638
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:12,025
Hi, are you tracy edmondson?

639
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:13,089
Yes.

640
00:36:13,126 --> 00:36:15,196
My name is melinda gordon.

641
00:36:15,249 --> 00:36:17,769
I knew your sister karen.

642
00:36:17,814 --> 00:36:20,604
My sister?

643
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:27,986
There's so many questions. I...

644
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:32,568
I'm not honestly sure i
want to know the answers.

645
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:35,044
She had 3 children.

646
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,089
Their father died,
too. They have no one.

647
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:42,942
You didn't know that, did you?

648
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,147
You're not one of the people
she asked to take care of them.

649
00:36:46,176 --> 00:36:49,056
She probably figured i'd say no.

650
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:52,714
Because you didn't take
her when your parents died?

651
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,840
I know about the accident.

652
00:36:55,885 --> 00:36:59,165
I know that you were
19 when you lost them.

653
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:02,945
You were old enough
to take over custody.

654
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:10,136
I sat in a courtroom while the judge
asked her over and over if she wanted me.

655
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:15,561
She cried every night until
she passed out from exhaustion.

656
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:17,124
And they were my parents, too.

657
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,234
I could barely function.

658
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,500
How was i supposed to
fix her broken heart?

659
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:24,054
I don't think anyone
expected you to do that.

660
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:25,326
Except maybe you.

661
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:28,723
Well, it's too late now. She's gone.

662
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,970
What if it wasn't too
late just meet her kids.

663
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,906
They're really...

664
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:38,797
Really self sufficient and loving.

665
00:37:38,825 --> 00:37:42,255
And they need you to be their family.

666
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,010
Legally, it's the only
way they can stay together.

667
00:37:45,033 --> 00:37:47,373
She is a complete stranger to them.

668
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,347
I'm not their family.

669
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:53,969
If karen were here, she'd
tell you i'm not her family.

670
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:55,457
I gave up that right.

671
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:57,756
Listen to her. She's right.

672
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,690
So...

673
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:04,385
I can't. I don't...

674
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,810
Deserve a second chance?

675
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,200
You all do.

676
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:21,237
What are you doing?

677
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:22,842
Oh, i'm just picking up ned.

678
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:26,572
He wanted to help lisa's aunt
move the rest of her  tuff in.

679
00:38:27,148 --> 00:38:27,898
Are you guys ok?

680
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:30,772
I mean, did he ever apologize
for just walking out?

681
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,100
No, actually, i apologized to him.

682
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,120
Yeah, he was right.

683
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:40,092
It was just very hard
for me to think of him...

684
00:38:40,126 --> 00:38:42,186
Dating.

685
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:45,836
Is that why you're looking this way?

686
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:49,771
'Cause you literally can't face
the idea of ned having a girlfriend?

687
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:52,355
No, i am trying to
give them their privacy.

688
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,750
This is me... Letting go.

689
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,986
So what are they
doing? Are they kissing?

690
00:38:59,011 --> 00:39:00,601
Uh, no, she just hit him.

691
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,750
Oh, thank god.

692
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,417
But it was full of sexual tension.

693
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:06,134
Ned, come on, let's go!

694
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:08,384
We're late for practice!

695
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:13,215
What? We are!

696
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:14,639
I don't know, melinda.

697
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:16,825
I think they just want to be left alone.

698
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:17,629
Maybe, maybe not.

699
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:21,653
I remember when dad came to pick you up, and
you had all that gum stuck in your braces.

700
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:24,168
Yeah, but i won the contest.

701
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:26,823
- Yeah.
- Ok, now mom.

702
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:29,939
I rember mom taking
henry to work one day.

703
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,698
i love this one.

704
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:37,689
And you gave her computer
a big drink of grape juice.

705
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:49,669
Please don't stop because of me.

706
00:39:49,698 --> 00:39:50,608
Oh, no.

707
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:54,463
It's just a family thing
we do, just the three of us.

708
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:56,687
Tell her tracy is her family.

709
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,740
Tell her she might remember
some things they'll want to hear.

710
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:03,055
Amy, uh...

711
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:06,729
Your mom wants you
to let your aunt play.

712
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:09,191
Lisa: wait, mom's here?

713
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:12,647
Where is she?

714
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,969
I remember...

715
00:40:20,726 --> 00:40:24,496
I remember making up a
game with your mother.

716
00:40:25,686 --> 00:40:28,046
It was called "i rember."

717
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,050
Sweetheart, listen.

718
00:40:30,072 --> 00:40:32,942
'Cause after our parents died,

719
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,500
i told your mother to rember one
thing about each of them every night

720
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:42,927
Before she went to sleep, and that
way, they would be with her always.

721
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:46,564
Even if i couldn't be.

722
00:40:48,886 --> 00:40:52,526
Youmade up the game?

723
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:55,788
Tell them to listen to their aunt,
because she knows the story about

724
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:59,498
When we camped out on copper
island with mom and dad.

725
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,451
Tracy...

726
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:05,812
Can you tell them the story
about camping on copper island?

727
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:08,439
Oh, come on, aunt
tracy! What's the deal?

728
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:11,955
'Cause mom always hated camping.

729
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,430
Well, how do you think
she learned to hate it?

730
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:20,563
I remember your mother, a rope swing,

731
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:24,428
and a giant bed of poison ivy that

732
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:27,972
She fell into, because...

733
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,766
What is that?

734
00:42:06,788 --> 00:42:09,278
It's so beautiful.

735
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,911
It's time, isn't it?

736
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:17,497
Only you know that.

737
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:47,501
There's room over here, aunt tracy.

738
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,875
come on, tracy. Sit down.

739
00:42:48,893 --> 00:42:51,283
Yeah, tell us more.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
