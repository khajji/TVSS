1
00:00:01,578 --> 00:00:03,148
Previously on ghost whisperer.

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:06,356
they're what's left over of old roads,alleyways,

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:09,403
they're what's left over of another town--underground.

4
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:10,279
Dad!

5
00:00:10,293 --> 00:00:11,083
You're alive.

6
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:12,677
It has to do with paul eastman.

7
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:14,816
You sent him to prison,only he escaped.

8
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:18,847
I've put a lot of people in jail, and none of them have come after me.

9
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:21,528
What if he's hiding from someone, someone who he sent to prison?

10
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,362
What if he's just lying to protect me?

11
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:24,741
The man killed a little boy.

12
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,678
He escaped during a prison fire.

13
00:00:27,191 --> 00:00:30,601
Facial burn victims wear a clear mask during treatment.

14
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:31,969
Paul eastman is dead.

15
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:33,066
He possessed my dad.

16
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,551
He's just trying to get his revenge.

17
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:35,871
I have to warn my dad.

18
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:38,564
Dad?!

19
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:40,857
Oh,my god!

20
00:00:43,013 --> 00:00:43,863
Tom gordon!

21
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:46,294
Tom,we're coming in.

22
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:49,825
It's a gunshot victim.

23
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:51,885
What are his vitals?

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,349
Tom,can you hear me?

25
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,960
tom?

26
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:02,941
I had to.

27
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:06,499
I had to protect her,I had to.

28
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,068
Try to be quiet.

29
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:10,154
- It's all right.
- I had to.

30
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,409
Hey,hi.

31
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:32,133
Your father's in critical condition, and the next 24 hours are key.

32
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,578
How could he be alive?

33
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:35,756
I saw him,I saw his head.

34
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,188
Cold feet.

35
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:40,696
He had the gun right against his temple, but he moved his hand just as he fired.

36
00:01:40,913 --> 00:01:42,853
Maybe he changed his mind at the last second.

37
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:46,858
Now the bullet had lodged under the scalp, but it didn't penetrate the skull.

38
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,844
So he made it through surgery quick and easy.

39
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,625
Now all we have to do is watch and wait.

40
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,653
Yeah.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,520
It's all right.

42
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,113
Hey,thanks a lot,doc.

43
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:55,962
You got it.Just page me if you need me,

44
00:01:56,142 --> 00:01:57,762
cause you know I never really leave this place.

45
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,003
- Hey.
- Why would he do this?

46
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,142
I mean,he must have been possessed.

47
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:06,324
Look,before we brought him in, he said something to me.

48
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,475
He told me he did this to protect you.

49
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:09,698
Protect me?

50
00:02:10,034 --> 00:02:10,994
From what?

51
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,289
Or who.

52
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,257
Paul eastman?

53
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:14,671
No,he's haunting my father.

54
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:16,088
Why would he be a threat to me?

55
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,719
Maybe that's a question for dear old dad.

56
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,271
Hey.

57
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,596
I don't really know if you can hear me,

58
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,821
but they told me maybe you could.

59
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,517
Look,dad,I'm--I'm really confused.

60
00:02:55,138 --> 00:02:56,148
I don't know.

61
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:02,021
I don't know what you're supposed to mean to me.

62
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:06,099
I mean,you leave us when I'm 9,.

63
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:07,927
and then you just

64
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:09,776
come back.

65
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,875
No explanation,nothing.

66
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,151
I don't really know what you think about me.

67
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:22,652
Or what I really think about you.

68
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:29,084
So it's a really bad time to die,ok?

69
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:34,707
Because there's so much that we need to know about each other.

70
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,139
About everything.

71
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:07,437
Sorry.

72
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,754
There was a line out the door.

73
00:04:11,946 --> 00:04:13,806
I have been doing things like this all day!

74
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,186
Hey,hey,don't worry about it.

75
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,763
But just don't try to pick it up.

76
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,231
I'm gonna get a broom.

77
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:24,516
Are you ok?

78
00:04:25,054 --> 00:04:26,414
Yeah,yeah,whatever.

79
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:29,329
Hey,how is your dad?

80
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:34,598
Uh,resting comfortably or so they say, and if that's true,he's the only one.

81
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,427
What the hell is going on?

82
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:40,183
It's a long story,but I think my dad's being haunted by this man he sent to prison.

83
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,503
,an innocent man

84
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,040
Haunted how?

85
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:46,972
I think this ghost just figured out a way to possess people for a few minutes,

86
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:49,928
or at least long enough to get them to do the things he wants done.

87
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:52,779
Like your dad killing himself?

88
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:53,588
Yeah,that's one theory.

89
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:55,102
This does not taste like green tea.

90
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,510
Yeah,because you took mine.

91
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:57,807
Oh.Sorry.

92
00:04:58,146 --> 00:05:00,146
What I don't understand is why now?

93
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:03,787
I mean,why would paul eastman wait 30 years to get vengeance?

94
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:07,761
Are you asking me like you actually expect an answer?

95
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:12,076
Yeah,well,you know what,you work on that for a while,and I'm gonna go get us some new glasses.

96
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:14,562
You know what,you need a break.

97
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:19,103
We really should go next week and see the tall ships come into the harbor at piermont,ok?

98
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:20,805
You mean do something fun?

99
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,249
I have no training for that.

100
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,030
It's settled!

101
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:26,185
We are going.

102
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:16,239

105
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,546
Paul?

106
00:06:58,969 --> 00:06:59,969
Paul eastman?

107
00:07:08,157 --> 00:07:10,807
You don't really think this stuff scares me,do you?

108
00:07:10,861 --> 00:07:13,861
Well,fear is a relative thing,I've always found.

109
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,710
I know that you've been possessing my father.

110
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,684
I know that you want revenge.

111
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,336
You blame him for sending you to prison.

112
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,846
Tip of the iceberg.

113
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,630
He tried to kill himself just to get rid of you.

114
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,143
He thinks you're trying to hurt me.

115
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:30,672
I know that you're the one that's been haunting me in my dreams.

116
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,134
Why don't you just leave him alone?

117
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,402
Give me your best shot.

118
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,410
It's touching that you believe your father to be so noble.

119
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:40,419
No,never said he was noble,

120
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:43,204
but I do believe that everyone deserves forgiveness.

121
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:45,072
He didn't set out to hurt you.

122
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:48,581
Your father didn't try to kill himself to save you;

123
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:50,966
he did it because I made him.

124
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:55,074
I put that gun to his head myself.

125
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,537
But he's strong,I'll give him that.

126
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,019
He saved himself.

127
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:02,441
You really do hate him.

128
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,979
There are few who deserve hatred more than that man.

129
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:08,519
You have no idea.

130
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:10,101
So tell me.

131
00:08:11,153 --> 00:08:12,633
I don't think I will.

132
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,732
And I don't think you'll believe me.

133
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:15,963
Try me.

134
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,888
Every journey begins with the first step.

135
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:48,907
Mom.

136
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,469
What are you doing here?

137
00:10:51,605 --> 00:10:52,845
Nice to see you,too.

138
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,712
Why haven't you been answering your phone?

139
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,052
'Cause then I'd have to talk to whoever's calling.

140
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:57,774
That's clear.

141
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,277
Cold,but clear.

142
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,128
How's the new shop?

143
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,720
I like working with flowers.

144
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:06,541
They're beautiful,they smell nice.

145
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,284
And when they die,they don't come back with complaints.

146
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,750
Ok then.

147
00:11:11,368 --> 00:11:13,378
I'm not discussing your father.

148
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,289
Who says this is about him?

149
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,823
Maybe it's about something else altogether.

150
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:17,271
- Is it?
- No,it's about dad.

151
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,439
I am not discussing your father.

152
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,640
Fine,let me talk then.

153
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:24,436
I found out that he prosecuted a man named paul eastman for murder,

154
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:27,456
only he was innocent,and his ghost is back trying to get revenge.

155
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:31,014
This is sounding a lot like a conversation about your father.

156
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,790
Did you know paul eastman?

157
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,752
I mean,did dad ever talk about him?

158
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:37,055
Why don't you ask him?

159
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,231
Well,he's got his hands full right now.

160
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,817
You know,bullet in the head and all that?

161
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,599
Not that you'd care.

162
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,295
It wasn't life-threatening.

163
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,576
It didn't even get past the scalp.

164
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,226
So you checked on him?

165
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:48,965
One phone call.

166
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,018
Look,melinda,I don't mean to sound hard-hearted about this,

167
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,550
but your father is not a good person.

168
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:58,183
He's not misunderstood.

169
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,073
He's just plain bad.

170
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,847
You need to accept that.

171
00:12:02,865 --> 00:12:04,885
He doesn't deserve your good intentions.

172
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:07,735
He doesn't even.

173
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
I left the door unlocked.

174
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,239
I have to get back.

175
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,103
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:14,921
I cannot help you.

177
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:24,228
You have to look at the big picture here.

178
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:27,066
You can't just get caught up in where you are right now,

179
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,550
although that is the trap that we all seem to get caught up in.

180
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:34,868
You know,it's where am I, where am I going,what's going to happen.

181
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:37,012
These are--hello?!

182
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:39,702
You know,you should really be taking notes on this,my little friend.

183
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,606
I know you are not talking to that gerbil.

184
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:45,386
His name is bob,by the way,and,you know, I don't even know why I bother with this guy.

185
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:47,335
It's in one little ear,out the other with him.

186
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:48,346
How's your dad?

187
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:50,271
Stable,which is more than I can say for me.

188
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,841
Well,stability's overrated.

189
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:52,459
I wouldn't know.

190
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,552
Anyway,do you remember paul eastman, the guy who was haunting my father?

191
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,268
No,but if you hum a few bars.

192
00:12:57,468 --> 00:12:59,568
He's not only haunting him,he's possessing him.

193
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:02,819
You know,like making him do all kinds of things,I don't know,trying to kill himself.

194
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:04,476
Well,the dead are really getting the hang of this.

195
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:05,784
That can't be good news for the living.

196
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,641
Yeah,and I've already talked to eastman, and he hates my father with a passion,

197
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,666
so I don't even know if I'm going to be able to turn this guy around.

198
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,857
And by the way,I found eastman's bones

199
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,149
buried in the basement of a house that his ghost led me to.

200
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:16,811
That's quite a "by the way" you just laid on me.

201
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,939
Did anything ordinary happen to you in the past few days?

202
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,100
Um,no.

203
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:20,816
I didn't think so.

204
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:21,890
Any ideas?

205
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:24,505
Well,no one's bones are found buried in someone's basement

206
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:26,209
if they died a nice,happy,peaceful death.

207
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:28,148
I think he was murdered and he wants you to solve it.

208
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:29,108
No,that's too simple.

209
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,123
I mean,he would have laid all that out for me first thing.

210
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,343
Whatever it is,he knows the answer,and he wants me to figure out the mystery for myself.

211
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:34,960
Why?

212
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:38,183
Because he said that I wouldn't believe him if he tried to tell me--

213
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,314
If that's for me,I already left.

214
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:41,986
Hello?

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,680
Hey,I found something in the archives.

216
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:46,159
That house you were in,where you found the bones.

217
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:48,956
you know that house.

218
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:50,116
No,I don'T.

219
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:51,042
Yeah,you do.

220
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:53,317
They might have changed the name on the street,but you know it.

221
00:13:54,173 --> 00:13:55,063
How?

222
00:13:56,022 --> 00:14:00,692
The name on the original deed is thomas and beth gordon.

223
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:02,982
It was your parents' first home.

224
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,817
What?£¡

225
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,613
Honey,it's the house you were born in.

226
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:12,733
bones?

227
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:17,032
As in a skeleton in the basement of the house you and dad owned.

228
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:20,384
That could have been there for a hundred years,for all you know.

229
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:21,349
Nice try.

230
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:24,905
Ok,the bones belong to that man that dad sent to prison,paul eastman.

231
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,162
He was the one that led me there,

232
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,029
and you're gonna act like you don't know what I'm talking about?

233
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:30,284
What difference does it make?

234
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,580
You never believe me anyway.

235
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:32,297
Why should I?

236
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:33,941
You never tell me the truth.

237
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,802
Then don't ask.

238
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,081
Just leave me in peace.

239
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:40,481
Peace is not an option noright All right?

240
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:42,303
Sooner or later,the police are going to get involved.

241
00:14:42,322 --> 00:14:44,162
It happened at your house,they're coming to you.

242
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,452
You be may be implicated in a murder!

243
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,667
Melinda,I know you don't have much respect for what I say,

244
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:53,556
but I am asking you this one time to listen to me--

245
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:56,063
leave this alone.

246
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:58,814
There is no good for anybody at the end of this road.

247
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:00,638
Yeah,that's the difference between you and me.

248
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,590
I can't live with a lie.

249
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:06,444
You would be surprised at what you can learn to live with.

250
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:18,592
I didn't recognize anything in the basment.

251
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:19,751
It's really changed.

252
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:20,917
Well it's abandoned now.

253
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,581
You want to go inside?

254
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,099
No.

255
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:26,094
Too many bad memories?

256
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:28,634
Too many memories,period.

257
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:31,627
Now I've searched every online news site.

258
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:34,478
Paul eastman escaped from prison and was never heard from again.

259
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:35,413
Right.

260
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:39,008
Until he shows up as a skeleton in the house where you and your parents used to live.

261
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:40,599
It's crazy.

262
00:15:42,504 --> 00:15:43,324
What is it?

263
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:44,199
I don't know.

264
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,908
I-I just don't know what I'm supposed to do next.

265
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,007
You know,I.

266
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,826
I just have this really bad feeling.

267
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:53,266
Like when I was a little girl waiting on my dad to do the right thing.

268
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,670
You know,or trying to figure out how to understand him.

269
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,560
And I just keep getting hurt, and then he walks away.

270
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:02,789
You know,I hate to say this, but maybe your mother's right.

271
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,030
Maybe it's time for you to cut him out of your life,

272
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,201
the way he cut you out of his.

273
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,500
I wish I could.

274
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,469
But I'm not him.

275
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:14,475
I gotta get back to the store,

276
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,070
- I'll see you later. - Ok.

277
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:24,403
- Yeah?
- Hey,jim,dr.Farrington,

278
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,612
just giving you a head's up in case the hospital hasn't called.

279
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:30,256
Tell melinda that her dad is conscious and talking.

280
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,140
Yeah.

281
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,223
I'll do that.

282
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,029
Sorry,I'm just a little dizzy.

283
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:58,466
Hey,boss,do you mind,uh,this is my father-in-law.

284
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:00,858
Do you mind if we,uh, take a walk to my-- thanks a lot.

285
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:04,101
Jim clancy.

286
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,056
I heard so much about you.

287
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:08,254
It's if I knew you.

288
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:11,368
You don't know me,tom.

289
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:12,816
You know nothing about me.

290
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,003
Come on.

291
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:17,924
You know,unlike melinda, I got nothing invested in you,zero.

292
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,462
You're just the guy who's put my wife through a world of pain.

293
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,579
She'd be much better off if you never took another breath.

294
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:26,738
I almost obliged,didn't I?

295
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,759
Yeah,but you missed.

296
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:31,611
And then you tell me you did it to protect her?

297
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:33,893
I'm having trouble believing that.

298
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:35,846
I misspoke.

299
00:17:36,636 --> 00:17:38,136
Do not mess with melinda's head.

300
00:17:38,536 --> 00:17:39,926
I won't have that.

301
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,724
I've always had to stand by,

302
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:43,993
watch her tossed around and hurt by things I don't understand,

303
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:46,574
but you. you'll understand.

304
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:48,082
I don't think you do.

305
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:49,166
Oh,I think so.

306
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:51,995
And I think you're gonna start telling me the truth,

307
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:55,658
or I'm gonna come back here when you are sound asleep in your room,

308
00:17:56,087 --> 00:18:00,597
and I'm gonna cut some very important tubes and watch you die for real,tom.

309
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,197
But jim.

310
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:05,556
you're sworn to save lives.

311
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,629
Comes out a roaring second compared to saving my wife.

312
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:18,161
It all goes back to paul eastman.

313
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:22,498
He spent 9 years in prison,then he escaped.

314
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:27,176
Came to find me,actually beth and me and melinda.

315
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:31,325
The thing is,prison didn't agree with him.

316
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,120
He was demented,and he wanted revenge.

317
00:18:36,768 --> 00:18:38,608
He was going to kill my wife and daughter.

318
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:40,974
And me,too.

319
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:50,906
Could have done a lot of things.

320
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,171
I could have called the cops.

321
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,508
Could have drove his body to the mountains and dumped it.

322
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,050
I wanted to keep him right there.

323
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:00,806
I wanted to always know where he was.

324
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:04,442
Wanted to keep this in the family.

325
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,296
You were the assistant district attorney.

326
00:19:07,889 --> 00:19:09,129
Why didn't you call the police?

327
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:11,146
It seems like a pretty clear case of self defense.

328
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:13,976
Maybe.

329
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:17,889
But it would have been a big media story.

330
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:21,347
And how would melinda have processed all this?

331
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:21,879
She was 9.

332
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:27,225
What if she got harassed about it at school, or had reporters following her?

333
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:30,551
So you see,just like you,my friend,

334
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,177
burying a body came in a roaring second to protecting my family.

335
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:37,236
Oh,yeah.

336
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:39,742
Is that why you left them right after that?

337
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,211
There's never only one reason for these things.

338
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:49,826
The important thing both of us have to remember is this--

339
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,777
paul eastman still wants to kill me.

340
00:19:52,631 --> 00:19:53,691
from the grave.

341
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,339
The problem with that is?

342
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:02,207
I don't expect anybody to cry any tears over me,but he still wants to kill beth,

343
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,222
and he still wants to kill melinda.

344
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:06,374
And I don't know how to stop him.

345
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:08,899
Do you?

346
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:14,403
My father admitted to you that he's a killer?

347
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:17,304
I know this seems like an episode of father knows best gone horribly wrong,

348
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,189
and I am the last guy to defend your dad,

349
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:21,549
but it does look like a case of self defense.

350
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,091
So I guess we know why paul eastman was haunting him.

351
00:20:24,326 --> 00:20:26,166
Hey,correction-- haunting you,mel.

352
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,725
Your dad told me this guy wants to hurt you,your mom,and him,

353
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,134
and by hurt,I don't mean just push and shove,ok?

354
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:35,116
Yeah,I know.I convinced my dad to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger.

355
00:20:35,745 --> 00:20:37,655
You know,that's what I don't understand.

356
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:39,596
Paul eastman,he's a powerful ghost,right?

357
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:42,968
So why hasn't he possessed you?

358
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:44,815
Why hasn't he really come after you?

359
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,702
For one,he obviously has things he wants me to find out first.

360
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:49,359
Yeah,like what?

361
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,988
Since I'm still alive,I don't know yet.

362
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:55,129
Not a big fan of the gallows humor when it concerns your safety.

363
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:03,307
That would have been pretty impressive if it had been bourbon.

364
00:21:03,991 --> 00:21:06,801
Pinot grigio has a pretty big kick.

365
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:09,082
What are you going to do?

366
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,742
There's only one way to get him to cross over.

367
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:20,345
Ok,I think I can make it from here.

368
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,646
Good enough,thanks.

369
00:21:25,272 --> 00:21:27,322
I didn't expect you to get out so soon.

370
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,887
Signed myself out.

371
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:32,516
There's too many sick people in that hospital.

372
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,109
I need you to let me take you to paul eastman.

373
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,143
-Serves no purpose.
-Is it true.

374
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:40,313
Was he really going to kill mom and me.

375
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,232
Just a second.

376
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:47,913
Melinda,it's a little late.

377
00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:51,049
for me to be a hero in your eyes.

378
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:53,155
I did what I had to do,that's all.

379
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,790
I saved myself as well.

380
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,430
I heard what you said in there.

381
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:00,799
When.

382
00:22:00,826 --> 00:22:03,486
When you came to my hospital room.

383
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,410
A moment of weakness.

384
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,400
Understood.

385
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:10,627
Am I ever going to find out.

386
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,247
Find out what.

387
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:15,125
Who you are.

388
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,000
If you ever loved me.

389
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,237
If you ever loved mom.

390
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,960
If you love me now.

391
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:27,154
-Melinda,it's so complicated
- no,it really isn'T.

392
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:29,203
Everybody always says that,but.

393
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:32,703
at the end of the day,it's pretty damn simple.

394
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:35,534
Either love is there or isn'T.

395
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:40,026
No excuse,no qualifications,no complications.

396
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:43,045
Why do you want me to talk to paul eastman.

397
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:45,495
I want you to apologize to him.

398
00:22:45,518 --> 00:22:48,728
I want you to tell him why you did what you did.

399
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:52,989
I want you to have closure.

400
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:55,567
with at least one person.

401
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:57,173
And maybe he'll leave us alone.

402
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,898
That's the only way any of this is going to end.

403
00:23:02,908 --> 00:23:06,428
All right.I don't think it's going to help,but if you do,I will.

404
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:11,076
I'll come to your shop tonight,and after it's over,we'll talk.

405
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,560
And I'll tell you everything that you want to know about me,about us.

406
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:21,086
No more complications.

407
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:16,442
Dad.

408
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:18,979
Hey.I was just walking by,I saw the lights on.

409
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:21,942
-Everything ok.
-Yeah.

410
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:24,058
Sorry,I thought you were someone else.

411
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,319
-Who. -No one worth talking about.

412
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,495
Thanks.

413
00:24:43,338 --> 00:24:46,148
He's gonna hurt her,you know.

414
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:52,301
-What.
-She has to know.

415
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,265
It's the only way you can save her.

416
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,677
And she has to hear it from you.

417
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:01,451
Don't let her find out from tom.

418
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:04,422
You know what he's capable of.

419
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:07,248
She's safer not knowing.

420
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,736
Not anymore.

421
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:31,763
Oh,I hope you have some bourbon and a straw.

422
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,710
You won't believe the day I had.

423
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,523
I haven't told you the truth.

424
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:40,908
No kidding.

425
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:42,348
About what.

426
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:45,086
About a lot of things.

427
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:50,874
I lied about not knowing paul eastman.

428
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,230
I was in love with him.

429
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,622
We were engaged.

430
00:25:55,644 --> 00:25:59,474
I was living with him when he was arrested.

431
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:08,133
Paul and I had been living together for about a year.

432
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:11,322
I knew he wasn't guilty of that murder.

433
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:15,186
I knew that a ghost had led him to that boy's body.

434
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:17,226
But who was going to believe that.

435
00:26:17,246 --> 00:26:20,566
So you went to the prosecutor.

436
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,864
-that's how you met dad.
-Yes.

437
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:28,181
After he was convicted.

438
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:30,624
I never expected him to believe me.

439
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,306
I had to show him the ghost in his own office before he did.

440
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,120
-Where is he.
-Right there,in the corner.

441
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:37,584
What's he wearing.

442
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:42,242
He's wearing a brown suit,uh,probably from the late 1800s.

443
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:48,466
He's got a gray beard,white hair,uh,long,and glasses.

444
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:50,848
You just described mr.Mclaughlin.

445
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:52,721
This was his office like a hundred years ago.

446
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,250
Of course,then he did believe me,

447
00:26:55,274 --> 00:26:58,974
and he realized it was possible that paul was innocent.

448
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,953
I told paul that there was hope;

449
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:06,618
that tom was doing everything he could to find evidence to exonerate him.

450
00:27:06,663 --> 00:27:09,103
Paul was the love of my life.

451
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:11,535
When he went to prison,it was like.

452
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:13,868
I died inside.

453
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:15,191
I didn't want to.

454
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:19,997
I tried to fight it,but I started having feelings for tom.

455
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,817
I thought he was such a good man.

456
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:27,883
Paul was going more and more inside himself,and.

457
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:29,923
and there was tom gordon.

458
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:32,833
Centered,very sure of himself.

459
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:38,538
And he cared,or at least he did the best imitation of someone who cared that I'd ever seen.

460
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:42,494
How did you tell paul.

461
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:45,371
I didn'T.

462
00:27:45,745 --> 00:27:48,325
How could you not tell him.

463
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,259
I was confused.

464
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,829
I felt guilty.

465
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:56,147
His letters were getting so angry and bitter.

466
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:59,589
I was trying to figure out how to tell him.

467
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:04,088
And then he killed a man in prison.

468
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:13,675
He was never gonna get out then.

469
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,942
It was over for him.

470
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:18,882
And you married dad.

471
00:28:22,506 --> 00:28:25,176
I'm not proud of any of this,melinda.

472
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,150
I'm not judging you,mom,really.I'm not.

473
00:28:28,175 --> 00:28:31,955
How did paul find you after he escaped from prison.

474
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:36,039
He read something in the newspaper about tom's career,

475
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:40,216
and in the article it mentioned me and.

476
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:42,518
and that we had a daughter.

477
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,210
He started a fire.

478
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:46,868
Undedhe ep getting badly burned.

479
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:53,352
And when he was in the hospital ward,he managed to escape.

480
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,298
He found us.

481
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:59,847
Well,I guess you know the rest.

482
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:01,849
Do we know the rest.

483
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,380
I mean,do we,beth.

484
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:06,838
Or are we just going to wait around for you to tell us the next big missing piece in melinda's life.

485
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:10,036
-Jim,don'T.
-No,you know what,I'm sick of this.

486
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:15,512
I am sick of people like you and like her father who should have been protecting her.

487
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:18,831
Who should still be watching out for her instead of lying to her.

488
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,878
I mean,playing mind games with her when she's in danger.

489
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:21,949
Jim,this isn't helping.

490
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:25,994
Beth,all she ever wanted from you was for you to accept her as she is.

491
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:28,065
And maybe from her father,maybe an explanation.

492
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:30,386
You know.How do you walk out on a family.

493
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:32,338
And for all that,I mean,look at her.

494
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:34,968
She still wants to understand.

495
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:37,582
She still wants to forgive.

496
00:29:37,615 --> 00:29:40,545
But every time she opens her heart to you,you stick a knife in it.

497
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:45,511
Beth,you ran away from everything you could do in your life.

498
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:47,516
My wife runs toward it.

499
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,470
And for that,she deserves just the littlest bit of respect.

500
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,664
You know,a little truth.

501
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:58,962
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:03,747
-Mom,I -no.He's right.

503
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:05,891
You're right.

504
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:08,052
There is another missing piece.

505
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,463
What.

506
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:12,336
When paul was arrested.

507
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:16,072
I was pregnant.

508
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:18,196
Mom,what are you saying.

509
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,886
I was pregnant with you.

510
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:28,922
Paul eastman is my father.

511
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:32,441
You're lying.

512
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,900
No.

513
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:36,172
We didn't tell you.

514
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,849
We didn't tell anyone.

515
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:45,638
Tom wanted you and he wasn't afraid that you might have this thing,this so-called gift.

516
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,810
You're lying.

517
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:50,219
You're lying.

518
00:31:18,368 --> 00:31:20,588
Is it true.

519
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,049
Is what true.

520
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:25,137
That you're not my father.

521
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:30,267
If you say it's complicated,I will kill you right here.

522
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:42,055
Your mother's trying to drive a wedge between us.

523
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:44,751
You can see that,can't you.

524
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:48,078
No one will tell me the truth.

525
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:50,342
Come with me,and I will.

526
00:31:50,384 --> 00:31:52,524
Come with you where.

527
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:55,485
A place where you'll be safe.

528
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,360
Safe.Right.

529
00:31:58,395 --> 00:32:01,945
Look.I'm sorry.

530
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:03,964
I really am.

531
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:07,754
This whole thing is such a mess.

532
00:32:07,794 --> 00:32:11,434
I never meant for you to be involved.

533
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:14,073
Not like this.

534
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:19,214
Come with me,and you'll understand everything.

535
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:52,977
I'm curious,what do you remember about that night,the night paul eastman came here.

536
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:55,138
Not much.

537
00:32:55,441 --> 00:32:59,981
Just his face,with that horrible mask leaning over me.I was scared.

538
00:33:00,025 --> 00:33:03,255
-What else.
-That's all,why.

539
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,332
Could be important.

540
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,782
What I remember.

541
00:33:07,815 --> 00:33:11,535
Why don't you go upstairs and see if your room jogs anything.

542
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:28,279
Your bed was right over there.

543
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:30,771
You never even heard him come in.

544
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:32,424
Did you see him leave.

545
00:33:32,453 --> 00:33:34,923
No.I just went back to sleep.

546
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:39,166
-You sure.
-Yeah.Yeah,I.

547
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:55,532
that's it.

548
00:33:55,553 --> 00:33:58,303
The breaking glass,it woke me up.

549
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,587
And then.

550
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:01,449
And then the voices.

551
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:03,013
You can't just show up here and

552
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:07,091
What'd you think I'd do,make an appointment.

553
00:34:07,122 --> 00:34:08,172
I can't help you.There's nothing I can do.

554
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:10,883
You know why I'm here.

555
00:34:10,902 --> 00:34:13,872
I saw all the files.

556
00:34:13,908 --> 00:34:15,908
All the court records.

557
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,528
You never lifted a finger to help me.

558
00:34:18,562 --> 00:34:22,962
Everything thatd ou tol ybeth that you were doing for me,that was all a lie.

559
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:25,515
You wanted to keep me in prison.

560
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:26,718
Keep your voice down.

561
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:32,384
What do you think beth is going to say when she finds out that you hired that other prisoner to kill me,

562
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:36,244
that you wanted me dead so that you could have her all to yourself.

563
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:40,014
She'll never believe you,but you do what you have to do.

564
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:42,233
I will.

565
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:05,694
It's funny how memories mecan co rushing back.

566
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:07,176
What are you doing.

567
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:10,804
I'm sorry,melinda,but the thing is.

568
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:15,115
I just can't let you live now.

569
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:24,468
Wait.You knew paul eastman was innocent,and you kept him in jail.

570
00:35:24,514 --> 00:35:28,724
Innocence is kind of a broad concept at times.

571
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:33,666
Besides,your mother wanted me and not some needy,haunted guy.

572
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,881
So I just.

573
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:37,563
made sure he stayed where he belonged.

574
00:35:37,581 --> 00:35:41,001
But your mother,she's nothing if not devoted.

575
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,939
She just wouldn'T.

576
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,079
give up on that guy.

577
00:35:44,095 --> 00:35:47,635
So you tried to have him killed in prison.

578
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:52,481
When they told me that paul killed that guy instead.

579
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:02,837
He had more on the ball than I thought he did.

580
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:05,265
It was a win-win in any case.

581
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:07,185
He was convicted for that murder,too.

582
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:12,745
Your mother and I,well,not exactly happily ever after,I guess,but still,it's nice to.

583
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,944
win.

584
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:17,065
So why did you come back here.

585
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:18,496
Why wouldn't you just leave me alone.

586
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:21,834
Because you had to go and find the underground,wake up paul eastman.

587
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,271
You know what your problem is,melinda.

588
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:26,224
You're just too good for your own good.

589
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:30,794
I kept hoping that you would get scared off.

590
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:34,646
But you don't scare easily,do you.

591
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:37,068
Dad,please.dad.

592
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,860
Don't call me dad.

593
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,529
I'm not your father.

594
00:36:40,558 --> 00:36:43,108
I wasn't talking to you.

595
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,080
No.No.

596
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,609
-Hey,are you all right.
-Yeah,I'm all right.

597
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,162
How did you find me.I looked everywhere.

598
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:31,335
But then I thought,you're looking for eastman's ghost here,with the bones.

599
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:35,096
He's dead.

600
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:46,976
You're my father.

601
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:50,348
Have you always known.

602
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,340
After I died,I forgot almost everything about my life.

603
00:37:55,386 --> 00:38:02,466
It was like I'd become paralyzed,stuck down below with all of the other angry,bitter spirits.

604
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:10,004
But then I saw something.

605
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:14,243
Something that changed everything.

606
00:38:14,285 --> 00:38:16,885
It woke me up.

607
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:20,573
-What.
-You.

608
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:25,618
I saw you moving through the church,and I knew instantly.

609
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:28,924
I felt that you were from me.

610
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,671
You were so beautiful.

611
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,450
The more I watched you,the more I saw how you pined for the man that you thought was your father

612
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:40,255
how you were waiting for him to love you back,

613
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,150
and I knew that I could nerve compete with your idea of him,

614
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,970
so I had to try and make you destroy that myth yourself.

615
00:38:49,015 --> 00:38:52,735
You could have told me this so much sooner.

616
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:56,265
You would never have believed me.

617
00:38:56,544 --> 00:39:01,184
This was a journey you had to take on your own.With my help.

618
00:39:01,218 --> 00:39:07,588
You've spent so much time trying to understand the man who pretended to be your father,

619
00:39:07,632 --> 00:39:13,362
you never saw the one person who was right in front of your eyes.

620
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:16,371
I've tried.

621
00:39:16,407 --> 00:39:19,367
But she always pushes me away.

622
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:22,713
And she lies about everything.

623
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,490
She only wanted to protect you.

624
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,720
That's what mothers do.

625
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:35,146
But you've only.looked at her in the shadow of tom gordon.

626
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:38,724
But she has always put you first.

627
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,950
It's time.to make things right.

628
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,507
Be too good for your own good.

629
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:58,872
I don't blame you for hating me.

630
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:02,157
Mom,I could never hate you.

631
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:05,134
You're busy fighting your own battles.

632
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,980
You always believed in him.I just didn't see how I could take that away from you.

633
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:13,471
Mom,I'm relieved.

634
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:18,318
My father didn't abandon me.

635
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:20,758
At least not by choice.

636
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:28,814
And to know that he would have wanted me if he could have,makes all the difference.

637
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:33,383
Somewhere,deep down inside,I always felt like I was disposable.

638
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:37,731
Now I don'T.

639
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,709
Go.

640
00:40:58,346 --> 00:41:01,636
You never were fond of seeing ghosts,were you.

641
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:05,183
I'll make an exception today.

642
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:08,274
How can I ever ask you to forgive me.

643
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:11,537
I was so full of rage.

644
00:41:11,574 --> 00:41:14,404
at you and him.

645
00:41:15,092 --> 00:41:18,402
I just wanted you all to feel as much pain as I did,

646
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,260
but that all went away with just one word.

647
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,420
What.

648
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:27,396
"Dad.

649
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:34,154
" When my daughter called for me,when she needed me,

650
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:39,191
all the fury went away,and I just wanted to save her.

651
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:43,777
-If I could do this all over again
- I wouldn't change a thing

652
00:41:44,404 --> 00:41:47,324
Look at what we created.

653
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,480
She's the reason we came together.

654
00:41:50,948 --> 00:41:53,848
Nothing else matters.

655
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:56,733
Nothing.

656
00:42:00,136 --> 00:42:05,616
-The light.
-Yeah.It's getting brighter.

657
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:08,395
But there's so much that.

658
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:13,459
-I need to know.
-No.There isn'T.

659
00:42:13,495 --> 00:42:16,575
You're loved.

660
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:19,641
That's all,that's everything.

661
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,670
And so am I.

662
00:42:49,874 --> 00:42:54,834
-Clean slate.
-Clean slate.

663
00:42:55,734 --> 00:43:00,534
You know,um,we're all going to watch the tall ships come in.

664
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,969
Would you like to come.

665
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:04,967
Oh,no,you--you go on with your friends.

666
00:43:05,002 --> 00:43:08,752
-It's all right.
-It's friends and family.

667
00:43:09,184 --> 00:43:11,594
Ok.

668
00:43:15,748 --> 00:43:18,718
Have I ever told you how proud I am to be your mother.

669
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:20,793
You are my mother,right.

670
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:25,674
Yes.I am definitely your mother.

671
00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:10,829
- what.
-That's weird.

672
00:44:10,854 --> 00:44:12,834
There's six of us,but.

673
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:15,354
there's only five shadows.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
