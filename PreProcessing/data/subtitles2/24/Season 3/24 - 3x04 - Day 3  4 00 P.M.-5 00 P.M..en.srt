1
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,054
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,223
Wayne said you wanted to see me.

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,643
Keeler. He’s bringing your ex- husband into this debate,

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,479
the SEC’s investigation into his company.

5
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,565
Well, Ted was convicted and served his sentence, you know that.

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,026
All that Ted Packard wants is money!

7
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,529
If we pay him off he’ll recant before this debate.

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,239
It’s blackmail!

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,366
We could have the money within the hour.

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,090
Thought you were with my dad...

11
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:36,537
Your dad’s side-lining me, Kim.

12
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,037
Make him sit up!

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,666
Look, I know my dad can be hard but he will come around.

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,626
We shouldn’t have told him.

15
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,996
Well, the only other option I can think of
is for us to stop seeing each other.

16
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,048
Chase, what do you want?

17
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,175
I want to be able to do my job!

18
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,093
Linda!

19
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,553
I need your help!

20
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,265
These guys, they will kill me
if I don’t get them something.

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,851
- Where are you?
- I’m at the mall.

22
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,104
CTU knows the powder’s not real.
Now they’re going after Singer.

23
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,773
- What do you want me to do?
- Grab him and take him to containment.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Done!

25
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,734
We believe your son was infected with a virus

26
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,361
in Mexico earlier this morning before he came home.

27
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,115
We have three hours to find him before he becomes contagious.

28
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,157
We got it, Jack!

29
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,369
He’s at Los Feliz mall between Vermont and Sunset.

30
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,288
I can land a team there in ten minutes.

31
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:19,788
OK, fine.

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,207
- Kyle?
- Who are you?

33
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,502
My name is Tony Almeida.
I’m a federal agent but I’m here to help you.

34
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,380
- I don’t believe you.
- Come with me, I’ll prove it to you.

35
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,641
We have an officer down!

36
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,644
Kyle Singer’s not in custody!
I repeat: Kyle singer’s not in custody!

37
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:51,820
The following takes place
between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm.

38
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,074
Doctor!
Get out of the way, please!

39
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,001
Jack isn't picking up.
Aren't any other agents there? Isn't Tony there?

40
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,545
I can't get through to him either.
I'm trying Michael right now.

41
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:09,795
What's going on?

42
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,048
- There's been gunshots at the mall.
- When?

43
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,968
About two minutes ago.
I can't get in touch with my dad, or Tony.

44
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,261
- Michael said someone's down.
- Who?

45
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,140
It's either Tony or Jack, he's not sure.
He's about to find out.

46
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,527
Hold on.

47
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,322
It's Jack.
He wants to talk to you.

48
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,409
- Jack, what's going on? Where's Tony?
- He's been shot.

49
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,494
- How bad?
- He was hit in the neck.

50
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,539
He's still alive.
They're getting him into hospital now.

51
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,957
Oh God!

52
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,876
Michelle, I know how difficult this must be
for you right now.

53
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,003
But you need to make a decision.

54
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,088
What?

55
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,383
With Tony down you're in command.
If you wanna be by his side at the hospital

56
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,552
you're gonna have to hand CTU over to someone else.

57
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,887
No- one will fault you for whatever you choose to do.

58
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,807
But if you choose to stay,
we need you to work at full capacity.

59
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,060
- I understand.
- Michelle, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:21,118
- Is Tony all right?
- They don't know yet he was shot in the neck.

61
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,327
Michelle, we're starting to overload the network.

62
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,082
When the virus threat came in,
we had start stealing cycles from the main CPE.

63
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,669
- Chloe, now is not a good time.
- What are you talking about? Are you out of your mind?

64
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,546
Just deal with it, ok?

65
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,966
- Michelle?
- Offload the archive files and send them to Division.

66
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,301
That should free up the network.

67
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,344
Fine. That's all I needed to know!

68
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,890
I have to get to the hospital.

69
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,435
Michelle, I need you in the conference area.
The second call from Hector Salazar's people just came in.

70
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:50,814
- I am not in the position to deal with this right now.
- Who else is there?

71
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,816
You're the ranking agent on site.

72
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,782
Kim, I want you to find out
what hospital they took Tony to.

73
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,620
The second anyone knows anything
you have them patched through to me.

74
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:05,162
Ok.

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,008
Deliver Ramon Salazar to the Bad Night Stand,
adjacent to the 101 Freeway.

76
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,177
Provide him with a full spectrum band wave radio,

77
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:28,268
adjusted to frequency XQ2137.
Do not attempt aerial or ground surveillance.

78
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,812
You have two hours from the receipt of
this message to comply.

79
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,150
If you violate any one of these conditions,
we will release the virus.

80
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,319
Does the encoding scheme match the first message?

81
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,278
Yeah.

82
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,322
Is there any way you can find out where it came from?

83
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,200
I can scan the frequency,
maybe we'll get lucky.

84
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,288
Whoever sent this message
is controling Kyle Singer's movements.

85
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,775
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

86
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,589
- Kyle?
- Linda, where are you?

87
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,261
I'm trying to find a place to park but they're putting
out some kind of barricades, something's going on here.

88
00:05:02,262 --> 00:05:05,722
No, no, don't go to the garage.
Meet me outside the East entrance, ok?

89
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,598
On Vermont?

90
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,500
Yeah, yeah, go there now.
I'll be there in a sec.

91
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:10,810
Over here!

92
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
I found him!

93
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,009
Move over! Come on!

94
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:43,427
Get over!

95
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,054
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,388
Where are we going?

97
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,432
We just gotta get out of here.

98
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:07,409
It's all contact frequency so if he shows up anywhere
please let me know as soon as possible, ok?

99
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
You got it.

100
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:09,995
Excuse me.

101
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:20,130
- What's up?
- I just heard about Tony.

102
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,132
- Yeah.
- How's he doing?

103
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:23,926
He's on his way to the hospital.

104
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,435
- Why isn't Michelle with him?
- She knows it's gonna set us back

105
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,229
if she and Tony are both gone.

106
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,067
- Tell Michell I'm heading over to Downey.
- You going to see Salazar?

107
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:40,901
Yeah.

108
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:45,489
- My dad said questioning him was a waste of time.
- No, sitting round in here is a waste of time.

109
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,533
Don't you think you should clear it with Michelle first?

110
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:51,536
We lost the kid who's infected with the virus.

111
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,998
- If anyone knows where he's going it's Salazar.
- At least run it by her before you go.

112
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:58,544
- I'll call her from Downey.
- Chase!

113
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,424
Dessler.

114
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,344
- I'm looking for Tony Almeida's wife.
- Yes, this is Michelle.

115
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,389
Michelle, this is Dr Landser at Good Samaritan hospital.

116
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,473
How is he?

117
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm afraid the wound to your husbanïs neck
is gonna require some vascular repair.

118
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,479
We're just about to go into surgery.

119
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,106
Can...Can I talk to him?

120
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,025
No, we've medicated him.

121
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,778
In fact that's why I'm calling you.
We need your verbal consent to operate.

122
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,031
Yes, yes, yes...Of course.
Whatever you have to do...

123
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,118
- Great, thanks.
- Are you sure he's gonna be ok?

124
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:37,124
Well we can't say anything with a 100% certainty
until we get in there. But he's gonna be in good hands.

125
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,876
Please let me know the second you finish.

126
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,587
I'll find you in the waiting room
when we're out of surgery.

127
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:47,092
Dr Landser, I will do my best to be there but...
you may have to reach me through this number.

128
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,635
Ok, we'll find you.

129
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,432
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Sure.

130
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,508
I just spoke with Anne's ex- husband.
I'm meeting him in half an hour.

131
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:33,430
Unless you're changing your mind...

132
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,536
I've never given in to blackmail in my life.

133
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,314
Yes, but considering everything
that you're up against today...

134
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,357
we decided that...

135
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,237
I decided to pay!
It's my choice.

136
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,365
And David, you're making the right one.

137
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,620
Give this guy some money, he crawls back under his rock
and life will be a lot simpler for everyone.

138
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,207
Including Anne.

139
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,379
I hope so.

140
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:10,592
Yes.

141
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,594
I have Jack Bauer on the line, sir.

142
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,846
Put him through.

143
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,640
The president's on the line, Mr Bauer.

144
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,433
Mr President? It's Jack Bauer.

145
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,935
Hello, Jack.

146
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:24,723
I was told that Hector Salazar has given your office
final instructions on delivering his brother.

147
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,816
Yes, sir.

148
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,986
I've also been told that you might be able
to pre- empt that demand.

149
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:34,241
We've identified the person carrying the virus.
He is a young man named Kyle Singer.

150
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,912
- Then you know where he is?
- No, sir. Unfortunately we lost him.

151
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,530
Can you find him?

152
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,710
Not in the time- frame that Hector Salazar
has given us to release his brother.

153
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:51,049
So, either I hand over Ramon Salazar
or risk that his brother will release the virus.

154
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:54,178
Mr President, I understand that this is an impossible choice.

155
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:58,724
It's not a choice, Jack. Not really.

156
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:03,645
This nation's policy of non negotiation with terrorists
has been a proven deterrent.

157
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,316
Capitulating to Salazar would effectively destroy that policy.

158
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:10,986
Mr President, hundreds of thousands of innocent people
may die within the week.

159
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,864
More would die in the long run
if I released Salazar.

160
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,284
I would be declaring open season on the American people.

161
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,914
- This is your final answer, sir?
- I don't negotiate with terrorists, Jack.

162
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,253
- I won't negotiate with terrorists!
- I understand Mr President, thank you.

163
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,509
Conference in CDC and Health Services.

164
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,388
I want a full briefing on quarantine
and evacuation procedures.

165
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,183
Yes, Mr President.

166
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,488
Can you just tell me where we're going?

167
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,325
I don't know, ok? I've just gotta get out of town
for a second, and figure this whole thing out.

168
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,702
I thought you had to meet with those guys.
That's why I brought you the money!

169
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,871
Things have changed, all right?

170
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:06,333
What are you into, Kyle?
I mean, you ask me to steal this money from my father

171
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,378
so those guys won't hurt you
over losing their drugs...

172
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,380
I don't think it was drugs!

173
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,549
What do you mean?
What is it about?

174
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,635
I don't know. These cops,
they came to my apartment today,

175
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,303
and they were saying something about...

176
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:21,640
using me to...to bring
some weird disease into the country!

177
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,392
A disease?

178
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,979
Yeah. This cop, he was...he was saying
it was inside of me.

179
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,565
In your body?

180
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,400
I know...

181
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,152
It sounds ridiculous, right?

182
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,488
Right?

183
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,578
Man, this whole thing is so surreal, ain't it?

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,788
Pull over.

185
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,206
What?

186
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,167
I said pull over!

187
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,878
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

188
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,714
Take the car, take the money!
Whatever you're doing, I don't want any part of it!

189
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,841
Hey look, linda! Linda, come on! Come on!

190
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,386
Stay away from me, ok? If you've got
some kind of disease, I don't want it!

191
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,181
- You should have never done any of it!
- DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?

192
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,515
Kyle, please!

193
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:08,312
Fine, fine. Baby, you're right.
You're right, I'll stay away, ok?

194
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,023
The money's under the front seat.

195
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,525
Ok, now, come on Linda, please!

196
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,404
Kyle, I really don't want anything to happen to you, ok?
I really don't but I can't do this!

197
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,073
How stupid am I!

198
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,160
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,373
Go! Run! Run, Linda! Go!

200
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:44,972
Sir, we have a monitoring plan
for everyone inside the quarantine zone.

201
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:48,685
- Define the quarantine zone.
- Everyone within a two mile radius of ground zero,

202
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:52,856
ground zero being the shopping center
where Kyle Singer was last seen.

203
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:56,025
Mr President, this is Dr Nicole Duncan
at Health Services.

204
00:12:56,026 --> 00:13:01,490
Medical teams are in place and are ready to start
screening and releasing people from quarantine over a 72 hour period.

205
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:06,578
If we move quickly, we believe we can lower
the prior casualty estimate.

206
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:09,164
- Lower to what?
- Between 60000 and 90000.

207
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,666
This is Wayne Palmer.
Yeah...Yeah...

208
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,964
- All right, thank you, Miss Dessler, Dr Duncan...
- Mr President.

209
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:25,639
We're about to set into motion a chain of events that will create panick
throughout the country, that will take some time to control.

210
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,969
If anyone here sees an option that I'm overlooking,
now's the time to offer it up.

211
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,274
It's Jack Bauer. He needs to talk to you in private,
and he said it's urgent.

212
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,153
Could you all excuse me for a moment?

213
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,824
In the meantime I want everyone
to contact their key personnel,

214
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,118
make sure they're ready to go.

215
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,752
- What is it, Jack?
- Mr President, is this line secure?

216
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:57,422
Yes. What do you need to tell me, Jack?

217
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:02,676
For what it's worth, sir,
I agree with you supporting

218
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,137
this country's policy
to not negotiate with terrorists...

219
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,223
Jack, you didn't call me to express
your approval of my decision.

220
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,184
- I have another option for you to consider.
- Another option?

221
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:16,857
Yes, one that, I believe, that will protect the integrity
of this nation's policy and stop this outbreak from beginning.

222
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,611
- And how would I do this?
- By simply doing nothing, sir.

223
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,696
- Nothing?
- Yes, Mr President.

224
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,534
- Hector Salazar will view that as non compliance with his demand.
- Not if he gets his brother back.

225
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,534
How?

226
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,455
Ramon Salazar would be broken out of prison
and delivered to him.

227
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:35,334
The public and, more importantly, other terrorist groups
would view this as a prison break

228
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:38,378
as opposed to a capitulation
to their terrorist demands.

229
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,757
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack!
Who breaks Salazar out?

230
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,384
- I will, sir.
- By yourself?

231
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,262
I know the prison and I have
full access to the prisoner.

232
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:51,016
Because of the nature of my involvement
with the Salazars I can break him out and deliver him.

233
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:54,686
I have a history of insubordination with CTU,
they would believe that I've switched sides.

234
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:58,273
- The cover story would stay clean.
- This doesn't sound like a one- man job.

235
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:01,527
I think in order to protect you Mr President,
this has to be.

236
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,403
I don't know, Jack.

237
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:04,445
There has to be some other way.

238
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,241
No, no. Not in the time that we've got left.

239
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,910
The Salazars are going to release
the virus in the next two hours.

240
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,579
Regardless of how successful you are at
containing the initial outbreak,

241
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:17,059
the resulting civil unrest will far outreach
any quarantine zones you've established.

242
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,003
The damage to this country, sir, would be catastrophic.

243
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,924
Mr President?

244
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,510
I need your "ok" on this.

245
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,392
Even if you succeed,
I won't be able to protect your legal status.

246
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,977
You'll be a fugitive.

247
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,273
I understand, Mr President.
This will be my last assignment.

248
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,984
I don't know what to say.

249
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:46,280
If you don't say anything, Mr President,
I will accept that as a "go" for this mission.

250
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:57,374
Good luck, Mr President.

251
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,439
I want the information
from Dr Duncan's central records in my office.

252
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,899
My eyes only.

253
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:30,908
Wayne?

254
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,076
- Where are you going?
- Excuse me.

255
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:33,869
Wait.

256
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,412
I'm sorry, Anne but I...

257
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,788
I have an appointment.

258
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,290
And I am running late.

259
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,958
An appointment? The debate starts in 30 minutes!

260
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,000
Who are you meeting?

261
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:44,213
I'm sorry again but that's confidential.

262
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,714
It's government business.

263
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,592
Does this have anything to do with my ex- husband?

264
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:55,098
Like I said: it's government business.

265
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,286
Surgery, nurses' station.

266
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,249
Yes this is Tony Almeida's wife Michelle.
I was wondering if he'd gone into surgery yet?

267
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,333
Yes he has.

268
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,128
I just wanted Dr Landser to know
that he's allergic to penicillin.

269
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,006
Yes, he's aware of it.
The allergy card was in his wallet.

270
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,716
Is there a way to know how he's doing in there?

271
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:33,011
No but the doctor will contact you
as soon as he's out of surgery.

272
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,014
Ok, thank you.

273
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,185
Yeah?

274
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,104
Er, the site profiles are done.

275
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,231
You could have sent these to my system.

276
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,441
Yeah, I know. I wanted to come down here anyway.

277
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:47,901
Why?

278
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,820
Because of earlier.

279
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,446
What is it Chloe?

280
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,951
I just want you to know that
I didn't know Tony had been shot in the neck,

281
00:17:55,993 --> 00:18:00,622
when I was insensitive earlier. And had I known
I certainly would have been more careful about my choice of words, ok?

282
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,457
It's fine Chloe.

283
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,335
I do try to be aware of other people,
you know that, don't you?

284
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:06,503
I said it's fine.

285
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,088
Ok.

286
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,888
Gael?

287
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:16,430
What?

288
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:20,267
I think we should be careful about how we talk
to Michelle today. She's really sensitive.

289
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,560
About Tony being shot.

290
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,477
In the neck.

291
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,520
Of course.

292
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,523
So I'm telling everybody.
Make sure everyone in your department knows.

293
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,400
I've got to take this call.

294
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,568
Is this a personal cell?

295
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,945
I thought those were prohibited
because they can't be monitored?

296
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,615
I'm using it for an emergency, I'm moving around a lot.

297
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,659
They'll monitor it at the other end.
I've really got to take this call.

298
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:46,710
Hello?

299
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,420
When did you make the second call?

300
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,546
20 minutes ago.

301
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,715
Are they letting Ramon go or no?

302
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,091
They're still deciding.

303
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,511
What are they waiting for?
They have less than two hours!

304
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:58,347
I'll let you know as soon as I hear anything.

305
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:32,422
I'm sorry!

306
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,260
It's not good to touch what's not yours!

307
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,096
- Does your sister know you're here?
- No.

308
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,017
Did you know it was loaded?

309
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,694
It is a nice gun, huh?

310
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:02,369
Take it, Sergio, it's ok.

311
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,962
You like the way it feels? Huh?

312
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,760
You want to pull the trigger?

313
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,721
Hear the noise it makes?

314
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,684
That's the power of these things, Sergio.

315
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,729
It feels like a gun!

316
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,607
Can I?

317
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:38,071
Sure. Sure. Come on!

318
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,785
You see that vase down there?

319
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,622
Ok, now I want you to aim.

320
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,957
And squeeze the trigger.

321
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,418
Very slowly.

322
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,468
What are you doing?

323
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,595
Get out of here! Go! Now!

324
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,808
How many times do I have to tell you
to leave him alone? He's just a boy!

325
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,602
A boy who needs to become a man!

326
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,229
You're not his father!

327
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,110
What you gonna do, huh?

328
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,655
You gonna shoot me?

329
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:28,580
Come on! Pull the trigger! Right here, come on!

330
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,342
Get in there!

331
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,068
What are you gonna do to us?

332
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,035
What...What is this?

333
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,954
What are you gonna do to us?

334
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,365
Come.

335
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:53,332
We never really finished our conversation.
I was just wondering what you had decided.

336
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,875
Decided about what?

337
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:59,004
The debate. What to do about my ex- husband.

338
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:08,347
I ran into Wayne a few minutes ago. I know he's never liked me
but this was different. He was avoiding me and...

339
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,685
I had a feeling I wasn't able to shake.

340
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,145
What kind of feeling?

341
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:24,738
That you're paying Ted to keep quiet!
Is that what you're doing, David?

342
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:30,160
Sometimes you have to do
the wrong thing for the right reason.

343
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:33,997
How can you reward someone
for threatening you with a lie? That's wrong.

344
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,876
There are political realities I have to consider
if I want to stay in office.

345
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,545
I'll tell you something...
If it makes you feel better...

346
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:44,049
It doesn't make me feel better!
It just happens to be the truth.

347
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:59,064
Anne, I have been in this job for nearly four years. And I have learnt the
hard way that there are no absolutes. Sometimes you have to make compromises...

348
00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:04,486
Politically, yes! But when it comes to morality...
David, you have to draw the line.

349
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:08,198
I have drawn the line.
We're just standing on different sides!

350
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,871
You're running scared.

351
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:17,875
I am fighting to stay in office
and serve the people that put me here.

352
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:23,338
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and trust
that the people will be able to tell the difference.

353
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,841
It's not that easy!

354
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:34,808
You've never been about what's easy. You've been about what's right.
That's who you are. That's who the people elected to lead them.

355
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:43,567
And for what it's worth,
that's who I fell in love with.

356
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,823
I was...

357
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,411
I was trying to protect you.

358
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:55,787
Protect me?

359
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:00,417
This won't end with Keeler's allegation!
You're gonna be in the media's cross hairs.

360
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,211
I am used to public scrutiny.

361
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:07,257
Not like this! This will be different.
And much uglier than you can imagine.

362
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,511
I can defend myself.

363
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,537
David?

364
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,205
Have you made contact with Packard?

365
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,665
Just going to.

366
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,750
Are you with him now?

367
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,710
No, he's coming over now. Why?

368
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:46,839
Walk away.

369
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:48,423
What?

370
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,008
You heard me.

371
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,136
David, we've been through this.
Now, you decided to bury this thing, remember?

372
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,721
I've changed my mind.

373
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,932
Anne talked to you, didn't she?

374
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,060
Wayne! Walk away.

375
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,222
You wanted to see me?

376
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:42,060
I've spoken to Chloe, and Adam, and we'll cover for you
if you want to go to the hospital to be with Tony.

377
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,145
Cover for me?

378
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,355
Well, we know...
You've got a lot on your mind right now.

379
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,690
I'm fine Gael!

380
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:47,608
We just thought...

381
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:53,780
Look, Michelle. I've been taking 30% of Chloe's load
since the bio- threat came in. I can handle half of COM's load as well.

382
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:58,744
We just need the right user password on district servers
so we won't be slowed down by request authorization.

383
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:03,332
It's Joe Tommisello's area, he put a 24 hour delay on user logs
because of security problems we've been having.

384
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,375
So what if I call Joe and get him to wait for us?

385
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,169
I tried that, he's unreachable.

386
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:08,879
Is there any other way to do this?

387
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:14,551
More bodies. We need at least four more
system radi- analysts to take on work we've been doing.

388
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,803
I can make some calls, get the next shift in early.

389
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,768
I've already tried that. By the time they got here it would be
too late. Look, I appreciate this but it's not gonna happen.

390
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,438
So let's get back to work.

391
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:30,901
Michelle!

392
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:39,034
Listen, I agree. We can't run this place by committy.

393
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,703
Let me step in for you. Adam and Chloe can stay at their posts.

394
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:42,621
What about yours?

395
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:46,291
When I was at Langley, I filled out for my period chief
a couple of times and we got through it.

396
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:51,255
Was there a bio- threat?
President in town all in one day?

397
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,006
Thank you anyway, Gael.

398
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:02,765
CTU, Bauer?

399
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,684
Kim, it's your dad, what are you doing right now?

400
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm still trying to locate a point of origin on
that phone call from Salazar's people.

401
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:11,567
Ok, look, I'm gonna need you to do
something for me first, it's not gonna take long.

402
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:15,236
- What?
- I need you to generate a prisoner transfer document.

403
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:19,158
Look in your file form, under the heading
"Federal Transit Authorization".

404
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,075
What's this about?

405
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,370
I need to move Ramon Salazar.

406
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,454
Why are you gonna move him?

407
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,874
Kim, this has been given priority clearance.

408
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:30,961
No- one in CTU's supposed to know. That's why
you're the only person I can trust to do this for me.

409
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:32,420
So, please, help.

410
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:36,049
Ok. It's asking for a clearance code.

411
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,509
It's: *99.

412
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:40,929
Now it wants a pass- word.

413
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,641
Lincoln 65 FGA.

414
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,858
Ok. It's cycling. It's gonna take a minute.

415
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,859
Ok, good.

416
00:28:55,903 --> 00:29:02,034
Look, Kim, I know you tried to come up to my office earlier today
to talk to me about something that was really important to you.

417
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:05,412
And I know I wasn't very supportive and I just wanted to...

418
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:06,746
You don't have to do this, dad.

419
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:09,458
Sweetheart, I do. I need to tell you I'm sorry.

420
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,753
I know that I'm awfully protective of you.

421
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:19,426
I just watched so many things happen to you over the last few years...
I don't want you to get hurt anymore.

422
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:23,388
The fact is, I trust you, I trust your jugement.

423
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:28,894
I need you to know that anything that you ever
chose to do I would support you in.

424
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:30,394
Ok?

425
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,356
Thanks that means a lot to me.

426
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:39,530
Good. I love you so much, Kim.

427
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:41,865
I love you too, dad.

428
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:45,661
Are you ok?

429
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,289
Yeah, yeah I'm all right.
Is the document up yet?

430
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:50,456
Yeah.

431
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:54,294
Ok, I need you to send it to warden Mitchell,
over at Downey, now.

432
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:55,462
Done.

433
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,340
Ok, good. Let me speak to Chase.

434
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:01,008
He's not here.

435
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,344
What are you talking about?
Where is he?

436
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:06,722
Kim? Kim, where is Chase?

437
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,079
He went to interrogate Salazar.

438
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,435
Chase is at the prison, now?

439
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:14,815
He left about 15 minutes ago.
He's gonna be there soon.

440
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:16,900
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

441
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,695
Son of a bitch!

442
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,201
Yeah.

443
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,037
Chase, what are you doing?

444
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:30,873
I'm gonna talk to Salazar!

445
00:30:30,874 --> 00:30:32,582
Get back to CTU now!

446
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:35,252
And do what? Some filing
and some dusting round the office?

447
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,921
No, I want you to work with Michelle
and find Kyle Singer!

448
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:40,090
She's got a dozen IT people on that right now!

449
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:41,215
Listen to me!

450
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:42,425
No! Listen to me, Jack.

451
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:47,472
I know you're angry about me and Kim, I get that!
But I'm not gonna let you stop me from doing my job!

452
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:49,849
YOUR JOB IS TO FOLLOW MY ORDERS!

453
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,416
You're in no condition to give me orders!

454
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:56,981
Chase, I'm warning you. Don't go against me!

455
00:30:56,982 --> 00:31:01,099
Jack, look. You know I respect you but
you also know I've been covering for you.

456
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,500
Since you've been back, I've been keeping the fact
that you're a junkie from Kim and everybody else at CTU!

457
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,618
I'm not doing it anymore. I'm done.

458
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:08,659
Chase?

459
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,622
Chase? Damn it!

460
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,711
Get this guy processed and get him out of here.

461
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:24,718
- Agent Edmunds.
- Warden. I need to see Salazar.

462
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,761
I've got a lot going on right now.

463
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:30,265
Have division follow up for written authorization
but you need to let me see Salazar now.

464
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,769
Salazar's been buying two murders today.
Nobody gets close to him without full paperwork.

465
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,771
You don't understand what's happening today?

466
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:37,773
Our Salazar has information that I need.

467
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:38,273
What kind of information?

468
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:39,565
It's classified!

469
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,443
This is my facility. I need to know.

470
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:47,949
We're dealing with major terrorist threat.
Salazar's brother is behind it.

471
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,204
Go ahead and confirm with division if you want to.
But hundreds of thousands of lives are at stake, here.

472
00:31:53,205 --> 00:32:01,505
Now, Jack and I have been coming here twice a week for the last three months. Salazar's
prevented us from doing our job with his stalling and his lawyers and his due process.

473
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,130
We don't have time for that...

474
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,927
I need to go one on one with him, right now.

475
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:13,809
He's in isolation cell in B block. Come on, I'll take you.

476
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,278
- Surveillance cameras?
- Yeah, 3.

477
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,508
Get them turned off.

478
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:26,738
It's against regulations.

479
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,199
Won't be any marks, I promise.

480
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:31,869
You get 30 minutes.

481
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:41,211
This is warden Mitchell. I need you to go black on isolation B.

482
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:42,609
For how long, sir?

483
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,006
Until further notice.

484
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:04,442
You're a tough guy, huh!

485
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:09,865
You are not worried of what might happen
if you lay a finger on me?

486
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,412
Ok...If you're not worried, neither am I.

487
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,211
Let me know when you start to worry.

488
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,226
Where's Kyle Singer?

489
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:40,186
I told you, I don't know!

490
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:42,189
You're gonna tell me who does!

491
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,067
Chase!

492
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:47,694
Put him in his cell.

493
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:55,723
What are you doing here, Jack?

494
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:57,203
We're running out of options.

495
00:33:57,204 --> 00:34:00,248
We can't find Singer. Salazar's our only hope.
You were right.

496
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:03,293
He's tougher to break than I thought.
Maybe two of us can...

497
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:03,668
Yeah.

498
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:05,629
Look, Jack, about what I said before...

499
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:13,384
- Forget about it.
- So we're ok? You and me?

500
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,635
Yeah, we're ok.

501
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,811
Tell me about the security cameras.

502
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:21,645
They're disabled.

503
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:23,062
Good.

504
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,190
Get him out of his cell.

505
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:48,005
Are you gonna kill me, now, Jack?

506
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:56,930
I'd love to, but I can't. If you play this cool, Ramon,
you're walking out of here with me now.

507
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,474
You'll be with your brother in the next couple of hours.

508
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:00,893
Now, grab his feet.

509
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:16,325
Turn and face the wall.

510
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,389
How are you gonna feel, Anne...

511
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,392
if David loses this election because of you?

512
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:46,854
I don't think that's very likely.

513
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:50,901
Mmm. Then you really don't know what you're talking about, do you?

514
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:53,445
Because this allegation may cost him this debate.

515
00:35:53,446 --> 00:35:55,989
And David needs this debate to win this election.

516
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,532
It was blackmail.

517
00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:01,119
And David made the decision to pay.
It wasn't up to you to change his mind!

518
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:06,416
If he believed the decision was right,
he wouldn't have changed his mind.

519
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:09,107
The problem is, you can't stand the fact

520
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:11,474
that your brother wants me in his life.

521
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:13,841
Because you're a distraction to him.

522
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:16,406
And you're a liability.

523
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,970
Compared to whom? Sherry?

524
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:22,932
I'm not gonna sit here and try and defend Sherry.
She went off the rails.

525
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:25,727
But at least she understood the game,
and she understood David. She was with him

526
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,562
for over 20 years.

527
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,690
I have been with him long enough
to know the kind of man he is.

528
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:32,233
You don't know anything about him

529
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:35,028
or what it takes to survive in the world he lives in.

530
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,825
We disagree, Wayne. We always have.

531
00:36:41,577 --> 00:36:46,665
Anne, I will not stand by and watch you
jeopardize everything that he's worked for.

532
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,625
I won't do it.

533
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,381
I don't scare easily.

534
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:26,872
What's happening, Jack? After all you went through
to put me in here, I can't believe you're letting me out!

535
00:37:26,873 --> 00:37:27,830
Shut up.

536
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,750
I don't believe you sold out. It's not your nature.

537
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:37,174
But then, why knock out the kid? Did your government cave,
but can't admit it? Is that what happened?

538
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:43,346
You don't look so good, Jack. That's a bitch!

539
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:46,892
You wanna get out of here? You'll keep
your mouth shut and do what I say.

540
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:47,935
You understand me?

541
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,271
We've been cleared to pass.

542
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,442
The warden wants to see you first.
He'll be here in a minute.

543
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:56,276
Ok.

544
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,671
Don't you move.

545
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:19,883
Sorry to keep you waiting, Jack.

546
00:38:19,884 --> 00:38:21,050
What's the problem?

547
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:25,806
The access codes of this transfer order. They don't correspond
to the ones assigned by the bureau of prisons.

548
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:29,518
Division superseded those access codes.
CTU has a mandate to prefix.

549
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,894
This is yesterday's prefix.

550
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:33,062
Son of a bitch.

551
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,314
Someone in my office must have screwed up.

552
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,693
Look, we'll get you the proper prefix retroactively.

553
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:42,281
Look, I know about the terrorist threat.
Agent Edmunds told me.

554
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:46,450
That's exactly why we need to move the prisoner now.

555
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,078
It's classified priority one, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

556
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:52,583
But I can't afford to lose any time over some small technical detail.

557
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:54,751
Come on, Kevin, help me out.

558
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,794
Where's agent Edmunds?

559
00:38:56,795 --> 00:39:00,885
He's conducting a search of the prisoner's cell.
Trying to find some additional information.

560
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:03,900
He'll be right behind me,
he can help you out with the paperwork.

561
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,139
Right, pick up your badge and go to receiving.

562
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,183
Thanks, we'll hurry out.

563
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:16,857
Move.

564
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,294
Turn on isolation 3, please.

565
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:45,635
What the hell?

566
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:47,930
Someone turned the camera, the angle's wrong.

567
00:39:47,931 --> 00:39:49,640
Get Binge to meet me in isolation.

568
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:53,810
Door.

569
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:06,198
Face the wall.

570
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,800
Agent Bauer. Can I get my gun and a badge?

571
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,476
Open it!

572
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:41,692
Door!

573
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,405
Kind of hot today!

574
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,800
Yeah, I'm burning!

575
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,203
Whatever Bauer told you, he's lying!
Come on!

576
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,207
Here you are, check your gun.

577
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:57,833
Ok.

578
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,592
Daniel I'm back on post.

579
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:17,853
Move!

580
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:29,031
Security 3, get a block of the whole ward.

581
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,263
Open the cell blocks, now!

582
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:33,659
I can't do it from here.

583
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,245
Is it worth losing your life over?

584
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:37,331
Do it now!

585
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Come on! Get the hell out!



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
