1
00:00:03,842 --> 00:00:06,342
How many times have I told you,
your store is growing too quickly.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,200
You've never told me that.

3
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:08,176
Your books are a mess.

4
00:00:08,293 --> 00:00:09,463
When have you ever seen my books?

5
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:10,732
I haven't seen your books,but I know you.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,570
Let's focus,please.

7
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,616
Look,my friend kylie's a financial whiz.

8
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,980
She could really help you.

9
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,299
Her father was the dean of the
business school here before he died.

10
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:20,992
Before that,he was my economics department advisor.

11
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:24,061
- You were an economics major?
- Yes,I was an economics major.

12
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:26,092
I was this close to getting my undergrad,ok?

13
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:27,116
In economics?

14
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:30,143
Yes,I can add,melinda.I'm a big boy,ok?

15
00:00:30,243 --> 00:00:32,663
Look,kylie lost her merit scholarship.

16
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,191
That's her loss,but it's your gain.

17
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,381
Does she have the job or not?

18
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,289
Well,she might have,but she's a half an hour late,

19
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:38,492
and it's my night to cook.

20
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,671
Well,I think I told her 7:30.

21
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:41,615
You cook?What do you cook?

22
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:42,222
Tell me about it.

23
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:44,846
Well,I make a great lasagna,you told her 7:00,

24
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,604
and I can't hire someone who's flaky.

25
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:47,858
She's not flaky.

26
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,275
She's not.She's just.

27
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:51,372
she's troubled.

28
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,510
Why wouldn't you tell me that she's haunted?

29
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:15,152
'Cause I don't know if she's really haunted.

30
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:16,503
It could be anything.

31
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:19,563
She's skittish,she's nervous,
she has a hard time focusing.

32
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:21,834
It could be any one of your college pitfalls.

33
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,129
It could be sex,drugs,guitar hero.

34
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,735
So you want me to give her a job just in case she has a ghost?

35
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,783
And if she doesn't,what do you want me to do then?

36
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:30,207
Clean her dorm room,do her laundry?

37
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:32,367
Melinda,this girl's father was my mentor.

38
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,091
Please.I'm begging you.

39
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,397
Hi!I'm sorry I'm late.

40
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,029
You're not late.

41
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,103
Late was 10 minutes ago.

42
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,001
You're in a different time zone,kylie!

43
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:43,444
I know,I know,I'm not sure what happened.

44
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:45,398
I said informal job interview.

45
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,951
I didn't mean that informal.

46
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,144
Oh,well,moving right along.

47
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:51,479
Kylie,melinda,melinda,kylie.

48
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:52,485
Hi.

49
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:56,546
It's just,it was really dark,
and I really thought that someone was.

50
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:58,666
whatever.

51
00:02:59,104 --> 00:02:59,784
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,540
You went out on a limb for me,
and I completely blew it.

53
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:05,281
I guess the,uh,the job is history.

54
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:06,407
No.No,not at all.

55
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:07,928
When do you want to start?

56
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,880
I knew you two kids would hit it off.

57
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:18,876
Can you see us?

61
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:52,943
Oh,please don't tell me those are
all this month's receipts.

62
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,665
No,actually,there's a bunch
from april and march,january.

63
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,805
Hey,is that dry cleaning receipt I've been looking for.

64
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:05,124
Do you think they're still going to
have my coat after 6 months?

65
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:06,749
Well,it's worth giving it a try.

66
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:10,331
Hey,this student that you hired,what's her deal?

67
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,452
Uh,her name's kylie,her grades slipped,

68
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,019
and she's trying to get her scholarship reinstated.

69
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,976
I'm talking about her other deal.

70
00:04:18,378 --> 00:04:19,748
What's the reason we hired her?

71
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,699
Well,I thought we weren't gonna talk about it.

72
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,139
You were just gonna do your thing,
I was gonna do my thing,yada yada.

73
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,884
Yeah,except your thing kinda becomes my thing

74
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:28,311
when you bring it into the store.

75
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,089
Well,is it really going to bother you that much
even if you don't believe it's real?

76
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:34,756
No,I was just,you know,trying to know
how I should act around her.

77
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,549
I don't want to step on any ghost toes.

78
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:38,987
Well,I really appreciate that.

79
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:41,305
Um,she has a ghost.

80
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,409
That's pretty much all I know so far.

81
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:46,781
Ok.Hey,I just want to remind you
that I've got that appointment

82
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:49,502
with ned on thursday,so I won't be here all day.

83
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:50,108
I've got it.

84
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,332
It's on the calendar.

85
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:54,984
- Hi.Am I too early?
- No,not at all.

86
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:56,462
I was just getting things organized for you.

87
00:04:56,903 --> 00:04:57,513
Ok.

88
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,047
- Um,you know,about that
- you can't start today?

89
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:01,908
You don't want the job?

90
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:03,713
No!No!I just.

91
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,570
I just want to make sure professor
payne didn't pressure you into this.

92
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:09,008
He has a way of pushing people.

93
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,247
Yeah,you noticed that,too?

94
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:11,024
Yeah.

95
00:05:11,148 --> 00:05:14,148
So unless you,um,actually need my help,I...

96
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:17,258
trust me,when you see the books.we need it.

97
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:19,506
Um,I'm just gonna grab my laptop,
and then you can get to work.

98
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:20,091
Ok.

99
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:25,265
So,how do you and professor payne actually know each other?

100
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,585
Oh,we have some of the same.interests.

101
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,640
Oh,my god!

102
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,349
Oh!Oh,my god!

103
00:05:31,492 --> 00:05:32,252
They're all over me!

104
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,718
What is this?!What is this?!What is this?!

105
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:36,839
Get them off of me!

106
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,505
Oh,my god!

107
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:46,493
Are you ok?

108
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:47,482
Oh,my god,melinda!

109
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:48,778
- Go get jim.
- Ok.

110
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,902
You're ok.

111
00:05:58,426 --> 00:06:00,286
Finish it!

112
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,389
Finish it!

113
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:13,302
Delia: He was already on his way over.

114
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,272
Yeah,you could hear that crash
all the way across the square.

115
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:17,156
Hey there,hi.My name's jim.

116
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:20,837
All right,that's going to be sore for a little while.

117
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:22,772
You were very lucky that that's safety glass.

118
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,074
That could have been a lot worse.

119
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:29,016
Assuming how the definition of luck changes
depending on how bad yours is.

120
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:32,092
Yeah,right,being attacked by a swarm of flies,not lucky.

121
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:34,386
These things happen to you a lot?

122
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,850
Daily,yeah.

123
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,287
What kind of things,for example?

124
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:44,103
Thanks,delia.

125
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:46,979
Melinda will be back any minute
with some more ice for your arm.

126
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:48,978
Um,you know what,actually,I'm fine.

127
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,860
I'll just ice it back at the dorm.

128
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:56,473
I think you should come to the station with me
and let me take a better look at that.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,110
You know what,it's ok.

130
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,378
But thank you for everything.

131
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,277
At least let me drive you home.

132
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:04,005
No,I have a car.

133
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:05,369
It's ok.

134
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:06,645
Thank you.

135
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:15,717
So did you get a chance to debrief her?

136
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:17,771
No,she was gone before I got back.

137
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:20,685
Jim said she couldn't have gotten out of here fast enough.

138
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:22,883
Now,you're thinking this has something do with her father,right?

139
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:25,396
That's the first thing I thought of,
and the second,frankly.

140
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,152
I mean,her father died 4 years ago.

141
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,764
That's right around the time kylie started
going to rockland university.

142
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,540
So why would he suddenly appear now?

143
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,311
Maybe he's disappointed in her studies.

144
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:35,192
I mean,she comes from a long line of academics.

145
00:07:35,304 --> 00:07:37,184
Her grandfather founded the economics department.

146
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:42,158
Her father was a consultant for the world bank
before he retired to teach at rockland U.

147
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:44,239
Her brother just graduated summa cum laude from here.

148
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:46,672
The ghost said "finish it.

149
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:48,389
" I mean,I guess that could mean college.

150
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:50,758
Yeah,spoken just like ben,except for the plastic head part.

151
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:54,234
It makes me wonder,if it is her father,
why he wouldn't just talk to me directly.

152
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,806
And what's with all the weird hauntings?

153
00:07:55,896 --> 00:08:00,136
I mean,the heavy breathing,the doll,the flies,
it's all gotta be a symbol of some kind.

154
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:02,125
Does it have anything to do with what he used to teach?

155
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:04,446
No,he was an economist,not an entomologist.

156
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,901
They're the ones that study bugs.

157
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:07,534
I'm aware of that.

158
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,271
Oh,I'm sorry.

159
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,165
I'm always teaching,I can't help it.You know?

160
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:13,048
The fact of the matter is,economists,they never speak in metaphor.

161
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:14,956
That's probably why I never cut it as one.

162
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:17,328
You know,nobody ever knew what the heck I was talking about.

163
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,793
And that's different now in what way?

164
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:19,894
That's very funny.

165
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:23,951
Look,maybe we should just find out from kylie
if she knows anyone who died more recently.

166
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,616
Great.That would be thanatology,the study of the dead.

167
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:32,812
Look,I know that this is hard to talk about,
but when I met you,

168
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:35,923
I heard a really strange.breathing noise.

169
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:37,612
I really want to help you.

170
00:08:37,682 --> 00:08:39,102
You heard it,too,didn't you?

171
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,754
What if I did,what does that mean?

172
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,815
I don't know,have you heard it before?

173
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,504
On occasion.

174
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:46,845
Since when?

175
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,370
Uh,a few months ago,when my scholarship got revoked.

176
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:53,871
I'm assuming it has something to do with stress.

177
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,058
Why?

178
00:08:57,952 --> 00:09:02,492
Because I can see ghosts,
and I think there's one haunting you.

179
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:06,134
Ok.

180
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:08,633
wow.

181
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:14,108
I don't want to sound rude,but,um,
you're saying you've seen a ghost around me?

182
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:18,586
I couldn't see his face,
but he was wearing a hat and a dark overcoat.

183
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,505
Does that sound familiar?

184
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:26,459
You saw a ghost in a hat and dark overcoat?

185
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,739
- Do you know what you sound like?- Yes.

186
00:09:30,762 --> 00:09:33,692
Yes,I do,but if you could just go with me on it.

187
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,220
Flies.

188
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,320
the doll,um,weird breathing noise.

189
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:42,193
Does that mean anything to you?

190
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:45,665
I mean.the doll talked to you.

191
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:46,898
I know you saw it.

192
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,910
It was a talking doll.

193
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,089
No,it was a ghost.

194
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:53,067
talking to you,and it said,"finish it.

195
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,960
" What does that mean?

196
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:55,977
Finish what?

197
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:58,338
I think this conversation.

198
00:09:58,488 --> 00:09:59,788
I have to go.

199
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,196
Kylie,I really want to help you.

200
00:10:03,702 --> 00:10:05,782
Has anyone around you died recently?

201
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,941
No,not really,actually.

202
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:13,446
Could this have anything to do with your dad?

203
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,303
Could scaring you be his way of getting you to finish?

204
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,629
Stop it.Don't talk about my dad.

205
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,391
It's bad enough that I've lost him.

206
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,382
Don't make him into some freak ghost.

207
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:27,308
And by the way,about that job,I quit.

208
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,019
She's scared.

209
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:43,054
And she's hiding something,
but I'm never going to know what it is,

210
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:44,783
because I'm never going to see her again.

211
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:46,569
You're too hard on yourself.

212
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:48,336
I should have known just to back off,you know?

213
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:50,348
Even the word "ghost" was wigging her out.

214
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,171
This is not your fault,all right?

215
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:55,031
She was probably terrified by one of payne's lectures,right?

216
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,564
Nice try.Thanks.

217
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,562
Mel,what's wrong?

218
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:40,765
Wait a minute.

219
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,793
Wait a minute,it's just like that
scene from that japanese horror film!

220
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:47,088
What was?

221
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:48,532
The vision I just had!

222
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:50,978
Flies!

223
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:53,077
Amityville horror,or the fly!

224
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:54,261
The...the doll.

225
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:57,122
Puppet master,or chucky!

226
00:11:57,488 --> 00:11:58,668
The overcoat.

227
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,208
Oh,my god,the overcoat.

228
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,566
Just pick one.

229
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:05,577
I can't believe i r-neve-I can't believe I didn't see it!

230
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,360
See what?

231
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:07,926
The hauntings.

232
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,860
They're all scenes from hvir moorroes.

233
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:13,616
Let's narrow this down.

234
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:17,991
We need to find someone who's close to you
that died recently that was a horror film buff.

235
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,150
Anything?

236
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:21,628
Well,what do you expect?

237
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:23,803
I expect you to tell me the truth if you want help.

238
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:27,697
Look,if melinda says you have a ghost,hey,you have a ghost.

239
00:12:28,324 --> 00:12:30,834
Ok,so what if I have one?

240
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,221
What...what's the deal?

241
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,390
What does that mean?

242
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:36,868
Well,ghosts,if they're here,
it's usually because they have unfinished business.

243
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,673
- Like what?
- Whatever.

244
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,051
It could be anything with a loved one.

245
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,980
It could be unresolved issues of guilt,anger,forgiveness.

246
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,680
Can.this ghost hurt me?

247
00:12:46,843 --> 00:12:49,903
Actually,if they get angry,they can get pretty nasty.

248
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,922
What aren't you telling me,kylie?

249
00:12:53,053 --> 00:12:54,313
There's something you're not telling me.

250
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,481
Did somebody close to you die?

251
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:56,578
I need to know.

252
00:12:56,686 --> 00:13:00,966
No,I've known people to die,yeah,
but no one close or anything.

253
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:01,593
Hey,kylie.

254
00:13:02,342 --> 00:13:03,362
Cram session.

255
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,439
Let's get a move on.

256
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:05,196
I have to go.

257
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,540
I don't want to be the first sloan to not graduate.

258
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,228
Are you at the film school yet?

259
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,496
Did you get any answers?

260
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,494
Rick: Yes,nothing happened,no one died.

261
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:19,477
I'm telling you,no faculty members,
no janitors,no students,nothing.

262
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:22,232
If something like that happened,
it would have been all over the campus.

263
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,500
It's not,uh,it's not like we drop
like flies around here,no pun intended.

264
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:29,206
Well,aren't there any students that are into the genre?

265
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,364
I mean,there is a class or a club or anything?

266
00:13:31,468 --> 00:13:31,998
I'm looking.

267
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:33,472
I'm at the bulletin board now.

268
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:36,681
There's a flyer up here for musical theater club.

269
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,112
That's spooky.

270
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,051
Keep looking.

271
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:41,836
What else do I have?I have a missing kitty.

272
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:44,038
All right,this is different.

273
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:48,812
"Scared sane... "we're holding auditions
for a new kind of horror film.

274
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,079
"Ever wonder why some movies terrify you?

275
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:55,196
"Are you brave enough to enter your own personal horror
"to see what lies within?

276
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,140
Enlightenment awaits.

277
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,526
" Sounds like a real horror buff.

278
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:01,187
Is there a name,phone number,anything?

279
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,788
Let's see,auditions are at
some downtown production facility.

280
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:08,261
There's a name,toby bates,
but as far as a number goes,you're out of luck.

281
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:09,693
It's a couple months old.

282
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,624
Well,fax it over and I'll check it out.

283
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:13,074
- Ok.
- Thanks.

284
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:15,954
Hangs up phone Toby.

285
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,703
Ringing Toby?

286
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,402
I'm looking for toby bates.

287
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,814
Hello?

288
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,379
Is anyone there?

289
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:19,352
Why do I always
get the scary stuff?

290
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,105
Who are you?

291
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:51,067
Oh, you want to play?

292
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:52,822
Is that it?

293
00:15:59,009 --> 00:15:59,829
Ok.

294
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:01,848
So which one is this?

295
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:04,391
The maze from the shining,
children of the corn,

296
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,493
or the spaceship from alien?

297
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:07,889
What?

298
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,000
Who are you?

299
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,679
So what is this?

300
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,278
The maze from the shining,
children of the corn

301
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,450
or the spaceship
from alien? What?

302
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,785
Oh, you want to play?

303
00:16:46,794 --> 00:16:57,194
Oh, you want to play?

304
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:07,833
Ok, here it is,
toby bates' obit.

305
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:10,189
"Guerilla filmmaker
falls to his death."

306
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,443
This happened 3 months ago.

307
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:13,501
Oh, that's right, when kylie
said the hauntings started.

308
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:14,846
She said no one
close to her died.

309
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:17,424
We should ask her if
she knew this kid toby.

310
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,880
It says he wasn't a student,
so that's not their connection.

311
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:21,685
He was just a kid
shooting a film.

312
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,808
Yeah, lots and lots
of film apparently.

313
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,900
There's massive amounts
of files on this computer.

314
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:28,414
Thank goodness you had the
mental fortitude to steal it.

315
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,001
Hey, I did not steal it.

316
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:32,531
This ghost wanted my help,
led me to that editing bay,

317
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,116
and in fact, probably
wanted me to take it.

318
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:34,786
What I still want to know is

319
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:37,191
what are we going to
do about skippy here.

320
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,526
I mean, what is he
good for except for

321
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:40,004
a free ride in
the carpool lane?

322
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,534
And what's he doing
in my good chair?

323
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:44,083
More importantly, why is
he wearing toby's clothes?

324
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,249
I mean, it's gotta be a prop
from one of his movies, right?

325
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:47,044
I hope so.

326
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,389
Oh, listen to his profile.

327
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,507
"I want to push classic horror
past the scare to enlightenment,

328
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:55,606
use the genre to dive into the
darkness of souls and set them free."

329
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,640
To think I was just watching
scary movies for fun.

330
00:17:58,683 --> 00:17:59,763
Do you think
kylie was in one of

331
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,190
toby's movies and
that's how they met?

332
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,459
There's an audition
file in there.

333
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:04,358
I think we could look
to see if she's in it.

334
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,209
What horror movie
really scares you?

335
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,860
That movie where the arm
comes up out of the grave

336
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,190
and it like--ugh--
like, super creepy, yeah.

337
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,000
What--wait a minute.
I know this kid.

338
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,703
He's one of kylie's friends.

339
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:25,248
well, that's great. So
there's a connection at least.

340
00:18:25,263 --> 00:18:27,093
I mean, you can talk to
this bruce guy tomorrow

341
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,494
and find out what
he'll tell us.

342
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,963
I mean, maybe he's
being haunted, too.

343
00:18:30,002 --> 00:18:31,372
No, I'm not--I'm
not talking to him.

344
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:32,532
You do the talky talk.

345
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,309
That's your job.
It always has been.

346
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,441
Except that I have to be
at my other job tomorrow.

347
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,244
Delia's got the day off.
Look, you're gonna be great.

348
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:46,487
What are we gonna
do about her?

349
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,530
Yeah, I remember this.

350
00:18:52,144 --> 00:18:53,604
Actually worked on this film.

351
00:18:54,097 --> 00:18:56,857
Guy called it a "shockumentary,"
making you face your fears.

352
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,255
I call it sick.

353
00:18:58,283 --> 00:18:59,473
Well, after you worked in it,

354
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:01,911
did you notice anything
strange or supernatural

355
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,937
that happened to you
in the last 3 months?

356
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:07,214
-I aced my bio quiz.
-Wow, that is spooky, my man.

357
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:09,466
I don't know how
you sleep at night.

358
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:11,668
Anything, for real?
Did you notice anything?

359
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:13,238
No, man, it was just a movie.

360
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:14,442
All right.

361
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:16,546
Well, what is a
shockumentary? What is that?

362
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,712
He would ask you what
classic horror movies

363
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:21,263
scared you the most,
and then, you know,

364
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:22,559
he'd put you in
the scariest scenes,

365
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:24,738
making you experience the
horror over and over again.

366
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,032
Guy was a psycho.

367
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:27,622
Now, I didn't know a
movie that's scared me,

368
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,310
so he put me in
somebody else's fear.

369
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:30,882
I play the priest
in the exorcist.

370
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:32,811
This guy just liked
scaring people,

371
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:34,034
or was there a
point to all of it?

372
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,291
I don't know. I didn't
stick around to find out.

373
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,309
Hey, brother, I
don't blame you.

374
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,112
I wasn't scared, I was pissed.

375
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,394
I ran into a friend that night
who had just wrapped her segment,

376
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,308
looked like she got
in a car accident.

377
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,861
She said her scariest movies
were blair witch and evil dead,

378
00:19:45,897 --> 00:19:48,157
so toby left her alone in
the woods for a whole night.

379
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:49,413
Nearly lost her mind.

380
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,203
Was kylie in a movie?

381
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:52,743
No, she had no
interest in acting.

382
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,941
I didn't think so.

383
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:56,379
But she sure grilled toby
about what he was doing.

384
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:57,985
I didn't know she was
such a major horror buff.

385
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,574
Wait a minute, kylie
and toby, they met?

386
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,804
Yeah. I dragged
her along with me.

387
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:03,538
Toby even wanted her
to audition for it.

388
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,879
She said no, and
it got kinda nasty.

389
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:07,625
-What else happened?
-Oh, we left.

390
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:10,352
But you should have seen
the look on toby's face.

391
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,052
He was pissed.

392
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:23,018
So kylie was at the
audition, she did meet toby.

393
00:20:23,164 --> 00:20:25,254
Yeah, turns out she's a
giant horror film buff.

394
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:26,699
She even insulted his work.

395
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:28,499
So why has she been
covering it with us?

396
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,289
Have I not been trying to figure
that out the entire ride over here?

397
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:32,677
I don't know, I
wasn't with you.

398
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:34,606
You're right, that was,
uh, skippy. I forget.

399
00:20:34,618 --> 00:20:35,828
You guys look so much alike.

400
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:37,417
Well, we were
trying to figure out,

401
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:38,996
and we came up with
nothing, we were stymied.

402
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:40,376
So we called
kylie's cell phone

403
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,555
and it went right
to voicemail.

404
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:43,383
It's ok, she'll call back
when she gets scared enough

405
00:20:43,414 --> 00:20:45,364
and it'll probably
be soon. Look at this.

406
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:48,846
I spent the last 3 hours looking
at more of toby's footage.

407
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:50,809
Ooh, I feel your pain.

408
00:20:50,842 --> 00:20:52,842
You know, the big crime is
efthat bore this kid died,

409
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,595
he didn't set some
time aside to edit.

410
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,976
Well, actually, he did.

411
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:58,351
I found something that
looked like a movie

412
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,670
he was starting to
assemble. Brace yourself.

413
00:21:11,573 --> 00:21:12,353
Oh, my gosh!

414
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:14,559
That person was
actually buried alive!

415
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:15,986
How is that therapy?

416
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,783
How could toby get away
with something like that?

417
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:20,323
Actors will pretty much do
anything to get themselves on film.

418
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,309
So this is a shockumentary.

419
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,614
Yeah, all the segments
are about 5 minutes long,

420
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,717
and he's put 6
together so far.

421
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:30,825
Let's see, you have cindy's
fear: Friday the 13th,

422
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,307
janet's fear: I know
what you did last summer.

423
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,902
-billy's fear...
-yeah, he cast on fear, not type.

424
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,012
I mean, it's pretty terrifying,
I had to turn it off.

425
00:21:40,036 --> 00:21:41,146
Well, that's weird, melinda.

426
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:43,383
I mean, some of the date
stamps on these edits

427
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,437
are within the last month.

428
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:45,874
One of these is
from yesterday!

429
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,843
But one of us had the
computer the whole time.

430
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:50,915
-I mean, he couldn't have cut it, could he?
-Why couldn't he?

431
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,995
I mean, we've seen
him manipulate footage,

432
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:54,358
surveillance camera stuff.

433
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:56,107
I mean, it's not
that far of a leap.

434
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,427
He's making his
movie from the grave.

435
00:22:26,271 --> 00:22:27,811
********I'm home.

436
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:29,195
Thank god you're home.

437
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,010
This movie's really
starting to freak me out.

438
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:32,285
What is it?

439
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:36,594
It's the movie that the ghost
was making, or is making.

440
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:38,267
And your favorite genre.

441
00:22:38,296 --> 00:22:39,486
No, except this
one's different.

442
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:41,585
These are real people,
and they're really scared.

443
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,668
It's like freddy
krueger meets punk'D.

444
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,772
Apparently kylie tiedck
this guy off in an audition.

445
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:49,202
Well, I know he's a
ghost, so that's not good.

446
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,557
Yeah, I'm just trying to see
if there's any more to it.

447
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:53,878
Well, if you're
actually sort of scared,

448
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,246
why don't you
turn the lights on?

449
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,117
Are you kidding me?
And ruin the fun?

450
00:22:58,053 --> 00:22:59,783
I don't understand you people.

451
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:00,815
I'm gonna hit the shower.

452
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:02,531
Get me the hell out of here!

453
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,152
What are you afraid of?

454
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,012
I want out!

455
00:23:05,783 --> 00:23:08,423
-I know you're...
-what are you afraid of?

456
00:23:09,818 --> 00:23:11,858
Jim, stop it, seriously.

457
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:14,935
What are you afraid of?

458
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:26,659
All right, that's it!

459
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:28,866
Toby, stop it!
Do you hear me?!

460
00:23:29,071 --> 00:23:30,741
It was bad enough
when you were alive.

461
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:32,734
I thought you wanted to play.

462
00:23:34,305 --> 00:23:36,355
I thought you loved
those slasher movies.

463
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:37,528
You have to stop doing this.

464
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:40,116
Just let me try and
help you move on.

465
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,715
Not until she finishes it.

466
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,479
Who, kylie?

467
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,650
What is it that you
want her to finish?

468
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:49,894
Ask her. She knows.

469
00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:58,452
Did you talk to kylie?

470
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,499
No, I called,
went by her dorm.

471
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:04,042
I think she's avoiding us, and
there's something you should see.

472
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:05,036
Yeah.

473
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:10,883
Was that a person?!

474
00:24:10,888 --> 00:24:12,978
No. That was
skippy over there.

475
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:15,351
But I know why you're queasy.
Does any of that look familiar?

476
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,927
That's the place
where toby died.

477
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,636
I recognize the for rent
sign from his obituary.

478
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:22,174
He was doing a stunt.
That's how he died.

479
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:27,125
Wait a minute.

480
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:32,475
Shouldn't you buy
him a drink first?

481
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,039
Look, ok?

482
00:24:34,076 --> 00:24:38,366
The movie that he was making
before he died, it was the exorcist.

483
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:39,704
I'm with you, I think.

484
00:24:40,084 --> 00:24:41,834
The falling through the
glass, the heavy breathing,

485
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:44,746
the things that he was
haunting kylie with,

486
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:46,204
it's all things
from the movie,

487
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,633
so it has to mean
something to her.

488
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:49,286
Wait a minute, what was that?

489
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:50,244
I didn't see that before.

490
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,399
It's one of the soundtracks
attached to the raw footage.

491
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:55,173
They must have mixed it
down into logged clips.

492
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:57,815
-let's do one more.
-What?

493
00:24:58,412 --> 00:25:01,532
Well, that's toby, but you
can hear someone else. Listen.

494
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:03,772
What? Why? We're not gonna
get a better take than that.

495
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:05,255
-It's kylie.
-Yeah.

496
00:25:05,265 --> 00:25:06,905
She was working with him.

497
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:09,255
Just not in front
of the camera.

498
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:32,734
Hey, kylie, it's melinda.

499
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,450
If you're there,
please pick up.

500
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:35,652
I need to talk to you.

501
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,040
I know you were
working with toby.

502
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,428
What I don't understand
is why you didn't tell us.

503
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:42,517
I know you're scared, but
you need to let us help you

504
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:44,897
before this gets
even worse. Just--

505
00:25:54,902 --> 00:25:56,982
Testing, testing.

506
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,455
Final death scene, take one.

507
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:05,695
Final death scene, take one.

508
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:11,874
Final death scene, take one.

509
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:19,383
Testing.Final death
scene, take one.

510
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:22,211
Final death scene, take one.

511
00:26:26,393 --> 00:26:29,323
Death scene, death
scene, death scene,

512
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:32,391
death scene, death
scene, death scene,

513
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:38,691

514
00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:54,812
death scene, death
scene, death scene,

515
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:58,028
all right, I need you to tell
me the truth. What happened?

516
00:26:58,045 --> 00:27:02,355
Death scene, death scene,
death scene, death scene--

517
00:27:02,402 --> 00:27:03,172
I killed him.

518
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,448
Death scene, death scene,
death scene, death scene.

519
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,614
I.*********

520
00:27:10,494 --> 00:27:12,014
I just didn't want
to believe you.

521
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:15,784
The thought of
toby haunting me is.

522
00:27:16,392 --> 00:27:17,472
it's too awful.

523
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,227
Why don't you tell me exactly
what happened that night.

524
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:24,259
I was supposed to be there.

525
00:27:25,732 --> 00:27:27,322
He had the shot all set up.

526
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:29,232
It was actually pretty cool.

527
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:33,359
This interior angle shot
of the priest falling.

528
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:37,972
Bruce quit, so toby
had to stand in.

529
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,830
It was a 2-person job.

530
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:50,468
And I guess he
tripped, and fell.

531
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,872
It's horrible.

532
00:27:57,736 --> 00:27:59,276
That's what happened to toby.

533
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,787
But you weren't there.

534
00:28:02,406 --> 00:28:03,836
It was an accident, so.

535
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,640
why do you think
it's your fault?

536
00:28:06,672 --> 00:28:07,932
Because.

537
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,597
that's the day I
lost my scholarship.

538
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,134
I've just been so invested
in making this movie

539
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:17,367
that I've let my
course work slip.

540
00:28:17,412 --> 00:28:20,882
I'm skipping deadlines,
I'm flunking tests.

541
00:28:20,954 --> 00:28:23,074
You--you
can't quit.

542
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:24,882
This is our baby.

543
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,943
No, this is your baby.

544
00:28:27,315 --> 00:28:30,195
And it's been fun, and we've
had our kicks, but it's over.

545
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:33,174
No, you don't understand.
I'm doing this for you.

546
00:28:33,192 --> 00:28:36,002
-You need to face your fears.
-Please don'T.

547
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:37,652
I don't want to do this.

548
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:39,961
Yes, you do, and
that's what scares you.

549
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:42,876
I haven't even told my
friends about working with you.

550
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:55,581
What embarrasses you
more, me or making movies?

551
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:00,949
-It's just. it's not me.
-Yes, it is.

552
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:04,034
What is holding you
back? You can do this.

553
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:06,041
Why are you turning
your back on it?

554
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,278
You love making movies.

555
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:12,216
Why is what I do
so important to you?

556
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:16,318
Do you have something to say?

557
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:19,024
'Cause if you do, say it.

558
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:20,355
I want to hear it.

559
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,348
I do.

560
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,016
This isn't about me.

561
00:29:36,465 --> 00:29:37,725
It's never about you.

562
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,888
You think hiding behind
a camera gives you a pass.

563
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:44,007
From our friendship and
from all human interaction.

564
00:29:44,053 --> 00:29:46,353
No, that's the only
way that it works.

565
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:48,649
Ok, that's the only way
that I can get people

566
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,764
to be themselves on camera.

567
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:52,468
I have to be invisible.

568
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:57,292
I hope you and your camera
have a very happy life together.

569
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:00,371
I'm done.

570
00:30:05,692 --> 00:30:07,802
I shouldn't have
walked away like that.

571
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,632
I don't think
toby's haunting you

572
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,320
because he thinks
you killed him.

573
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,551
Of course he does, why
else would he be doing this?

574
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,965
I think he wants you
to face your worst fear,

575
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,713
whatever it is
about that movie.

576
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:22,834
God.

577
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:25,871
I'm so tired of hearing that.

578
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,870
What do you mean?

579
00:30:26,897 --> 00:30:29,237
I know why the
exorcist scares me.

580
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,620
The day my dad died, a priest
was reading his last rites.

581
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,401
It was horrible.

582
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,500
That's why I can't-- I
can't watch that movie.

583
00:30:48,002 --> 00:30:49,322
I get it.

584
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,266
-Nowhw at?
-I don't know.

585
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:55,998
I don't understand
what he wants, then.

586
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,528
I want her to finish it.

587
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,050
If she's faced her fears,
I want her to finish it.

588
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:04,919
Finish what?

589
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:07,447
Is he here?

590
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:11,263
He was.

591
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:14,604
What did he say?

592
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:18,476
He said if you faced your
fears, he wants you to finish it.

593
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:20,919
Do you know what that means?

594
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:22,333
It means.

595
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,900
he's not gonna stop.

596
00:31:27,897 --> 00:31:30,607
And this isn't gonna
end, and you can'T.

597
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:31,998
help me.

598
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,203
Yes, I can.

599
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,252
I promise.

600
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,309
You need to leave kylie alone.

601
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:56,721
That's funny.

602
00:31:57,174 --> 00:31:58,664
I was going to say the same thing to you.

603
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,203
You're making it worse.

604
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:02,234
She needs to figure it out on her own.

605
00:32:02,528 --> 00:32:05,568
Why is that important to you,
that she finishes the movie?

606
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:08,092
Why do you this to people?

607
00:32:08,204 --> 00:32:11,114
Everyone has something that they're afraid of;

608
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,853
something that holds them back.

609
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,215
There's always a reason.

610
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,579
Like you,and those slasher films.

611
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:18,424
Let's look at that.

612
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:19,739
Give me a break.

613
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:25,138
Don't you ever wonder why those films
leave you feeling sick and exposed?

614
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:28,206
What deep,dark memory do they stir?

615
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:29,191
I don't need your help.

616
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:32,169
Those films are usually about abandonment.

617
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,363
Who abandoned you,melinda?

618
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:36,772
Who left you alone in the dark?

619
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:39,143
Your mother?

620
00:32:39,987 --> 00:32:41,147
Your father?

621
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:44,376
That's it,isn't it?

622
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,823
- Was he a
- stop it.

623
00:32:48,813 --> 00:32:52,613
I am all for self reflection,
but you're the earth-bound spirit.

624
00:32:52,698 --> 00:32:54,598
You're the one who has issues.

625
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:56,855
Are you sure?

626
00:32:58,928 --> 00:33:02,978
By the way,kylie's going to
finish what we started.

627
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:04,795
She has no choice.

628
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,530
Ok,toby,I'm here.

629
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:32,591
This is where we were going to shoot the last.

630
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:34,074
it's where you died.

631
00:33:34,585 --> 00:33:36,375
Did you want to see me scared?

632
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:39,537
Did you want to see me...

633
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:40,948
...crack?

634
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:43,941
Well,it worked.

635
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:46,079
I'm terrified.

636
00:33:48,212 --> 00:33:49,672
Now what do you want from me?

637
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:50,954
Is this it?

638
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:54,407
I don't get it.

639
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:56,326
I am trying,damn it!

640
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,061
I've done everything that you wanted!

641
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:01,496
I watched the movie a million times!

642
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,570
I don't know what I'm supposed to face!

643
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:05,063
I'm done living it!

644
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:08,444
Do I have to die,too?

645
00:35:08,816 --> 00:35:10,356
Do I have to die,too?

646
00:35:33,293 --> 00:35:35,343
Wow,you really know what you're doing.

647
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:38,282
Tell that to this machine.

648
00:35:38,507 --> 00:35:40,597
What is wrong with this thing?!

649
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,150
What do you want from me?!

650
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:44,751
I shot your movie,I cut it!

651
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,251
It's finished. Just let me be done with it!

652
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,522
Kylie,everything's going to be ok.

653
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:49,651
No,it's not.

654
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,117
He won't let me lock the cut.

655
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:52,036
He won't let me finish.

656
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:53,863
Kylie,no one's here.

657
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:55,705
He's been here all night.

658
00:35:56,229 --> 00:35:59,769
He's haunted me every step.

659
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:01,282
I beliyoeve U.

660
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:04,122
Why do you think he's doing that?

661
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:06,789
I don't know,I told you.

662
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:09,949
Tell me about the breathing.

663
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:12,386
What about it?

664
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,743
Toby seems to think it's the key,
and you're the only one who knows why.

665
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:16,834
The breathing.

666
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:19,483
is it about your father,the way he died?

667
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:43,897
The summer before I leorft f rockland,
I had,uh,I had an internship

668
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:46,629
at this investment firm in the city.

669
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:51,871
And every day I ate lunch at
the washington square park.

670
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,215
It's right by nyu.A lot of film
students hung out there,

671
00:36:55,074 --> 00:37:01,504
and I would just.do wardrobe,
grip,camera,whatever they needed.

672
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,125
It was.

673
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:08,147
it was the best summer of my life.

674
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,389
But what I didn't know was that entire time.

675
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,860
my dad was dying.

676
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,823
Your family didn't tell you?

677
00:37:16,874 --> 00:37:20,554
They didn't want to distract me,
I guess,from my work.

678
00:37:23,938 --> 00:37:25,608
I would have taken any excuse to quit.

679
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,730
I didn't want to go into finance,
I wanted to make films.

680
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:35,621
And I was gonna tell him.

681
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,289
After the summer was over.

682
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:47,379
But then one morning,my mom called
and she said I'd better get home,and.

683
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,441
I couldn't believe.

684
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:56,568
how frail he looked. How weak he was.

685
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:01,064
He kept slipping in and out of consciousness,

686
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:04,387
and then finally,he smiled at me.

687
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:06,218
He told me to come close.

688
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:13,457
That's--that's probably why the
breathing was so hard for me,

689
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:15,429
that night.

690
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:19,712
And the last words he said to me,.

691
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:21,918
he could barely speak

692
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:26,995
And when I looked up,and I saw the priest,

693
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:30,724
I knew he was dying.

694
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:35,978
What things did he say to you?

695
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:39,191
He said I would always be his angel,

696
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:44,055
and that I was just so much like him.

697
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:48,681
What else?

698
00:38:49,314 --> 00:38:50,954
Think.

699
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:53,397
I would do great things.

700
00:38:56,228 --> 00:38:57,798
I would never let him down.

701
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:01,852
But I did let him down.

702
00:39:01,874 --> 00:39:03,474
I lost my scholarship.

703
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:08,827
I've given up completely on everything
that he would have wanted for me,.

704
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:11,858
everything he cared about

705
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,480
Kylie.

706
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,800
he cared about you.

707
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:20,611
He wouldn't be proud of me making horror films!

708
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:22,973
Do you like making horror films?

709
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:27,889
More than anything.

710
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,430
Well,I'm pretty darn sure he'd be impressed
with you making horror films.

711
00:39:31,513 --> 00:39:34,813
No,not dad. You knew him.He's...

712
00:39:35,488 --> 00:39:36,348
yeah,I knew him.

713
00:39:36,363 --> 00:39:39,743
Who do you think it was that convinced
me to write books about voodoo?

714
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,830
Not my father.

715
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,529
Yes,your father,my friend ben told me,

716
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:47,606
and I'm only mildly paraphrasing here,

717
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:51,676
he said,"rick,if I had half the passion
for numbers that you have for shrunken heads,

718
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:54,682
"I would run,I wouldn't walk,
to the nearest convention of the dead.

719
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:56,901
" And that's what I did,kylie.

720
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:00,971
That's what he meant that day.

721
00:40:00,991 --> 00:40:02,661
That's what he was trying to say to you,

722
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:05,387
that if you find your passion,
you'll do great things.

723
00:40:05,408 --> 00:40:06,818
Don't you see that?

724
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:16,871
It worked.

725
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:20,175
She did it.

726
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:23,344
She figured out what was holding her back.

727
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:24,927
Yeah.

728
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,220
Now how about you?

729
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,300
This was about kylie,
about her following her dream.

730
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,398
I'm--I'm done.

731
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:33,912
Is this.

732
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:35,502
is toby here?

733
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:36,742
Yes.

734
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,000
I think there's something he'd like to say to you.

735
00:40:39,044 --> 00:40:40,444
Oh,no,there isn'T.

736
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:41,713
Is he hiding?

737
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,945
He doesn't like it when the camera's on him.

738
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,320
This could be your last
chance to ever talk to her.

739
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,422
Go for it.

740
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,177
Face your fears.

741
00:40:57,754 --> 00:41:00,514
It's funny,because my whole life,

742
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:02,955
I tried to be invisible.

743
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:07,162
Now I'd give anything
for her to be able to see me.

744
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:10,147
He wishes that you could see him right now.

745
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,416
Tell him I can.

746
00:41:11,864 --> 00:41:13,124
Really?

747
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:16,018
It's that angle 2 shot.

748
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:17,551
we did.

749
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,333
At the beach.

750
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:23,678
With the guy and the girl.

751
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:28,662
It's sunset,and they were so afraid
to tell each other how they felt.

752
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:32,953
And the world was coming to an end.

753
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,939
Tell her I remember.

754
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:52,625
Oh,man.

755
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:53,763
Look at that.

756
00:41:57,394 --> 00:41:58,824
He sees the light.

757
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:16,823
Tell her I'll save her a good seat.

758
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,750
Who are you?

759
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,540
What do you want?

760
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:04,324
Melinda!

761
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:05,322
Hey,what's up?

762
00:43:05,337 --> 00:43:07,467
- What's going on?
- I just had the worst dream.

763
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:08,701
Are you ok? That's crazy

764
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,990
No,it was so real.

765
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,061
It's like it actually happened.

766
00:43:13,077 --> 00:43:16,447
There was this strange man coming towards me,
and he had on a mask.

767
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:17,669
The guy in the horror flick.

768
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:18,946
No,this was real.

769
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:22,502
- Honey,it's just a dream.
- No.

770
00:43:23,966 --> 00:43:25,296
This happened.

771
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:28,223
This was a memory.

772
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,343
When I was younger.

773
00:43:32,692 --> 00:43:34,462
this happened to me.

774
00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:38,498
Hey,come here.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
