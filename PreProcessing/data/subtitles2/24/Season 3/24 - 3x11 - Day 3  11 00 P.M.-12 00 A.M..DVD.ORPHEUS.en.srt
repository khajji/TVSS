1
00:00:01,104 --> 00:00:03,579
No, why did you want me to the basketball game?

2
00:00:03,614 --> 00:00:06,188
I don't know the difference
between a field goal
and a slam dunk.

3
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,898
They don't have
field goals
in basketball.

4
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:09,765
That's football.
No, basketball, too

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,378
Oh, jim,
why don't you come?

6
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:13,094
Ned would love
to have you there.

7
00:00:13,129 --> 00:00:14,832
Ah, i'd love to,
but i got the night shift.

8
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:16,032
You know?

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,301
Look, i wouldn't ask,

10
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:19,934
Except this is
a new school for him,

11
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,068
He just transferred in,

12
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:22,435
And i know
he would appreciate

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,615
Seeing a few
familiar faces there.

14
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,759
I'd be happy to come.

15
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:26,712
Huh! That's great!

16
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:28,201
Oh, he will
so thrilled!

17
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:30,767
Oh, i hope he gets
a touchdown!

18
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,025
Hey, honey, we're here.

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,292
Yeah, i saw that, mom.

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,262
Did you say hi
to melinda?

21
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,087
Hi, melinda.
Hi, ned.

22
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,992
And i have snacks
if you're hungry.

23
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:57,384
Oh, no.
Really, i'm ok, mom.

24
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,074
I know it means a lot
to him that we're here.

25
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:00,981
I can see that.

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,217
Is that brad? No.34

27
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:05,183
I mean,
what's the big deal?

28
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:07,620
What can he do
that you can't do?

29
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:15,044
That.

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,101
Way to go, brad!

31
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,234
Is that his girlfriend?

32
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,801
Yeah, her name's
krista.

33
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:34,292
I don't know.

34
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,975
What happened?
Ned, what's wrong?

35
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,317
Brad's points aren't up.

36
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:40,273
Something wrong
with the scoreboard.

37
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,012
Maybe she needs help.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,094
"34 + gf = death."

39
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:53,995
What's going on?

40
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,869
34, that's brad's
number.

41
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:57,807
So "gf" is gotta be
girlfriend, right?

42
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:01,266
Yeah, brad and krista
are like this
uber couple.

43
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,834
What?

44
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:05,201
"Slammers be slammed?"

45
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:13,978
Wait, this doesn't have
anything to do with
that awful slam book?

46
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:15,656
What's a slam book?

47
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:17,273
It's just this
terrible website

48
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:21,653
Where students
can anonymously slam
each other. It's--Ugh.

49
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,082
What's going on?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,368
Delia, get up, go!

51
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:33,250
Ok, ned, come on, let's
get out of here.Ned...

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,135
Ned, what the hell
is going on?

53
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:05,130
Tell me more
about the slam book.

54
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:08,026
It's just a way
to hurt people.

55
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:11,556
Well, it's working.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000

58
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:49,071
And right before
the bleachers closed,

59
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,191
The scoreboard said
"slammers be slammed."

60
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:51,965
Well, it's obviously
a ghost

61
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:54,092
Who's a big fan
of a jump shot.

62
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:56,745
You know, as opposed
to slam dunks.

63
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,413
Nothing? These are
basketball references.

64
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,644
Why am i wasting
my time?

65
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,472
Ok, have you ever heard
of a slam book?

66
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:02,522
Of course i have.

67
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,074
The internet's
wonderful contribution

68
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:05,562
To ruining reputations
everywhere.

69
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:08,396
Yeah, these kids
just create a webpage
and tear into each other.

70
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,479
Everyone can see it.

71
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,123
You don't even have
to sneak into
the boy's locker room

72
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,348
To find out what
they wrote on the wall.

73
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,708
Not that i ever did that.

74
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:16,698
I never did that,
either. Ever.

75
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:18,170
I never had
anything written
about me, either,

76
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,359
Which is awful.
Zip, zero, nothing.
Is there anything worse?

77
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,101
Yeah, try this--
"Want milk?

78
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,274
Try jay baker's man boobs.

79
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:25,848
So you think this ghost
is lashing out

80
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,755
Because of what
somebody wrote about it
in the slam book?

81
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,284
Maybe. Especially
if what was written
by brad and krista.

82
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,176
Hey, morning.
Hey, professor payne.

83
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:34,817
Hey, you two.
Hey

84
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:37,356
Hey, ned, how are things
going at school?
Weird.

85
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:38,656
Why? What happened now?

86
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,394
Well, the school tnks
they have a suspect

87
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,397
In that gym incident
last night.

88
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,366
The girl who ran
the scoreboard,
what was her name?

89
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,202
Lucy.

90
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:46,894
Well, that means
it's not a ghost, then.

91
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,735
Well, it depends on
who you talk to.

92
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:51,645
The school feels
they caught the culprit.
Ned, on the other hand...

93
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,700
Lucy's brother died
a few weeks ago.

94
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,360
Yeah, he hit his head
skateboarding.

95
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,733
He seemed fine,
and then he just
fell asleep.

96
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,875
Concussions
are like that--
Totally stealth.

97
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:01,216
Oh, that is awful.

98
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:03,221
And that's exactly
why some people think that

99
00:05:03,296 --> 00:05:04,962
It makes sense
that lucy did it.

100
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:06,837
You know, she was upset,
understandably.

101
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,416
Maybe she blames
brad and krista

102
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,014
Even though
her brother's death
was an accident.

103
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:12,161
What is her brother's name?

104
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,867
Thomas. Thomas benjamin.

105
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,322
Well, that's strange.
There's practically
nothing here.

106
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:24,567
Just one kid
calling him guano boy.
Whatever that means.

107
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:25,649
Where can i find a picture?

108
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,763
Check the school
face page. Here.

109
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,237
Guano boy's
better than nothin'.

110
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:32,215
At least he's not invisible.

111
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:33,880
Hello?

112
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,760
Do you guys even hear
what i'm saying?

113
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,580
I don't know if he caused
all that stuff

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,680
With the scoreboard
and bleachers,

115
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,203
But i know he was there last
night. This is the ghost i saw.

116
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,013
Really?
Mom.

117
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,319
What?

118
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,691
So if it was the ghost,
that's good news, right?

119
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,170
At least for lucy.

120
00:05:51,242 --> 00:05:53,943
You can tell
that ned's a little
biased on the subject.

121
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,475
So lucy's a friend?

122
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,892
Don't say anything.

123
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,562
Uh, ned, i take it
you don't agree

124
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:02,370
With, uh, britfan20-12
who describes lucy
as, quote,

125
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,217
"Satan's deadly
girl pawn?"

126
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,925
Whoever wrote that
doesn't know her.

127
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,482
She's really cool.
You should meet her.

128
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:11,082
So then why don't you
introduce me?

129
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:15,758
Uh, geometry class?
I sit right behind you.

130
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,097
Uh, right next
to tony neil.

131
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,113
Spanish 2.

132
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:21,585
I sit in the back,
over to the left,

133
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,357
Uh, by the pencil
sharpener.

134
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,214
I'm sorry, i have no clue.

135
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,841
Don't take it personally,
i'm new at school, ted.

136
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,055
Ned.

137
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:31,786
I'm new, too.

138
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:33,862
That's why i thought
you might, uh--

139
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,366
Uh, lucy, i'm melinda.

140
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:40,712
Ned told me
about your brother,
and i'm really sorry.

141
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:42,933
Thanks. Um...

142
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,140
What's this about?

143
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,009
Well, i was at the gym
last night.

144
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:48,340
Yeah, look,

145
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:49,991
I already talked
to a lot of people
about it, so...

146
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:52,931
I don't think
that you did it.

147
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:54,577
I was there
at the scoreboard.

148
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,748
I'm all emotionally messed up
about my brother.

149
00:06:56,823 --> 00:06:57,923
It had to be me, right?

150
00:06:57,994 --> 00:06:59,292
Well, it's hard
to explain,

151
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:02,606
But i'm pretty sure
someone else did it.

152
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,170
Why?

153
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,289
Do you blame brad and krista
for your brother's death?

154
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:11,670
It was an accident.
Why would i blame them?

155
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:13,590
Whoever wrote
"slammers be slammed"

156
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:16,101
Obviously blames them
for something.

157
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:19,168
Can i ask you more
about your brother?

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,147
I heard that he died
in a skateboarding
accident.

159
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:25,275
He came home that night
and put a bag of ice
on the back of his head.

160
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:26,697
He had his skateboard
with him,

161
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:29,620
So i figured he just
wiped out again.

162
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,780
And then he went to sleep
and never woke up.

163
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:34,160
Do you remember
anything else?

164
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,530
Anything he said?

165
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,702
Nothing he said.

166
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,846
But i noticed
there was like...

167
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,722
Chalk on his jacket.

168
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,163
Like, the kind
that they use

169
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:46,368
To write the name
of the football team
on the field.

170
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:49,647
This is gonna sound
like a weird question,

171
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,082
But were there any
bad feelings

172
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:52,964
Between thomas
and krista--

173
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:54,967
What does the gym thing
last night

174
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,798
Have to do with thomas?
He's dead.

175
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,241
Oh, i get it, ok.

176
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:04,129
You say that you don't
think that i had anything
to with it, but...

177
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,409
No, it's not
like that.

178
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:07,191
Why can't everybody
just give me a break?

179
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:10,155
Lucy!
Hey. Let her go.

180
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:12,980
I'll see you guys
in a little bit.

181
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:28,433
Oh...

182
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:47,495
Aaah!

183
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,723
Aaah!

184
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,479
Please, please stop!
He's harmless!

185
00:08:58,521 --> 00:08:59,815
Just let him fly away!

186
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,688
I don't get
why we can't tell lucy.

187
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,960
She'd be so relieved
to know that her brother's here.

188
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:16,135
For starters, she'd have
some answers for everything
she's being accused of.

189
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,046
Yeah, i don't know
if she's gonna be
relieved, ned.

190
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,788
It's a lot
for one person
to handle.

191
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,694
I handled it when you told me
my dad's ghost was here.

192
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:22,926
I don't want
to tell her
about her brother

193
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,072
Until i know
what he wants.

194
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:25,877
Officer: lucy benjamin?
Yeah?

195
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,384
Grandview police.
We need to ask you
some questions.

196
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,151
Who would put
a bat in there?

197
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,633
I mean, who would
think of that?

198
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:36,452
It was you.

199
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:37,458
You're the only one.

200
00:09:37,461 --> 00:09:39,393
I don't know what
you're talking about.

201
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:41,516
Brad: krista, take it easy.

202
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,124
Why would you do that to me?

203
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,196
I'm like the only person
in this whole school

204
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:46,250
Who's been nice
to your brother.

205
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:47,353
Why would you do that to me?

206
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:50,509
I died becau of you.
That's why.

207
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:54,155
And now you're gonna pay--
Both of you.

208
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,975
I just don't get
why the cops were there.

209
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,366
Lucy's not some psycho.

210
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,559
It's the world we live in now.

211
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,296
Schools feel like
they can't be too cautious.

212
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,671
Well, does thomas
have any idea

213
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,745
What kind of trouble
he's getting
his sister in?

214
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,254
Well, maybe he does,
maybe he doesn't.

215
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:14,726
We just have to find out
what he has against
those two,

216
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,401
And what it has to do
with the slam book.

217
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:17,508
So what do we do?

218
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,911
Well, usually i would
talk to lucy,

219
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,417
But she seems to think
i'm just another adult

220
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,356
Who wants to blame her
for what happened
in the gym.

221
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:24,967
Who else can we get
to talk to her?

222
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:29,086
I don't know.

223
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:32,065
I mean,
this whole thing just--

224
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:34,000
Ok, you know what,
if you're afraid

225
00:10:34,074 --> 00:10:35,507
To have ned get involved
with ghosts,

226
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,780
Then i understand.

227
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:39,570
It's not the ghost
i'm afraid of.

228
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:41,599
What is it, then?

229
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,936
Nothing. I'm not
afraid of anything.

230
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,070
Me, neither.

231
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:04,018
What are you doing here?

232
00:11:04,058 --> 00:11:06,008
Are you here
with your friend?
No.

233
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,712
I just--I didn't
mean to bother you.

234
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:08,753
I just wanted
to talk.

235
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,770
Oh, god, i'm sorry.

236
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,582
Um...

237
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:16,170
I haven't been
in the best mood lately.

238
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,386
I should get going,
anyway.

239
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:20,908
I'm really sorry
about what happened
to thoma

240
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:26,281
I shouldn't have...
said anything.

241
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:31,103
No, it's ok.
It's...messed up

242
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,972
How you don't really
want people to bring it up,

243
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,510
And then, if they don't,

244
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:39,428
It's like everybody's
already forgotten him.

245
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:42,333
Were you two
really close?

246
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:44,494
He's my big brother.

247
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,772
We were the only 2 kids
in our family.

248
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:47,748
He always looked out for me.

249
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,617
Sometimes more
than i wanted him to.

250
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:54,106
Yeah. I got a mom
who's like that.

251
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,986
Just, i...

252
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:00,232
Miss him so much
sometimes, you know?

253
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,634
And all this strange stuff's
happening,

254
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:05,537
And making it
so much worse.

255
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:07,737
Maybe i can help.

256
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,960
What do you mean?

257
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:11,401
Ok, this is gonna
sound weird.

258
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:14,075
Really wei, but i
can't think of a not
weird way to say it,

259
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,317
So i'm just gonna
say it.

260
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:19,068
I believe in ghosts.

261
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:22,678
And if you go with me,
just for a minute,

262
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,274
Maybe you can see
how you won't have
to miss thomas so much.

263
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:26,742
Plus, it can
help explain

264
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:30,034
All the strange things
that's been happening.

265
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,511
The scoreboard,
the bleachers,

266
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:32,816
The bat in krista's car.

267
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:35,021
The bat was just somebody's
bad idea of a joke.

268
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,562
Everybody knew
thomas was into bats.

269
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:38,035
I know
it sounds crazy.

270
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,041
Ok, wait, what--
What is this?

271
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,942
Is there a camera somewhere?
Are you gonna post

272
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,122
This whole little talk
on your slam book?

273
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:45,721
I wouldn't do that.

274
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:48,084
Just don't talk to me
about my brother again.

275
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,851
Stay the hell away from me!

276
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:57,030
These kids must spend
half their waking hours

277
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:59,443
Slamming each other online,
and nobody's immune.

278
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:01,054
That's one of the
popular girls, right?

279
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,894
Turns out that's not
such a blessing anymore.

280
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,134
I guess it pays
to be anonymous
on the internet.

281
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,310
Yeah. Being anonymous
is part of the problem.

282
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,984
These kids say things
under the cover
of a screen name

283
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:11,391
That they would never
have the courage to say
to someone's face.

284
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:12,869
Here we go.

285
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:15,872
A slam on krista
keeps it concise
and to the point.

286
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,549
"Liar. Two-Faced.
Phony. Bitch."

287
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:22,084
Anyone who sleeps
with krista better
get tested."

288
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:23,195
"You're not kidding.

289
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,286
Don't forget
the rabies vaccine."

290
00:13:25,328 --> 00:13:26,639
Wow. Rabies.

291
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,800
Gettin' slammed already
for having a bat
in her car.

292
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,999
News travels fast
on the internet.

293
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:35,173
Yeah, except this was
posted last month,

294
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:36,957
Before thomas died.

295
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:38,695
And there's a few more
mentions of rabies

296
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:41,845
Going back en further.
You know what, i wonder...

297
00:13:48,004 --> 00:13:48,959
What's that?

298
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,790
Krista's school face page.

299
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,647
Look at the caption.

300
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,787
"Here's me with
a bat house i built
with my dad."

301
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:56,694
You know,
maybe i'm wrong,

302
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:57,906
But i'm guessing
bat lovers united

303
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,208
Is a very small club.

304
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:03,374
Makes you wonder what else
they had in common.

305
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:11,179
Krista: i can't
handle this anymore.

306
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,879
"It's ok, brad's
totally clueless.

307
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:32,465
"I mean, what would
i tell him anyway?

308
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,817
I'm crazy about someone
who won't even give me
their name."

309
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,451
Signed krista?

310
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:49,614
Krista: i can explain.
Brad.

311
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:54,346
And that was sent
to every kid at school
at the same time?

312
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,171
Ned: yeah, how is that
even possible?

313
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,378
Well, if i had to guess,
i'd guess ghost.

314
00:14:58,422 --> 00:14:59,369
So what now?

315
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:00,503
Well, it seems to imply

316
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,009
That krista was cheating
on her boyfriend brad.

317
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:03,550
Maybe he knew
about it.

318
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,788
I can introduce you to brad.

319
00:15:04,859 --> 00:15:06,526
I'll be right there.

320
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,503
[Indistinct chatter]

321
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:17,083
Ned.

322
00:15:17,122 --> 00:15:17,873
Hey.
Hey.

323
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:19,579
Where is he?

324
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,281
Yeah, practice just ended.

325
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,688
I told him to meet you
in the team meeting room.

326
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:24,764
I'll see you later.

327
00:16:12,749 --> 00:16:15,015
Thomas benjamin
had chalk on him
when he died.

328
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,771
He was hit in the head
with something.

329
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,708
I'm guessing
it was this board.

330
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:27,317
You're the one
that pushed him into it.

331
00:16:31,276 --> 00:16:34,296
Brad, i don't work for the school
or the police

332
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:34,862
I'm just trying

333
00:16:34,864 --> 00:16:37,798
To help thomas
and his family
get some peace.

334
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,576
And you, too.

335
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,849
But you have
to tell me
what happened.

336
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,196
Krista had been
acting strange for weeks.

337
00:16:46,274 --> 00:16:48,326
I mean, we spe
all our time together,

338
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:52,216
But she was sorta...
checked out.

339
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:56,967
She was always online
iming her friends.

340
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:58,725
Hey.

341
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:00,675
Here's a tip--

342
00:17:00,962 --> 00:17:05,562
When your girlfriend starts
closing your cell phone
around you, it's over.

343
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:08,010
I really like krista,

344
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:11,423
And i just--
I didn't want
to lose her.

345
00:17:11,503 --> 00:17:13,936
I had to know
who she was seeing.

346
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,911
I know it was wrong,
but i read her email.

347
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:21,423
Some of the stuff
she was telling this guy
was so intense.

348
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,439
And the weirdest thing was,

349
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:25,244
E didn't even know
who he was.

350
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:28,907
Then i did something
really stupid

351
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:31,968
That i'll regret
the rest of my life.

352
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,098
I sent him an email
pretending to be krista.

353
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:42,311
I said, "let's meet."

354
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:45,152
So you arranged
to meet him here?

355
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,532
I just wanted to know
who the guy was.

356
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:51,438
I had a right
to face my competition,

357
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:54,087
Tell him what krista
meant to me.

358
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,869
Then there was thomas.

359
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,544
Guano boy.

360
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,349
Brad: i couldn't
believe it.

361
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,352
Where's krista?

362
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:13,809
She doesn't know
anything about this.

363
00:18:13,814 --> 00:18:14,889
I sent the invite.

364
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,381
Yeah, well, whatever.

365
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,702
Look, man,
i just want to talk.

366
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:19,456
Yeah, well,
i don't want
to talk to you, man.

367
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:20,514
You gotta hear me out, man!

368
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:21,984
And that's when
he blindsided me.

369
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:24,905
[Both yelling]

370
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,086
Ow!

371
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,808
Are you ok, man?

372
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,451
What the hell
do you care, man?!
Get off me!

373
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:47,583
Brad: and that was it,
i swear.

374
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:50,727
He seemed fine
that night when he left.

375
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:52,478
What about krista?

376
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:54,912
How does she feel
about all of this?

377
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,249
Like i told thomas--

378
00:18:57,501 --> 00:19:01,435
She didn't even know
i sent the email
arranging the meeting.

379
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:04,819
It's me who's to blame.

380
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,138
Quite an entrance.

381
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:49,680
Just some friends
from a previous life.

382
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,116
I don't know why
they can see me.

383
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,507
Then again, i don'know why
you can see me, either.

384
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,419
Brad told me
what happened
the night you died.

385
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,556
Did he mentioned the part
where he killed me?

386
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:03,377
He said that you
threw the first punch,

387
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,106
And that he thought
you were ok and it was
all an accident.

388
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:06,827
What if it was?

389
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,044
When i left him, he was
with the principal,

390
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:11,151
Confessing everything
to the authorities.

391
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:12,687
He feels terrible.

392
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:13,956
Ok, it was all
an accident

393
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,848
And you have
to forgive them
and go into the light.

394
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:18,455
Forgive them? Why?

395
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:19,570
Because everything
that you're doing,

396
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:21,477
All these things
you're trying to
punish them with,

397
00:20:21,484 --> 00:20:23,223
These hauntings,
it's just hurting
your sister.

398
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:25,430
She's getting blamed
for everything you do.

399
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:27,866
Who's blaming lucy?

400
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:28,992
Is it the slam book?

401
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:31,313
You know how
they treat anyone
who's different.

402
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:33,451
No, the police.
Ok, the school.

403
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,093
You were there
when they were
questioning her.

404
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:37,096
Well, they shouldn't be
questioning lucy.

405
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:38,521
That's the whole point.

406
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,752
They should just
leave her alone.

407
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:40,971
Is that why you've been
doing all this,

408
00:20:40,976 --> 00:20:42,940
Because you think
you're protecting her?

409
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:43,978
I always have.

410
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:46,263
I'm her brother.
I've got her six.

411
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:49,699
Thomas, please tell me
what it is that you're
protecting her from.

412
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:50,694
I can help you.

413
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:52,934
No, you can't.
No one can.

414
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:54,055
But if you don't
tell me,

415
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,190
I'm gonna have
to find out myself,

416
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:56,476
And what if
i'm too late?

417
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,387
You stay away from her.
I'm warning you.

418
00:20:58,395 --> 00:20:59,982
Why won't you let me
help her?

419
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,713
We all got our secrets.

420
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,380
Including you.

421
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:21,235
Melinda: lucy?

422
00:21:21,944 --> 00:21:23,700
Can i talk to you
for a minute?

423
00:21:23,707 --> 00:21:25,076
Talk if you want.

424
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:28,517
I know ned told you
he believes in ghosts.

425
00:21:29,292 --> 00:21:30,745
I really wish
he hadn't done that,

426
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,070
Because it doesn't
do you any good
unless i can prove it.

427
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,328
Oh, you're gonna
prove it to me?

428
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:36,846
I will if i have to.

429
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:38,597
But i think you
already know.

430
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:39,668
Really? How's that?

431
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:42,161
I think you've felt
his presence.

432
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,031
And i'm not just talking
about the weird things
that keep happening.

433
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,737
I want to know
why thomas needs
to have your six.

434
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:51,502
What?

435
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:52,868
I didn't know
what it meant,

436
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:53,896
So i looked it up,

437
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:56,755
And it's what
a fighter pilot
says to another

438
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:59,938
When he's covering his tail,
"i've got your six."

439
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:02,257
How did you know
thomas said that?

440
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:04,072
Because he said it
to me.

441
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:05,922
What do you want from me?

442
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:09,242
I want to know what
it is that thomas is
protecting you from.

443
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,277
Why he is so mad
at brad and krista,

444
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:13,959
So that i can get him
into the light
where he belongs.

445
00:22:15,746 --> 00:22:18,181
Lucy, please.
Just tell me what happened

446
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:20,198
Between him and krista.
Were they seeing each other?

447
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,647
Did he send those emails?

448
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,710
Hi. Justin yates.

449
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:44,831
Justin who?

450
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,514
You don't remember me.

451
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:47,900
Yeah, why would you.

452
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:51,615
Um, ok, uh, blogger?
In shame of the devil?

453
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:55,075
We met after you won
that plaque from the town
for, uh, saving those kids.

454
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:56,532
Ok, smile.

455
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:05,662
Oh.

456
00:23:05,736 --> 00:23:06,674
What do you want?

457
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,507
Well, i got this
really strange email
a few hours ago.

458
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,405
Ok.

459
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,375
So why don't you just
post it on your blog

460
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:15,677
And i'll read it
when i get a chance.

461
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,696
I know my blog
isn't exactly cnn.Com.

462
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,721
But a lot of your friends
and a lot of your customers
probably check it out.

463
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,487
And you know how
the internet is.

464
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,200
Once something
starts to spread...

465
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:27,326
What are you
talking about?

466
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,183
Here. I'll show you.

467
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:42,757
This is a video of me
rehearsing a fight
i had with my husband.

468
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,365
Yeah, you know,
i thought you would
say that.

469
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:45,461
Uh, the one problem is,

470
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,795
The video made my hamster
jump on the wheel, you know?

471
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:51,237
And, uh, remembered
these files

472
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:54,518
I kind of borrowed
from professor payne
a while back.

473
00:23:57,494 --> 00:23:58,312
They were encrypted,

474
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,362
And i'd given up
on trying to decode them

475
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,371
Until tonight.

476
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:04,290
What's in the files,
justin?

477
00:24:04,297 --> 00:24:05,950
In a nutshell?

478
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:07,993
You see ghosts.

479
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,031
And you believe that?

480
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:11,842
Not so much, really,
until i noticed

481
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:14,734
Something about the email
that the video
was attached to.

482
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,500
Whoever sent me this clip,
their computer doesn't have
an ip address.

483
00:24:18,514 --> 00:24:20,992
And in case you don't know,
that's not possible.

484
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,613
Not in this world,
at least.

485
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:23,989
The world of the living.

486
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:27,871
Wait a minute, um...

487
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:29,487
What is it
that you want, exactly?

488
00:24:29,493 --> 00:24:31,080
Well, in my business,

489
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:33,809
Usually when someone
sends this kind of message,

490
00:24:33,819 --> 00:24:35,459
Someone wants you
to stop looking

491
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:37,001
Wherever it is you're looking.

492
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:38,487
So you just wanted
to give me a warning?

493
00:24:38,492 --> 00:24:41,758
Yeah, and, uh, maybe a little
professional courtesy,

494
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,700
In case you find anything
interesting you want to share.

495
00:24:44,711 --> 00:24:46,354
Well, thanks...

496
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,883
For the warning.

497
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:49,929
Good night.

498
00:24:56,452 --> 00:24:57,944
You're welcome

499
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,532
Guilty, guilty,
i'm guilty!

500
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:03,237
What do you want from me?
I told you i'm guilty!

501
00:25:03,311 --> 00:25:04,545
What were you thinking?

502
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:06,349
Keeping records
of things that
i said to you,

503
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,055
Things that i told you
because i thought
that you could be trusted.

504
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,666
And don't even tell me
that they were encrypted,

505
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:13,255
Because we both know
how little that's worth.

506
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:13,781
All right, think back.

507
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,882
You come to me,
i don't know you
from adam.

508
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:18,182
And all the things
that i've been studying
and wondering about,

509
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,748
And between you and i,
starting to doubt,

510
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:20,406
All of a sudden
they're real?!

511
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:21,674
But why write it down?

512
00:25:21,746 --> 00:25:24,213
[Sighs] look, because
it was so amazing,

513
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,912
I had to make sure
i wasn't dreaming it!

514
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:27,154
This was huge stuff!

515
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:27,901
For you,
it's an old hat,

516
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,898
But let's not forget
that i'm an academic,

517
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,578
And you're sweet,
kind, caring,

518
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:33,253
Forgiving melinda,
right?

519
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:35,004
Don't i have an
obligation as my job

520
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:37,227
To write down
what i observe?

521
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:38,919
Remember, you're--

522
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,045
You're sweet, kind,
forgiving melinda.

523
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:43,420
Do you have any idea
what this could do
to my life?

524
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:46,267
Oh, come on, melinda!
What are you afraid of?

525
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,139
Everyone you help,
they already know
that you see ghosts!

526
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,148
I am afraid
of people like you.

527
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,287
Of becoming a case study

528
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,559
So that people can
understand things

529
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,062
That can't be
understood.

530
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,502
And while i'm under
that microscope,

531
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:57,864
I can't even help
the spirits that
actually need me.

532
00:25:57,908 --> 00:25:59,714
You've really
thought this through,
haven't you?

533
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:02,102
My whole life.

534
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,032
Hey, ned,
what's going on?

535
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:07,223
Is that ned?
Tell him i'm here.

536
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:08,732
It's professor payne, ned.
Put me on--

537
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,525
Ned, could you please
say that again,

538
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:13,164
Because i had
someone very annoying
distracting me.

539
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,907
Ned: lucy just told the school
she did all those hauntings.

540
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:17,384
The scoreboard,
the bleachers,

541
00:26:17,457 --> 00:26:19,757
The bat in krista's car,
everything.

542
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,640
What? Why would
she do that?

543
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:23,472
It's like she's trying
to protect thomas.

544
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:25,893
Thomas is a ghost.
What is she protecting him
from, purgatory?

545
00:26:25,938 --> 00:26:28,756
Wait, will you just
call me back if you get
anything else? Bye.

546
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,438
I don't get it.

547
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:31,972
Thomas says that
he's protecting her,

548
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:33,595
She's acting like
she's protecting him.

549
00:26:33,837 --> 00:26:35,881
What are they protecting
each other from?

550
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:36,778
Have you asked krista?

551
00:26:36,817 --> 00:26:38,853
No. She won't return
my phone calls.

552
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:40,203
All right, well,
ever since brad confessed,

553
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:42,733
Maybe she has
a lot less to hide.

554
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,218
Hi, krista,
i'm melinda.

555
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:49,383
I know who you are.

556
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:52,182
Um, i've been trying
to talk to you.

557
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:55,325
Wow. Do you have, like,
zero comprehension
of the word "no?"

558
00:26:55,372 --> 00:26:57,372
I do, but did thomas?

559
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,248
Thomas?

560
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,710
Yeah, i'm not trying to
blame you for anything.

561
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:01,851
I mean, i'm sure
if you hurt
thomas' feelings,

562
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:02,668
You didn't mean to.

563
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,529
No, i didn't do
anything to thomas.

564
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:07,832
Ok, we had a couple
conversations about bats.

565
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:08,458
That's it.

566
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:09,902
Well, you were
writing to each other.

567
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:11,960
It's no secret
that the two of you
were involved.

568
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:14,158
I mean,
the entire school
got that email.

569
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:16,687
No, those emails
weren't from thomas, ok?

570
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:18,525
So just drop it.

571
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:19,748
Well, how can you
be so sure?

572
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:21,734
They weren't even
signed.

573
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:24,827
Because, i've written back
since he died,

574
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:25,914
And...

575
00:27:25,953 --> 00:27:27,297
I haven't got a response yet,

576
00:27:27,338 --> 00:27:29,615
But whoever was writing me
opened them.

577
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:32,092
So if thomas wasn't
writing them, then who?

578
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:33,652
I don't know!

579
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,406
I gotta go.

580
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,112
Wait a minute.
So krista's protecting
thomas, too?

581
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,914
Protecting or stonewalling.

582
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,709
She's insisting those emails
were not from him.

583
00:27:45,755 --> 00:27:47,393
Or maybe she's just
embarrassed

584
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:50,251
That she was cheating
on her boyfriend
with guano boy.

585
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:52,047
I'm not calling names.

586
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,021
I'm just trying
to put it in perspective.
High school perspective.

587
00:27:55,067 --> 00:27:57,123
So assuming that krista
was telling the truth,

588
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:59,792
And if he wasn't
writing those emails,
who was?

589
00:27:59,837 --> 00:28:04,535
Maybe there's some clue
to who sent them
in the emails.

590
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:06,954
You're right!

591
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:08,407
You're right,
that's all
we have to do.

592
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:09,750
Do you still have
that email
on your phone?

593
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,478
The one the ghost
was texting everyone?

594
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:13,186
Yeah, but it didn't say much.
That's ok.

595
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:14,625
Little blogger
friend of mine

596
00:28:14,697 --> 00:28:16,731
Taught me that one
is all it takes.

597
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:24,466
Professor rick payne
in apologetic servitude.

598
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:25,104
Melinda: good.

599
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:26,450
I'm gonna forward you
an email,

600
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,808
And i need you
to use the ip address

601
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,379
To track down the location
of the computer that
originally sent then.

602
00:28:30,456 --> 00:28:32,128
Can you do that?
Sure.

603
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,230
Yeah, i mean i know a geek
who knows a geek.

604
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:35,770
I knew you would.

605
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,042
Remember to tell
your mom

606
00:28:39,122 --> 00:28:41,522
That we did not spend
the whole evening
talking about ghosts.

607
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,639
I helped you with
your homework, too.

608
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,538
Yeah, that was intense.

609
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,651
How much you know about
measuring volumes and planes.

610
00:28:49,117 --> 00:28:49,426
[Cell phone rings]
hello?

611
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:50,907
Rick: all right,
i can get you

612
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:53,165
The internet service provider
and the physical address

613
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,178
Of the computer's location.
No user name, though.

614
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,479
I would need
a court order for that.

615
00:28:57,523 --> 00:28:58,845
Yeah, but you've already
got the address?

616
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:00,037
Yeah, do you have a pen?

617
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:02,955
Uh, yeah. Ok,
write this down.

618
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:25,920
So whoever answers the door
sent those emails to krista?

619
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:28,716
I feel for him,
whoever he is.

620
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:34,056
Hi.

621
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:37,369
Lucy?

622
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,318
Yeah, this is
my house.

623
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,282
Are you looking
for someone else?

624
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,919
Not any more

625
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,989
Now's not really
a good time.

626
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,318
Lucy? Who is it?

627
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:53,792
Dad, this is
ned and melinda.

628
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,937
They're...from school.

629
00:29:58,057 --> 00:30:00,207
Why don't you
come inside?

630
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,049
Um, we're sorry
to bother you.

631
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,074
We were just hoping
that we could talk to
lucy for a few minutes.

632
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,254
What about?

633
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:12,927
This is
my wife jill.

634
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:13,946
This is melinda
and--

635
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:15,833
Ned. Hi.
Hi.

636
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,108
Is this about the trouble
lucy's in?

637
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:19,910
In a way.

638
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,131
It's ok. I can talk to them.
We'll just go outside.

639
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:23,452
No, i don't
think so, honey.

640
00:30:23,486 --> 00:30:25,894
Our daughter's
all but been branded
a serial killer

641
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:27,801
Because some kids
reprogrammed
the scoreboard.

642
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:28,719
Dad...

643
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:30,458
I don't believe
for a second
you did that.

644
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:33,138
I don't care what
you told the police
or your teachers.

645
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,780
Well, i actually believe
that lucy's innocent, also.

646
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:39,567
In fact, i know it.

647
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,241
Why don't we all
sit down?

648
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:49,401
How do you know that?

649
00:30:49,445 --> 00:30:52,037
It's about
the letters you wrote.

650
00:30:52,082 --> 00:30:53,203
Emails, actually.

651
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:58,069
The ones you wrote
to that kid you like.

652
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,000
That kid?

653
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,703
There's this girl
i was into.

654
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:06,754
If you're here
as someone concerned

655
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,598
About some inappropriate
relationships--

656
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,551
No, actually,
we're just here as friends.

657
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:13,240
They're here
because of thomas.

658
00:31:13,281 --> 00:31:14,576
Because he wasn't
ok with it.

659
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:16,392
Not really...anyway.

660
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,179
Lucy, what are you
talking about?

661
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:20,112
The night thomas died.

662
00:31:20,703 --> 00:31:21,732
"Meet me at 8:00.

663
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,014
"If you can't
make it, forget it.

664
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,231
I've waited
too long."
Signed krista.

665
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,778
Are you out
of your mind?

666
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:27,748
Where did you get that?

667
00:31:27,787 --> 00:31:29,698
You saved it on the hard drive.
The hard drive that we share.

668
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,342
It's private.

669
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,621
Krista eisenberg.

670
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:34,656
She is beautiful,
she's a senior,

671
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:37,174
And, oh, what's one
little key ingredient

672
00:31:37,218 --> 00:31:39,185
Missing in your wacky
lesbian fantasy?

673
00:31:39,228 --> 00:31:40,066
She's not gay.

674
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:42,357
We were posting
on the same blog!

675
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,637
She responded to me.
She wanted my email,

676
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:45,727
And she's the one
who kept it going.

677
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:47,022
But you never told her
who you are.

678
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:48,283
You never gave her
your name.

679
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,234
She likes me.

680
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:51,499
She doesn't even know
she's writing to a girl!

681
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:54,439
I think she does.
Oh, why?

682
00:31:54,485 --> 00:31:57,186
Because of little things
that she said.

683
00:31:57,232 --> 00:31:58,598
Different stuff
that you wouldn't understand.

684
00:31:58,638 --> 00:31:59,512
You can't do this.

685
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,722
Ok? You're comitting
social suicide.

686
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:05,307
Once she sees you,
she's gonna realize
that you tricked her,

687
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:06,805
And she's gonna
be pissed.

688
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:08,954
If she doesn't want
to be with me,
she can tell me,

689
00:32:08,997 --> 00:32:10,185
And i'll handle it.
Can you handle

690
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:12,232
What she's going
to write about you
in the slam book?

691
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:13,671
What her friends
are going to write
about you?

692
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:14,705
Once you're a target,

693
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,349
Everyone's gonna
take a shot.

694
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,748
People that don't
even know you.

695
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:20,358
They're gonna
terrorize you
every day.

696
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:22,632
For the rest
of high school.

697
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:26,715
Lucy, we have got
to undo this

698
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:28,993
Before it gets out.

699
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,167
We're supposed to meet.

700
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:34,362
I'll go.

701
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:36,212
Ok? I'll figure
something out.

702
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:37,762
Ok?

703
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,006
The whole thing
was a set up.

704
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:55,030
Forget her.

705
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:56,655
Why would krista
do that?

706
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:57,682
She's the one
who kept emailing.

707
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:58,587
She's the one
who wanted to meet.

708
00:32:58,626 --> 00:32:59,710
Why would she
send brad?

709
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:01,702
I don't--I don't know.
Maybe she got off of

710
00:33:01,744 --> 00:33:04,276
Makin' him, like...
jealous or something.

711
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:07,143
Or she thought
that, uh, maybe...

712
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:07,950
What?

713
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:08,774
I don't know,

714
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:11,317
That the whole thing
was just kind of a joke.

715
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,309
But your brother
was lying to you.

716
00:33:17,352 --> 00:33:19,778
Krista never even knew
about the meeting.

717
00:33:19,822 --> 00:33:21,592
What?
Brad never told her.

718
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,459
He sent that email
himself,

719
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,451
But he never
told krista that.

720
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:27,575
Why was thomas
so mad at krista?

721
00:33:28,095 --> 00:33:29,441
Because...

722
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:32,988
He thought she never
meant anything
she put in the emails.

723
00:33:33,036 --> 00:33:36,786
He was sure you were
getting set up.

724
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:41,206
He thought he was
protecting me.

725
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,321
He had my six.

726
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:47,104
Mom and dad,
i am so sorry.

727
00:33:47,146 --> 00:33:48,557
I should have never
let him go.

728
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:50,352
Oh, baby.

729
00:33:50,393 --> 00:33:52,201
No one meant
for it to happen.

730
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:54,380
No, the county is not
charging brad,

731
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:55,656
And they shouldn't.

732
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:57,267
It was all an accident.

733
00:33:57,308 --> 00:33:59,580
What about all those
things that happened
at the schl?

734
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:01,351
Are you saying
you did it because
you're angry?

735
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:03,243
No, your son was.

736
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:04,852
Lucy took the blame
for those things

737
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:08,165
Because she was tired
of everybody asking
what really happened.

738
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,869
Ok, now i'm really confused.

739
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:14,461
But lucy never was
confused.

740
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:17,016
She knew who she was,
and who she loved,

741
00:34:17,061 --> 00:34:19,199
And she wasn't
ashamed of it.

742
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:21,378
And mom and dad
were ok with that.

743
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:24,260
Just like they were ok
with me being the freak kid

744
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:26,099
Who hung out
with the bats all day.

745
00:34:26,141 --> 00:34:27,822
Thomas is here.

746
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,857
His spirit.

747
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:34,134
What are you talking about?

748
00:34:34,176 --> 00:34:38,628
He says that you loved
both of your children

749
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,743
Just for who they were.

750
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,158
They were cool
about everything,

751
00:34:45,165 --> 00:34:47,408
But they have no idea
what it's like now,

752
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,976
For anyone who's different.

753
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:52,597
They take a few words
and, like,oison
your whole world.

754
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,777
He's worried
about lucy.

755
00:34:54,823 --> 00:34:58,014
All the damage that
the internet can do,

756
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:00,470
Spreading
cruel words around.

757
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,629
I mean, look at my sister.

758
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:06,409
She's pretty, and smart,
and funny.

759
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,929
Everyone likes her.

760
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:10,507
No one had to know
that lucy was different.

761
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,122
He's saying
that you could have
blended in--

762
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:14,337
If you wanted to.

763
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,468
You mean if i chose to.

764
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:20,881
In my heart,
i wanted her to change.

765
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:25,007
But i was the one
that needed to change.

766
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:28,293
I was just trying
to look out for you,

767
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:32,327
But i realize now
that that's not
what you needed.

768
00:35:32,377 --> 00:35:37,186
What you needed was me
to see you and to love you
for who you are.

769
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,486
He loves you.

770
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,570
He always did.

771
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:51,740
And he doesn't
want you to be anything
but who you are.

772
00:35:54,464 --> 00:35:56,872
I love him, too.

773
00:35:58,425 --> 00:35:59,924
I love you, thomas.

774
00:36:04,994 --> 00:36:06,641
Come on.

775
00:36:12,262 --> 00:36:14,316
Do you see the light?

776
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:15,715
Not yet.

777
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:19,342
I got one or two things
to take care of first.

778
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,089
So now they think somehow

779
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,599
That the computer
on the scoreboard

780
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:56,456
Looped into
the school server,

781
00:36:56,498 --> 00:36:57,848
Like it was just
some wires that crossed,

782
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:59,621
Messed everything up.

783
00:36:59,662 --> 00:37:02,390
So thomas set things right.
That's great.

784
00:37:02,436 --> 00:37:03,484
Yeah.

785
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:05,247
And lucy's off the hook.

786
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,332
Excuse me.

787
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:14,985
Oh, man. She's pissed
about the ghost thing.

788
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,433
Do you want me
to go talk to her?

789
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:21,036
No, it's ok.
I can handle it.

790
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:32,145
Hey, mom?

791
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:35,870
Be mad at me, ok?

792
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:37,657
Not melinda.

793
00:37:39,096 --> 00:37:41,473
I'm the one
that pushed her to help.

794
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:44,837
I'm not mad
at anybody.

795
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,732
I'm just proud of you

796
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:50,567
For wanting
to help your friend.

797
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:51,876
Lucy?

798
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:54,856
She's not really my friend.
She called me "ted."

799
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:56,627
You see,
that's what i mean.

800
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:58,712
You didn't care what
anybody might call you.

801
00:37:58,755 --> 00:38:01,794
You still stuck
your neck out anyway.

802
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,124
Your sweet,

803
00:38:03,162 --> 00:38:04,164
Beautiful neck.

804
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:07,088
I used to kiss it
when i put you to bed.

805
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:11,824
That was just
a second ago, ned.

806
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,808
And now you're all
grown up.

807
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,157
I am...

808
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:21,396
So proud of the man
that you are becoming.

809
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:32,772
Lucy: hey.

810
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,018
Me?

811
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:35,689
Ned, yeah, hi.

812
00:38:36,991 --> 00:38:38,190
How have you been?

813
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,216
Good. Good, you know,

814
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:41,768
School, life.

815
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:46,488
Um, that was
a cool thing you did,

816
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:49,005
Telling me about
what you believe.

817
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:51,372
I know i didn't
make it easy.

818
00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:54,019
Do you want to sit?

819
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:56,785
Yeah. Yeah, ok.

820
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,536
So has your friend
seen my brother around?

821
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:05,968
No, but he might
still be here.

822
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,260
Usually she sees them
cross over.

823
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,083
Hey.

824
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,799
Hi.

825
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,629
I got your email.

826
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:22,270
My email?

827
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:24,041
Yeah?

828
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:30,641
Wait, don't tell me
that it wasn't for me.

829
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:32,086
This is weird enough
already.

830
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:36,088
No, i just--I didn't...

831
00:39:36,138 --> 00:39:40,056
Don't be shy.
Just admit it.

832
00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:45,384
The web works
in mysterious ways.

833
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:47,337
Wow.

834
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:53,043
Busted.

835
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:56,003
Thanks for all
your emails.

836
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,961
So you knew?

837
00:39:58,003 --> 00:39:58,699
Not for sure.

838
00:39:58,737 --> 00:40:01,979
But, um...
i hoped.

839
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:09,754
You did
a good thing.

840
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,533
I worry about her.

841
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,457
I don't.

842
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:18,232
She looks like
she has good friends.

843
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,303
The light...

844
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:34,225
What's it like in there?

845
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:39,875
I've heard good things.

846
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,313
But don't go by me.

847
00:40:43,112 --> 00:40:46,629
Maybe you should
go check it out
for yourself.

848
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:16,735
Justin.

849
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,717
Oh, uh...

850
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,000
Hey. Um,

851
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:23,683
I'm not stalking you,
i swear.

852
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,154
You said it, i didn't.

853
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:28,645
Ahh, did you ever find out
who emailed me that video
from the security camera?

854
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:29,330
Nope.

855
00:41:29,368 --> 00:41:32,097
It's like you said,
no ip address.

856
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:35,741
You got your secrets,
that's cool.

857
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:38,641
It's just, you know,
it's hard not ask about
the ones i know about.

858
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:41,470
Like your travels
underneath the town.

859
00:41:41,516 --> 00:41:42,356
In the tunnels

860
00:41:42,394 --> 00:41:45,936
Under our beloved,
perhaps haunted, town.

861
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,905
Is that professor payne's
theory?

862
00:41:47,948 --> 00:41:50,030
Look, i don't want
to out you.

863
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:52,317
Ok, i know what
that could do
to your life.

864
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,226
Why does this mean
so much to you?

865
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:57,086
Do you have some sort of thing
with the other side?

866
00:41:57,737 --> 00:41:59,258
Hmm.

867
00:42:01,005 --> 00:42:02,566
When the time comes,

868
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:07,254
Just remember,
i kept your secret.

869
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,571
What time is that?

870
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:21,803
When i call in the favor

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
