1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,930
you konw don't even call this a short walk

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,720
going for two miles next to the forest march

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,450
All right,we go to the base camp

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,420
i give you a nice massage

5
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,450
Hey, how nice is nice

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,610
how long would me marry you to get there?

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,510
What¡¯s the man doing in our tent

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,730
Who¡¯s that?

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,470
I don't know.

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,650
Wait a minute. Is she a¡ª

11
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,440
no,she's not a ghost. She's real.

12
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,320
She's a young girl.

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,390
But doesn't she
look kind of-

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,410
yeah. Something's not right.

15
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,110
There's not another campsite for miles.

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,580
Oh,we scared her.

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,040
No,wait!

18
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,100
Wait a minute!

19
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,370
Wait!

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,810
We don't want to hurt you!

21
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,270
We just want to help!

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,310
Wait!
Don't-

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,200
It's all right. Take it easy,ok?

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,060
Let me see your leg. I'm a paramedic.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,390
I can help you.

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,770
Let me just look at your leg,all right?

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,530
It's nothing.

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,810
It just needs to be cleaned and dressed.

29
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,930
Hey,uh,tell us your name.

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,220
You must be pretty scared,huh?

31
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,250
Are you in these woods all alone?

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,560
Tell you what. I'll make you a deal.

33
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,590
You come back with us to our camp,ok?

34
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,680
Get warm,have a good meal.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,540
I'll split this with you.

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,150
Ok. You can have the whole thing.

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,260
It's ok.

38
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,710
It wasn't very deep at all.

39
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,610
It should heal quickly.

40
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,560
You know,we really want to help you,

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,870
but you have to tell us
a few things first,like...

42
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,890
what's your name?

43
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,060
Where are your parents?

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,850
Are you lost?

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,130
Maybe if we talk to child services back in
town, they could give us some information-

46
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,490
becca.

47
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,410
- Your name's becca?
- yeah

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,100
Ok.

49
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,140
Becca,so...

50
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,190
what are you doing here?

51
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,820
Are you hiding from something?

52
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,270
I ran away.

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,320
What did you run away from?

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,790
Your parents?

55
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,720
I don't have any parents.

56
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,640
They're dead.

57
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,010
Do you live in a foster home?

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,060
How long have you been out here?

59
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,690
2 or 3 weeks.

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,470
We need to find out
where that foster home was

61
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,020
so that we can let them
know you're all right.

62
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,230
No.

63
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,710
Please. I don't want to go back there.

64
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,150
Well,we're going to do the
best we can to keep you safe,

65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,290
but we need to let the
police know that we found you.

66
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,760
Don't make me go back there.

67
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,150
I'm begging you.

68
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,230
You know,we don't get
any cell service out here,

69
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,860
and if we try to hike to the car,it
would be dark before we get there,so...

70
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,890
ok.

71
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,040
You're going to stay here with us.

72
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,000
We'll keep you safe.

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,940
I won't let you leave me.

74
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,630
What's going on?

75
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,330
What's happening to me?

76
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,770
hey, look at me, There's nothing here.

77
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,340
You're all right.

78
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,600
She's mine.

82
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,830
Becca,I know that you
don't really feel safe,

83
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,890
but trust me,you are.

84
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,390
I think the best thing for you is
just to get a good night's sleep.

85
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,180
I can'T.

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,940
Well,then,let's talk.

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,420
Do I have to?

88
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,690
I know that this is
going to sound strange...

89
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,720
but have you lost any
friends or family lately?

90
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,830
Why?

91
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm just trying to understand
why you're out here.

92
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,290
They hurt me. I left.

93
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,630
I'm not going back.

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,940
Ok.

95
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,770
Why these woods?

96
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,540
How have you been living out
here all this time by yourself?

97
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,060
I'm tired.

98
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,120
I'm going to go back to sleep.

99
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,390
Wait. Um,can you hang with me for a
minute,just till I fall back asleep?

100
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,330
Of course I will.

101
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,600
Hey,I didn't know you were so
good with teenage hard cases.

102
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,580
Well,it helps that I used to be one.

103
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,110
You? Come on.

104
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,920
Yeah. You remember that age.

105
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,510
You're always mad at your parents 'cause
they didn't understand who you were.

106
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,890
Well,take all that,add ghosts,and stir.

107
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,450
Do you think that's
what happened to becca?

108
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,550
Or maybe she was abused?

109
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,550
I don't know.

110
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,840
What did the ghost say about her?

111
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,870
He just said "she's mine. "

112
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,320
Well,maybe he could be a friend
or a brother who was also abused.

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,660
Could be.

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,740
Well,I guess we'll find out
when we know where she belongs.

115
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,430
What if we're just taking her right
back to the thing she's running from?

116
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,080
Don't really have a choice.

117
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,590
Honey.

118
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,450
No. Wake up.

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,150
Becca's gone.

120
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,420
What?

121
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,660
I left this in my backpack.

122
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,960
She must have found it in the tent.

123
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,270
Ok. So where could she have gone?

124
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,820
I don't know. Wherever
she went,she's staying,

125
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,000
'cause she took most of the food.

126
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,960
Oh,no.

127
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,820
What?

128
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,480
My car keys.

129
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,880
What?

130
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,400
Becca

131
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,750
Just watch out. She
might get some traction.

132
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,230
Becca!

133
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,660
Becca,stop it!

134
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,500
i'll try get this side

135
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,770
You can't go. I need you!

136
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,780
I won't let you go!

137
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,220
Go away!

138
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,920
Leave her alone!

139
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,040
Get out of the
car- right now.

140
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,330
Get out of the car.

141
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,210
You could have killed yourself.

142
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,010
What were you thinking?

143
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,520
You saw him,too.

144
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,520
You can see ghosts.

145
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,870
So,we'll go downtown later and see if
we can get some things that fit better.

146
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,140
So you're not going to
call the police or whoever?

147
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,510
Eventually,but if you need
some more time,for now...

148
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,070
do you need some help with that?

149
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,980
I know how to use a brush.

150
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,250
You know,when my grandma first
told me that she could see ghosts,

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,490
I should have said,"thank god.

152
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,250
You know,there's finally
someone else like me. "

153
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,960
All I could say was,"what
is wrong with my grandma?"

154
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,870
It might be something
you have to get used to.

155
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,070
So,you said that you
were hurt by people.

156
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,840
Mostly with words?

157
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,900
Yeah,mostly.

158
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,590
Who?

159
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,680
My foster parents.

160
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,060
What happened to your real parents?

161
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,830
They died in a car crash.

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,630
How old were you when they died?

163
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,190
I guess I was,like,5 or 6.

164
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,560
How old were you when
you started seeing ghosts?

165
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,970
I don't remember ever not seeing them.

166
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,510
What did you say to your
parents after they died?

167
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,240
After they died?

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,780
I never saw them.

169
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,120
Your parents didn't die,did they?

170
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,710
And you don't have foster parents.

171
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,420
You made it all up.

172
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,720
Look,you can tell me the truth.

173
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,310
If you do,I can help you.

174
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,150
And if you don't,then you're going to
go back home, and nothing's going to be-

175
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,320
they think I'm sick.

176
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,880
They take me to the doctors and
they try to make me take pills.

177
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,060
Ok. So then,we'll make them understand.

178
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,010
It won't work.

179
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,490
Well,you can't live in the woods
forever,and you don't have to.

180
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,010
Know how to make the ghosts go away?

181
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,750
I know something better.

182
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,920
Yeah,mom. I'm fine. I promise.

183
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,190
I don't know. Just,like,some
cuts and stuff,

184
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,090
but he's,like,an ambulance
guy,and he says I'm fine. So...

185
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,620
yeah,I know.

186
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,810
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,590
They'll be here tomorrow afternoon.

188
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,300
They live in a small
town outside st. Louis.

189
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,270
Well,what happens now?

190
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,330
Well,they just talked
to the grandview police,

191
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,170
who said nice things
about us,thank goodness,

192
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,060
so I guess she'll stay
here until they get here.

193
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,740
How did she get that far from home?

194
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,030
'Cause she's a smart girl.

195
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,320
She took a bus 5 or 6 days and
then got off here in grandview.

196
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,890
Ok. And how
about this-

197
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,700
another person who sees
ghosts chooses grandview.

198
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,940
Why does that keep happening?

199
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,930
I don't know,but I don't
have time to think about it.

200
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,560
Right,'cause you got
a ghost to cross over.

201
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
No. She does.

202
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,560
I have 24 hours to teach
that girl everything I know.

203
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,990
has you benn in a touch since you left home?

204
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,780
no*******

205
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,650
But the thing to remember is that
they're more scared and confused than you.

206
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,750
They're stuck here,for some reason,and
most of the time,they don't even know why.

207
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,320
and after you've figured out
why they've stayed earthbound,

208
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,360
you can help them,take care of them.

209
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,290
And they can cross over.

210
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,080
Cross over?

211
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,380
Yeah. Into the light.

212
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,870
So,how do you know it's a better place?

213
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,980
You ever been there?

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,720
No,but I've felt it.

215
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,500
There's peace there,and knowing that I
gave them that,there's nothing better.

216
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,440
Hey. You must be becca.

217
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm delia.

218
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,850
It's ok,honey. I won't bite.

219
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,450
I hear that you are a very special girl.

220
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,000
Uh,you know what? There's some really
cool vintage dresses over there.

221
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,740
Why don't you take a look?

222
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,830
Melinda,you know that I believe
that you do amazing things.

223
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,850
I have seen you change
people's lives again and again.

224
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,350
- But this-
- what?

225
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,170
Do you really think the
best way to help this girl-

226
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,990
Is to give her a crash
course in being you?

227
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,230
Delia,she's not just running
away from her parents.

228
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,060
She's running away from ghosts.

229
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,190
Can't you teach her
how not to be afraid?

230
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,010
I can't stop her from seeing them,

231
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,600
which means that I can't stop them
from going to her with their problems.

232
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,600
Have you ever tried walking around with
a crowd of dead people following you?

233
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,400
It's not fun.

234
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,870
Didn't you say your mom had
this gift,and she lived with it?

235
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,420
Trust me,that is not a good argument.

236
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,240
Melinda?

237
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,920
Yeah. I'll be right there.

238
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,730
Look,I had my grandmother,ok?

239
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,640
Becca has no one but
parents who don't understand.

240
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,870
I have to teach her
how to cross them over.

241
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,430
I'm not going to let her
turn out like gabriel¡ª

242
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,850
overmedicated and institutionalized.

243
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,610
Becca!

244
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,500
Look,I'm sorry,ok?

245
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,530
I know that this is hard.

246
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,740
You don't have to apologize.

247
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,600
I should be used to seeing them.

248
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,650
You have to stop running away from them,

249
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,140
else they're going to keep finding you.

250
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,840
You think I don't know that?

251
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,160
Look,that's why you
have to face them,ok?

252
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,480
You just have to find
out what they need.

253
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
It will make them stop.

254
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,820
Ok. I'll try.

255
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,550
Let's start with his name.

256
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,150
Did he give you that?

257
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,050
I think it's daniel.

258
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,770
Has he said anything about how he died?

259
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,430
Um,I think he was in
some kind of accident.

260
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,880
He said there were bodies around.

261
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,450
Was there a fire? 'Cause he
looked e'like hd been burned.

262
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,540
Honestly,I try not to look.

263
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,230
He talked about that,too.

264
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,920
Ok. I see it a little bit,but
for her to be your mini-me,

265
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,300
her hair would have
to be a lot different.

266
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,860
This is my friend rick payne.

267
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,390
He's a professor.
He's also-

268
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,870
oh,my gosh! Those eyes!

269
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,000
Look at those eyes with that
"don't even try lying to me,

270
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,000
'cause I can literally see
right through you" look!

271
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,340
- A little strange?
- Yes.

272
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,490
The resemblance is uncanny.

273
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,910
Ok. The ghost.

274
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,850
He's a boy,about becca's
age. His name is daniel.

275
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,280
There was an accident in the woods.

276
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,990
There were lots of bodies
around,so I'm thinking...

277
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,290
last year plane crash.

278
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,890
Yeah,he probably wandered off, got
separated from the rest of the passengers.

279
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,580
Yeah. The woods are not
far from the crash site.

280
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,720
Well,that would explain the bodies.

281
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,960
And the burns on his face.

282
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,250
Ok. Well,I'll check the manifest.

283
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,470
I'll see if his name turns up.

284
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,050
What about the voices?

285
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,970
What voices?

286
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,680
In your basement.

287
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,110
Didn't you hear them?

288
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,240
No,not really.

289
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,380
Wait a minute. You can hear
voices that melinda can't?

290
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,180
That would make her
more powerful than you.

291
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,540
No. That's just how it works.

292
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,810
In the beginning,you get everything¡ª

293
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,770
you get voices,ghost energy,all of it.

294
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,870
And then,eventually,you learn to tune
certain things out so you can function.

295
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,830
Whatever she's hearing,it's
probably coming from the tunnels.

296
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,190
Do you still have that giant
hole in the wall in your basement?

297
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,420
What tunnels?

298
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,060
Oh,you don't want to
know about the tunnels.

299
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,700
Well,why not? What's under there?

300
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,510
What's under there? More
like who's under there.

301
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,440
More accurately,who isn't under there.

302
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,620
The amount of
trapped souls-

303
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,580
ok. You know what?

304
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,080
Maybe she should focus on the ghost that's
haunting her right now,don't you think?

305
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,340
Yeah,ok-yes.
I do.

306
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,330
What's my job again?

307
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,950
Check the plane manifest.

308
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,120
Ok.

309
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,550
You and I have a field trip to go on.

310
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,700
come on,Let's go find daniel.

311
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,570
Why?

312
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,720
Because this is probably
near where he died.

313
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,730
It will help him remember what happened.

314
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,470
But why look for him at all?

315
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,360
I mean,he hasn't bugged me
in hours. Maybe he's finished.

316
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,660
No,he's not finished
until he crosses over-

317
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,200
until we help him cross over.

318
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,160
How many times did I tell you?

319
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,910
I don't like being left behind!

320
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,590
Becca,talk to him.

321
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,500
Find out what he needs.

322
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,910
Please,don't go.

323
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,110
Ask him what's keeping him here.

324
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,450
Why won't you just leave me alone?

325
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,740
They left me here.

326
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,790
They never said a word!

327
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,670
Were they punishing me?

328
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,320
What was I supposed to think?

329
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,810
Who? Daniel,who left you here?

330
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,020
Who is she,anyway?

331
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,580
I don't like her.

332
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,510
Becca,find out what's keeping him here.

333
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,980
I don't care.

334
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,910
I hate him! I want him to go away!

335
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,930
i'm burning

336
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,420
Hey,what do you see?

337
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,090
Daniel,talk to me,all right?

338
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,880
I want to help you.
She wants to help you!

339
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,790
She doesn't want to help me!

340
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,510
Why should I help her?

341
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,810
Well,then,stop hurting her,all right?

342
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,320
Let her go.

343
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,490
Hey.

344
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,080
What happened?

345
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,900
I was on fire!

346
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,520
It was horrible.

347
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,680
Look,I know how painful this is,ok?

348
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,270
But look at me.

349
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,530
I'm right here. We're ok.

350
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,600
There's a reason that he
told you all of that. Ok?

351
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,290
He was trying to tell
you what happened to him,

352
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,580
and with that,you can cross him over.

353
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,420
I don't care.

354
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,360
Yes,you do.

355
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,200
You want to help him and yourself.

356
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,660
I don't care about
daniel or any of them!

357
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,240
You can't give up.

358
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,040
Yes,I can!

359
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,220
I'm done.

360
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,330
I'm never going to do that again.

361
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,180
Still not hungry?

362
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,610
You know,your parents are
going to be here tomorrow,

363
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,080
so we don't really have much time.

364
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,410
Has a ghost ever done
anything like this to you?

365
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,250
I've seen weird things before.

366
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,190
No one's ever tried to hurt me.

367
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,580
I know how awful this is.

368
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,850
But the vision,it'S...

369
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,680
sometimes the only way they can
tell you that they need your help.

370
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,320
But why should i help daniel when
all he tries to do is scare me?

371
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,190
Look... I know that this is not fair.

372
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,930
Most kids don't have to think about
death until they're much older.

373
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,790
But you and me?

374
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,920
Our lives are different.

375
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,850
You want a reason why
you should help daniel?

376
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,100
One is because if you
don't,he'll never leave you alone.

377
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,920
But the real reason is because you can.

378
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,900
Ok.

379
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,020
But how?

380
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,710
The vision.

381
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,100
Tell me everything you saw.

382
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,930
There were bodies on the ground.

383
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,940
I'm right here.

384
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,990
I was on fire.

385
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,890
You mean daniel was.

386
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,210
At first,his skin hurt really bad.

387
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,080
Then,he couldn't feel anything.

388
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,050
There was metal burning.

389
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,210
And tires.

390
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,690
And there were cars.

391
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,060
They looked like tinfoil
somebody punched really hard.

392
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,050
One of them was on fire.

393
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,470
I think that one was daniel'S.

394
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,040
Can you see a license plate number?

395
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,980
There were
letters. M-I-Y...

396
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,880
the number 8.

397
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,620
Hey...

398
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,140
becca.

399
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,070
No. You did great.

400
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,780
You know what? Let's get out of here.

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,960
What do you think?

402
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,050
Let's go...

403
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,160
walk amongst the living
for a little while.

404
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,010
Can I just be alone?

405
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,200
Sure.

406
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,930
Hey,melinda?

407
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,040
Were you ever scared?

408
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,840
It's never been easy.

409
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,080
But I had someone
who... made me feel brave.

410
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,050
I hope I can do that same thing for you.

411
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,490
Hey.

412
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,290
How'd the open house
for the new listing go?

413
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,640
Oh,people loved the cookies,but
not bites on the house.

414
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,350
I brought leftovers.

415
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,990
Thanks for covering.

416
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,270
Where's becca?

417
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,420
She's at home resting.

418
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,550
Jim's there.

419
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,550
How's she doing?

420
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,920
We made some progress.

421
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,090
I think I know who the
little boy in the woods is.

422
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,880
He's looking for his parents.

423
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,180
2 cars hit
head-on,causing a pile-up.

424
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,340
There were 5
fatalities,including a family¡ª

425
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,700
becca had seen their
license plate in a vision¡ª

426
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,900
a mother,father,and a 13-year-old
boy named daniel asher.

427
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,650
That's terrible.

428
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,730
Daniel died at the scene.

429
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,610
And his parents died
later at the hospital.

430
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,720
You know,maybe they just saw
the light and went right into it.

431
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,730
And he's just been
waiting there ever since?

432
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,240
He thinks they're still alive?

433
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,580
I'm not sure.

434
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,270
But he needs to know that they've
gone,and he should join them.

435
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,580
With any luck,becca will be
able to convince him of that.

436
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,630
It would really help them both.

437
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,860
You know what? I really have to go.

438
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,910
Hey.

439
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,970
You're back!

440
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,240
That's so great.

441
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,470
Um,you could come meet my parents.

442
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,870
So,I was telling them all
about how you helped me.

443
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,220
Now,I admit that I was just
pretending to see ghosts,

444
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,580
just like you did when you
were my age for attention.

445
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,820
Melinda. I'm joan cahill,becca's mom.

446
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,250
I don't even know what to say.

447
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,120
Honestly,I don't,either.

448
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,050
Honey,the cahills were able
to get an earlier flight.

449
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,500
Um,this is tony.

450
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,820
Tony,this is my wife melinda.

451
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,710
Thank you for saving our daughter-
our whole family,actually.

452
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,740
Well,I don't know if I really helped.

453
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,060
You did.

454
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,830
Look,I don't know how
you got through to her,

455
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,920
but these things that she was
imagining,we didn't know what to do.

456
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,770
Frankly,I felt like we'd lost
her long before she ran away.

457
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,230
But... you're back now. Right,sweetheart?

458
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,170
Things are going to be a-ok.

459
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,230
Yeah. A-ok,again.

460
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,170
Thanks for not busting me.

461
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,190
So,what are you going to do now?

462
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,470
Every time you see a
ghost,just ignore it?

463
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,110
Kind of already tried that.

464
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,200
- Yeah,but it will be easier now.
- How?

465
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,170
'Cause I know it's not my fault.

466
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,860
Before,I thought I had
something bad in me.

467
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,970
I was making them come
to me and nobody else.

468
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,720
They come to you
because you can see them.

469
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,740
And because they need your help.

470
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,630
Look,this is who you really are.

471
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,760
It's who we both are.

472
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,780
No.

473
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm not brave enough.

474
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,100
You comfortable,sweetie?

475
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,590
You can't hear a word
I'm saying,can you?

476
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,440
I could sleep for about
100 years,you know?

477
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,400
Should we try to get a
later flight tomorrow?

478
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,070
No. Let's get home.

479
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,120
Thank god,we can throw these away now.

480
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,170
What were we doing,making
her take these?

481
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,990
Joan,wait...

482
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,000
she wasn't hallucinating.

483
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,110
She never actually saw anything.

484
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,030
I know. I hope it's
over,but just in case...

485
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
it's not just about becca.

486
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,310
It's about that little boy in the woods
waiting on parents that will never come back.

487
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,070
Yeah,but becca knows
about the light now.

488
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,420
So maybe she's able to help him.

489
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,470
And he knows about you.

490
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,800
He can come to you.

491
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,700
And what about the ghost
that haunts her after that?

492
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,410
And then,the one after that?

493
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,590
Honey,no one could have
helped her more than you did.

494
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,730
Yeah.

495
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,540
That's what kills me.

496
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,170
No. Get away from them.

497
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,380
I'd give anything just to
be with my parents again.

498
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,040
Oh! No,no. Why can't
you just leave me alone?

499
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,270
Because then I'd be alone,too.

500
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,900
How'd you like it if I left
you in the dark in those woods?

501
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,060
I begged you to.

502
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,670
But you didn't mean it.

503
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,760
Why can't you just be my friend?

504
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,130
Because you're dead!

505
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,490
You'd be dead,too,if I didn't
help you find food and water.

506
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,810
I looked out for you.

507
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,610
Every night,I was there,and you knew it.

508
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,000
Ok. Fine. You watched over me. Thanks.

509
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,420
Now,go,please.

510
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,070
I'm still protecting you.

511
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,010
What's that supposed to mean?

512
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,730
Someone knows about you
and your friend. That lady.

513
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,400
- He found me,and he'll find you,too.
- Who?

514
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,510
I'm not sure.

515
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,290
He wanted me to come
with him,but I wouldn'T.

516
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,750
He said he knows where
they're keeping my parents.

517
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,340
I don't understand.

518
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,930
Melinda knows things.
You should go to her.

519
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,040
No. She just wants to send me away
so I'll never see my parents again.

520
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,600
Becca...

521
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,410
please.

522
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,360
You have to help me. only you hear voices

523
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,760
Why don't you let me finish that up,huh?

524
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,840
Go on up.

525
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,360
that's weird

526
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,630
- Hey.
- We are so sorry to bother you.

527
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,240
Is becca here?

528
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,530
Please tell us she's here.

529
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,080
No,she's not.

530
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,490
Oh,god.

531
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,070
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

532
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,410
Um,we were tired. We fell asleep.

533
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,140
Probably 3 hours ago.

534
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
We already called the police.

535
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,210
I woke up freezing.

536
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,290
It always seemed so cold
right before I hear her scream.

537
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,650
Becca gets night terrors.

538
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,800
And this time,she didn't
call out. She was just gone.

539
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,214
becca say anything? Was
she talking to anyone?

540
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:31,315
I heard her whisper something.

541
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:32,266
She went into the bathroom.

542
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:34,367
She does that sometimes when
she's trying to hide from us.

543
00:27:34,418 --> 00:27:35,708
Yeah,but does she say anything?

544
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:38,979
I buried my head in the
pillow. I couldn't listen.

545
00:27:39,011 --> 00:27:41,131
Ok. She was probably talking to daniel.

546
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:43,562
And if she went with him,then
she's trying to cross him.

547
00:27:43,593 --> 00:27:44,543
I'm sorry. Cross him?

548
00:27:44,584 --> 00:27:45,804
Just take them to the police,all right?

549
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:47,304
- I'm going to go to the woods.
- You got it.

550
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:49,395
Excuse me. What the hell is going on?

551
00:27:49,446 --> 00:27:51,476
You know what? I'm really sorry
to have to throw this at you,

552
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:54,257
but your daughter's been
trying to tell you for years.

553
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,869
You've tried pills.
You've tried doctors.

554
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,980
The only thing you 2 never
tried was believing her.

555
00:28:00,452 --> 00:28:03,092
Your daughter sees ghosts,ok?

556
00:28:04,864 --> 00:28:07,734
And I know that because I see them,too.

557
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
Look,you both have to understand
that my wife has lived her entire life

558
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:19,941
having people tell her she's crazy.

559
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:23,453
And maybe right now,you
think she is,too.

560
00:28:24,655 --> 00:28:28,435
But I'll tell you,she's the only chance
you have of getting your daughter back.

561
00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:52,299
You can hear it too,right?

562
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,210
This is where melinda
said the trapped souls are.

563
00:28:58,093 --> 00:28:59,903
It sounds like they're hurting.

564
00:28:59,964 --> 00:29:01,574
That's why we have to hurry.

565
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:13,171
Hello?

566
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:14,321
This is guardian-safe.

567
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:16,852
There's been an alarm activation
at your place of business.

568
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:19,283
Would you like us to
dispatch the police?

569
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:20,895
The tunnels.

570
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,615
Sorry,ma'am,I didn't hear you.

571
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:24,646
Would you like us to
dispatch the police?

572
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:27,077
No,no,no. It's my husband.

573
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:28,819
Sometimes he forgets
how the alarm works.

574
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,710
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

575
00:29:34,193 --> 00:29:36,143
What? What?

576
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:41,345
- What?
- Hey.

577
00:29:41,396 --> 00:29:44,046
In the square this afternoon,when
you told becca about the tunnels,

578
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:46,638
didn't you tell her that she could
get to them through the basement?

579
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:48,789
Oh,gee whiz. You know,I really
thought there was going to be a

580
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,460
"sorry I woke you
up,professor" mixed in there.

581
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:52,462
She's in trouble,ok?

582
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:55,642
She ran away from her parents after
they heard her talking to someone.

583
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:56,654
Was it the ghost daniel?

584
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,465
No,room service.

585
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:02,196
Well,we know she heard us talking about
the hole in the wall in your basement.

586
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:03,748
But why would they go into the tunnels?

587
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:05,538
Because you told her that there
were spirits trapped there.

588
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,749
Maybe she and daniel think it's
the best way to get to his parents.

589
00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:09,531
And by the way,the store
alarm just went off.

590
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:13,082
- Oh,boy. Sounds like daniel's up to his old tricks again.
- What?

591
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:16,914
Remember,you asked me to
read up on the accident?

592
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:20,176
Well,the post mortem report says
that that kid's blood alcohol level

593
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:22,367
was a few notches above schnockered.

594
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:23,799
So,he was drunk?

595
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:24,809
Very.

596
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,417
I think your parents are down there.

597
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:43,348
Look,if you're scared,you
don't have to do this.

598
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,740
You can just go.

599
00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:49,232
I'll go alone.

600
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:51,513
You could get hurt.

601
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:53,144
I won't leave you.

602
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,946
We can do this.

603
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:31,105
Becca,you here?

604
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:48,434
Becca?

605
00:31:53,197 --> 00:31:54,397
Becca?

606
00:31:54,418 --> 00:31:55,818
Daniel?

607
00:32:24,624 --> 00:32:25,744
Becca?

608
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:33,248
Becca!

609
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:38,591
Becca?

610
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:40,512
Daniel?

611
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:46,966
Becca?

612
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:02,723
mom, dad? are you here?

613
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,155
She's here,another one.

614
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:17,251
mom? dad?

615
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,568
Are those your parents?

616
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:32,059
You. Is it over?

617
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:33,271
Can I go now?

618
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:34,391
Who are you?

619
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:36,752
He has a gun.

620
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,822
Why did you all come here?

621
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:58,463
How did you find this place?

622
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:06,118
It still hurts.

623
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:07,879
We were promised.

624
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:11,191
You said...

625
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:12,792
he promised.

626
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:19,715
Becca,I'm scared.

627
00:34:19,756 --> 00:34:22,076
Who are all these people?

628
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,063
Melinda,see?

629
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:56,664
Just a few stitches
and you're all better.

630
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:02,857
And we can stop somewhere
special on the way home.

631
00:35:07,102 --> 00:35:08,892
oh, melinda

632
00:35:11,264 --> 00:35:13,044
It's ok,honey.

633
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:15,275
They're just upset.

634
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:18,146
Erwe we supposed to help.

635
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:20,578
I can't understand them.

636
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:22,079
There's too many voices.

637
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,310
I know.

638
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:27,051
But if you try,you can
hear what's important,

639
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:31,533
the one soul that we need
to hear most at that moment.

640
00:35:33,126 --> 00:35:37,066
All we have to do is
listen with our hearts.

641
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,100
Where is he?

642
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:45,731
I can't find him!

643
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:50,964
Sweet girl,can you help me?

644
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:53,495
I need to find my husband.

645
00:36:01,631 --> 00:36:05,911
Daniel? I'm here.

646
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,590
i'm here. It's ok.

647
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,980
No,it's not.

648
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:21,291
We can't find my parents.

649
00:36:21,322 --> 00:36:22,642
I know.

650
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:24,173
I did.

651
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:25,353
I listened for them.

652
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:27,034
Then,I heard them calling for you.

653
00:36:27,075 --> 00:36:29,775
- Daniel? honey
- Daniel? Where is he?

654
00:36:29,816 --> 00:36:30,966
Daniel!

655
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,707
I've been waiting for you for so long.

656
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,620
It's ok.

657
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:39,131
You can go to them.

658
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,592
Daniel,what's wrong?

659
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:43,673
Daniel. Come.

660
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:46,834
You said they'd never leave you.

661
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,976
But you didn't believe that,did you?

662
00:36:51,198 --> 00:36:54,368
Not after what happened that
night before the accident.

663
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,980
It's my fault.

664
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,530
We never would have been in
that car if I didn't screw up.

665
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:03,063
My friend levi's
parents were out of town.

666
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,514
We all said we were sleeping
at someone else's house.

667
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:09,566
And we snuck into their liquor cabinet.

668
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:13,848
We went outside and started
taking out some mailboxes.

669
00:37:18,773 --> 00:37:20,813
Someone called the police.

670
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:22,174
And then they called us.

671
00:37:22,225 --> 00:37:26,395
At 2 A.M.,We're picking our
13-year-old up from the police station.

672
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:29,257
Blaming ourselves,each other.

673
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,808
Arguing over who was supposed
to follow up with levi's parents,

674
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,910
still thinking every
mistake could be avoided.

675
00:37:35,942 --> 00:37:39,562
If I hadn't done that,if you
weren't so tired and worried-

676
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:42,654
daniel! That car swerved into our lane.

677
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:43,926
Dad!

678
00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:46,276
It wasn't your fault.

679
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:50,098
And even if it was,we
would never leave you.

680
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,010
Then where were you?

681
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:54,061
Your parents died at the hospital.

682
00:37:54,092 --> 00:37:56,192
We didn't understand what happened.

683
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:58,973
How could we still be here and you not?

684
00:38:00,055 --> 00:38:01,755
And then,we met a man who...

685
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:03,206
told us he could bring us to you.

686
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:04,877
A man. Who are you talking about?

687
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:09,117
He didn't say his name- only that
we shouldn't go into the light.

688
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,990
If we did,our son would be lost forever.

689
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:14,972
We're together now.

690
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,465
Do you see it?

691
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,917
It's so beautiful.

692
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:26,618
Daniel.

693
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,539
Come.

694
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:31,281
I can'T.

695
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:34,182
I don't see it.

696
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:35,143
He needs your help.

697
00:38:35,184 --> 00:38:36,624
But how? What's keeping him here?

698
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:39,315
Just listen with your heart. Ok?

699
00:38:39,346 --> 00:38:41,386
You'll find the answer.

700
00:38:44,649 --> 00:38:46,499
He's staying behind because of me.

701
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,240
I've already hurt my family so bad.

702
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,051
I don't want to leave and hurt you.

703
00:38:51,072 --> 00:38:53,192
- Daniel,it's ok-
- it's not.

704
00:38:54,004 --> 00:38:55,614
We know that now.

705
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:57,715
Look around this place.

706
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:03,457
Who's going to watch
over you in the dark?

707
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,619
Daniel,if you do this...

708
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,350
you'll be helping
becca. You-

709
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:11,192
you'll prove to her that
there's nothing to be afraid of.

710
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:14,393
Come on,daniel. Just try.

711
00:39:14,915 --> 00:39:16,605
See the light.

712
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:19,297
For me.

713
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:32,224
Look at that.

714
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:34,445
Mom.

715
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:36,526
Dad.

716
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,067
I see it.

717
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,091
Take care of her,will you?

718
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:50,463
Yes. Yes,I will.

719
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:09,253
We want to believe you.

720
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,595
You have no idea how much.

721
00:40:12,646 --> 00:40:14,886
But it almost seems impossible.

722
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,108
If you need help explaining anything...

723
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:19,489
dad...

724
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:25,451
there's someone... a man.

725
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:28,093
He's been wanting me to
tell you both something.

726
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,195
He's been asking for a long time.

727
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:37,157
I was scared of him at
first because he looked...

728
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:42,111
he said he died of an aneurysm.

729
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:44,732
He said you're married because of him.

730
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:46,894
She's talking about larry.

731
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:50,325
He introduced us,but becca,he
died before you were even born¡ª

732
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,937
he wanted you guys to meet for so long.

733
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,658
But you guys just kept on saying no.

734
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,610
And he just kept saying¡ª

735
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,691
Have a little faith.

736
00:41:32,169 --> 00:41:33,499
what if I don't know how they died,

737
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,350
or what if I don't know what
it is they're really missing?

738
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:39,121
- What if it just-
- hey,relax. Ok?

739
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,213
I just saw you do it.

740
00:41:41,294 --> 00:41:43,474
I didn't tell you what
it was that daniel needed.

741
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:46,635
You just listened with your heart.

742
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,737
Yeah.

743
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,377
Can I ask you something?

744
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:54,238
When you were running away,why
did you stop here,in grandview?

745
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:56,531
I don't know,just a feeling.

746
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:59,712
The bus stopped,and
something told me to get off.

747
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:02,244
- It was just-
- something you had to do.

748
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:03,805
Yeah.

749
00:42:06,087 --> 00:42:08,087
well,you know where to find me.

750
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:33,421
I wasn't sure if you were still in town.

751
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:35,952
Something told me you were.

752
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:39,394
Is it really worth it,gabriel?

753
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:43,005
To break up families just
for a few extra souls?

754
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:45,417
I mean,what could you
possibly need them for?

755
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:48,079
It's not just about gaining
or losing a few extra souls.

756
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,640
Of course not,unless you
happen to be one of them.

757
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,301
As usual,you're missing the big picture.

758
00:42:52,342 --> 00:42:53,742
What is the big picture?

759
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:55,503
'Cause you're just a collector.

760
00:42:55,524 --> 00:42:59,244
And please,don't stand there and pretend
like you're doing something noble.

761
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,657
Wait a minute.

762
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,049
You didn't want them,did you?

763
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,390
You wanted her.

764
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:11,971
That's what drew her here,the
same thing that drew you.

765
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:17,845
Please,don't do this.

766
00:43:18,476 --> 00:43:20,776
You have a real choice.

767
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:23,478
You could work with me,and we can
free all of those souls down there-

768
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:26,449
sorry. I picked another horse.

769
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:27,821
He's much faster than you.

770
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:30,071
Then what are you doing here?

771
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:31,823
You're my sister.

772
00:43:32,464 --> 00:43:33,764
And you have a choice too.

773
00:43:33,785 --> 00:43:34,635
What does that mean?

774
00:43:34,665 --> 00:43:37,665
It means don't be so sure
you have all the answers.

9999
