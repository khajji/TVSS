1
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,900
Alan Milliken's prescription bottle turned up with Sherry's fingerprints on it.

3
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:24,099
I can call Foxton.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,299
He can make this all disappear.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,200
All you have to do is give me the ok.

6
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:29,100
David put you up to this, didn't he?

7
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:29,800
Sherry, I¡­

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,099
The police think I killed Alan

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,800
Well, I told you to keep your mouth shut

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,500
It's nobody's fault but your own

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,100
Oh, my God. Sherry.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,700
No.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:00,500
You committed treason. You facilitated the escape of a man
who is responsible for the death of Ryan Chappelle and almost a thousand civilians.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,300
With luck, the best you can hope for is 20 years

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,700
Tell me how to find your couriers, Stephen

16
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:08,499
Or I am going to put her in that building

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,700
You wouldn't dare. She has nothing to do with this

18
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,500
Neither do the people in those body bags

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,300
When your daughter is infected, I am going to make you watch her die

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,699
Dad, stop them

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,099
Stephen, you are out of time

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,800
Stop, stop, stop, I will tell you

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,800
Where's the 11th vial?

24
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:25,699
Los Angels

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,199
What's the target?

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,300
His instruction were to select a public place where maximum casualties would be inflicted.

27
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,600
The target has stopped moving

28
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:34,400
The target has stopped

29
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,099
Drop the bag

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,000
Get on the ground, now. Don't move

31
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,100
Where is it?

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,200
Where's what?

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,900
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

34
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:43,300
Chase

35
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,300
What are you guys doing, what's going on?

36
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:46,100
I have got the signal.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,400
What are you looking for?

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,199
It's just a transmitter

39
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
He's put it on an innocent. This man is not Rabens.

40
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,700
Shut the station down now

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
The following takes place
between 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,050
This is Dessler

43
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,275
Michelle, it's Jack

44
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:09,499
We just lost Rabens

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,100
He dumped the GPS beacon onto an innocent.

46
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,099
Which means he still has the virus?

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,300
We have to assume so. He couldn't have gotten very far.
We are sweeping the station now.

48
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:18,000
We have locked down the entire building

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,500
We are gonna start moving passengers through monitored checkpoints.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,899
How will you find Rabens?

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,200
We still don't have a sketch on him.

52
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,499
We need Saunders to make an I.D.

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,599
I want you to move him over from holding to Chloe's station.

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,000
We are sending up a live feed, you should have it in a few minutes.

55
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:30,400
Ok, we will be ready on our end.

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,300
Michelle, Gael Ortega's wife Theresa is here

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
All right, Jesse, send her in

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,700
According to Chloe's statement, you were working in parallel to bring down Saunders,
even while you were complying with his demands.

59
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,099
Yeah, that's right

60
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,399
I, I gave Chloe a recording of a conversation between Saunders and myself

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,900
Chloe also said you intentionally scrambled the voice to slow down her progress.

62
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,700
Tony, did you put Michelle's life ahead of public safety or national security?

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,100
Yes, I did

64
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,300
They said he was exposed to a virus

65
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah, that's right

66
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,100
Did he suffer?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, no, he went quickly

68
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,700
Gael

69
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
He was a hero

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,300
He tried to stop the virus from being released,
and when it was, he just kept working

71
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,400
Till the end.

72
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,900
Thank you

73
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,500
Thank you

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,700
Can I pick up his things

75
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Of course

76
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,800
I will go see what I can do

77
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,800
Ok

78
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,200
Wait here

79
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,699
Kim

80
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,500
Yes, Michelle

81
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,400
That's Mrs. Ortega. Gael's wife

82
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,500
I need you to take her to his station, pick up his personal belongings.

83
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:56,199
Sure

84
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,800
Thank you

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,700
Sit him down

86
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,100
Hello

87
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,299
Kim, I need you

88
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,600
Saunders is here to I.D. Rabens.

89
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,499
Well, I am with Mrs. Ortega.

90
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,600
Michelle said I could reassign anyone I wanted to help me,
and I want you, so please don't make me ask again.

91
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,800
Fine. I will get Barry to watch her

92
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,850
Barry

93
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah

94
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Please watch Mrs. Ortega while she gathers Gael's things.

95
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,999
Sure.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Take as much time as you need.

97
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,900
Thanks

98
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,200
Excuse me, Barry

99
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,600
Can I get a signature?

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,700
Oh, sure

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
Thanks

102
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,000
Anything else?

103
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,200
No, that's it

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,900
Sir. If you will just step up to the line

105
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,300
Right here

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,100
Chin up, please, sir

107
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,000
Chin up.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Move in closer on 2A

109
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,300
Yeah, Jack, it's me

110
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,400
Any matches, Michelle?

111
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,299
No, nothing yet

112
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,499
- How far have you got?
- 4C

113
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,300
So far, we have gone through the 1st 2 sets of photos.

114
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,000
Next group is uploading now. Stand by.

115
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,100
It's not him.

116
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,000
Is there anything on this page?

117
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,400
3B, closer up

118
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,300
No. That's not him

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
No

120
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,099
No

121
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,300
Station 3, do we have a match?

122
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,200
It's a negative, Jack

123
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,600
I don't see him anywhere

124
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,000
Head up, sir.

125
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,400
Bring up 5B

126
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,700
No, he's not, he's not here

127
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
All right, bring up the next page

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,200
What about this one?

129
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,300
He killed my husband

130
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
He killed Gael

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,900
Michelle, what's going on over there?

132
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Saunders has been shot.

133
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
What are you talking about?!

134
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:01,350
Who shot him?

135
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:02,299
Gael's wife

136
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,700
Hold on, Jack. I need medical here now

137
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,300
Michelle, what is his condition?

138
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,899
Looks critical.

139
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,600
You do everything you can to keep him alive.

140
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,200
He's our only connection to Rabens.

141
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,350
Chase

142
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,799
Jack

144
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Talk to me

145
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,150
He didn't make it

146
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:25,000
Son of a bitch

147
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,900
We will get back to you

148
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
Saunders has just been shot.

149
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
He's dead

150
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,200
Don't move, madam, don't move

151
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,000
He killed Gael

152
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,700
Between the information we've gotten
from the captured couriers and our own intelligence,

153
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:05,700
We've been able to confirm that Saunders
was the sole architect of today's actions.

154
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,300
If we catch this last man

155
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:10,899
Arthur Rabens

156
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,999
that'll be the end of the threat

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,850
And if not, we are back to square one

158
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,700
And the virus is back on the market.

159
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,799
Find him

160
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,400
- Hello, Wayne.
- Joseph, could you give us a minute??

161
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:30,400
- Thank you, Joseph
- Mr. President

162
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Well, did you get the prescription bottle from Sherry's house?
?

163
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,600
Yeah

164
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Well, that's good

165
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
David...

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
something horrible happened and I don't¡­

167
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Sherry is dead

168
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
What?

169
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,299
How?

170
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,999
ulia, she came in and she...

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
she killed her, and then she turned the gun on herself

172
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
They are both dead?

173
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,900
Yeah

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Listen, I am not going to try to pretend that we can just put this behind us

175
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,699
but the fact is¡­

176
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,800
The fact is that politically, we are free of everything

177
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,300
Free of Milliken's extortion, his death

178
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:11,899
free of Sherry's involvement.

179
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,499
You are thinking of the politics of this?

180
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,199
The mother of my children has just been murdered

181
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,200
And the woman that I love just killed herself in front of me.

182
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,699
I understand how you feel

183
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:35,700
But there's a story here, David.
There's a story that can tie this all together

184
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,550
Alan Milliken was having an affair with Sherry.

185
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:42,300
Julia found out, and then she killed them both

186
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,000
No, no, no, I don't want to hear it

187
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:49,700
- Your emotions are clouding...
- No!

188
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,200
David, please, just listen to me.

189
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Leave me alone.

190
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,900
David, please!

191
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,299
Jeanie

192
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,099
Yes, Mr. President?

193
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Would you get my son and my daughter on a conference line

194
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,800
We are going to separate the crowd into units of 10.

195
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,399
I want an officer assigned to each unit.

196
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,400
That officer's gonna be responsible to make sure that no one leaves that unit
unless authorized by me or another CTU agent

197
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,599
I understand

198
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,899
We are also going to search every passenger

199
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,800
and I mean every briefcase, purse and pocket.
And we are gonna verify their identification.

200
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:58,399
We will be here all day

201
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,499
- Not if we find him
- Yes, sir

202
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,600
I want you to initiate another search of the station

203
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,800
including the tracks, a mile in each direction.

204
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:08,100
Thank you
Yes sir.

205
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:09,699
Jack

206
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,899
We are locked down

207
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,300
We got 2 men at every exit

208
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:16,699
Good

209
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,000
Is there anything else we can do right now?

210
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:23,300
No, not until we get an I.D. on Rabens.

211
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,550
Jack, listen,

212
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:31,199
about Mexico...

213
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,200
I hope you know I understand you were just doing your job.

214
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,000
Look, it took me a long time to understand that if you want to do this job well

215
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:43,699
you have to stay detached...

216
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,500
If you can accept that, you will be fine

217
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,599
Yeah

218
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,299
Well, I have accepted it

219
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,300
That's why I am thinking after today, I am done

220
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I don't want to be detached, Jack

221
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:05,200
Not from Kim, not from my daughter

222
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,600
I am going to request a transfer to the floor

223
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,599
You sure about this?

224
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,299
I'd still be serving my country,

225
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,300
and take care of the people I care about

226
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:24,100
I owe them that, Jack

227
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:26,899
What did Kim say?

228
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,900
I think she's willing to give it a try as long as I am not in Field Ops.

229
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,299
What do you think, Jack?

230
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,300
I am the last person you should be asking

231
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,599
This is between you and Kim

232
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Whatever you choose, I would support

233
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,300
You are a good man, Chase

234
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,599
Let's go, let's go
Moving in, form a line here, sir.

235
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Please, fast, we'll be checking your belongings and your identification

236
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,900
You only have 9 people in your unit,
Where is the man in the brown jacket?

237
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,599
I don't know

238
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Chase, we have a passenger unaccounted for

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,600
This is Jack Bauer, we have 2 LAPD officers down at the northwest exit.

240
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:29,600
I need transportation to meet me on the corner.

241
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
I am a federal agent. Did you see what happened here?

242
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:39,799
A carjacking

243
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,799
- Get a make on the car?
- No

244
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,800
This is Jack Bauer, we have got a civilian casualty on Hope and Seventh

245
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,050
Did you see which way the car went?

246
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,500
Yeah, yeah, he went straight down there

247
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:58,500
I need that transportation now

248
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,899
Michelle, this is Jack

249
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,200
Rabens is out of the station.

250
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,599
I repeat, Rabens is out.

251
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,000
He was headed east on 5th street less than 5 minutes ago

252
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:16,899
I need to I.D. a stolen car

253
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,800
I want you to get me a DMV readout on a¡­

254
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:21,099
- Frank Kassar
- ...A Frank Kassar

255
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,399
Then I want you to set up roadblocks in a 5 mile radius

256
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,400
and coordinate SAT surveillance, traffic cameras,
everything we have got

257
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,699
Yeah

258
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,400
Fred, it's me. I need to talk to you now

259
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:55,400
All right. I will be right out.

260
00:17:55,401 --> 00:18:00,400
I need to step out

261
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,799
Brad, Rabens is gone

262
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,100
He got through the perimeter at the MTA station

263
00:18:15,101 --> 00:18:16,299
How the hell did that happen?

264
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,499
It doesn't matter how it happened, it happened.

265
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,599
We identified the vehicle he carjacked as a light blue Malibu.

266
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,300
We set up a roadblock and uplinked traffic cams and satellite sweeps

267
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:29,300
But I need Tony to coordinate the data flow with tactical.

268
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:31,399
There's no downside here, Brad

269
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,400
You know he's not a flight risk and he'd be a major asset to the operation.

270
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:39,400
- I could be brought up on charges if I let Tony out
- We can't lose Rabens

271
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,400
So unless you want to take responsibility and run tactical yourself...

272
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,200
You are wasting time, Brad

273
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,900
We need you on the floor.

274
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Come on, Chloe, where's Rabens?

275
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:15,499
Just a second, Jack

276
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,799
I think I have got a match

277
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,099
A light green Malibu, intersection of Fifth and Vanowen.

278
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,700
Ok, we are only a few blocks away, we are gonna head over there now.

279
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:24,600
Adam, get me a closer shot of that plate.

280
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:27,299
Doing it now

281
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,800
I am back in play, Jack, Michelle got me up to speed

282
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,900
Tony, how long till the plate's I.D'd?

283
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:35,700
Adam, do we have a match?

284
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,350
Yes, it's him

285
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:38,999
Jack, it's him

286
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,299
Which direction is he headed?

287
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,100
East on Del Mar, just past Franklin.

288
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:43,799
It's this block

289
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Right there, right there

290
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,300
Tony, we got him. He's headed south on Manning toward the Chatham Center.
We are going to need backup

291
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:59,300
Copy that

292
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Tony, where's that backup coming in from?

293
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,760
From the east and from the south on a reciprocal course.

294
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,160
Ok, we just made a right.
We are headed west on De Soto

295
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,930
Get that thing out of here now

296
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,580
Tony, we have been cut off.
He made a right on to Lawndale. He's headed north.

297
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,130
We are about 3 blocks behind him

298
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,880
Yeah, Jack, we have 3 vehicles in the area

299
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,770
ready to cut him off.

300
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,550
Jack, we got him pinned on Chamberlain, just north of Palm

301
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,660
Keep him there. We are 2 blocks away

302
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,110
He's running into the middle school on Chamberlain, main entrance.

303
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,190
Tony, we are coming up on the middle school now.

304
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,600
Tony, he's in the school. Gotta get back to you.

305
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,940
Tell the arriving teams to secure the exits

306
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,350
We can't evacuate this school.

307
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,240
We run the risk of losing him. Let's move.

308
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,270
Hayes, cover the west exit.

309
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,220
- You got anything??
- Nothing

310
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,810
Cover your exit. No one leaves this buildin

311
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,330
Chase, take your men and search the auditorium

312
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,260
All teachers and students are instructed to remain in their classrooms and lock their doors.

313
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,930
I repeat: remain in the classrooms and lock the doors

314
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,560
It's all right, children

315
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,560
Chase, it's Jack
Second floor is clear. Do you copy?

316
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,160
Chase?

317
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,130
No,Chase, just lay still
Everything's going to be all right

318
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,160
This is the only thing I could do to keep him from escaping with the virus.

319
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,600
Don't waste your time, it's not coming off

320
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,320
What are you talking about?

321
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,130
Rabens didn't even try to remove it

322
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,690
If he could unlock it, he would have

323
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,000
Tony, Rabens is dead

324
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,810
The virus is in our possession.

325
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,900
But the dispersal device has been activated.

326
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,840
I don't see a timer£¬I have got no idea how long we have got

327
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,780
All right, Jack, I need you to find a secure container.

328
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,980
Anything airtight.

329
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,450
I can't do that£¬the device is attached to Chase's wrist.

330
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,570
What?

331
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,340
I will explain later.

332
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,440
Right now I need you to put me in touch with one of the teams
that's been able to disarm the device already.

333
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,070
All right, I will get back to you.

334
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,010
Hurry

335
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,260
Just support the device

336
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,270
Jack, I don't know how this is all going to turn out,

337
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,380
but I want you to tell Kim that I am sorry.

338
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,630
You got to tell Kim, you tell her yourself

339
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,890
We're going to get through this. You just stay with me.
We are going to get through this.

340
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,640
- Jack, I am patching you through
- OK

341
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,890
Roger Summers here

342
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,480
Roger, my partner had to fasten the dispersal device to his wrist

343
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,850
to stop the courier from escaping with it.

344
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,240
I need to figure out how to disarm the timer or remove the clamp

345
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,040
Forget about the clamp. It's titanium£¬
And it's also wired into the tamper proof mechanism.

346
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,890
Fine, then let's disarm the timer. What do I do?

347
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,450
There's a plate at the opposite end of the clamp

348
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,510
You need to open that up.

349
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,140
Ok, I see it

350
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,470
Chase, stay with me. Stay with me

351
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,430
Ok, I have got the timer.£¬
3 minutes, 51 seconds, counting down.

352
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,880
You should see 6 wires to the left£¬separate them from each other

353
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,400
Ok, done

354
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,050
Ok, the furthest to the left should be red.

355
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,180
Cut it without making contact with the others.

356
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,820
You ready?

357
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,000
I cut the red wire, but the timer is still counting down

358
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,470
That's ok. The timer will stop with the next cut

359
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,650
Locate the green wire. It's in the group to the right

360
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,830
Roger, I don't have a green wire.

361
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,760
What color wires do you have?

362
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,090
Orange, yellow, black and purple

363
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,820
Jack, the devices don't match

364
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,200
Don't panic, and don't cut any more wires until we can figure this out on our end.

365
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,830
Hurry. We are running out of time.

366
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,580
Jack, you need to go

367
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,990
I am not going anywhere without you.

368
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,360
Do it

369
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,160
- They are going to call back
- You have to

370
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,310
They are going to call back

371
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,030
It's ok

372
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,840
This is Jack Bauer. We have a man down on the 3rd floor science lab northeast corner of the building

373
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,610
requiring medical assistance

374
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,060
Emergency, now

375
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,120
Could you give us a minute, please?

376
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,230
What's going on?

377
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,580
I am back in custody.

378
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,930
Hammond's taking me down to Federal.

379
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,290
No, no, they can't do this

380
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,510
Not after everything you have accomplished today.

381
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,270
Michelle, I put your well being above the country's

382
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,940
Nothing anybody can say will ever change that fact.

383
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,570
But they can't£¬they can't put you in prison.

384
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,440
Yes, they can

385
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,130
And they will, for a long time£¬believe me.

386
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,820
- Tony, don't talk like this. I
- Michelle

387
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,940
I can't, I won't give up on you

388
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,510
Michelle, come on. Please, Michelle, don't do this

389
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,560
Baby, you are alive

390
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,200
And nobody else got hurt because of what I did

391
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:13,490
And that's more than I hoped for

392
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,730
I can live with that

393
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,660
Even in prison

394
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,950
Tony, it's time

395
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,200
- This is Bauer
- Agent Bauer, please hold for the President

396
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,769
Jack

397
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,560
Mr. President

398
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,990
I wanted to thank you personally

399
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,510
Not only for what you have done today,

400
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,980
but for everything

401
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,600
This country continues to owe you a great debt of gratitude.

402
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,730
Thank you, sir.

403
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,440
I put you in an unimaginable position earlier today,

404
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,730
when I asked you to take the life of one of your colleagues.

405
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,240
Please forgive me for that.

406
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,350
Mr. President, there is nothing to forgive.

407
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,340
It's what had to be done

408
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,660
It wasn't the only sacrifice made today

409
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,590
I understand

410
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,340
How's agent Edmunds doing?

411
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,710
He's in surgery now

412
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,860
It's going to be a few days before we know whether or not he can use his hand

413
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,110
Well, when he's strong enough to talk,

414
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,700
I'd like to thank him personally.

415
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,260
He would appreciate that, sir.

416
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,870
You know, Jack, men and women like you,

417
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,980
your courage and level of commitment humbles me.

418
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,220
Thank you, Mr. President

419
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,870
I will let everyone know at CTU that you appreciated the job they did

420
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,690
Jack, there's one more thing

421
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,150
and please don't discuss this with anyone until it becomes public

422
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,060
But I wanted you to hear it from me, personally.

423
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,520
I have decided not to seek reelection.

424
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,230
This will be my only term

425
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,410
Mr. President, I hope you don't mind me saying so,

426
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,770
but I think you're making a mistake.

427
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,000
Well, mistake or not, it's what I have decided.

428
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,670
When I am a private citizen, I hope we can become better friends.

429
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,290
That would be an honor, sir

430
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:45,940
Thank you, Jack

431
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,250
Thank you, Mr. President

432
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,610
Come

433
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,990
Mr. President,

434
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,790
the motorcade's ready

435
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,470
Thank you, Eric

436
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,400
Thank you, Wayne

437
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,100
- Dad
- Hey

438
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,830
Is Chase going to be ok?

439
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,390
The doctors are very optimistic.
They got him into surgery very quickly

440
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,190
Oh, thank God

441
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,310
Come here

442
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,880
I hear you and Chase are going to make some changes.

443
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,280
I am very happy for you

444
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,880
I thought you were going to be upset about it

445
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,240
I am so proud of you

446
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,710
I am sure whatever choices you make will be the right ones.

447
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,950
Thank you, Dad

448
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:48,980
Thank you

449
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,790
You going to be ok?

450
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,320
Yeah, I am going to be fine.

451
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,220
There's something I have to deal with

452
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,260
But I am going to be fine

453
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,900
You are going to wait here for Chase to get out of surgery?

454
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,290
Yeah

455
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,730
I've gotta leave for a little while,

456
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,420
- but I will be back
- Ok

457
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,580
I love you

458
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,910
I love you, too, Dad

459
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,470
Jack, you there?

460
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,750
Jack?

461
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,830
This is Jack

462
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,330
I just got a call from District
They have started interrogating Saunders' courier.

463
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,740
We could use your help

464
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,500
- Jack?
- Yeah

465
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,300
Jack, did you copy?

466
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,660
I am on my way.
