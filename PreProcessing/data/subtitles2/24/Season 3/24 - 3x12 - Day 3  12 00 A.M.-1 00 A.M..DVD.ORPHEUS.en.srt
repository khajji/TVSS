1
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,230
Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,415
Yeah? Yeah.

3
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:41,590
We've got an apartment fire on town square.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

4
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,780
Pull that hose, set the
master stream on top.

5
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:58,905
Hey, will.

6
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,175
What was it, gas?

7
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,445
Yeah, most likely.

8
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,940
Looks like a couple floors
collapsed on themselves.

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,095
Better get in there.

10
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:07,580
Yeah, we will, as soon as we
get the word that it's stable.

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,445
Anybody left in the building?

12
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,800
don't know until we get inside

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,200
That's it, let's go.

14
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,480
Anyone in here?

15
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,235
Ok, if anybody can hear
us, make a sound. Please!

16
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,590
Make a sound!

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,695
help me.

18
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,050
Will, I got one.

19
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,095
Hey, how you doing?

20
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:42,950
How is he?

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,350
Get me out of here.

22
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,245
I ca-can't feel anything.

23
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:48,275
Take it easy. Keep breathing.

24
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,035
We're gonna get you out of here.

25
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:52,390
Jim, get this one. Got it?

26
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,630
Lift up the beam.
- All right.

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,965
It's not going, it's not going.

28
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,045
Come on!

29
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:04,455
It's not moving.

30
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,330
That's fine, that's fine.

31
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,080
We're gonna get you out
of here. Come on, ready?

32
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,405
Damn it, come on!

33
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,755
Jim, jim, we got another one! We got two!

34
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:22,330
We need more men, we got a guy trapped!

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,030
I never stopped. Never.

36
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,000
We'll get you out.

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,195
Look, I need more men. I got
a guy trapped in here. Please.

38
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:37,565
Send them in.

39
00:02:37,665 --> 00:02:38,525
Are you ok?

40
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,165
Unstable, evacuate now.

41
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:43,265
I repeat, you must evacuate now.
- Jim!

42
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:44,850
I'll be right back.

43
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,725
Jim...
- what?

44
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:47,755
They're calling us out.

45
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,405
The building's too
unstable. It's coming down.

46
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:50,165
But we
can't leave-

47
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,055
we gotta go, it's too unstable!

48
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:54,055
Damn! Can he move?

49
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:55,900
Yeah, I think so.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,300
Take him, take him.

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,730
Grab his legs.

52
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,970
All right, go. Let's go.

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,800
Move, move, move, move, move!

54
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,650
We've got a live one coming out!
There's still a guy in there.

55
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,251
what?
- I have go back in there, come on!

56
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,685
It was clear. It was obvious.

57
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,025
The guy under the beam, he was gonna
die the minute they took it off of him.

58
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,685
He was half-dead already
when I got to him.

59
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,375
So you did the right thing.

60
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:47,835
You know, the guy, he's sitting up.

61
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,305
He's looking around, he
knows what's going on.

62
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,655
I only have time to get one guy.

63
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,680
I have to make the call who's
got the better shot. I mean...

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,905
I had to.

65
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:58,260
Exactly.

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,035
Then why do I feel like I
just condemned a man to death?

67
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,615
Like I should have saved them both.

68
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:06,970
Because you're you.

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,480
That's why I love you.

70
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,225
A man's life was saved tonight.

71
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,445
Thanks to you.

72
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,995
Hey, medic.

73
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:17,835
We've got half a dozen people coming in.

74
00:04:17,935 --> 00:04:19,245
We're shorthanded in the E. R.

75
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,625
Can you help us out?

76
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,370
Jim: Yeah, I just gotta
scrub up. I'll be right in.

77
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,400
The man who was under the
beam, what was he wearing?

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,410
A bathrobe, I think.

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,295
Don't even tell me...
- no. Go.

80
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:39,650
All right.

84
00:05:35,555 --> 00:05:39,445
Leaving that guy behind
was the right thing.

85
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,480
Yeah, that's what
everybody keeps telling me.

86
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:44,818
Decisions like that
get made all the time.

87
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,667
You don't ask for them, but
you have to make the call.

88
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:50,253
All you can do is focus
on the ones you can save.

89
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,385
You're good.

90
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,661
So are you.

91
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,496
Be sure of yourself, that's important.

92
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,618
I'm not sure what I'm sure about.

93
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,202
Even applying to med school.

94
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:02,563
Pressure on that right there.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,505
Mid-life career change?

96
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:09,334
I prefer to think of it as maybe a third
of the way through my life career change.

97
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,231
It's not easy, I know.

98
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,283
Did you do something before this?

99
00:06:16,357 --> 00:06:19,307
doesn't matter. Just
retract that right there.

100
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:21,698
Ok, guys, thanks.

101
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:23,143
We'll take it from here.

102
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,424
Thank you.

103
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,883
What are you doing?

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,810
You need to be a little
more careful, nurse.

105
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,321
sorry.

106
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,765
Melinda: So the guy who was
left behind didn't make it?

107
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,015
Yeah.

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,130
Died in the building collapse.

109
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,048
I'm really sorry.

110
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:57,471
I just wish there was
something I could do.

111
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:58,816
Yeah.

112
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:02,156
I just can't get his
face out of my head.

113
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,645
Well... I know I asked, but you didn't
see his ghost in the hospital, did you?

114
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,048
I mean, he's not haunting me?

115
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:08,563
Well, there's always
ghosts in the hospital.

116
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,019
You know that.

117
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,755
Can't tell who's who.

118
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:14,647
Yeah, there was just something
weird happening in the E. R.

119
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,237
Look...

120
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:25,074
if his ghost was around, could
I talk to himth rough you?

121
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,060
I mean, just to explain
what happened, why.

122
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:31,926
I guess.

123
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:35,012
I mean, sometimes ghosts get angry, and...

124
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:38,989
anyway, you're not being haunted, so
don't even worry about it.

125
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:42,124
Well, I'm gonna hit the shower.

126
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,813
Do you want tea or juice or something?

127
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,409
Scotch would be better.

128
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:47,771
Juice is good.

129
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,029
Do you want this in there or by the bed?

130
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,391
Jim: In here, please.

131
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:41,561
When the curtain closes, people die.

132
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:44,537
Are you ok?

133
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,500
Uh, yeah. I just, um...

134
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:49,108
I thought you were in
the shower. Duh. Careful.

135
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:51,473
There's glass everywhere.

136
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:08,521
Look, I don't know if you're
here, or if you're even listening,

137
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:12,230
but I t ow thaknyou must be really
angry about the way things turned out.

138
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:15,736
I can help you if you'll let me.

139
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,881
You have to understand that
my husband wanted to save you,

140
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:23,758
he just couldn't, and it's not his fault.

141
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:30,474
See, he's really torn up about things, and I just
think if you blame him, he may never get over it.

142
00:09:31,943 --> 00:09:34,658
You see, he's got a lot to deal with it.

143
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:38,084
I mean, just being married
to me, that's a lot to...

144
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:44,613
anyway, I know that you've been through
something very bad, and I just want to...

145
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,911
joe?

146
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:52,624
Joe grimaldi?
- Yeah.

147
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,384
Melinda, right? Jim clancy's wife.

148
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,945
Yeah, we met a few years ago.

149
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,751
Do you still run the vfw?

150
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:03,448
I volunteer there. Now I
have a landscaping business.

151
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,818
You know, I keep busy.

152
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:09,632
Did you lose someone in the building?

153
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,284
My brother.

154
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:14,739
They said he was trapped in there.

155
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:19,403
The hospital said he was alive when they
got to him, but they couldn't get him out.

156
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:22,475
Your brother?

157
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:25,034
I just had to come here.

158
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:28,220
I don't know why, I...

159
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:31,561
I just wanted to see all
this for myself, I guess.

160
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:33,115
What was your brother's name?

161
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,701
Vince.

162
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,062
I'm so sorry.

163
00:10:37,292 --> 00:10:39,592
Were the two of you close?

164
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:43,484
Well, as close as you can be, I guess.

165
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,651
No. I guess we weren'T.

166
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:51,017
It was my fault.

167
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,557
What if you could change all that?

168
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,706
What would you do if you could
just talk to him one more time?

169
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:59,573
What?

170
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:02,361
Look, I know how this
is going to sound...

171
00:11:03,315 --> 00:11:05,520
but I see spirits.

172
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:07,239
I can talk to them.

173
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:11,106
I can help them cross over, and
your brother is still here.

174
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:12,892
He's an earth-bound spirit.

175
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:15,599
My brother's a ghost?
- Yes.

176
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,219
And jim, my husband, he was the
paramedic who found him last night,

177
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:22,524
and he wanted to save him so badly,

178
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:24,607
but I just think your brother's
coming after him now, because

179
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:26,740
he blames
him- - look!

180
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,444
I don't want to hear any of this.

181
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,170
I don't know what it is
you're trying to sell me.

182
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:31,357
Please, just hear me out!

183
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:33,662
It's not funny, you know?

184
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:38,166
To mess with people's emotions like this, or
whatever the hell it is you're trying to do.

185
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,417
It's not right.

186
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:43,827
Joe, please...

187
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:51,623
************

188
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:53,192
Do you remember me?

189
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:54,693
Jim, right?

190
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,684
The future doctor.

191
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:57,982
Feeling better?

192
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:58,877
Well, that's debatable.

193
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:01,171
Hey, I wanted to ask you, the guy
I had to leave in a building,

194
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,870
where you here when they brought him in?

195
00:12:02,977 --> 00:12:04,777
Yeah, he was D. O. A.

196
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:08,369
But they kept him in the E. R. Until
they reached the next of kin.

197
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:09,940
Look, I don'T...

198
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:13,335
I want to try to talk to his
family and explain what happened.

199
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,768
I don't think the hospital's
gonna release that.

200
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:17,893
Yeah, uh...

201
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:20,561
that's why I wanted to ask you.

202
00:12:22,298 --> 00:12:23,693
Don't do this.

203
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:26,419
You know every cliche about not getting
emotionally involved with the patients.

204
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah, I know all about that, but
I'll tell you, if it was me,

205
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,569
if it was my family, I'd want
to know exactly what happened.

206
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:33,061
You know, why decisions were made.

207
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,587
This isn't about that guy's family.

208
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:36,233
You want to make yourself feel better.

209
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,859
You want them to look
you in the eye and say,

210
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,461
"it's ok, we don't hold it against you. "

211
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,843
Ok. Maybe.

212
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:48,958
But you can't tell me that family wouldn't want to
talk to the last person that saw their son alive.

213
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:50,691
Jim, you can't do this.

214
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:52,357
Take it from me, you have
to be able to let go.

215
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,983
You do your job, you do your
best, but you have to move on.

216
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:56,354
You have to put up the walls.

217
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,714
Otherwise...

218
00:12:58,864 --> 00:13:01,459
otherwise you'll lose yourself.

219
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,219
Just move on, save the next patient.

220
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,180
You have a lot more wins than losses.

221
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,543
You can't
let the-

222
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:13,290
hey, hey, what are you doing?

223
00:13:13,396 --> 00:13:16,011
I don't know!
I- I can't-

224
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,305
*******

225
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,084
Are you ok? What happened?

226
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,816
I don't know.

227
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:31,363
I- I don't know what happened.

228
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,883
I'm sorry, it...

229
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:36,412
it was some sort of spasm.

230
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:37,628
Now, look.

231
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,723
Do not be sorry.

232
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:42,282
Don't be sorry. This-this
had nothing to do with you.

233
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,550
You better...

234
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:49,124
you gonna be all right?

235
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:58,512
Jim: Are you here, huh? I wish I knew.

236
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,018
I don't even know if
you can hear me, but...

237
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,619
I want to tell you that I'm sorry.

238
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,350
If there was anything else, I could have
tried, if there was any way to save you,

239
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:11,670
I would have done it, I promise.

240
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:18,709
But you...

241
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,346
you were so badly hurt.

242
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:25,501
I knew you were gonna die, I
could see it in your eyes.

243
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,585
Leaving you there...

244
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:32,890
like that was the hardest
thing I've ever done in my life.

245
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,110
I'm not real good at this.

246
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:43,222
My wife would know what to say to you.

247
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,753
She knows how to handle grief.

248
00:14:45,863 --> 00:14:47,693
She knows how to handle loss.

249
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:50,161
Me, not so much.

250
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,845
For so many people...

251
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:57,159
she knows how to make a difference.

252
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:05,291
I'm not sure I do, in the
grand scheme of things, but...

253
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:09,422
Look, for whatever its worth,

254
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:16,718
Accept my apology for what it is.

255
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:19,516
If you want to punish me, here I am.

256
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:24,947
But do not take it out
on the people around me,

257
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:27,553
or the people I love.

258
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,524
Jim, I'm home.
- That's her.

259
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:40,525
Honey, I'll be down in a minute.

260
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,162
Miranda: Look, I know that
you have no reason to,

261
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:47,579
but I really need you
to take a leap of faith.

262
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:51,783
I know that you'd want your brother to
be at peace, and you can help him do that.

263
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:57,938
When I left you last night, I did something
I haven't done in probably 30 years.

264
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:00,194
What?

265
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,793
I cried like a baby.

266
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:07,758
This isn't just about not
believing in ghosts, is it?

267
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:13,627
The truth is...

268
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,077
I was a lousy brother.

269
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,232
I did things.

270
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,635
Things that I'm ashamed of.

271
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:26,487
About a month or so
ago, I sent vince a letter.

272
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:27,843
I- I tried
to explain.

273
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:30,843
I- I asked him
to forgive me.

274
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,591
I didn't hear back.

275
00:16:32,697 --> 00:16:36,777
Yeah, but this could be your chance
to do it in person- kind of.

276
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:40,333
If it's true, and
vince is out there-

277
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:45,418
look, I could stand here all day and talk to you about
unfinished business and the importance of closure,

278
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,758
but there's much more at stake.

279
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:52,012
I really believe that your brother's
ghost is trying to hurt my husband.

280
00:16:52,651 --> 00:16:55,691
You're the only one that can help me.

281
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,726
Ghosts usually come
back to where they died.

282
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:06,763
Your brother knows that I can see him, so
if he senses me here, maybe he'll come to me.

283
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:18,366
If you're here, I brought
someone to talk to you.

284
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:21,416
Please.

285
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:33,761
He's here.

286
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:37,124
Just speak from your
heart. He can hear you.

287
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,889
I- I, uh, I really don't know how
to do all this, where to start.

288
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:51,622
If you're really here...

289
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:56,168
I just want to say I'm sorry.

290
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,115
It's not like you went out
of your way to stay in touch,

291
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:03,259
I mean, I don't know why you
couldn't pick up the phone.

292
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:05,993
Yeah.

293
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:08,907
I guess none of that matters.

294
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:13,824
The thing is, vince, I owe you an apology.

295
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:16,819
When we had that big
fight that christmas,

296
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,230
I said things I shouldn't have
said; things I didn't really mean;

297
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:25,288
things that changed
everything between us.

298
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:28,434
If I could take it all back, I would.

299
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:30,616
I sent you that letter.

300
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:35,920
When I didn't get an answer, I figured you
were through with me, and I didn't blame you.

301
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,586
Anyway...

302
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:44,507
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.

303
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:48,642
Please.

304
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:53,095
Is there anything you want to say?

305
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:58,033
Yeah, who is this guy?

306
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:59,104
Your brother.

307
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,518
I don't have a brother.

308
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,298
Well?

309
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,830
Does he forgive me?

310
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:10,853
Didn't you die in the building collapse?

311
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,605
What building collapse?

312
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:13,952
What's going on?

313
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:17,407
Well, if you didn't die in a building
collapse, then why are you haunting my husband?

314
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:19,641
I can care less about your husband.

315
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:22,209
She's the one I want.

316
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,035
She's the one who killed me.

317
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:36,942
What's going on?

318
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,052
knownthis couldn't be real.

319
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:43,438
Look, it is real, ok?

320
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:45,544
I just made a mix-up
and I'm really sorry!

321
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,692
So what? I just poured my heart out
to some dead guy I don't even know.

322
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:52,095
Look, it means that your brother crossed
over right away; that he's at peace, ok?

323
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,008
That's a good thing!

324
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:55,567
Well, maybe he's at peace, but I'm not.

325
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:03,729
So it wasn't his brother.

326
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,044
It was another guy altogether.

327
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,770
The good news is, the ghost that I thought
was haunting you wasn't haunting you.

328
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,135
The bad news-
- wait a minute.

329
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:11,962
Wait a minute, back up here, mel.

330
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:15,657
You told me in the hospital that you
thought there was not a ghost haunting me.

331
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:18,012
Well, you know what, you
were really upset,

332
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,601
and I just didn't want to add to it by
telling you there was an angry ghost-

333
00:20:20,711 --> 00:20:21,851
I just wanted to talk to this guy.

334
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:23,266
I wanted to tell him how sorry I was.

335
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:24,852
This ghost was not in the mood to talk.

336
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,358
He's all about revenge.

337
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:27,824
Mel, this is wrong, ok?

338
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,830
I don't need to be protected.

339
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:30,114
I don't need to be treated like a child.

340
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,819
I was not treating you like a child.

341
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:34,586
I was actually looking out for
you a little, like you do for me.

342
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:36,797
You don't let me look out for you.

343
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:39,435
But here I am, trying to find the next
of kin of this guy, somebody to talk to.

344
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:40,876
You're talking to his
brother behind my back.

345
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:41,872
It wasn't his brother.

346
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,231
So what?

347
00:20:45,756 --> 00:20:50,111
Look, I know that I screwed up here, and
we will talk about this later. Ok?

348
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:52,758
But for right now, I've really
got to get a pen in this thing.

349
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:55,909
I mean, this ghost is haunting
some nurse at driscoll.

350
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,161
Um, jennifer quinlan.

351
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,190
He says that she killed him.

352
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,118
What?

353
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:02,202
Wait, is that credible? Is that true?

354
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:03,016
I don't know.

355
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,889
I mean, he's been very confused and a little
hard to figure out, but I did get a name.

356
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:08,725
Peter. Peter harrison.

357
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:09,982
Wait, I know this nurse, ok?

358
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:11,307
She's solid. She's solid.

359
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:12,832
What's happening here
is what happened to me.

360
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,008
She had a patient, dheied, he's
blaming her.

361
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:17,547
Well, I need to check online
and see if I can find anything.

362
00:21:17,657 --> 00:21:21,292
In the meantime, can you please just check
on jennifer and how peter harrison died?

363
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,345
Yeah.

364
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,310
Yeah, I'll check on her when I go in.

365
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,738
We'll talk about the rest of this later.

366
00:21:27,848 --> 00:21:30,103
Whatever you want.

367
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:42,641
Callin' it a night?

368
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:43,627
Yeah.

369
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:45,986
Just worked a double.

370
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,323
So how are you liking grandview?

371
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,963
Oh, it's ok.

372
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,325
A little provincial, maybe.

373
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:54,579
I'm still getting my bearings.

374
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:56,939
Yeah? Where'd you work before?

375
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:58,643
I moved around a lot.

376
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,955
Been a bit of a gypsy.
- Oh, yeah?

377
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,364
But always hospitals, huh?

378
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:06,105
Are you doing my bio?

379
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,982
Uh, yeah, look, I'm sorry.

380
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:12,517
This is gonna sound a little
weird, but, um, I came across a name.

381
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:14,935
A patient I was wondering
if you might know.

382
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:17,300
Um, peter harrison.

383
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:19,858
What is it you want to know?

384
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,844
I want to know if you
know if this patient died,

385
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:27,271
and if there were any circumstances surrounding
his death that were a little strange.

386
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:33,612
You remember how I told you how important it
was not to get personally involved with patients?

387
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:34,629
Yeah.

388
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:38,078
Well, I wasn't always good
at taking my own advice.

389
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:42,772
Peter harrison was a patient
of mine at my old job,

390
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:47,615
and he was very sick, and I
came to care for him very much.

391
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,769
Too much.

392
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:53,618
And when he died, well, I
was just wrecked.

393
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:58,704
I felt helpless and alone, and I knew
I should have never let it go that far.

394
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:01,260
So you quit?

395
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:07,324
I wanted to start over some place where I didn't
know anybody, where maybe I would never know anybody.

396
00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:09,224
Nothing

397
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,310
What did you think?

398
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,828
Nothing. I'm sorry.

399
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:16,193
I was just curious.

400
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,770
Well, I should probably get going.

401
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:21,133
Yeah. Good-bye.

402
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:38,930
No, don't!

403
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:41,291
Please don'T.

404
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:46,224
When the curtain closed, I died.

405
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,821
Did someone kill you?

406
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,685
Was it the nurse, nurse quinlan?

407
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:54,373
No. It was my doctor.

408
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:56,507
Doctor sutherland.

409
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:58,926
No. No!

410
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:01,290
Please don't!

411
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,920
Jim... come on in, bud.

412
00:26:15,293 --> 00:26:17,593
Thanks.
- Yeah.

413
00:26:20,142 --> 00:26:22,442
Well, listen...

414
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:24,087
I got nothin'.

415
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:25,373
You mean like nothing suspicious?

416
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:27,958
No, I mean like nothing like in nothing.

417
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:32,678
6 months ago, jennifer quinlan, she shows
up in grandview, rents an apartment,

418
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:36,037
puts all her paperwork through the
dmv, and the next thing you know,

419
00:26:36,151 --> 00:26:38,701
she's got a job at the
driscoll county medical center.

420
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:41,066
All right, but what about before that?

421
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,291
Jim, I
got-nothing.

422
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:44,719
It's like she dropped out of the sky.

423
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:48,805
I mean, she's got a fake social security
number, yeah, but no other documentation of any kind.

424
00:26:48,921 --> 00:26:51,251
I mean, not in driscoll
county, not in the northeast.

425
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:54,486
It's like she's got no
past, like she's a ghost.

426
00:26:55,342 --> 00:26:57,692
She can't be all bad.

427
00:26:57,942 --> 00:26:59,917
She does volunteer work.

428
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:02,280
Where?

429
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:28,172
You're gonna let her do this again?

430
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:53,031
Jennifer: Can I help you?

431
00:27:54,185 --> 00:27:55,580
I'm sorry.

432
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:56,526
Do I know you?

433
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,115
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry.

434
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:32,025
All this from a bumper.

435
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:01,693
NO RESULTE FOUND

436
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:30,548
Jim?

437
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,810
Jim?

438
00:29:40,918 --> 00:29:42,988
What are you doing here?

439
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:45,717
Just looking for you, dr. Sutherland.

440
00:29:46,611 --> 00:29:48,446
You want to talk to me?

441
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:50,244
Wait a minute.

442
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:53,996
Nora, talk to me about peter harrison.

443
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,278
Or were there others?

444
00:29:56,385 --> 00:29:57,965
Like peter harrison's father?

445
00:29:58,072 --> 00:30:00,927
You shouldn't stick your nose
into other people's business, jim.

446
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:11,457
I just need this ghost to come to me.

447
00:30:11,565 --> 00:30:12,865
I need something more credible, you know?

448
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:14,771
Something I can actually
go to the police with.

449
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:18,508
Yeah, but why would the ghost come to
you if it was haunting dr. Sutherland?

450
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:21,053
I don't know. Probably because he knows
that I'm the only one who can see him.

451
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:24,583
There was no suspicion, no
investigation of the san diego hospital?

452
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,477
Not that I could find.

453
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:28,266
She quit, and nobody ever saw her again.

454
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:32,846
I just came from the hospital and
jennifer, nora sutherland, whoever she is,

455
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,300
didn't show up for her shift, her phone's not
picking up, and she hasn't returned any of her pages.

456
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,278
She skipped town.

457
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,031
Yeah, but what if the
ghost skipped with her?

458
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:44,538
I mean, what if she just shows up in a new
city with a new identity and kills more people?

459
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,666
There's not a damn thing
we can do without proof.

460
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:47,535
Ok. You know what?

461
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:49,758
I need to go home and try
something. Do you mind?

462
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,677
No, no, go. Go do what you have to do.

463
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,585
I promise I'll give you, like, a
month off when this is over.

464
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:56,951
Call me.
- I will.

465
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,546
I really need to talk to you.

466
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:13,000
The doctor that killed
you, dr. Nora sutherland,

467
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:16,955
probably at sisters of angels
hospital in san diego...

468
00:31:23,787 --> 00:31:26,457
I really need to know what happened.

469
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:31,386
Any details that I
could give the police.

470
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:34,714
Dr. Sutherland, did she
treat your father, also?

471
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:36,395
My father? I don't think so.

472
00:31:36,502 --> 00:31:38,792
Look, you may not be the only
person that she did this to,

473
00:31:38,902 --> 00:31:42,827
and she could do it again, so
please, you have to try-

474
00:31:44,157 --> 00:31:45,282
I remember getting sick.

475
00:31:45,387 --> 00:31:47,962
I was in the hospital for a long time.

476
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:51,160
We've ruled out a bunch of
things, which is good news,

477
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:54,431
but we're still going to have to
work you up some more tomorrow.

478
00:31:54,544 --> 00:31:56,894
I don't want you to
worry about anything.

479
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:59,073
I'm gonna be with you on
this every step of the way.

480
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:03,187
I started, like, getting
confused, feeling lost.

481
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,340
She was there every day for me.

482
00:32:13,072 --> 00:32:15,372
I fell in love with her.

483
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:19,933
She made me feel so young, just
like I could do anything.

484
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:21,760
So what happened?

485
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:22,692
I don't know.

486
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:25,386
Please. You have to try.

487
00:32:25,496 --> 00:32:27,751
No, I do know.

488
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:32,138
Well, one night she came to me...

489
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,795
I was so sick that night.

490
00:32:34,904 --> 00:32:37,549
I couldn't even speak, I was helpless.

491
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:50,091
The thing is, like, I
still feel love for her,

492
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:53,256
even now, remembering all this.

493
00:32:53,367 --> 00:32:55,957
I just-I want to know why, how
she could do this to me.

494
00:32:56,068 --> 00:32:58,538
Peter, I really need you to concentrate.

495
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:02,823
I need you to see dr. Sutherland, and
I need you to tell me where she is.

496
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:08,031
The bus station.

497
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,665
Yeah, I'm heading to the bus station.

498
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,335
It'll probably be the first day
that bus is actually on time.

499
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:19,412
Jim: Hey, did you ask if the
other ghost is his father?

500
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:21,091
There is no other ghost.

501
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:22,277
Wait a minute...

502
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:23,632
both ghosts, same guy.

503
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:26,292
I'll explain it later. Bye.

504
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:44,091
No, don't walk away! Talk to me.

505
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:46,454
It's time for you to do the right thing.

506
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,354
Peter harrison told me that you
injected something into his I. V. Drip,

507
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:53,982
that you closed the curtains
and that you killed him.

508
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:05,308
I did it.

509
00:34:06,904 --> 00:34:10,194
I killed pete.
- Why?

510
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,641
Because he begged me to.

511
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:23,858
Isonwas an older man, right?

512
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:26,307
Are you really saying
you've seen his ghost?

513
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:28,646
He kept coming to me as a young man.

514
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:31,000
He was really confused, and then...

515
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,604
then he told me that
you made him feel young,

516
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:40,238
so I figured out that's why I saw him as
his younger self, ghosts sometimes do that.

517
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:45,994
He was 78.

518
00:34:46,393 --> 00:34:50,443
End stage alzheimer's and a lot of other
problems. He was with us for months.

519
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:54,102
He had no family, he
outlived all of his friends.

520
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,100
He was truly alone in
the world. He just...

521
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,423
I don't know, he had this spark.

522
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:04,578
He had this amazing life, and
adventures all over the world.

523
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,290
Sometimes he would forget he was old.

524
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:11,934
He really believed he was a young
man, with everything in front of him.

525
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:15,588
I never knew anyone like that before.

526
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:17,856
I had spent my whole life
obsessed with my career.

527
00:35:17,955 --> 00:35:19,885
I moved through the
world with blinders on.

528
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:24,759
I never once stopped to look at life
the way this crazy, sick old man did.

529
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:28,863
And I never looked at
it the same way again.

530
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:32,126
We became dependant on each other.

531
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,434
I shouldn't have still been his doctor,

532
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:39,153
but I didn't trust anyone
else to be with him.

533
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:42,937
Then things got harder.

534
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:45,745
The disease progressed, and he sort of...

535
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:49,194
withdrew into some place in his
head where I couldn't reach him.

536
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:50,953
I knew he was suffering.

537
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,937
I knew he hated what
was happening to him.

538
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,656
One night...

539
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:59,275
All of a sudden, it got real clear.

540
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:02,324
Let me go.

541
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:05,913
Make this stop.

542
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:11,131
Please. Kill me.

543
00:36:12,198 --> 00:36:16,938
I saw so much suffering
every day in that hospital.

544
00:36:43,187 --> 00:36:45,487
Good-bye.

545
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,228
I held his hand while he died.

546
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:11,252
And then I felt the most awful guilt.

547
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,230
I realized I had violated my oath.

548
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,105
I had no right to do what I did.

549
00:37:16,413 --> 00:37:21,158
I didn't think I deserved to be a
doctor anymore, so I started over.

550
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:24,262
Or at least I tried to.

551
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,630
You did what I asked you to do.

552
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:30,339
And I loved you for it.

553
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:36,336
Listen, peter's still here.

554
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:39,170
His spirit is with us right now.

555
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:41,269
I blamed her.

556
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:46,354
At the last second, I-
I became so afraid.

557
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,541
Afraid of dying.

558
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:53,820
And after I was dead, I
couldn't remember why...

559
00:37:55,048 --> 00:37:58,213
except her giving me that injection.

560
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:01,836
He wants you to know how
confused he was when he died.

561
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:05,240
He thinks I killed him.

562
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:06,519
Murdered him!

563
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,608
But now he knows what really happened.

564
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:12,143
He knows that you were
just trying to help him.

565
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,615
Peter, if you can hear me, I am so sorry.

566
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,523
I never should have done it.

567
00:38:20,623 --> 00:38:23,713
You gave me so much.

568
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:28,722
Tell her how much she
gave me just by listening.

569
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,075
Just by...

570
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:34,593
by being there.

571
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:38,272
I couldn't have had a better friend.

572
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:41,846
She made those last few months so rich.

573
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,534
He wants you to know
how much you gave him.

574
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:47,868
Having you as a friend made
his last months so rich.

575
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:52,707
Having you for a friend
made my life so rich, pete.

576
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:55,835
I'll never forget you.

577
00:38:58,073 --> 00:39:02,283
I... I think I have to go now.

578
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:08,571
So many old friends waiting
for me right over there.

579
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:12,183
He's ready to cross over now.

580
00:39:12,282 --> 00:39:14,537
Does that mean I'll never...

581
00:39:15,976 --> 00:39:18,766
That he'll never be near me again?

582
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:21,675
No!

583
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:25,574
Tell her I'll watch over
her like a father would.

584
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,231
The way she watched over me.

585
00:39:35,898 --> 00:39:38,823
He said you'll always be
like a daughter to him.

586
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:41,657
He'll always be watching over you.

587
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,347
I guess I have to go back
and own up now, don't I?

588
00:39:52,446 --> 00:39:54,761
What do you think?

589
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:14,953
Jim, I'm sorry.

590
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,747
That I held things back from you.

591
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:19,296
And I know that you don't
need to be protected.

592
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:22,055
I just feel like I make your
life so complicated sometimes,

593
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:26,409
and I was trying to spare you of any
more stress than I already bring you.

594
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,787
You don't bring me any stress, mel.

595
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:33,056
Ok, maybe a little. But...

596
00:40:34,404 --> 00:40:37,449
I can't think of a smaller price to
pay for everything else you bring me.

597
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:39,804
Really?
- Yeah.

598
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:45,022
You're not gonna get fed up and dump me for one
of those girls who only sees ghosts in the movies?

599
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,330
I'd be bored out my
skull in about 10 minutes.

600
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:04,665
I know how much it would have meant to you to talk
to a relative of the man that died in that building.

601
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:08,327
Yeah.

602
00:41:08,426 --> 00:41:10,711
There's your chance.

603
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:14,694
Joe grimaldi?

604
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:17,048
He's the brother.

605
00:41:25,994 --> 00:41:29,034
I can't tell you how much I
wanted to get out of there...

606
00:41:29,743 --> 00:41:33,568
to save him, but he was trapped, and
he was really badly hurt.

607
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,161
And the other guy was going to live.

608
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,110
I had to make the choice.

609
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,928
He wasn't going to make
it, no matter what, huh?

610
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:44,608
No.

611
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:48,382
If it helps any, he wasn't in any pain.

612
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,570
I mean, he wasn't suffering.

613
00:41:50,669 --> 00:41:53,124
I don't think he had any feeling.

614
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:57,673
I'm sorry, joe.

615
00:41:58,151 --> 00:41:59,706
Did he...

616
00:41:59,805 --> 00:42:01,595
say anything, my brother?

617
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:05,495
No, he wasn't making much sense.
You know, they're- no, I'm wrong.

618
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:07,798
He did say something.

619
00:42:07,898 --> 00:42:12,328
He said,"I never stopped. Never. "

620
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:19,973
Joe?
- Does that mean something to you?

621
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:26,473
I sent my brother a letter asking him to
forgive me for the things I said to him.

622
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:32,469
And the last thing I
wrote in that letter was...

623
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:38,957
"I wouldn't blame you if you
stopped loving me a long time ago. "

624
00:42:40,734 --> 00:42:42,909
Do you think that means that...

625
00:42:43,008 --> 00:42:46,323
yes. He forgave you.

626
00:42:46,672 --> 00:42:50,062
And you were the last thing he
was thinking about when he died.

627
00:42:58,007 --> 00:43:00,897
I feel like 100 pounds lighter.

628
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:04,866
Like everything is... is ok.

629
00:43:12,072 --> 00:43:15,392
Just thanks. Thanks, ok?

630
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:18,721
No problem.

631
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:24,838
Congratulations.

632
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,077
You just made it through your
first crossing over. Sort of.

633
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:34,124
That's a feeling. I mean...

634
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:38,038
just to know you brought somebody
a little peace, even by accident.

635
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:43,161
Look, um, I don't want you to ever feel
like you don't make a difference...

636
00:43:44,968 --> 00:43:47,693
or that I could make more
of a difference than you.

637
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,983
Sometimes it's just
about the little things;

638
00:43:50,082 --> 00:43:52,847
the things that you
do day in and day out.

639
00:43:54,105 --> 00:43:57,245
The things that you do every single day.

640
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:00,939
That's what makes a real
difference in the world.

641
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:03,477
You heard me talking to
that ghost, didn't you?

642
00:44:03,576 --> 00:44:05,831
A little.

643
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:11,779
Let's go home.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
