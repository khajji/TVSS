00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:10,236
Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,600
*Let your heart be light

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
santa!

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,100
*From now on  our troubles will be out of sight

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,800
*Have yourself a merry little Christmas

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,900
*Make the Yule-tide gay

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
- happy holidays.
- thank you.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,500
this is nuts.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,500
yeah. i don't know whether to laugh or cry.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,700
and if things continue this way,
i'm going to have to bring in chairs

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,100
and have christmas eve dinner here.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
i told you,  you were taking on too much.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,500
- speaking of which--
- no.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,100
i'm sorry. i have to go in 5 minutes.
i haven't gotten anything for ned yet.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,500
well, at least i'm no longer confused
on whether i should laugh or cry.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,800
i promise i will come back if i can.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
it's fine. i'll close up.

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,000
and my christmas list
will magically take care of itself.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,600
got to hurry up and pick something out, ok?
got a lot to do.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,700
do you think mommy will like this one?

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,500
- how much is it?
- $25.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,300
yeah. she'll love it.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,700
oh, hey. is this for your mom?

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,600
yeah. but don't wrap it.
she likes it when i wrap it myself.

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,600
i'm a really good wrapper.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,500
i bet you are.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,400
- so, did you get your letter to santa yet?
- yeah.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,000
- i'm sure he'll read it as soon as he gets it.
- i hope so.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,000
- dad!
- what happened?

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,400
dad! are you ok?

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,900
yeah,  i'm all right, buddy,  just a little burned.

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,800
- why do these things keep happening?
- i don't know.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,700
that's weird. it's freezing cold.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,500
it's all right, buddy.
maybe santa will bring me another one.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
you know what? um,  you really should
have a doctor take a look at that,

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,100
so i'll just get these delivered.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
i'll wrap them up and get them to you tomorrow.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,700
that'd be great. thank you.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,300
yeah. i just need your signature right here,
and then i will take care of it for you.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,800
what was that about?
that kid looked totally freaked out.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,500
yeah, for a good reason.

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,500
do you want me to add these
to ned's delivery list tomorrow?

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,300
no. i think this needs my special touch.

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,000
*And have yourself A merry little Christmas now

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,800
come in from the cold.

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,700
i'm from same as it never was.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,100
oh, for a second there,
i thought santa had gotten young and beautiful.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,600
oh, tired and frazzled is more like it.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,100
i'm william's mother claire.

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,900
it's reay nice to meet you.
where should i put these?

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
right there. just put them on the table, i guess.

53
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,200
most of them are for my staff.

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,400
i just have to bring them in tomorrow.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,500
- how's that doing?
- frost burn, apparently.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,400
doctors had trouble believing that
it was from a p.d.a.

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,300
i'm right back on that horse.

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,100
yeah? this is william.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,300
right, well, we should have included
that in chambers, though.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,500
yeah. i understand.

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,600
busy time of year.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,800
yes, all of a sudden.

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
you look cold. would you like some tea?

64
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,300
i would love some.

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,000
hey, um...

66
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,800
is this your grandpa?

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
yeah, grandpa howard. my father's step dad.

68
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
he looks nice.

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,600
so does the tree. you're doing a great job.

70
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,600
thanks. you can help if you want.

71
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,600
my dad's getting distracted.

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,900
sure.

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,300
doesn't your mom want to help?

74
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,300
she doesn't live here anymore.

75
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,500
oh, i'm so sorry.

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
it's ok.

77
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,400
they still love me,  and it's not my fault.

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,200
it's just better that they live apart right now.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,700
my parents were separated, too,
so i know how hard that can be.

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,800
they're gonna get back together by christm, though.

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
my mom gonna move back in,

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,700
or we might just buy
a new house somewhere like floda

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,000
and start over,
because everybody's happy in florida.

84
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,700
sounds nice.

85
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,000
um, do you remember at the store when you said
some weird thin were happening to your dad?

86
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
- yeah.
- what kind of weird things?

87
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,300
i don't know. things like...

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,400
dad! dad, dad, look!

89
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,300
look, the one has a face in it!

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,500
yeah, yeah,  it won't matter.

91
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
no, if it goes to arbitration,  we'll have--

92
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,300
- oh, can i see?
- yeah!

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,800
see, there's a face in it that
wasn't there last year. it moves, too.

94
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,400
yeah, fine. yeah, ok,  i gotta go.

95
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,400
all right, look,  let's stop messing around here
and get this done. come on.

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,300
here we go.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,000
it's herbal. i hope you don't mind.

98
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
i have some lovely--

99
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,900
dad! grandma, help.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,200
william, are you all right?

101
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,900
- are you ok?
- yeah, really,  i'm fine.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,700
i'll get something.

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,400
are you sure you're ok, dad?

104
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,700
i want him to know what it's like
to lose everything.

105

108
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:45,757
hey, the after work rush
is still a couple of hours off.

109
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:48,267
i can handle this for now
if you want to get a head start on your shopping.

110
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,375
head start?
head start is shopping in november.

111
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:53,884
ok, i'm talking about
desperation shopping right now.

112
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:56,592
i have to check out a couple of things first.

113
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,700
wait a second,  you are not still
having christmas eve dinner at your house?

114
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:03,313
yes, i am. don't ask me how.

115
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:05,621
i'm hoping that santa claus
will give me rachael ray for christmas,

116
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,028
and then maybe she can handle it.

117
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,232
look, i know this may not be
politically correct in your world,

118
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:13,342
but can't this situation wait
until after the holidays?

119
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:15,851
by situation, you mean haunting, correct?

120
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,259
well, you know,  you say tomato, i say--

121
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:19,466
no, it can't wait.

122
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,370
there's too much anxiety
and negative energy in this house.

123
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,979
this ghost could get very powerful very fast,
and he really has it out for william.

124
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,994
so what is it you're looking for?

125
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:31,099
anything i can find on william taylor--

126
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:33,406
enemies,  deaths of relatives.

127
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,513
the only recent death
i've been able to find is his father,

128
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,919
but i saw a picture of him at their house,
and it's not him.

129
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:40,327
- something to do th his work?
- ugh, i hope not.

130
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:42,334
his work is in mergers and acquisitions.

131
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,840
his company does  a lot of takeovers.

132
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:45,948
i don't know,  it's very coorate.

133
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:48,752
yeah, well,  somebody like that
has a lot of heavy duty enemies.

134
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,760
maybe you should concentrate
on the hostile takeovers,

135
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:53,766
or the people who lost their jobs in the mergers.

136
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:54,976
oh, that's a good idea.

137
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,779
at least it would narrow it down.

138
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,493
to about a hundred.

139
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:19,952
daddy?

140
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,659
oh, it's--i think someone's in the house.

141
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,967
- well, are you sure?
- yeah. i heard them downstairs.

142
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,297
ok.

143
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,200
ok, come here, riley.

144
00:08:36,908 --> 00:08:39,108
riley, you get on the phone and you call 9-1-1.

145
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:41,615
and you do not come out of this room, ok?

146
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:44,511
dad?

147
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,818
what is it?

148
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:51,525
it's nothing. it's just...a toy.

149
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,241
everything's fine.

150
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:56,346
let's get you back in bed.

151
00:09:57,756 --> 00:09:59,356
how did this get included in my order?

152
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:01,762
well, it wasn't in your order,
'cause we don't sell those things.

153
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,669
ooh, does that have a remote?
maybe i should get one of those for ned.

154
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,079
well, you were the only delivery,
the only person in the house yesterday.

155
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:09,688
so now what happened?

156
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,193
i-i...i don't know what happened.

157
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:16,201
i came downstairs,  the box was open,
and this thing was flyin' around.

158
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:24,631
have you been having
a lot of weird things happen lately?

159
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,440
yeah, i guess so.

160
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,748
has anyone around you died recently?

161
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:31,355
my stepfather died 2 years ago.

162
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,960
- how old was he?
- 89.

163
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,365
nope, not him.

164
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,770
what, are you saying that...

165
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,381
wait a minute,  bruce spence

166
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:43,988
a guy i worked with once,
and he died in a plane crash.

167
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,700
- wait...
- excuse me?

168
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:46,804
what does that have to do with anything?

169
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:50,507
oh, hi. i'm so sorry. we're just really busy.

170
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,919
can you give me a day?
i'll call you tomorrow, ok?

171
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,326
'cause i really think that i can help you.
i'm sorry.

172
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:58,834
hi. all righ here is what i found in the back.

173
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,167
honey, i didn't even know you were home.

174
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:09,573
sorry, i just got in.

175
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:12,477
before i left,
we got a huge delivery that i had to inventory.

176
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:14,486
come on,  come on up to bed.

177
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:17,093
i will. i just have to nail down
something first--ooh!

178
00:11:17,702 --> 00:11:18,702
here it is.

179
00:11:18,906 --> 00:11:22,806
bruce spencer was c.e.o. of
the struggling barnes & stowe properties company.

180
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:25,518
he was bought out by the company
william taylor works for,

181
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,627
and he died in a plane crash.

182
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:30,634
all right,  that's tragic,  but relevant how?

183
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:34,042
well, it says here that spencer had hit on
hard times,  since the sale of his company.

184
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:36,553
he felt cheated. company was overvalued.

185
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,060
he ended up losing his house
and pretty much all of his money.

186
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:40,269
well, good.

187
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,572
so he's the who's haunting william taylor.

188
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,779
case closed,  time to come up.

189
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,883
but he doesn't really look like my ghost.

190
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,489
melinda, you're running yourself ragged.
you gotta get some rest.

191
00:11:48,597 --> 00:11:51,297
there's nothing here
that can't wait till tomorrow.

192
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:55,311
- you're right.
- all right.

193
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,718
pack up,  and i'll be up in a second.

194
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:12,563
- jim?
- ready and waiting.

195
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,599
are you bruce spencer,  by any chance?

196
00:12:23,705 --> 00:12:26,405
no, i'm not bruce...whoever.

197
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,115
then who?

198
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
come on, who do you think?

199
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,229
no way.

200
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,235
yep. i'm santa claus.

201
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:41,454
*** you somethin'.

202
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,761
i don't understand why you can see me.
usually only kids can.

203
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:48,873
- well, because i can see--
- hold on,  wait for the question.

204
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,986
what i need to know is,

205
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:54,893
are you here to help me,
or are you just going to get in my way?

206
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,901
let's talk about you first.
why do you think you're santa claus?

207
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,110
- why do you think you're you?
- because i am?

208
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:01,717
there you go.

209
00:13:02,424 --> 00:13:05,124
ok, um, maybe you're confused.

210
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,933
do you see a light?

211
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,839
do you need to cross over?

212
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:14,245
heh, no. what i need to do is all around me.

213
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,061
why are you trying to hurt william?

214
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,866
i'm not hurting william.

215
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:20,072
i'm helping riley.

216
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
i got a letter from him.

217
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:25,586
i've been helping kids for
as long as i can remember.

218
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,597
"dear santa, please,
i just want my father back for christmas."

219
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,008
i don't understand.

220
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,912
and you tell me i'm confused.

221
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:36,718
that guy william
is totally disconnecting from his kid.

222
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,530
i'm trying to get him to
pay attention before it's too late.

223
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:45,438
every time he gives his kid the bum's rush,
i try to give him a little correction.

224
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,858
i need to know,  am i gonna have a problem with you?

225
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:52,867
yes. you need to leave them alone right now.
they're dealing with enough.

226
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,980
so it's get in my way.

227
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:57,187
i thought so.

228
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:00,697
you told santa he was confused?

229
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:02,404
i guess i know which list you're going on.

230
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,309
this guy is convinced he's santa claus.

231
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:05,915
good! i'm glad,  i hope he is.

232
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,220
you know why?
i have a bone to pick with santa claus.

233
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:12,827
1982, i asked for a video game.
you know what i got instead? sensible shoes.

234
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:13,941
will you please focus?

235
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:17,144
i need to figure out who this guy is,
so i can help him with his delusion.

236
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:18,954
look, you've dealt with spirits like this before.

237
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,660
remember, you had that one girl ghost
who thought she was bloody mary.

238
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:24,268
true, but she had specific reasons
for taking on a persona,

239
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,076
and specific people that she wanted to haunt.

240
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,782
well, what's the difference
between that and this guy?

241
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:29,187
for all we know this guy,  the way that he died

242
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,291
and something that happened in his life
actually made him think he was santa.

243
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:35,501
yeah, but what? i mean,
what is his attachment to william and riley?

244
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:39,711
i mean, riley writes a letter wanting his dad back,
but it's his mom who's left the house.

245
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:41,823
you're being too literal.
this kid feels the distance.

246
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,730
he misses his dad,  he's confused.
what he wants back is his family.

247
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,142
so...

248
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:50,847
the santa ghost is gonna try to
electrocute and terrorize william?

249
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,658
it's not very jolly of him, is it?

250
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:53,963
you've really been no help  all.

251
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:57,367
all right, look,  i'll look up santa claus ghosts
and christmas items on the computer.

252
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:59,678
just, what else do you want from me?

253
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:02,585
are you coming to my dinner christmas eve?

254
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,394
- yeah, no. too busy.
- with what?

255
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,602
christmas eve stuff. you wouldn't understand.

256
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:10,009
you know what? be at the house at 7:00, ok?

257
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,317
or i'll kick your christmas butt.

258
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:18,634
ah, charlie brown would be proud.

259
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:23,953
turn right in 100 ft.

260
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,359
yeah, the selma people get it friday.

261
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,168
ok, right, right. not what i'm playing.

262
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:31,577
yeah, i should be almost there.
i have the documents ready.

263
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:33,883
turn left in 50 feet.

264
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,190
except that...

265
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:37,194
- turn left now.
- wait.

266
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,303
turn rig,  turn left.

267
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,810
something's messed up. my g is--

268
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,017
turn right now.

269
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:46,721
i'm nowhere near whe we're supposed to be meeting.

270
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,829
look, i need to call you ck, there's--

271
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:50,136
i need to pay attention here.

272
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,140
turn left in 100 feet.

273
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,651
turn left in 50 feet.

274
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,260
***

275
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:03,868
***
your route guidance is now complete.

276
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,000
it's just that-- i don't know,

277
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:46,305
you seem to have a handle on
all these weird things that are happening.

278
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,213
well, maybe they'll put that on my gravestone.

279
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:50,918
"melinda gordon,  who had a handle on weird things."

280
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:53,929
so the car just led you there?

281
00:16:54,136 --> 00:16:57,036
yeah, yeah, i was supposed to be
at a business meeting a half hour ago.

282
00:16:57,547 --> 00:17:02,147
everything went foggy,
and then my gps led me straight to village java.

283
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,662
where i see my wife with another man.

284
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:11,875
um, i had a visit... last night
from the ghost that's haunting you.

285
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,491
a ght?

286
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,499
you're telling me i'm being haunted by a ghost
and you can see it?

287
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:19,711
yes.

288
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:22,518
that might be one weird thing too far.

289
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,624
look, i know it sounds,  but it's true.

290
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:27,834
- is it bruce spencer?
- no.

291
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:29,641
well, who is it?

292
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,547
let's just say that i don't exactly know yet.

293
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:35,755
but maybe he's trying to get you
and your wife back together.

294
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:38,866
by letting me see her with another man?

295
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:42,675
ok. maybe he's trying to show you
how much you have to lose.

296
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,486
jane's never had a problem showing me
what i have to lose.

297
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:46,794
meaning?

298
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,999
that's why we split up.

299
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:53,811
a few months ago,  i found out she'd had an affair.

300
00:17:54,723 --> 00:17:56,223
it was a long time ago,  but when i did the math,

301
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,427
i realized that it was
9 months before riley was born.

302
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,637
- so is riley--
- i don't know.

303
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:03,345
i guess i don't know what to think.

304
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,049
i raised him,  i've been his dad, but...

305
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,368
i just don't know.

306
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:14,277
the whole thing's just one big nightmare.

307
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,183
i'm sorry.

308
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:20,191
i know what you see when you look at me.

309
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:23,901
just some corporate guy who's all about work
and making money.

310
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,217
but i believed in things.

311
00:18:27,824 --> 00:18:31,124
i believed in jane.like i never--

312
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,835
you were brought to that cafe for a reason.

313
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:36,845
go talk to her.

314
00:18:44,074 --> 00:18:45,274
jane.

315
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:50,988
what are you doing here?

316
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:53,498
i don't know.

317
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:58,608
i...saw you with that guy.

318
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,119
oh, really?

319
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:03,027
well, where the hell were you this morning?

320
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:06,033
i called you 3 times.
we had a court hearing, remember?

321
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:08,142
i know, i just...

322
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,149
i couldn't face it.

323
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:13,157
that guy was my lawyer.

324
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:16,369
i'm sorry. we can reschedule it.

325
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:18,574
the judge ruled r me, will.

326
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:21,483
i'm taking the job in philly.

327
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,192
and i'm king riley with me.

328
00:19:26,204 --> 00:19:30,104
look, it's close.
you can still visit on weekends if you want.

329
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,918
but you know you've been
pulling away from riley because--

330
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,325
'cause he may not be mine.

331
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:36,729
it's excruciating to watch.

332
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:40,537
all he wants is his dad,  and you treat him
like he's a stranger all of a sudden.

333
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,548
can't you see how that makes him feel?

334
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:46,454
look, i'm just trying to get through this.

335
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,169
you think i want to feel the way i'm feeling?

336
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,278
i don't know how to turn it off.

337
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:56,487
- you just ruined everything.
- i know what i did, will.

338
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,899
i would change it if i could.

339
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:02,006
but we can't make riley suffer for it.

340
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:05,517
i can't believe you actually
did a test for paternity.

341
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:08,025
if you don't like the results,
what are you gonna do?

342
00:20:09,336 --> 00:20:13,936
i'd rather have riley think his dad's not present
because of the distance in miles.

343
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:16,552
not because of the distance in your heart.

344
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,299
you're not trying to get them back together.
you're trying  to tear them apart.

345
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,612
why would santa do a thing like that?

346
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,762
you should **

347
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,367
's like he was rooting
for william and jane to fight.

348
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:57,775
doesn't that all have to do with
him showing william what he has to lose?

349
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:00,286
i don't think so.
there's something else going on here.

350
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,994
hey, wait a minute,
didn't you tell me that jane had an affair?

351
00:21:03,102 --> 00:21:05,502
now what if that guy died,
and he's haunting them both?

352
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,609
i thought about that,
but the age doesn't really match up.

353
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:10,816
although it could have been a may-december thing,
so it's worth checking out.

354
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:12,126
gravy dish.

355
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,630
honey,
maybe we should just skip this holiday dinner.

356
00:21:14,737 --> 00:21:16,837
i mean, it's 2 days away.
i have to work a double--

357
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,744
no! we are not canceling.

358
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,950
we are not going to break tradition, ok?
it's about being organized.

359
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,860
look, table's set,  i'm ahead of the game.

360
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:25,666
you know what? christmas is a few days away,

361
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:29,471
and there's been a noticeable lack of
christmas gift hints. what gives?

362
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:31,984
i have everything i want right here.

363
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:35,291
uh-huh. ok. come on,  name one thing. just one.

364
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:36,801
world peace.

365
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:41,506
ok, this ghost to cross over, which is
why i have to find out if santa is jane's lover.

366
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,529
yeah.

367
00:21:45,632 --> 00:21:47,832
- hang the garland.
- right.

368
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,739
i'm sorry about all that drama last night.

369
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:51,545
tough situation,  i understand.

370
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:53,251
how's riley doing with all this?

371
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:56,056
he's sad,
wishes he could spend more time with his mother,

372
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:58,965
but he still seems like a happy kid.

373
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:02,374
he told me that his mom's coming back
and you guys are going to move to florida.

374
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:05,184
yeah, well, sometimes
that kid is just in his own little world.

375
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:08,694
i know i don't need to tell you this,
but kids are really sensitive.

376
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:11,904
sometimes they can see things that we don't,
they feel things that we don't.

377
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:13,613
i'm just trying to get some clarity.

378
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,619
i need to know if i'm his father or not.

379
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:18,325
- aren't there tests that can be done?
- i've done the tests,

380
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,233
but i haven't got the results yet.

381
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,540
so until then,  he feels your distance.

382
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:25,949
is that why you left me that message to me

383
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,458
aren't we both too busy for psychology lessons?

384
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,264
i'm just trying to help you.

385
00:22:31,273 --> 00:22:33,573
the man that your wife...

386
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,883
slept with?

387
00:22:37,492 --> 00:22:39,092
do you know if he's still alive?

388
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:42,097
you think he might be the spirit or whatever?

389
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:45,106
- it would be good to rule it out.
- yeah, well,  you can rule it out.

390
00:22:45,316 --> 00:22:49,716
he's alive and well and living in san diego
with some very nice memories.

391
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,850
so what do you want for christmas?

392
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:00,656
a puppy! oh!

393
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,665
how about you? what do you want?

394
00:23:04,073 --> 00:23:05,473
teddy bear.

395
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,426
i know who santa isn't. he is not bruce spencer,

396
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:25,933
and he's not the man that william's wife
is having an affair with.

397
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,041
i haven't been able to find anything
about deaths in her family.

398
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:31,951
well, here's a novel idea--
maybe santa is santa.

399
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:33,859
yeah, except for the fact that he's a myth.

400
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:36,265
he's a myth,  but maybe also...

401
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:37,674
maybe he's a ghost.

402
00:23:37,877 --> 00:23:40,077
all right,  hear me out. maybe santa's a ghost.

403
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:42,584
think about it. only kids can see him,
he can travel the world in a night,

404
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:46,492
he can whisper  to parents
what little timmy and sally want for christmas.

405
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:50,004
you said it yourself at all
the kids said that they saw santa.

406
00:23:50,115 --> 00:23:53,815
yeah, but that's probably because he believes it,
and they can feel his energy.

407
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:57,228
would santa make things explode
or tear families apart,

408
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:59,137
because that's
what this ghost is doing to william.

409
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:01,943
he would if he wanted to teach them a lesson.

410
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:04,654
ok, all right,  follow me.

411
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:07,361
all right, let's see,  there's a germanic tribe,

412
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:10,168
they believe that santa claus is a reformed demon.

413
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:12,077
he would slither down the chimney,

414
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:14,683
and he'd see the kids in their beds
and eat them all up.

415
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:17,291
that's just nasty.
it's not helping us at all, is it?

416
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:20,199
no, it's really not,  and our ghost is not santa, ok?

417
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:24,308
he's just a delusional spirit that has
some kind of unresolved issues with william.

418
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,120
i know, but he thinks he's santa.

419
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:29,226
and considering the season,  it's delightful.
just run with it.

420
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:30,336
i don't have time.

421
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,439
i don't have time,
because the season is almost over

422
00:24:32,545 --> 00:24:34,145
and i'm not even ready for it to start.

423
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:36,951
i need this ghost to cross over right now.

424
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,559
if this guy isn't santa,  how did we wind up
with the letter from riley to his father?

425
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,670
good question. ghosts don't have mail boxes,

426
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:44,177
they only have what they die with.

427
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:46,181
well, that means this ghost
must have died with the letter.

428
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:48,788
and he's been hanging onto it
because it meant so much to him.

429
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,796
more than he knows.

430
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,404
wait, you're leading now.
how did that happen? i was just leading.

431
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,610
no, no, no,  think about it.

432
00:24:54,714 --> 00:24:58,514
a letter from a child,
probably before riley was even born.

433
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,526
that ghost is attached to william.

434
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,534
stepfather! how did i miss that?

435
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:05,342
i've gotta go. you're a genius.

436
00:25:05,447 --> 00:25:07,447
tell me something i don't know.

437
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:10,355
like what just happened,
'cause i don't know what just happened.

438
00:25:10,462 --> 00:25:12,662
thanks again,  and happy holidays.

439
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:17,872
you know, we should take advantage of this lull
and go grab a latte. you want one?

440
00:25:18,587 --> 00:25:19,987
no, i'good, thanks.

441
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:22,895
did ned screw up a delivery?

442
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:25,301
nope.i'm just looking for something.

443
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:27,109
ok.

444
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:36,236
William Taylor

445
00:25:36,442 --> 00:25:38,442
dear santa,  please i just want
my father back for christmas.

446
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,148
Taylor

447
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,756
gotcha.

448
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:57,994
hey! i saw you. in a christmas bulb!

449
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:01,211
you're a smart kid, riley.

450
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:03,519
santa likes smart kids.

451
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:09,529
- you're santa?
- in the flesh. pretty much.

452
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,450
how come you're out here by yourself?

453
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:18,756
- my dad forgets to pick me up.
- what? that's terrible.

454
00:26:19,173 --> 00:26:22,473
sometimes  forgets it's his turn to have me.

455
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:26,884
but he'll remember,  and he'll pick me up.
he always does.

456
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:29,598
that son of a--

457
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:34,109
listen, i just want you to know
that i got your letter.

458
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,820
letter?

459
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:38,025
and i'm gonna take care of this for you.

460
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:41,134
- what?
- your dad.

461
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,742
you're not gonna hurt him, are you?

462
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:45,349
no, riley.

463
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:48,456
i'm gonna make sure you get what you want.

464
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,665
i just want him to like me again.

465
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:57,382
you leave this with santa, ok?

466
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,893
ok, santa.

467
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:10,426
put on your seatbelt.

468
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:13,031
bye, santa!

469
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:23,064
i know who you are.

470
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:26,974
and i really need to talk to you.

471
00:27:27,684 --> 00:27:29,484
i can help you.

472
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:32,491
how can you help me when you don't believe in me?

473
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,900
i know that you're really confused,

474
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:37,006
and don't know why you're here.

475
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:40,214
of course i do,  to give riley his christmas wish.

476
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:41,823
i showed you the letter,  didn't i?

477
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:43,328
it's a real heartbreaker.

478
00:27:43,432 --> 00:27:45,732
speaking of which,  how did you get it?

479
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,149
you know,  i'm not sure.

480
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:52,453
i just, uh,  well, it seems like i've always had it.

481
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,460
you have always had it.

482
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,267
especially since you died.

483
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:59,172
- but the letter's not from riley.
- what?

484
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:01,081
that's william's letter.

485
00:28:01,187 --> 00:28:03,887
he wrote it when he was a little boy.

486
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:06,696
he still does the funny thing with his "rs."

487
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:09,104
wait, i--

488
00:28:09,512 --> 00:28:12,012
oh. that doesn't make any sense.

489
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,720
it does if you're william's father.

490
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,629
and riley is really your grandson.

491
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,238
what?

492
00:28:20,145 --> 00:28:21,545
how the hell do you figure that?

493
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,450
well, at first,  when i was trying to figure out
who was haunting william,

494
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,559
i looked at all the family members.

495
00:28:26,665 --> 00:28:28,765
i'd forgotten that
he said something about his stepfather,

496
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:31,372
but i never even thought
to look for a birth father.

497
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,880
so?

498
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:36,585
soi think that you're william's birth father.

499
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,698
that's nuts.

500
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:43,302
he gave you that letter before you died,
and it broke your heart.

501
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:46,319
that's why you haven't crossed over.

502
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:51,126
look, i know that you think you're santa claus,
but you're not.

503
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:55,242
you're just a lonely little boy's father
who's come back to reconcile with him,

504
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:57,753
and i can help you do that.

505
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:02,264
you are so on my bad list.

506
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:05,276
- please, ok? let's just--
- no, no, no.

507
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:08,584
i am santa claus.

508
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:11,995
and this is why only kids can see me.

509
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:14,605
adults have lost their ability to believe!

510
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,913
you would be amazed
at some of the things i believe.

511
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
i'm not gonna waste any more time on you.

512
00:29:19,126 --> 00:29:22,426
- get lost.
- this is my place.

513
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:25,438
oh. yeah, well...

514
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:27,646
you're not santa claus.

515
00:29:28,656 --> 00:29:31,556
i guess
i'm just going to have to make you believe.

516
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:46,096
william **holiday dinner for riley's sake.

517
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,811
bless his heart.

518
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:51,818
i feel like i've been cooking all week.

519
00:29:54,936 --> 00:29:57,136
is everything all right?

520
00:29:57,845 --> 00:29:59,545
i'm not sure.

521
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:05,657
- could i ask you a personal question?
- ok.

522
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,270
- your husband was william's stepfather, right?
- yes.

523
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:12,882
so william's birth father was your first husband?

524
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:14,794
what's this about?

525
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,898
you know that weird things
have been happening to william.

526
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,110
i think it has something to do with his father.

527
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:24,417
- and this has what to do with you?
- nothing.

528
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:26,150
everything. look,  if you could just trust me,

529
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:28,834
i really think that i could help william,
and riley, too.

530
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:31,241
well, i don't see how.

531
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,460
it's really pretty simple.

532
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:41,168
my first husnd abandoned us when william was 5.

533
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,979
I'm so sorry.

534
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:47,886
- what was his name?
- alan silver.

535
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:53,301
5 years later,  i remarried.
that's why william's last name is taylor.

536
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,019
alan and i weren't right from the start.

537
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:01,828
i think
having a family just made him feel trapped.

538
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,945
so we got untrapped.

539
00:31:05,052 --> 00:31:07,752
that must have been really hard
on you and william.

540
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:10,862
oh, he asked about his dad all the time.

541
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,770
where was he,  why wasn't he with us,

542
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,086
so i, uh...

543
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:21,794
i created a myth about alan.

544
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:27,108
told william his father did important work
all over the world.

545
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:32,324
he used to try and track
where his father was on a map.

546
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:37,639
he was so sure
he was going to come home to us someday.

547
00:31:38,655 --> 00:31:42,555
the lie just got bigger and bigger,
and i didn't know where to stop.

548
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:45,368
the truth would have crushed him.

549
00:31:47,382 --> 00:31:51,482
christmas... was the hardest time.

550
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,896
i used to wrap up a present

551
00:31:54,504 --> 00:31:58,004
and put it under the tree
like it was from his dad.

552
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:02,916
his little face would just light up
when he'd open it.

553
00:32:04,134 --> 00:32:09,634
and then one year,  he just wouldn't open
the present i told him was from his dad.

554
00:32:10,854 --> 00:32:13,654
and after that...

555
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,365
he never asked about his father again.

556
00:32:17,475 --> 00:32:20,075
i'm sure that he stopped asking,  but...

557
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:23,284
i bet he never stopped thinking of him.

558
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:31,605
did william ever write a letter to his father?

559
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:36,925
it wasn't a letter to his father.

560
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,164
dear santa,
please i just want my father back for christmas.

561
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:51,369
it was like a knife through my heart.

562
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,280
i felt like i had to do something,
so i found out where alan lived

563
00:32:56,495 --> 00:32:58,795
and i sent him the letter.

564
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:02,205
no response.

565
00:33:03,616 --> 00:33:05,916
i'm pretty sure he got it.

566
00:33:06,826 --> 00:33:09,726
and i bet it really touched him.

567
00:33:10,136 --> 00:33:13,136
just not enough,  i guess.

568
00:33:17,058 --> 00:33:20,658
here he is, alan silver.
died of heart failure in '97.

569
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:25,069
this guy made it big. he founded nature for life,
those great organic coffees and teas.

570
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:26,183
ooh, i love that stuff.

571
00:33:26,286 --> 00:33:29,586
yeah, and it says here he became a multimillionaire
when they took the company public.

572
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:31,097
the irony is,  he couldn't handle it.

573
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:33,301
see, he just wanted to
have this little hippie company, you know,

574
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:36,808
and suddenly he was a rich capitalist.
he had a nervous breakdown.

575
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:38,319
you know,  i remember that guy.

576
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:39,723
he gave away all his money.

577
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:42,062
not only his money but his houses, cars.

578
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:44,776
he gained weight,  grew a beard,
and stopped cutting his hair.

579
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:46,644
santa.

580
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,250
that's got to be it, right?

581
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:50,754
i mean, he lost his mind,
started to think that he was--

582
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,066
- uh, this is gonna be a minute.
- yeah, i can see that.

583
00:33:55,175 --> 00:33:57,175
you know what,
i'm just gonna take care of the orders downstairs.

584
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,481
ok.

585
00:34:02,698 --> 00:34:04,798
so, uh, why would you do that to my mother?

586
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:06,805
make her remember all that crap from the past?

587
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,211
i didn't mean to cause her any pain.
i was just trying to help.

588
00:34:09,318 --> 00:34:11,018
it's like i told you,
you have a ghost attached to you.

589
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:12,224
yeah, so you said.

590
00:34:12,328 --> 00:34:15,428
it's your father. your real father.

591
00:34:15,939 --> 00:34:17,539
my real father?

592
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:19,844
you mean the guy who raised me,
who was always there for me?

593
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:22,951
ok, it's your birth father.
he got a letter from you,

594
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,061
one that you wrote to santa claus
when you were a little boy.

595
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:28,867
look, it's a long story,
but after he died,  he got really confused.

596
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:30,679
and he thought that the letter was from riley,

597
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,184
and then he thought that he was supposed to
get you to spend more time with your son--

598
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:34,292
wait, wait,  wait a minute.

599
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:37,795
why would he think
that he was getting a letter from riley?

600
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:41,008
because he thinks he's santa claus.

601
00:34:41,517 --> 00:34:43,717
because he doesn't know that he's your father.

602
00:34:43,824 --> 00:34:47,524
and why would he--
why would anyone think they're santa claus?

603
00:34:47,636 --> 00:34:49,436
because i think that...i don't know,

604
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,942
i think he kind of went crazy
before he died,

605
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,150
you know?
he gave up all of his money, his possessions,

606
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:57,156
and i guess that made him think he was santa.

607
00:34:57,366 --> 00:35:00,466
this is great.
so you're telling me that my dead father

608
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:03,676
who never gave a damn about his family
is now haunting me

609
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:05,286
because he thinks he's santa claus?

610
00:35:05,391 --> 00:35:09,291
i really believe that he's haunting you
because he wants to make things right.

611
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:10,503
oh, plse.

612
00:35:10,607 --> 00:35:13,007
my father was a no-show,  my mother lied about it,

613
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:15,114
and i think you're lying right now.

614
00:35:15,221 --> 00:35:17,621
so just stay the hell away from me.

615
00:35:18,932 --> 00:35:22,732
oh, and by the way,  merry christmas. ho ho ho.

616
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,547
oh, no.

617
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,955
it's true. i can see it now.

618
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:31,263
i'm not who i thought i was.

619
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,490
great.

620
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,205
william, wait.

621
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:47,613
- i know this is a lot to deal with.
- you think?

622
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:50,224
but it's christmas.

623
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:51,829
can't you find a little forgiveness?

624
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:53,834
look, you're talking to the
wrong guy about christmas.

625
00:35:54,341 --> 00:35:56,741
there's only one christmas i remember.

626
00:35:57,752 --> 00:36:00,152
my mother was in the living room wrapping a gift.

627
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:05,566
i watched her sign the card
and put the present under the tree.

628
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:11,082
when she left, i went to see what it said.

629
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,307
dear william,  i'm in New Delhi,  i'm sorry
i can't be with you,  but i love you always.

630
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:23,325
daddy

631
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:26,632
see, that's when i realized
that it was all made up...

632
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,450
that none of it was real.

633
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,557
i stopped asking about my father after that.

634
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:36,265
so the plane  did mean something.

635
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,170
yeah, it meant it was all a lie.

636
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:39,877
my father lied,  my mother lied.

637
00:36:40,082 --> 00:36:41,482
my wife lied.

638
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:44,786
the whole idea about
me being riley's father might be a lie.

639
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,399
nobody thinks i'm worth telling the truth to.

640
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,105
ok, you know what,  you can't look at it that way.

641
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,210
look, i just want to know the truth.

642
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:53,016
that's all i want.

643
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:55,922
somebody to tell me just one true thing.

644
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:01,041
william...

645
00:37:03,253 --> 00:37:06,253
that's your son. you do understand that?

646
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:12,072
you had a nervous breakdown before you died.

647
00:37:12,582 --> 00:37:14,882
i think it was out of guilt.

648
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,792
you gave everything away.

649
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,901
and you didn't even know
what you were making up for.

650
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:27,614
i threw away my wife,  my son.

651
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,330
it's not too le, alan.

652
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:33,139
it's never too late.

653
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:46,977
the christmas light just all of a sudden went out.

654
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:49,888
i mean, it couldn't happen at a worse time.

655
00:37:49,997 --> 00:37:52,597
riley and jane are going to be here any minute,

656
00:37:52,705 --> 00:37:54,905
and dinner's almost ready.

657
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:58,712
i'm so, so glad you made it home.

658
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:01,627
is that...

659
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,040
the test results.

660
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,702
i had no idea you knew.

661
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,610
i'm so sorry,  william.

662
00:38:28,716 --> 00:38:30,616
you should have told me the truth, ma.

663
00:38:30,822 --> 00:38:33,822
all those years,  all those hopes.

664
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:35,632
look,  this isn't about blame.

665
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:37,928
and whether you two believe it or not,

666
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,382
it's not going to change
the fact that alan is here.

667
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:44,255
and he deserves a chance
to try to make things right.

668
00:38:44,665 --> 00:38:47,965
how? how could he do that?

669
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:53,682
tell will i'm sorry
he had to deal with so many lies,

670
00:38:53,793 --> 00:38:56,893
but the truth 's looking for
exists in one of those lies.

671
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:00,303
he wants you to know that the truthou want
is in one ofhose lies.

672
00:39:00,413 --> 00:39:04,913
your mother made up stories about me
because she loved you.

673
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:09,827
she knew that every boy needs a father,
real or imagined.

674
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:13,742
your mother made up those stories
because she knew that you needed a father.

675
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:16,957
she did it because she loved you.

676
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:22,776
is my dad really here?

677
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:27,285
your problem is,
you're so busy lookin' for the lie,

678
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:29,096
you can't see the truth.

679
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:32,802
and he's telling you that you're so busy
looking for the lie that you can't see the truth.

680
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,413
your son...

681
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:38,118
maybe he's yours,  maybe he's not.
but you are his.

682
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:40,229
you're the only dad he has.

683
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,136
your son is the truth.
he's your truth.

684
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:45,745
your son is the only truth that matters.

685
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:49,553
if you love your son right now,
that's all that counts.

686
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:53,965
if you love your wife right now,
that's all that counts.

687
00:39:54,078 --> 00:39:56,878
the rest is just clutter.

688
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:59,587
he's telling you to let go of the past.

689
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:01,895
he wants you to listen to your heart.

690
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:06,502
and if you love your son and you love your wife,
then that's all that matters.

691
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,420
the past, the rest,  it's just clutter.

692
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:14,333
why'd you leave me, dad?

693
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:18,146
where's the truth in that?

694
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:22,557
because i didn't know what i had.

695
00:40:24,973 --> 00:40:27,673
because he didn't know what he had.

696
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:32,789
daddy, grandma! look what we got!

697
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:35,997
and mom sa i can open them all tonight!

698
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:43,826
merry christmas, pal.

699
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,931
merry christmas, daddy.

700
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:50,242
dad, we found this by the door.

701
00:40:53,461 --> 00:40:57,061
that's just clutter, pal. doesn't mean a thing.

702
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:10,703
well, i think dad has some presents
under the tree for you.

703
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:12,214
yeah, comen.

704
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:16,323
jane, let me help you with those gifts.

705
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:19,731
- you're back on my good list.
-  thanks, santa.

706
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:22,842
grandma, which one should i open first?

707
00:41:47,727 --> 00:41:50,227
well, the good news is,  case is closed.

708
00:41:50,335 --> 00:41:52,735

all the deliveries went out

709
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,543
and then i will be home.

710
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:57,252
did you get a chance to call everyone?

711
00:41:57,357 --> 00:41:59,457
yeah,  everyone understood.
you were too busy to cook.

712
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:00,883
oh, this just kills me.

713
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:02,769
i mean, it doesn't even feel
like christmas without friends,

714
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:06,174
and all the christmas lights are ill out here.

715
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:07,985
everything looks so glum.

716
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,890
not at all.

717
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:12,298
you look beautiful.

718
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:14,205

719
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,442
hey, here she comes.

720
00:42:33,869 --> 00:42:35,569
it's potluck,  i hope you don't mind.

721
00:42:35,675 --> 00:42:38,375
mind? this is the best gift ever.

722
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,492

724
00:42:45,304 --> 00:42:47,304
toast time.

725
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:52,019
to my wife.

726
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:53,626
to our friends.

727
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,130
to everything we all have,

728
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:57,535
and to all of us being together for this holiday.

729

732
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,190
- santa ghost cross over yet?
- i don't think so.

733
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:18,301
really? why not?

734
00:43:23,522 --> 00:43:26,322
because i think he really likes what he does.

735
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:37,258
hey, you guys, look.
