1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,800
spirts all around us.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,100
They can fuse their psychic energy
into objects in our everyday lives.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,900
You take something like this.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,100
This is a powerful totem.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,200
Through it, i can feel the future,
sometimes the past, but always the truth.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,800
Now,whose earring am i holding?

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Uh,that's mine.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,800
And you are?

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,900
- Delia.
- Delia.

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,500
- You're a skeptic.
- Guilty.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,400
Ahh, i love skeptics.
You're always the most fun to convince.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,100
Delia.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,900
Let's see what the spirits
can tell me through this earring.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,200
- It is a gift.
- That's right.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,900
You treasure it,
but your husband didn't give it to you.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Right again.

17
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,700
I'm getting an "N" Name.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,000
N-n-na.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Ned. Is that right?

20
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,900
Your son gave it to you?

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,500
That's absolutely right.
I'm... Very impressed.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,700
A round of applause for skeptic delia.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,300
I don't know what's funnier,
that you're here or that i'm here.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,900
- Can i get another volunteer?
- Uh,yeah, right here.Right here.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,700
I hate you.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,700
You come to this bookstore as much as i do.
Now give him love.

27
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,500
Wonderful.
And who do i have the pleasure of meeting?

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
- Melinda.
- Melinda.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,000
And you're happily married,aren't you?

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,100
Oh. Did your little spirit friends tell you that?

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,300
No,your wedding ring did.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
May i?

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,300
I'm getting an "M" Name.

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Mary ann.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Who's mary ann?

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,600
- It's my grandmother's name.
- You were very close, right?

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,300
Well,yeah.
I mean,all little girls love their grandmas, right?

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,900
No. No,this affection caused a rift.

39
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,300
A problem. Uh,your mother's war
with her got turned against you.

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,200
And your relationship with your father.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,300
He's no longer with us,is he?

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,500
Hey,how about it,huh?
Just keep breathing,ok?

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,200
You,sir.

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,300
A very strong message about you.

45
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
- You ok?
- yeah,i'm good.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm good,i just feel like
i've had a glass of wine or 15.

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,400
- Something's here.
- Like something something.

48
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
No,put it into words.

49
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,900
Put it into words that i can understand.

50
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,800
It's ok. It's all right.

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,000
Guess the spirits want you to buy my book.

52
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,500
Is it him? Is it something he's doing?

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,100
It's the ghost attached to him that he can't see.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,200
It's not a shock this guy's haunting

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,600
The ghost is not a fan.

56

59
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,615
ok,check this out.

60
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:06,324
According to this baby name website, 48% of
women born in your grandma's time had "M" Names.

61
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:10,052
Mary ann,mildred, maynard.

62
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:12,671
- Maynard?
- Yeah,that's how guys like casey work.

63
00:04:12,783 --> 00:04:14,583
It's called a cold reading.

64
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:16,993
- You've heard about things like this?
- Oh,sure.

65
00:04:17,204 --> 00:04:21,904
I'll start off with something like...
Ok,i'm getting an "M" Name.

66
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,528
'cause somebody in my family
has got to have one,right?

67
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,441
Like an aunt,cousin, or whatever.

68
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,650
Anyway,then you take my age. You can pretty
much assume that my grandmother's passed.

69
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:32,566
I throw out mary ann and presto.

70
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,981
Ok,but how did he know that my son's name was ned?

71
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:38,497
I mean,that goes beyond an educated guess.

72
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,410
Unless you told him without realizing it.

73
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,919
No. No way. I was very careful.
I didn't give him anything.

74
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:47,936
Yeah,except for the fact that sometimes
those guys put microphones in the audience.

75
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:50,257
Yeah. They'll record conversations beforehand,

76
00:04:50,368 --> 00:04:52,768
And then give it back to you
as if it's a part of the show.

77
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
Do you see why i am skeptical
of people who have "Gifts"?

78
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:59,896
Whoa. Hey.
No,not all sensitives are like that,ok?

79
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:04,815
Just the ones who want to make a profit and don't
know that there's a ghost standing behind them.

80
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,040
- Are you gonna confront him about it?
- Nope.

81
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,650
That's a can of worms that i'm gonna keep closed.

82
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:12,863
Well,maybe you are, but i'm not.

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,779
Just stay in touch with your inner spirit.

84
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:15,988
Thank you.

85
00:05:16,094 --> 00:05:17,794
- can i have your
- How you doing?

86
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:18,903
yeah Thank you.

87
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,408
- thank you
- Hi. Oh,delia.

88
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:23,016
Casey. Hey,good memory.

89
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,031
Not really.
Spirit guides told me i'd see you again.

90
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,343
I bet they did.

91
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,150
- Hey,can i ask you a question?
- Sure.

92
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,764
Um,did you use a microphone
to pick up my son's name?

93
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,087
I most certainly did not.

94
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:39,798
Does it ever hurt your conscience,
doing what you do?

95
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,029
- Excuse me.
- thanks

96
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:48,238
Because people believe you,you know.
They trust you.

97
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:51,853
And you just string them
along with your parlor act.

98
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,772
What i do is no act.

99
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:59,585
I've consulted with celebrities,politicians,
and no one has ever asked for their money back.

100
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,209
Just because you convince a lot of people
doesn't mean it's true.

101
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:07,821
Ok,if i am such a fraud,why have i been asked to
consult on the sydney drake disappearance?

102
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,351
The police called you in on that?

103
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:12,564
The family did.

104
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:14,574
I'm gonna find this girl.

105
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,483
And when i do,
maybe i'll make a believer out of you.

106
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,614
Look at this family.

107
00:06:23,023 --> 00:06:26,723
It's just been the mom and the 2 girls
ever since the dad died a couple of years ago.

108
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,842
- Is that sydney on the right?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:32,352
The drake family made a small fortune
with real estate holdings in town.

110
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,670
You know,jim was telling me something about this.

111
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:36,981
And he said the police were totally frustrated

112
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:41,392
'cause the night that she went missing everything
was in perfect condition.

113
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:44,114
The bed was made,
cell phone and keys were on the table.

114
00:06:44,227 --> 00:06:46,727
And the kidnappers didn't even make any demands.

115
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,340
No note,no clues,nothing for the police to go on.

116
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,962
Can you imagine how that must feel?

117
00:06:54,076 --> 00:06:57,976
Your child just vanishes and
you have no idea what happened?

118
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:00,096
Sad thing is it's been 2 weeks.

119
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:03,008
In most cases,
if they haven't been found in a couple of days--

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,520
Yeah,i know.

121
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:11,334
There isn't any way that you could go
and talk to mrs. Drake is there?

122
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,162
Why would i want to do that?

123
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,170
Just because casey is gonna go there
and spin whatever story he wants.

124
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,190
But if you get there first,you might,

125
00:07:19,702 --> 00:07:22,602
i don't know, see something.

126
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:23,725
Wait a minute,

127
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,353
- i thought you didn't buy what i do.
- I don't.

128
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,635
But i buy what casey does even less.

129
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,559
If it were me,mel,

130
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,170
if this was my kid,the last thing i would want
is somebody lying to me about it.

131
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,020
So,how can i help you, melinda?

132
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:51,635
I know that this is none of my business.
I just don't want to see your family get hurt.

133
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,960
Ahh,too late.

134
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,879
I know that you're consulting with casey edgars.

135
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:02,297
- You know casey's work?
- I know his type.

136
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:06,214
Oh. Well,you're not the first
person to warn me about him,

137
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:10,531
but he confirmed what i know in my heart--

138
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:13,052
Sydney is out there.

139
00:08:13,466 --> 00:08:15,266
He'll tell me where she is.

140
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,678
Look,um...

141
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:22,594
I have some insight into the supernatural as well.

142
00:08:22,913 --> 00:08:27,613
And the casey edgars of the world are just
trying to take advantage of people's pain.

143
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:34,039
It's really not as easy as just closing your eyes
and seeing where somebody is.

144
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:37,068
Do you communicate with spirits?

145
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,097
Do you know anything about sydney?

146
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,908
No. No,i don't know anything,but...

147
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:49,928
I wouldn't make you promises until i had proof.

148
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:53,856
Oh,excuse me.

149
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,443
Who's there?

150
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,790
Hey.

151
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:45,303
Hey,what do you want?
Why won't you just talk to me?

152
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:48,427
Please.

153
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:57,568
What are you doing in here?

154
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,083
What happened?

155
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:05,093
Uh,i--i'm sorry.I heard this strange noise.
That's why i came in here.

156
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:07,016
I was talking to your mom.

157
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,525
Yeah,i heard you two.

158
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,535
I know exactly what you are.

159
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,742
You're another one of those phony psychics
poking through our house.

160
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:14,053
No,please,that's not what this is.

161
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,660
It's just the feeding frenzy
doesn't stop around here.

162
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,073
Nikki.

163
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:27,214
You know,i think i've come at a bad time.

164
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:31,227
But if you want to talk some more,
I'd--i really would love to help.

165
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:34,244
Well,there is someone here
who would like to speak to you.

166
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:35,659
Excuse me?

167
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:39,966
Casey,this is the woman i
was just telling you about,

168
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,089
Melinda gordon.

169
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,200
We've met.

170
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,112
So what did you do?

171
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:48,617
Well,i got out of there as fast as i could.

172
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,030
The last thing i wanted
was a showdown with the guy.

173
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:52,342
And you didn't see sydney's ghost?

174
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:55,848
No. I saw the ghost
that's been haunting casey instead.

175
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,751
Wait,does that mean the
ghost is attached to you now

176
00:10:57,861 --> 00:10:59,949
since he knows you can see him and casey can't?

177
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,086
i don't know.

178
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:03,691
It's too hard to figure out
when he's making me this woozy.

179
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,415
You shou have seen the look in her eyes.

180
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:12,629
I mean,she was calm on the outside,
but her heart was breaking.

181
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:15,248
You know,and who am i to take away her hope?

182
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:19,064
Please tell me tha
what i do is not as bad as casey.

183
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,488
What you do has nothing to do with casey.

184
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,869
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?

185
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:03,693
Stop it.

186
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,099
Please,you know that i can't hear you.

187
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:27,503
- are you worried?
- Am i worried about finding sydney drake?

188
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Of course.

189
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,230
Listening to the spirits is not an exact science.
You have to be attuned to everything.

190
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,555
You never know
what the spirits might send your way.

191
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,691
- here you go
-  alright Keep the change.

192
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:47,404
You have a ghost attached to you.

193
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:49,114
Tell me something i don't already know.

194
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:54,424
No,i'm not talking about your inner spirit.
I'm talking about a real ghost.

195
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,049
He's wearing a red plaid shirt,
Loose jeans, and hiking boots.

196
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,467
So,sounds like a ghost.

197
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,178
You've actually seen it?

198
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:05,487
Yes. And he's angry with you.
And he had a message.

199
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:07,603
He wanted me to make you tell the truth.

200
00:13:07,713 --> 00:13:08,913
Oh,really? About what?

201
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,520
I'm sure there could be any number of things,

202
00:13:10,628 --> 00:13:14,728
but i'm gonna start with the fact that you
don't know anything about where sydney drake is.

203
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:18,052
Oh,i get it.

204
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,165
I'm cutting in on your turf.
Are you the town psychic or something?

205
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
Uh,this has nothing to do with turf.

206
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,789
It has to do with 2 words--Paranormal envy.

207
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:30,803
I am here because a ghost has a message for you.
You can do with that whatever you want.

208
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,232
ok.

209
00:13:34,043 --> 00:13:38,643
Maybe you have a gift.
Or maybe you just think you do.

210
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,367
But the real struggle is hiding it.

211
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:46,481
You've had this gift since you were a little girl
and that's the worst time to be different.

212
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,806
Are you a psychic or a therapist?

213
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,916
You couldn't get rid of this gift.

214
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:54,526
So you open up a nice little business.

215
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:58,144
It keeps you in contact with people
who recently lost loved ones, Like,um...

216
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,666
Selling antiques.

217
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:02,978
Oh,you really are touching.

218
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:05,685
I told the truth. Mission accomplished.

219
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:10,409
Oh,and one more thing.

220
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,924
Sydney drake is alive.

221
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:16,034
If you're mad because i beat you to the punch,
I make no apologies.

222
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,450
This is the big leagues.
A girl is missing.

223
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:23,872
Step aside, let the professionals handle it.

224
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:31,616
Hey. Wait.

225
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:38,051
Nikki.

226
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,575
I didn't mean to spy on you.

227
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:47,186
There's just been so much media attention
since sydney disappeared.

228
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:51,404
I definitely don't want to get recognized
checking out a so-called psychic.

229
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,430
So,when were you listening to us
and how much did you hear?

230
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,250
Enough.

231
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,466
What you were saying to casey and my mom,
that you can see the dead.

232
00:15:05,794 --> 00:15:07,194
Is it true?

233
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,610
Yeah,it's true.

234
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:13,724
Have you seen my sister?

235
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,021
No,i haven't.

236
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:22,823
But that doesn't mean anything.

237
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:25,726
It's just that...

238
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,828
I think my sister is dead.

239
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,530
I don't think my mother can face that.

240
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,232
She wishes it was me.

241
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,634
- That's not true.
- It is.

242
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:43,536
My mom pushed us both,
but sydney was the one who always succeeded.

243
00:15:44,338 --> 00:15:46,238
She had all the brains.

244
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,140
She sailed into medical school.

245
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:51,941
- Were you two close?
- Not as close as sydney and my mother.

246
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:55,744
When dad died, it just got worse.

247
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:58,846
It was all about sydney.

248
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:02,148
She was mommy's little princess.

249
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:06,351
Sydney used to call me the toad.

250
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:14,656
I'm sure that she knew how much you loved her.

251
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,158
I need your help.

252
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:20,359
Ok,explain to me again how this isn't a seance.

253
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:23,661
Because the one we're
looking for is alive,i guess.

254
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,864
Casey calls it a visitation.

255
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:29,265
This guy is so pretentious
it makes me want to throw up.

256
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:35,367
Oh,what i wouldn't give to see this.
The real deal vs. The real real deal.

257
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,376
Honey?

258
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:47,277
Mel? Honey?

259
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:51,079
Uh...i'm gonna-- i'm gonna call you back.

260
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:12,493
I am just a portal.

261
00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:19,896
I can feel the love and belief of everyone
in this room and so can my guides.

262
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,200
They are here with us.

263
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,201
Now.

264
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:33,404
Every single person has
a different spirit watching over them,

265
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,308
Protecting them.

266
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,609
Now,show us what we seek.

267
00:17:39,712 --> 00:17:44,812
Please shine a lot on sydney drake,
beloved daughter, sister,friend.

268
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:48,916
Please show us where she is.

269
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,119
I see her.

270
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,120
Where? Where is she?

271
00:17:55,222 --> 00:17:58,522
She's alive. She's close.

272
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,025
There's a man next to her.

273
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:05,926
A man wearing a red sweatshirt.

274
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:08,329
Yes,i can see it clearly now.

275
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,730
His shirt is red,and he's wearing hiking boots.

276
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,333
Are you kidding me?

277
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:30,243
i'm right here.

278
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,544
I'm standing right behind you.

279
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,847
I'm not alive, you liar. I'm dead.

280
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:42,551
Sydney?

281
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,754
you have to tell them the truth.

282
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:51,556
you have to tell them that i'm dead.

283
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:11,026
- Are you all right?
- Yes,i'm fine. I'm so sorry.

284
00:19:12,046 --> 00:19:16,046
Melinda,did you say my daughter's name?

285
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:20,469
Look,i know how this is gonna sound.

286
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:24,489
Yes.

287
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
Sydney's spirit was here with us.

288
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:32,716
And she wanted me to
tell you that she's not alive.

289
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,030
I'm so sorry.

290
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:41,446
Do not listen to her.
Your daughter is alive.

291
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:44,763
This woman is trying to sabotage my work.

292
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:48,577
She came to me earlier claiming i was a fraud,
and now she says she's a seer?

293
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,092
What are you talking about?

294
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:52,599
I was invited to come here.

295
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,908
Why are you using your doubt to block me?

296
00:19:55,017 --> 00:19:58,717
Why have you insinuated yourself in this family,
taking away their only hope?

297
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,336
What kind of scam are you running?

298
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:05,542
I am not running any scam.
And you're the only one that's getting paid.

299
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:10,068
We're not paying him.

300
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:14,977
We offered him money several times,
but he said no.

301
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:20,811
I know what i saw.

302
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,866
Lower.

303
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:37,077
Lower.

304
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,488
Ooh,not that low.

305
00:20:40,899 --> 00:20:42,299
Casey went for blood,huh?

306
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:46,805
The only thing that guy values more
than his paycheck is some good p.r.

307
00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:49,623
I can't believe he accused me of scamming them.

308
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:51,534
I mean,why didn't i see that coming?

309
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,741
Hey,it wasn't a total loss.

310
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:55,951
At least you found out the truth about sydney.

311
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,359
- Poor girl. She's dead,huh?
- Right.

312
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:03,369
And we know that the ghost wasn't attached to
casey, that it was attached to the drake family.

313
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,490
Yeah,but then why was she at the book signing?

314
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:09,905
Because nikki was there trying to check out casey.

315
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,816
Why would the fair
sydney drake be wearing men's clothes?

316
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:13,926
i mean, Any ideas about that?

317
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,630
None,but if that's how she's appearing to me,
then that is the clothes she died in.

318
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:21,245
This sense of you feeling dizzy,
Are you still feeling that?

319
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,559
Yeah,which makes me think that she was drugged,

320
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,469
Which is why i go through reefer madness
every time she appears,

321
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,680
And why she's remember things in bits and pieces.

322
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,089
Is there any way i can talk
to one of your cop friends?

323
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:32,598
On a cold case file, sure.

324
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:35,504
But on an on-going investigation,
it's just not gonna happen.

325
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:37,317
Sorry.

326
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,731
- There is one person you could talk to.
- Who?

327
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,541
Casey.

328
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:44,748
Now you're on drugs.

329
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:46,153
Ok,go with me for a second,all right?

330
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:48,258
Look,obviously this guy's not a sensitive.

331
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,766
But from the way you describe him,
He's a profiler.

332
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,276
Well,maybe he's a good one.

333
00:21:52,382 --> 00:21:55,282
He's close to the drake family.
They probably let him talk to the cops.

334
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:57,695
He might have clues he doesn't even know he has.

335
00:21:57,804 --> 00:21:59,104
- I hate this idea.
- Yeah,i know.

336
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,210
But if you can get casey on your side, You might
have a better chance of crossing this ghost over,

337
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,322
And that's really what it's all about,huh?

338
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,230
I hate this idea.

339
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,745
It wouldn't hurt to ask.

340
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:13,452
- I hate this idea.
- Me,too, believe me.

341
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:16,772
So why would i work with you on this?

342
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:21,182
Because at the end of the day, it's not about us.
It's about sydney.

343
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:22,697
We both want to help this family.

344
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:25,303
You're good at picking up on clues about people
and their behavior,

345
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:26,613
and you might see something i miss.

346
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:29,119
I'm a solo act. I don't need your help.

347
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:32,629
Yes,you do.
You've got nothi on sydney and you know it.

348
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:34,443
I've seen her. I know she was drugged.

349
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,250
I know that she died with
handcuffs around her wrists.

350
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:41,666
You think she's dead. I think she's still alive.

351
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,078
We're not exactly a mind meld.

352
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:45,484
All the more reason to find out the truth.

353
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:51,099
oh,please tell me you are not actually trying to
figure out the definition of "Truth."

354
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,816
I'm consulting with the spirit guides.

355
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:55,927
All right,tell your spirit guides this:

356
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:58,735
If we find sydney,
i'll step away and you can take all the credit.

357
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,846
If we don't,then i'll never bother you again.

358
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:04,661
The spirit guides have spoken.

359
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:11,584
So,your thing is crossing over,right?
Into the light?

360
00:23:11,697 --> 00:23:13,797
Yeah,that's my thing.

361
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,106
What's in the light?

362
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,912
I've never really crossed over, so i don't know.

363
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:20,624
Your knowledge of the
paranormal is really limited.

364
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,233
You should tell people
that ghosts reside on 9 planes of existence.

365
00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:26,147
It sounds smarter. Just a suggestion.

366
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:28,355
Can we focus on the ghost,please?

367
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:30,964
Right. Uh,let's see what we have--

368
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:34,774
Handcuffs,drugs, outdoor clothing.
What else we got?

369
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:36,089
Frogs.

370
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:37,897
Excuse me?

371
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:41,901
I heard them the other night out of nowhere--
Hundreds,maybe even thousands.

372
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,319
What does that mean?

373
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,023
I was hoping it meant something to you.

374
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,230
It's a signal that sydney wants me to have.
I just can't figure it out.

375
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:52,744
All right,well, let's forget for a moment
what frogs might mean to sydney.

376
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,260
- What do they mean to you?
- How is that relevant?

377
00:23:56,274 --> 00:23:59,674
Most paranormal experiences begin
as an inward exercise.

378
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:01,988
The answer might not be
some vague mystery out there.

379
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:04,897
It might be some specific thing
that you already know.

380
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,209
Like what?

381
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:11,615
Maybe the spirit is trying to communicate with us
through your memories,give us a clue.

382
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:14,735
- Just close your eyes.
- No.

383
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,854
Free associate.
When you think of frogs, you think of...

384
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,968
Gross.

385
00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:23,374
All right, that's a start. What else?

386
00:24:23,783 --> 00:24:24,983
Warts.

387
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:28,191
Kermit. Girl scouts.

388
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:31,802
You know, Jim and i went camping
for the first time last year,

389
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:34,515
And we had to move
because the sound of the frogs was so loud.

390
00:24:34,626 --> 00:24:36,126
Where was that?

391
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:38,434
Red mountain forest.

392
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:42,247
You know,i don't mind sharing credit with you.

393
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,657
As long as you present yourself as my prot?
Of course.

394
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,570
- You don't like me,do you?
- Not much.

395
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,479
Why not? I'm so likeable.

396
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:50,885
I don't like what you do.

397
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,991
Ah. You don't approve of me.
That's different. Less personal.

398
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:55,803
No,it's personal.

399
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:59,112
Heh. You're made
because i make a living at this and you don't?

400
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:00,224
I don't want to.

401
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,028
Oh,i do, and that makes me bad?

402
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:06,235
Look,i just think it's wrong,ok?
To make up little messages from the other side.

403
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:08,995
Like,"My spirit guides are
telling me that your mom and dad

404
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:11,449
are really proud of you and will always love you."

405
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:13,373
What if mom and dad aren't proud?

406
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,280
What if what they  really wanted to say
was something meaningful but painful?

407
00:25:17,396 --> 00:25:19,496
You just tell people whatever
it is that they want to hear,

408
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,805
And that's the part i don't approve of.

409
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,310
Listen,i help people.
It's the best part of what i do.

410
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:26,970
And the afterlife i believe in doesn't have ghosts

411
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,636
running around spreading
terrible news to the living.

412
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:33,897
So,if my gift allows me to tell right away
what someone needs to hear,

413
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,662
what's the harm in saying it?

414
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:38,469
No one has ever been helped by being lied to.

415
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:47,702
Ok,this is it. This is where we went camping.

416
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:52,325
- Wait. Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

417
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,341
Ok,there's gotta be something over here.

418
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,469
What is that?

419
00:26:02,876 --> 00:26:04,476
A body.

420
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:06,786
It's her.

421
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:12,302
- I can't go down there.
- Excuse me?

422
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:15,515
I have a problem with death,
specifically,dead bodies.

423
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:18,127
Casey,you said that you talk to the dead.

424
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:22,637
No,i talk to spirits.
Corpses are something totally different.

425
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:25,755
Ok,fine. Well,
step aside and let the professionals handle it.

426
00:26:42,132 --> 00:26:43,732
Is that really her?

427
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,939
Yeah,look at her wrists.

428
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,057
- She was held.
- Yeah.

429
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:53,564
And if she was wandering around drugged,
then she escaped...

430
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,080
I'm guessing from somewhere close by.

431
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:03,107
You really saw her.

432
00:27:10,946 --> 00:27:12,546
Protect her.

433
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:23,185
Ealing with cops. They always complicate things.

434
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,495
You're the one who wanted to take all the credit.

435
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,805
I don't deal with cases like these.

436
00:27:28,516 --> 00:27:29,616
Do you think sydney crossed over?

437
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:32,121
No.
I think we only got a small piece of the puzzle.

438
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:34,531
And now we have to figure out who did this to her.

439
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:36,241
She said, "Protect her."

440
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:37,747
- Protect who?
- I don't know.

441
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:39,575
Maybe she was talking about herself. I mean,

442
00:27:39,682 --> 00:27:42,110
there's something there. We're just missing it.

443
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,170
Yeah,something ways bothered me about her...

444
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,480
The handcuffs.I mean,
there are a million easier ways to kidnap someone.

445
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:48,792
Such as?

446
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:51,397
Drugs,restraints-- simple coercion,even.

447
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,209
If you're using handcuffs, you're an amateur.

448
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,319
You didn't do  your homework.

449
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:57,827
You're winging it.

450
00:27:58,435 --> 00:28:01,735
- You got all that from handcuffs?
- No,it's just a hunch.

451
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:06,959
I really thought she was alive.

452
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:10,073
I really thought i could feel it. I--

453
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:12,981
Look,i think you did feel something--

454
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:16,693
Her presence. It was just her ghost.

455
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:20,919
Maybe i do have something.

456
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:23,424
You know what? Be careful what you wish for.

457
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:28,737
A lot of responsibility comes with this gift,
and it's not always just giving people hope.

458
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:31,957
Sometimes you have to give them bad news.

459
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,971
You think i should tell the drakes.

460
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:38,584
It'll be easier coming from you.

461
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,434
Jim?

462
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:05,192
Time for your bathroom break.

463
00:29:58,712 --> 00:29:59,812
jim

464
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,817
- no!
- Hey,no,shh,hey, It was a dream.

465
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,425
Shh,quiet. It's all right.

466
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,831
It was a vision--

467
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,440
Something that happened to sydney.

468
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,547
She was in a place, like a cabin or something.

469
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:12,955
And they had her handcuffed to the bed,
and she hit a guy  with a mirror.

470
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:13,969
What guy?

471
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,773
It was the guy that was holding her,except...

472
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:19,085
He had your face.

473
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:22,094
- And you had to hit it with a mirror?
- No,i get it now.

474
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:25,806
Casey was right.
She's using my life to tell her story.

475
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,620
How do i fit in?

476
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:32,733
She's telling me
that she was taken by someone she loved.

477
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,648
Hello.

478
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:26,754
Hey,melinda.

479
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,567
Ok. All right,thanks.

480
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:40,708
You think someone in her family killed her?

481
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:42,418
Or has taken her, anyway.

482
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:45,824
In the vision,she used this guy's clothes
to go through the woods.

483
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,938
- You saw the cabin in the vision?
- No.

484
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,846
But i've seen some just like it on red mountain.

485
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:52,353
We know if the police found anything,
they'd be all over this area.

486
00:31:52,463 --> 00:31:54,963
Yeah,but you and i haven't been to this area.

487
00:32:01,198 --> 00:32:04,198
- Is this the cabin from your vision?
- It looks like it.

488
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:21,072
What are you doing?

489
00:32:21,478 --> 00:32:25,878
Remember when you were talking about
psychic energy infusing with everyday objects?

490
00:32:25,996 --> 00:32:27,096
Yeah.

491
00:32:28,807 --> 00:32:30,807
I think you might have been right.

492
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:52,698
Brandon?

493
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,803
She can't take much more.

494
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,450
Brandon!

495
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:18,198
we have to go.

496
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,716
We know that this is gonna
be hard for you to hear.

497
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:27,326
But we wanted you to be the first
to know brandon took sydney.

498
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:29,142
That's not all.

499
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:30,948
He had help.

500
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,458
Who?

501
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,671
You.

502
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,236
me?

503
00:33:45,037 --> 00:33:47,237
You think i did this to my sister?

504
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:49,538
You were the forgotten child.

505
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,139
You were living in sydney's shadow.
Even after she was gone,

506
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,340
You still couldn't get your mother's attention.

507
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:57,141
You and your boyfriend,
you planned the whole thing.

508
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,743
You guys are so far off. You don't have a clue.

509
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:02,044
Brandon is sydney's ex-boyfriend,not mine.

510
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:03,845
Just tell us what happened.

511
00:34:05,246 --> 00:34:08,246
Sydney was not as perfect as everybody thought.

512
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:11,548
I don't have to explain anything to you.

513
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:18,151
The cops are gonna connect brandon's clothes.
It's only a matter of time.

514
00:34:18,252 --> 00:34:19,452
Wait a minute.

515
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:22,353
Think about sydney's message, "Protect her."

516
00:34:22,654 --> 00:34:23,654
Yeah?

517
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:25,954
Well,what if she meant from this?

518
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:29,256
What if she meant "Protect nikki"?

519
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:35,659
Will you just let me talk to you? Please--

520
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,161
Please,look, i'm not here to judge you,ok?

521
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,062
But you're gonna have to tell
the truth sooner or later.

522
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,863
Not to you,i don't.

523
00:34:44,364 --> 00:34:46,464
I know that your sister loves you.

524
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:48,665
And i know that she wants me to protect you.

525
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:50,966
- How do you know that?
- Because she told me.

526
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:54,568
Did you kill your sister?

527
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:05,672
Do you know what the worst thing is
about being  the star of a family?

528
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,474
The expectations.

529
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:10,175
So,what happened?

530
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:12,776
She started taking pills...

531
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,577
First,so she could stay awake.

532
00:35:15,778 --> 00:35:18,078
Then,so she could get through finals.

533
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,980
Then,because she couldn't live without them.

534
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:28,282
By the time she got to med school,
it was,like, the perfect storm.

535
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,884
She was pushing herself harder than she ever had.

536
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:33,385
She had easier access  to prescriptions.

537
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:38,614
There were times when i wondered
what my mother would think of

538
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:41,674
her wonder girl turning into a drug addict.

539
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,690
I thought about telling her.

540
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:49,391
But then i just realized she would resent me
even more for bursting the bubble.

541
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:51,993
I tried to cfront sydney about it.

542
00:35:52,094 --> 00:35:53,994
- I'll quit tomorrow. I swear.
- No,you won't!

543
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:55,795
You've said that before.

544
00:35:55,896 --> 00:35:58,496
Please,please,i have my chem final tomorrow.
No,give me those--

545
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:01,097
Don't you do that. Oh,my god,nikki!

546
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:02,798
No...what did you do?!

547
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,299
nikki,no!

548
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,800
Nikki, what are you doing?!

549
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:11,001
God! Please! Nikki!

550
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,603
That was the last conversation we had.

551
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:18,004
- How does brandon fit in?
- He went out with sydney in college.

552
00:36:19,507 --> 00:36:24,107
She taught him the secrets
of staying up 3 nights in a row to study.

553
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:27,809
But he got addicted,too, except that he got help.

554
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,810
Sydney didn't want to. That's why they broke up.

555
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:34,112
And that's why you called him for help.

556
00:36:34,313 --> 00:36:37,213
I called him
because i knew how he had kicked his habit.

557
00:36:38,215 --> 00:36:42,115
He had some friends take him to an abandoned cabin
so he could go cold turkey.

558
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:46,617
It's the hardest way to go,
but it was the only thing he could do.

559
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,819
So,it was was never a kidnapping.

560
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
It was an intervention.

561
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:53,221
We thought we could do it in private.

562
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:54,822
get me out of here,please!

563
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,823
We moved her to this cabin after she passed out.

564
00:36:56,924 --> 00:36:57,924
Let me go!

565
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:00,524
We took turns taking care of her--

566
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:03,525
Feeding her, getting her through it.

567
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:07,827
Who did this? Who did this?!
Get me out of here!

568
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:10,428
I went out for an hour, just to get some air.

569
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,130
Time for your bathroom break.

570
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:14,131
- But when i did...
- Brandon,no.

571
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,731
Brandon took her to the bathroom and she hit him.

572
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:23,134
She put his clothes on and left.

573
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:27,235
We searched for hours...days.

574
00:37:28,138 --> 00:37:29,938
But we couldn't find her.

575
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:32,038
Why didn't you call the police?

576
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:35,239
We just kept telling ourselves
that she would show up...

577
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:38,141
Back at school or home.

578
00:37:38,742 --> 00:37:41,142
Then it just started to snowball.

579
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:46,144
We didn't want my mom knowing
what was wrong with sydney.

580
00:37:47,346 --> 00:37:49,946
And i didn't want her knowing what i had done.

581
00:37:51,248 --> 00:37:53,748
I knew mom would really hate me

582
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,350
if anything happened to sydney because of me.

583
00:37:59,852 --> 00:38:01,652
And then she called the police.

584
00:38:02,953 --> 00:38:05,153
And i was so scared.

585
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:09,255
I didn't know what to do.

586
00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:14,657
So,i did nothing.

587
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,959
I don't believe you.

588
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,460
I would have known
if sydney had a problem like that.

589
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,261
She would have told me. I would have seen it.

590
00:38:21,362 --> 00:38:22,962
No,you wouldn't have,mom.

591
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:25,262
You only saw flaws in me, not sydney.

592
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:27,963
- That's not true.
- It is.

593
00:38:28,965 --> 00:38:30,565
It is true.

594
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:34,267
Susan...

595
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:37,968
Sydney is here with us, right now.

596
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:41,069
And she wants you to listen to nikki.

597
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,571
No. This is some trick.

598
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:47,972
The two of you couldn't stand each other,
and now you're working together?

599
00:38:48,974 --> 00:38:50,574
I trusted you.

600
00:38:50,775 --> 00:38:54,475
But you are a fraud and a liar, just like the rest.

601
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:58,077
If i wanted to lie to you,
I'd tell you what you want to hear.

602
00:38:58,178 --> 00:39:00,178
Get out of my house.

603
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,579
Now.

604
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
Tell her it's time for
the training wheels to come off.

605
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:07,781
She says it's time for
the training wheels to come off.

606
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:14,885
That's something my dad used to say...

607
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:21,087
Whenever someone was
complaining something was too hard.

608
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,890
I know how difficult this must be for you.

609
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,691
But sydney does have a message for you.

610
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,992
She can't move on until you hear it.

611
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,799
I know nikki was trying to help me.

612
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,600
I couldn't find my way through those woods.
I just fell.

613
00:39:50,302 --> 00:39:52,202
Please tell her to believe me.

614
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:55,903
She knows that you were just trying to help her

615
00:39:56,004 --> 00:39:58,404
and everything that happened wasn't your fault.

616
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:01,206
I don't deserve that.

617
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:04,307
I don't deserve forgiveness.

618
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:07,809
She lost so much because of me.

619
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,029
And that's why i had to stay here.

620
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:11,421
I had to make sure
mom wouldn't be too hard on her,

621
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:13,811
Wouldn't see her as a disappointment.

622
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,913
She doesn't want you to blame nikki.

623
00:40:20,015 --> 00:40:22,515
Nikki did what she did because she loved me.

624
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:27,116
Even though mom always put her second,
even though  she lived in my shadow,

625
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,519
She looked out for me.

626
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,520
Tell her nikki needs her now more than ever.

627
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:38,322
I want my mom to see her, to know her...

628
00:40:40,124 --> 00:40:45,124
Not who my mom wants her to be, but who she is.

629
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,527
It's her turn now.

630
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:50,628
I'll tell her.

631
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:57,631
You were always the princess.

632
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,433
I was the toad.

633
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,341
I think i can go now.

634
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:23,742
She's ready to cross over.

635
00:41:30,547 --> 00:41:32,547
Bye-bye,sweetheart.

636
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:36,849
Tell them i'm happy now.

637
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,550
They should be,too.

638
00:41:44,953 --> 00:41:48,353
She's happy now. She's at peace.

639
00:41:50,356 --> 00:41:53,056
There are some things she wanted us to tell you...

640
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:57,058
go from your heart.

641
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,560
<i>{6}Sarah Mclachlan "world on fire"</i>

642
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,261
Sydney loves you.

643
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:16,566
I just don't know how to describe that experience

644
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,068
So simple but yet so profound.

645
00:42:19,669 --> 00:42:23,469
No smoke and mirrors,
just people trying to reach out to each other.

646
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:25,971
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

647
00:42:26,772 --> 00:42:28,172
Nikki gonna be ok?

648
00:42:28,473 --> 00:42:29,673
Yeah,i think so.

649
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:32,274
County said they wouldn't file any charges.

650
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:37,475
You know,if i could do what you do,
I would shout it from the rooftops.

651
00:42:37,877 --> 00:42:42,977
In fact, i can't do what you do,
but i still shout it from the rooftops.

652
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,580
You have a gift, you kn--

653
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:51,881
An instinct about people,
to make them see things they're not aware of.

654
00:42:52,984 --> 00:42:55,184
I couldn't have done this without you.

655
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:57,786
Thank you.

656
00:42:57,886 --> 00:42:59,486
Uh,excuse me, are you casey edgars?

657
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:02,687
