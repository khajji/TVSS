00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:16,200
Bill Buchanan had Fayed
in custody...

4
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,900
and he let him go.

5
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:23,367
Karen Hayes put it
in a blue file over at Homeland.

6
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,234
Someone is going to have
to go down--

7
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:27,167
the farther from the
president, the better.

8
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:28,701
Are you asking me to resign?

9
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:29,701
HAYES:
No, Bill.

10
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:31,234
I have to fire you.

11
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:33,234
We're talking about
the end of my career.

12
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,401
An FB sub-circuit board
from one of the weapons

13
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,601
is now in the possession
of an agent

14
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:40,567
of the Chinese government.

15
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:41,867
If the Chinese agent

16
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,100
in possession
of the sub-circuit board

17
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,734
is allowed to transfer it
to his government,

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,867
the entire Russian defense
system will be compromised.

19
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:52,701
I will have no choice
but to extend

20
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:55,134
my country's
forward perimeter.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,100
You are talking about attacking
one of our military bases.

22
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,301
You have two hours.

23
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,134
Everyone on the floor!

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,668
CHENG:
My men have your grandson.

25
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:06,933
Have you finished repairing
the sub-circuit board?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,100
I'll return it when you bring me
my grandson.

27
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:11,367
Cheng, I'm sending the boy
to you now.

28
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:15,634
Hello, Josh.

29
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,467
Your grandfather
wants to speak with you.

30
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:19,134
What do you want from me?

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,501
I am going to give you
the future I promised you

32
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:22,933
when you were born.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,401
I'm taking you away
from this ungrateful country.

34
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:36,034
Cheng, it's over!

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,534
Tell me where the boy is
and I won't kill you.

36
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:40,367
Help!

37
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,867
Josh!

38
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:42,867
Dad...

39
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:45,467
(grunting)

40
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:48,401
I lost the boy.

41
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,501
PHILLIP:
Who has him?

42
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,200
CTU and your son.

43
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,267
This is totally unacceptable.

44
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:56,833
The boy was my price
for repairing the circuit board.

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,301
Our arrangement is over.

46
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,967
Got Phillip Bauer calling

47
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,501
for you on
a scrambled line.

48
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,967
I want my grandson.

49
00:02:03,034 --> 00:02:06,000
And I want clear passage
to the country of my choice.

50
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,334
You give me that

51
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,167
and I'll give you
the FB sub-circuit board.

52
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:12,200
You're working with the Chinese.

53
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:13,200
I was.

54
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:14,467
You think Phillip Bauer

55
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,067
is somebody
that we can trust?

56
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,401
We have no choice.

57
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,668
Get me CTU.

58
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,833
Josh, you need to come
with me.

59
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,833
What do you mean?!

60
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,867
Come now!

61
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:23,933
Agent Doyle!

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Orders, Jack!

63
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,634
The boy stays with me!

64
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,668
What are you doing?!

65
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:29,933
Josh!

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,867
Where are you taking me?

67
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,134
I thought we were going back
to CTU.

68
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,067
I'm sorry, Josh.

69
00:03:04,134 --> 00:03:08,567
You're sorry for what?
What's going on?

70
00:03:08,634 --> 00:03:11,134
This has to do
with my grandpa.

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,367
Josh, he's got something
we need.

72
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:16,334
Something that
will stop a war.

73
00:03:16,401 --> 00:03:17,967
So we have to go through
the motions

74
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:19,467
of handing you
over to him.

75
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:23,134
What, meaning you're not
actually going to do it?

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,467
Meaning as soon as we
get what we need from him,

77
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:26,900
we're gonna recover you.

78
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:30,668
We have two Tac teams
and LAPD at the rendezvous site.

79
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,734
This is a locating device, Josh.

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,701
So we're going
to be able to track you

81
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:38,967
until we get
the green light

82
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:41,367
on your recovery
operation.

83
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:44,800
Look, I understand
you're scared.

84
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,434
I would be, too.

85
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:49,134
But I will get you
back, Josh.

86
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,634
This may sting
a little.

87
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:58,167
Ow!

88
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:14,200
Ryan, we are making
a mistake.

89
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,768
You can't let
them do this.

90
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,267
You can talk
to Doyle.

91
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:19,034
You can't let
them hand Josh
over to my father.

92
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,467
Those orders come
from the White House.

93
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:21,734
Get in the car.

94
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,167
Are you arresting me?

95
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,434
Are you charging me
with something?
No, Jack,

96
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:26,034
we have orders to place you
in temporary

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,000
custody in order to
protect our operation.

98
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,567
Don't make this harder
than it is.

99
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,234
(indistinct radio transmission)

100
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:45,668
(sighs)
(phone rings)

101
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:47,734
O'Brian.

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,867
Chloe, it's Jack.

103
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,034
Jack, Nadia said
you were in custody.

104
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,267
Why the hell is CTU handing
Josh over to my father?

105
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,601
It's a tradeoff.
The order came in
from the Vice President.

106
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:58,867
Your father got
ahold of the FB
sub-circuit board.

107
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,833
He's offering it
in exchange for Josh

108
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,668
and a safe passage
out of the country.

109
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:04,933
Whatever my father said,
he has no intention

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,367
of giving up
that circuit board.

111
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,334
The White House feels
they have no alternative.

112
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:11,000
Apparently, Doyle
has a plan to get Josh back.

113
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,833
My father will have
a better plan.

114
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,301
Damn it, Chloe,
we need to stop this.

115
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,067
Put me through to Karen Hayes.

116
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,100
Hold on.

117
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:23,200
My earlier deception
was a desperate move

118
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,734
on my part,
Mr. President.

119
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,634
It was a mistake

120
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,933
which I'm sure compromised
your trust in me,

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,534
and for that I'm deeply sorry.

122
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:36,134
But you are not calling
simply to offer your apology.

123
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,034
Sir, I'm aware that your
generals are pushing you toward

124
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,234
a military response, but an
opportunity has presented itself

125
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,634
that may allow us both
to avoid a war

126
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,367
that neither of us wants.

127
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:50,800
I am listening.

128
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:52,701
The man who has the component
is no longer working

129
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:53,833
with the Chinese.

130
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,768
He's offered to trade it
back to us,

131
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,334
and I've authorized
the exchange.

132
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,768
For the sake of both our
countries, Mr. Vice President,

133
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,401
I hope it happens soon,

134
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,401
because until you have
the component,

135
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:08,800
I have no choice but to continue
on our present path.

136
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,434
(phone rings)
The chatter
we are picking up

137
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,501
from Chinese military
intelligence

138
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,933
is not encouraging,

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,034
and you and I both know
they are far from incompetent.

140
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,900
I cannot extend or rescind
this deadline

141
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:22,167
for anything other
than concrete results.

142
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:24,234
I understand your position,
Mr. President.

143
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,200
The purpose of this call
is just to keep you current

144
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:30,167
on our efforts to try
to avoid a conflict.

145
00:06:31,434 --> 00:06:32,501
Karen Hayes.

146
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:33,933
JACK:
This is Bauer.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,234
Do you know of the Vice
President's plan

148
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,867
to hand my nephew over
to my father?

149
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,034
I do.

150
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,701
Karen, you cannot let
this happen.

151
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:41,334
It is a mistake
to trust my father.

152
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,634
You will get
nothing back.

153
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:45,134
He's gonna keep Josh
and the circuit board.

154
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,867
But why would he need
the circuit board?

155
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,067
Because it's his
only leverage

156
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:49,067
with the Chinese.

157
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,701
He's useless
to them without it.

158
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:53,534
Whatever you're offering him,
the Chinese are offering more.

159
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,267
Karen, my father is smart enough
to manipulate this exchange.

160
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,134
Look, Jack, I don't think

161
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,701
we should go through
with this either,

162
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:04,668
but the Vice President feels
it's the only way to avoid war.

163
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,467
He's given his order

164
00:07:06,534 --> 00:07:08,567
and I don't have
the authority to
do anything.

165
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,401
You're gonna have
to take care of this

166
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:11,734
from your end.

167
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,034
I can't. CTU has put me
in temporary custody

168
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,701
to stop me from interfering
with their operation.

169
00:07:16,768 --> 00:07:20,933
Karen, he is
an innocent boy.

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,933
You need to stop this,
and you need to stop it now.

171
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,668
Well, that did not go well.

172
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:38,367
Not that I expected much
good will from Suvarov.

173
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:40,900
I just got off
the phone with Jack Bauer.

174
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,734
I thought he was
under arrest.

175
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,401
He is, but he called me.

176
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:46,301
Okay, he called you...

177
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:50,034
Yes, and he's convinced that his
father will try to get the boy

178
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
and the circuit board.

179
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,100
How's he gonna do that?

180
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,034
We can verify the authenticity
of the board

181
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,134
before we hand over Josh.

182
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,334
You think Jack's concerns
are warranted?

183
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:03,601
Absolutely. He's Phillip Bauer's
son and he's been more right

184
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:04,900
than we have today.

185
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,768
Well, point taken there.

186
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,200
All right, let's say
we refuse to give up Josh,

187
00:08:09,267 --> 00:08:11,334
which is the only thing
Phillip Bauer

188
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:13,467
seems to want.
How do we get the circuit board?

189
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,800
Well, if you don't have
any ideas, I think I might.

190
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,034
Wait. If your idea involves
keeping Daniels in the dark...

191
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,301
Tom, he won't listen
to me, but if you...

192
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,867
My relationship
with the Vice President

193
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:25,668
is complicated, at best.

194
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:27,234
I can't be seen making

195
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:29,067
an end run around him.

196
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,067
But I promise I won't be
looking your way if you do.

197
00:08:49,134 --> 00:08:50,734
(cell phone rings)

198
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:56,900
(snaps phone shut)

199
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,567
Hey. Hey!

200
00:09:01,634 --> 00:09:04,501
That's personal.
Nothing you need in there.

201
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,534
Mr. Buchanan, our subpoena
covers everything. I'm sorry.

202
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,534
It's a family photo album,
for crying out loud.

203
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:11,100
You haven't been
charged with

204
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,634
any crimes yet,
but that could change.

205
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:19,867
(phone rings)

206
00:09:22,034 --> 00:09:23,434
RECORDING:
You've reached
the Buchanan residence.

207
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:24,900
Please leave a message.

208
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:28,067
HAYES:
Bill, I know you're there.
Please pick up.

209
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,434
Look, I know
you don't want
to talk to me,

210
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,501
but I really need
your help.

211
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,601
I don't know where else
to turn.

212
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:42,768
What do you mean, you don't know
where else to turn?

213
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,768
Are you okay?

214
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,900
No, I'm fine.

215
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,800
I just...
I really need your help.

216
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:47,967
I'm listening.

217
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:49,800
Thank you.

218
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:52,467
I know that you're angry
with me, and I don't blame you.

219
00:09:52,534 --> 00:09:54,100
What do you need
from me, Karen?

220
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,668
I just got off
the phone with Jack.

221
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,634
He's being held
in custody by CTU.

222
00:09:58,701 --> 00:09:59,634
Why?

223
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:00,867
Because they don't want him

224
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,967
to interfere
with an ongoing operation.

225
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,000
What operation?

226
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,234
Phillip Bauer

227
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:06,634
is now in possession
of the component.

228
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:08,200
What?

229
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,534
And he's claiming that he will
trade the sub-circuit board

230
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,067
for his grandson,
but Jack thinks it's a setup;

231
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,701
that Phillip will
get the boy,

232
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:15,967
keep the component,

233
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:17,900
and make a deal
with the Chinese.

234
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,467
I completely agree.

235
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:21,134
Have you spoken
to Nadia Yassir?

236
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,867
Oh, she won't budge
on this thing.

237
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,000
She's under direct orders
from the Vice President.

238
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:32,334
What are you asking
me to do, Karen?

239
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,034
Whatever it takes
to stop the exchange.

240
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,167
Nadia,

241
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:59,234
we just touched down
at the meeting point

242
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,833
and I'm not seeing any activity.

243
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,200
Satellite surveillance
confirms that.

244
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,301
How's the signal
on Josh's tracker?

245
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,534
Coming in clear.

246
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,367
Tracker's signal's strong.

247
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,301
Wait here.
I'm gonna check it out.

248
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,100
Come on.

249
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,000
(cell phone rings)

250
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:58,668
CTU, I've got a call coming in.
It could be him.

251
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,234
Morris, can you trace the call?

252
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:01,567
The signal's scrambled,

253
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:03,401
but we're still patched
into Doyle's phone,

254
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,634
so we'll be able to listen to
both sides of the conversation.

255
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,434
All right, Mike.
Go ahead. Answer it.

256
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:09,301
This is Doyle.

257
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,034
Before we do anything,

258
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,467
I want CTU to turn off
the satellite feed.

259
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:15,334
What are you talking about?

260
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:20,000
I have an uplink.

261
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,768
I know when
they're watching.

262
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:24,534
And I know when
they're off-line.

263
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,534
Stand by.

264
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:30,467
Nadia, can we tell
if he's bluffing?

265
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:31,900
MORRIS:
Yeah.

266
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,267
He's not bluffing.
He's absolutely in our system.

267
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:35,067
How?

268
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:37,100
I don't know.

269
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,668
Mike, we have confirmation that

270
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,933
Phillip Bauer has tapped
into our satellite surveillance.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,734
Can he see
Josh's tracker signal?

272
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,833
No. That's on
an internal network.

273
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,401
All right.
Then go off-line.

274
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,467
Tell LAPD and
the Tac teams

275
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:52,701
to keep a really
wide perimeter

276
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:53,800
outside the
satellite area.

277
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,967
We can't afford
to spook him.

278
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:57,267
Morris, shut down the satellite.

279
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:59,067
Marcy, let LAPD
and our teams know.

280
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:00,567
On it.

281
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,701
It's done.

282
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,734
Mike, satellite is off-line.

283
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,100
Mr. Bauer,
CTU's satellite is off-line.

284
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,833
I can see that.

285
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:13,867
Now get rid of the chopper.

286
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:16,701
Aerial One,

287
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:19,534
return to base.
That's an order.

288
00:13:27,668 --> 00:13:29,900
Now, how do you want
to work the exchange?

289
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,668
Wait there. Someone will come.

290
00:13:32,734 --> 00:13:33,668
When?

291
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:34,833
Whenever I'm damn well

292
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,668
ready.

293
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,234
Put my grandson on the phone.

294
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,167
Your grandfather.
He wants to speak with you.

295
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,567
But don't fight him, Josh.

296
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:48,034
Okay? The easier he thinks
this is going to go,

297
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,701
the less on-guard
he's going to be.

298
00:13:56,534 --> 00:13:57,967
Yeah.

299
00:13:58,034 --> 00:13:59,833
Hello, Joshua.

300
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,534
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?

301
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:05,668
Yes. And I don't want
to go anywhere with you.

302
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:08,334
I hate you!

303
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,967
Joshua, listen to me.

304
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:13,601
I understand you're
frightened and angry.

305
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:15,800
But your father's
involvement in
what happened today

306
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,267
will soon be
public knowledge.

307
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:20,167
Staying in this country
is not an option.

308
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,668
There's nothing here for you.

309
00:14:21,734 --> 00:14:23,768
My mom's here.

310
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,634
Your mother can join you
anytime she wants.

311
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,334
But she is incapable of
giving you what you need.

312
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,634
Where we're going, I will
have the means and the power

313
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,234
to help you become
the kind of man

314
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,567
 your father
 <i>should</i> have been.

315
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:39,534
Now, you think about that.

316
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,967
#No sign of anyone so far.

317
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:13,301
Yeah. We're still looking for
ways to get satellite coverage

318
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:14,967
without Phillip Bauer knowing,
but so far,

319
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:16,934
it looks like
he's covered all his bases.

320
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,268
Yeah. That doesn't surprise me.

321
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,400
How do I verify
the component's real,

322
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:22,034
once they hand it over?

323
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,400
Chloe?

324
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:26,134
The component has an R-7-2
socket on its underside.

325
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:28,001
When you plug
your PDA into that,

326
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:30,201
I'll be able to verify
the circuitry from here.

327
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:31,634
Good.

328
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,767
Nadia, once I know
the component's real,

329
00:15:37,834 --> 00:15:40,800
if I see a chance to get the kid
back, I'm gonna take it.

330
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:41,934
No, you're not, Mike.

331
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,400
Look, I want to see
Josh safe, too,

332
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:45,001
but we're under strict orders
from the White House.

333
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:47,400
We're not authorized
to retrieve him
until the component's

334
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:48,867
back at CTU.

335
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:51,368
I'm not talking about
what I'm authorized to do.

336
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,667
Well, I am. Mike, there's
too much at stake.

337
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:56,001
You're not going
off-book on this. Understood?

338
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,067
Mike, do you confirm?

339
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:03,067
MARCY: Nadia, I have
Karen Hayes on two.

340
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:05,467
All right. Put it through
to my cell phone.

341
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,067
Mike, I have to take this call.

342
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,567
You're on com
with Chloe and Morris.

343
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,700
Yeah. I'll keep them posted.

344
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,867
Yes, Ms. Hayes?

345
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:16,334
Nadia, the Vice President
would like to check

346
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,134
on the status
of the trade with Phillip Bauer.

347
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:19,600
Well, the agent
handling the exchange

348
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,700
is in position with the boy

349
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:22,101
and he's waiting
to be contacted.

350
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,500
I did tell the White House

351
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,368
that I would report in
as soon as that happened.

352
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,167
Yes, I know,
but I just wanted

353
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:28,834
to make sure that
everyone's onboard.

354
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:31,268
That no one,
including yourself,
has any doubts

355
00:16:31,334 --> 00:16:33,467
that this is the right
course of action.

356
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,634
The order comes from
the Vice President.

357
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,767
It's not being
questioned.

358
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:37,700
What's the status
of Jack Bauer?

359
00:16:37,767 --> 00:16:40,700
He's currently being transferred
to the detention at District.

360
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:43,167
Good. I need to be able
to view the operation

361
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:45,767
on your internal
deployment grid.

362
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,067
Do you mind me asking why?

363
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,134
Yes, actually, I do.
The Vice President

364
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,967
wants me
to keep track of Jack Bauer,

365
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:56,567
so I need the security code now,
please.

366
00:16:56,634 --> 00:16:59,334
Right away.

367
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:11,834
Log onto the grid on nine-four.

368
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:14,167
Security code
Alpha-Charlie-November.

369
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:26,467
Got it. Thank you.

370
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,433
I just got a call
from Security.

371
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,934
You better head over
to the lounge.

372
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:32,500
Why? What's the problem?

373
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:33,734
Marilyn Bauer.

374
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:47,134
I'm not a prisoner,
so stop treating me like one.

375
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:49,767
I want to see my son,
and I want to see him now!

376
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,800
And if you can't
tell me where he is,

377
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,533
I will find somebody who can!

378
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,800
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

379
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,400
Listen, Mrs. Bauer.

380
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:00,234
If you just calm down,
we can talk.

381
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,967
Did something happen?
Did he get hurt?

382
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,967
No. Josh is fine.
(sighs)

383
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:05,234
He's just being
held at Division.

384
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:06,400
They want to debrief him
while events

385
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:07,901
are still fresh in his mind.

386
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,001
You have no right to talk
to my son if I'm not there.

387
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:11,967
He needs to have
a parent present. I want to be

388
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:14,101
with my son!
I understand what
you're going through.

389
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,800
No! You have no idea
what I'm going through!

390
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,400
And if you don't
get me to him

391
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:19,967
right now,
I'm going to get our lawyers,

392
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,301
and I will take
this whole place down,

393
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,700
including you!

394
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:25,734
(muttering)

395
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,001
(phone rings)

396
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,167
O'Brian.

397
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:29,268
Morris, I need
you to send

398
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:30,867
additional security
to the lounge area

399
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,834
to escort Mrs. Bauer
to holding.

400
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:34,700
MARILYN:
I want my son!

401
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,234
You can't keep me here!

402
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,934
They're on their way.

403
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,201
NADIA:
Thanks.
This is Morris O'Brian.

404
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,368
Can I have two additional
security to the lounge area

405
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,368
to escort Marilyn Bauer
to Holding, please?

406
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:45,967
Thank you.

407
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,600
What?
It doesn't bother you

408
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:51,600
that we're doing this?

409
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,001
What if we don't
get Josh back?

410
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,433
Phillip Bauer
is a murderer.

411
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,934
I don't like it-- I hate it--
but we have our orders.

412
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:59,667
Since when do you care
about orders?

413
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,634
We're trying to avoid
starting a war.

414
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,134
Speaking as someone
that placed a lot

415
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:04,567
of people's lives at risk today,

416
00:19:04,634 --> 00:19:07,301
I can see why it's
necessary. Yes.
Jack thinks

417
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:08,834
we're being manipulated.

418
00:19:08,901 --> 00:19:11,101
That his father has no intention
of giving us the component back.

419
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,934
I don't think
we can count on Jack

420
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,201
being objective
about his father right now.

421
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:17,567
Who cares if he's being
objective, if he's right?

422
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,834
Are you actually angry at me?
As if I'm the one

423
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:21,700
that made the decision
to go through with this?

424
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:25,034
No. I... It's just
that Josh didn't do anything.

425
00:19:25,101 --> 00:19:26,268
He's innocent.

426
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,800
Chloe, keep a close eye on
Josh's tracker. If that signal

427
00:19:36,867 --> 00:19:38,901
weakens even a little,
I want to know about it

428
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,368
immediately.
I will.

429
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:46,400
CTU, this is Doyle.

430
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:47,967
You're on with O'Brian.

431
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,934
I've got a helicopter
approaching out of the north.

432
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:52,268
It's too far
to read its markings.

433
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:53,734
You think it might
be Phillip Bauer?

434
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,734
I don't know, Morris.

435
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,167
That's why I'm asking you.

436
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,667
All right.
No need to get testy.

437
00:19:57,734 --> 00:20:00,533
Pulling up the FAA database now.

438
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,834
Coast Guard has
a helicopter patrol

439
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,368
just west of
your position.

440
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:06,368
It's not Phillip Bauer.

441
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,734
All right. Thanks.

442
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,500
Doyle?
Yeah?

443
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:12,067
I know that a lot
of people disagree
with this operation.

444
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,334
I just want you to know
that what you're doing,

445
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,034
I think, is
absolutely necessary.

446
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:20,234
Morris, the next time
I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

447
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:24,134
Fair enough.

448
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:40,634
What is this lunatic doing?

449
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,800
(horn honking)

450
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,201
(tires screeching)

451
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,734
Don't move.

452
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,001
Get your handcuffs out.

453
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,767
Do it!

454
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,034
Mr. Buchanan?

455
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,967
What the hell are you doing?

456
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,600
You have Jack Bauer in there?

457
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,134
TURNER:
We have orders to transport
him to Detention at District.

458
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,834
I need you to release
him to me.

459
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,234
Mr. Buchanan, you've been
relieved of duty.

460
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,901
You know me, Turner.
I'm no threat to anyone.

461
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:19,368
I'm not even armed.
Stay where you are, sir.

462
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,400
You're not going
to shoot me, Turner.
Sir, you need to

463
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:23,634
stop coming at me. You know
what I'll have to do.

464
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,667
You don't have
to do anything.

465
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,533
You're a good
man, Turner.

466
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,167
I trained you.
I know you can't
possibly believe

467
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:30,567
what's happening
here is right.

468
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:33,867
I know you're
following orders,

469
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,767
but your oath of allegiance
is not to one single person.

470
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,368
You swore to uphold
the Constitution
of the United States.

471
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:42,634
The orders you're
following are illegal.

472
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,134
You have an opportunity
here, Turner.

473
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,567
Don't blow it.

474
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:49,334
Agent Turner, put
the weapon down.

475
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,334
Put it down.

476
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,368
They hand Josh over
to my father yet?

477
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:56,934
No. Doyle's in position
with the boy.

478
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,533
He's awaiting instructions
from your father.

479
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,134
Okay.

480
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,067
Let's go.

481
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:21,134
Karen explain
everything to you?

482
00:22:21,201 --> 00:22:22,400
Yeah.

483
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,734
Thank you for doing this.

484
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,667
You don't have to thank me.

485
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:28,467
You put yourself on the line.
I appreciate it.

486
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:31,067
Let's just hope you're right
about your father.

487
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:34,167
Unfortunately, I am.

488
00:23:03,534 --> 00:23:05,200
#Thank you.

489
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,267
(whispers):
Stuart...

490
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:17,868
Morris...

491
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,534
find out who that is.

492
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:30,667
I'm so sorry.

493
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:33,200
I don't believe we've met.

494
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:34,868
Morris O'Brian.

495
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:37,067
This is Stuart-- Milo's brother.

496
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,968
Oh, I'm so very sorry.

497
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,133
Very sorry.

498
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,000
I have to sign a release
for his body.

499
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,501
I'll help you
with the paperwork.

500
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,534
Come on.

501
00:23:46,601 --> 00:23:48,167
Thanks, Chloe.

502
00:23:48,234 --> 00:23:50,834
He was
a good man.

503
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:01,734
It's Milo's brother, Stuart.

504
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:25,000
(phone ringing)

505
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:26,400
Hi, Karen.

506
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,667
Hi.
I've got Jack.
We're on our way.

507
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:31,601
I just... I wanted
to thank you.

508
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:35,100
You didn't have to do this.
You made a big sacrifice.

509
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:36,734
I'm not the only one.

510
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,601
Won't be long before
they figure out how I
was able to locate Jack.

511
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:42,133
Yeah, well,
they already have.

512
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,234
I've just been
denied access.

513
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,334
They're probably on their way
to arrest me.

514
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,167
Listen...

515
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:51,868
I don't know when they'll let us
speak to each other again,

516
00:24:51,934 --> 00:24:54,467
so I just want you to know
that I'm so sorry.

517
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,167
And I love you very much.

518
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:00,267
Me, too.

519
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,801
They're here.

520
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:08,167
Good luck.

521
00:25:12,167 --> 00:25:15,501
They're about
to arrest Karen.

522
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:23,901
Hi.

523
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,334
Stuart?

524
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,367
Yeah.

525
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm Nadia Yassir,
acting head of CTU.

526
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,367
We're in the middle
of an operation right now,

527
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:32,767
so I don't have much time.

528
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:35,501
I just wanted to meet you
and tell you how sorry I am.

529
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,267
I know your name.
My brother talked about you.

530
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:43,601
I'd like to know
how he died.

531
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,200
Your brother died
saving my life.

532
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,100
He saw that I was in danger,

533
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,467
and he stood up for me
and sacrificed himself.

534
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:00,067
He was very brave.

535
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,033
No, he wasn't.

536
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,634
Not really.

537
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,400
It's more that he was
really in love with you.

538
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,667
(phone ringing)

539
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:13,834
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

540
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:20,634
Yeah, Chloe, go ahead.

541
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:22,901
Local police found
Agents Ryan and Turner

542
00:26:22,968 --> 00:26:24,467
handcuffed to their vehicle.

543
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,534
Jack escaped? How?

544
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:29,467
They were intercepted
by Bill Buchanan.

545
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,501
Are you sure?
Positive.

546
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:33,734
Why would Bill do
something like that?

547
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,434
Probably because
he agrees with Jack

548
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:36,801
that we shouldn't be
trading Josh

549
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:37,901
or trusting his father,

550
00:26:37,968 --> 00:26:39,300
regardless of what
the orders are.

551
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,734
Have Tac teams in the area

552
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,067
move into position
to intercept them.

553
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,634
They're already doing that.

554
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:49,667
I'm sorry, I had to, uh...

555
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,901
Mr. Doyle...

556
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:02,767
Yeah?

557
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:08,701
Listen, please don't do this.

558
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,601
Okay, my grandpa's crazy.

559
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,868
Okay, just please,
just let me go.

560
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:27,000
Josh... your country
needs you to do this.

561
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,868
I'll get you
back, Josh.

562
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:32,901
I give you my word.

563
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,934
Doyle, this is Nadia.
Do you copy?

564
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,033
Go ahead, Nadia.

565
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,734
Any sign of
Phillip Bauer yet?

566
00:27:40,801 --> 00:27:41,801
None yet.

567
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,934
Mike, Jack escaped
from custody.

568
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,868
We have to assume
he's on his way to you

569
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:46,234
to try and stop
the exchange.

570
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,400
How the hell does Jack
even know where we are?

571
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,934
Karen Hayes told him
and gave him your location.

572
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,868
Bill Buchanan
helped him escape.

573
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:54,000
Damn it.

574
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,767
I've got Tac teams
ready to move in.

575
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,000
Look, you know we can't
bring more men in.

576
00:27:58,067 --> 00:27:59,467
Phillip Bauer will
spot them on satellite

577
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:00,767
and he'll pull
out of this.

578
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,133
Then you'll have
to face him alone.

579
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,200
I'll be fine.

580
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,234
Is my uncle coming?

581
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,100
Yeah.

582
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:34,033
#Excuse us, please.

583
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,734
(door closes)

584
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:41,901
I assume you know

585
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:44,033
why I ordered your detention.

586
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,834
I do.

587
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,567
Then you admit to using
information

588
00:28:47,634 --> 00:28:49,701
you got from CTU to assist
Bill Buchanan

589
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:51,701
in breaking Jack Bauer
out of custody.

590
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,267
Yes, I do, sir.

591
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,234
Karen...

592
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,801
you and I have had
our differences,

593
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,834
but I thought that we
had worked past them,

594
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:04,200
that you and I had finally
reached an understanding.

595
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:07,100
Clearly, I was mistaken.

596
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,367
What in the hell

597
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:10,868
were you thinking?

598
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:14,267
I learned a hard lesson
today, sir,

599
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:15,467
when I trusted Fayed.

600
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:16,868
What lesson was that?

601
00:29:16,934 --> 00:29:19,033
Never negotiate

602
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,567
with a sociopath.

603
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,767
Phillip Bauer is
a sociopath.

604
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,968
We can't trust
that he'll give us
that component

605
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,434
whether we give him
the boy or not.

606
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,968
Damn it, Karen, that is
not your call to make.

607
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,300
I understand that, sir.

608
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,234
I wouldn't have done
what I did

609
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,701
if I wasn't willing to accept
the consequences.

610
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:40,767
Oh, believe me, there will
be consequences.

611
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,667
I will make sure that you
and your husband

612
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:44,567
go down hard for this.

613
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:50,367
(sighs)

614
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,467
You know, it was Tom Lennox

615
00:29:53,534 --> 00:29:55,467
who said your different
point of view would be

616
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:57,501
an asset to my team,
and I believed him.

617
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,434
Was he in on this with you?

618
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,567
No, sir.

619
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:05,601
He didn't know anything
about this.

620
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:19,234
Karen...

621
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,434
if Jack Bauer prevents this
exchange from happening,

622
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:25,167
the Russians will attack
our forces in Central Asia.

623
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:31,100
Any blood that is spilled
will be on you.

624
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,634
(knocks twice)

625
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,167
(door closes)

626
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:47,133
(phone ringing)

627
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:50,667
CTU, I've got
an incoming call.

628
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,801
Yeah.

629
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:55,167
Take Josh and walk
toward the water.

630
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:56,467
We're on our way.

631
00:30:56,534 --> 00:30:58,901
Nadia, did you
get that?

632
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:01,033
Yes. Agent Doyle,
be careful.

633
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,400
We need to go, Josh.

634
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,801
Tracker shows them moving

635
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:19,067
towards the water.

636
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,501
MORRIS:
Chloe...

637
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:22,567
Chloe.

638
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:26,000
You all right?
You look a little pale.

639
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,133
I'm fine. Just tired.

640
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,033
(distant whooshing)

641
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,534
You hear that?
Yeah.

642
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,868
NADIA:
Mike, what do you have?

643
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:49,167
Nadia, we got two men
in a small watercraft
coming ashore.

644
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,667
We're taking cover.

645
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:52,734
(motor humming)

646
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,000
You stay here,
understand?

647
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,968
Don't move.

648
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:24,834
Stop right there.

649
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:32,968
Send the kid down now.

650
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:35,067
Show the sub-circuit
board first.

651
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:39,567
I need to verify it.

652
00:32:39,634 --> 00:32:41,300
Walk forward.

653
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,367
Place it down.

654
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:46,801
Back up.

655
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,234
(screams)

656
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,467
Mike!

657
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:04,200
Mike, report in.

658
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,334
(grunting)

659
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:13,367
There they are.
They've got Josh.

660
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,868
I don't have a clear shot
without putting Josh at risk.

661
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:31,334
(gunfire)

662
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,167
Get down!

663
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:49,567
Doyle!

664
00:33:49,634 --> 00:33:50,701
We're gonna get you help.

665
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:53,300
The component was a fake.
It blew.

666
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:54,400
Take it easy, Doyle.

667
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:55,467
Help's on the way.

668
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,834
Stay with him,
I'm calling CTU.

669
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,834
(Doyle groaning)

670
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:04,534
Mr. Bauer.

671
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:05,801
PHILLIP:
Yeah.

672
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:07,701
We got the boy.

673
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,200
Be sure to scan him.

674
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:10,634
I don't trust CTU.

675
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:12,400
Yes, sir.

676
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,901
(whirring)

677
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:20,267
(rapid beeping)

678
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:22,167
They tagged him.

679
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,434
Short it out.

680
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,400
(electrical whoosh)
(yells)

681
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:27,868
It's done.

682
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:29,200
(computer blips)

683
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:31,234
We lost the tracker.

684
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,501
Try the backup frequency.

685
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:33,734
I did, it's gone.

686
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,601
Morris, get that satellite
back up now.

687
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm doing it.
(telephone rings)

688
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:38,701
CTU, Reynolds.

689
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,534
This is Bauer.
Patch me through to Nadia.

690
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:41,968
I got Jack Bauer on the line.

691
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:43,167
Put it on speakerphone.

692
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,601
Jack, this is Nadia.
Go ahead.

693
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,200
Nadia, I'm at the beach.

694
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:51,734
The component they delivered
to Doyle was a copy.

695
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,467
The case was loaded
with explosives.

696
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:55,501
They detonated it.
Doyle's been badly injured.

697
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,033
We need a trauma team
here now.

698
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm on it.
Aerial One.

699
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,400
Aerial One, return
to the drop-off point.

700
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,501
As we arrived, two of
my father's men and Josh

701
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,400
were headed out to sea
in a small boat.

702
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:06,267
Jack, they just disabled
Josh's tracker.

703
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:08,267
Your father forced us
to shut down satellite,
so it's gonna take us

704
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:10,701
a few minutes to get it back
up so we can track them.

705
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,767
How long is it gonna take
to get reinforcements?

706
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:14,300
Tac teams are
five minutes out.

707
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,667
Jack...

708
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:18,467
how bad is Agent Doyle?

709
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:20,367
Bad. We need
that trauma team.

710
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,100
Hurry.

711
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,134
#Sir...

712
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,534
Melinda said
you read the flash

713
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,467
regarding CTU's attempt
to make the exchange.

714
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:49,401
They're still
trying to track

715
00:35:49,467 --> 00:35:51,734
the watercraft Phillip Bauer's
men used to escape.

716
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,501
They've had no success yet.

717
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,234
Suvarov is expecting my call

718
00:35:56,301 --> 00:35:59,367
to confirm that we've
retrieved the component.

719
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:02,900
Well, my advice is give CTU
a few more minutes

720
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:04,601
before we call the Russians.

721
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:07,100
We could still
get lucky on this.

722
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,367
Karen was right.

723
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:10,401
Yes, sir.

724
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,668
She certainly was.

725
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:14,734
And I was wrong.

726
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:17,768
Not just about...

727
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,867
Karen, but about Wayne Palmer.

728
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,867
I judged his performance
as President unfairly.

729
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,701
What he faced
these past

730
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,301
weeks was
an impossible situation.

731
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:34,000
Maybe he was right

732
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,334
to reach out to Assad,
I don't know anymore.

733
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:40,634
You know, Tom...
it's easy

734
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:43,167
to think you've got
all the answers when none

735
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,134
of the ultimate responsibility
lies with you, but...

736
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,933
(sighs)

737
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,167
Sitting in this chair...

738
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:57,000
until you sit in this chair,
you don't know anything.

739
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:58,634
You can't know.

740
00:36:58,701 --> 00:37:01,768
Sir...

741
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,100
in view of the fact
that Karen was right,

742
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,067
you might want
to reconsider

743
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:08,167
your punitive stance
towards her.

744
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:10,134
My decision may have been wrong,

745
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,334
but I can't condone
that kind of insubordination.

746
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:14,100
Sir, you do not
want the facts

747
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,401
of your disagreement with Karen
made public.

748
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:20,034
And that's exactly what will
happen if you prosecute her.

749
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,301
After this crisis
has passed,

750
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,367
Karen Hayes and
Bill Buchanan

751
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:27,334
can retire quietly to
their country home in Vermont.

752
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:29,734
You will be honoring
her service.

753
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,000
It's just a better outcome
all around.

754
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:35,134
I'll take your advice
under consideration, Tom.

755
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,100
But right now, I need a real-
time update on CTU's progress.

756
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:41,933
All right, sir.

757
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:46,900
(door opens)

758
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,234
(door closes)

759
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,668
(sighs heavily)

760
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:55,900
This is Jack. The trauma
team doesn't believe

761
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,401
that Doyle's injuries
are life threatening,

762
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:59,768
but he's gonna be blind
in one, if not both eyes.

763
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,367
I should've listened to you,
Jack.

764
00:38:04,434 --> 00:38:06,034
You did what you
thought was right.

765
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,434
Is satellite
back up yet?

766
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:08,668
Any minute.

767
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:10,067
But it'll be
next to impossible

768
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:11,734
to find a craft that
size in the dark.

769
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,200
Their boat had limited range.

770
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:15,267
They must be meeting up
with a larger vessel.

771
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:22,634
NADIA:
Jack?
I want you to get me the names

772
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:25,234
and locations of every
offshore oil platform

773
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:26,967
within a ten-mile radius.

774
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,200
Wh
What are you thinking?

775
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,601
My father's company,

776
00:38:29,668 --> 00:38:31,833
BXJ, has shelter corporations.

777
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,167
They owned oil leases
up ande coast.

778
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:36,501
He didn't pick this location
at random.

779
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:37,534
I'm on it.

780
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,668
All right, Jack,

781
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,567
I'll let you know what we find.
Thanks.

782
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:01,301
Are you still in the clear?

783
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:02,601
All clear.

784
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:03,833
Good.

785
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,467
Dock on the northeast side
of the platform.

786
00:39:06,534 --> 00:39:08,501
Roger that.

787
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:15,467
They'll bring the boy here?

788
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:16,734
Yeah.

789
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,534
When do I get my component?

790
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:21,067
You get it when
they deliver the boy.

791
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:23,467
Good.

792
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:26,567
You're making the right choice,
continuing to work with us.

793
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:29,200
Your mistakes have been totally

794
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,701
unacceptable.

795
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:34,867
But China is still my future.

796
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,167
(sighs)

797
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:16,768
(beeps)

798
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:32,900
Morris, no luck tracing the oil
leases through the CNC servers.

799
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,434
Try the EPA database.

800
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:38,434
Coastal leases have to have
regulatory approval.

801
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:41,434
That's a good idea. Nadia'll
have to call in an access code.

802
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:44,734
Right.
Nadia...

803
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,833
You okay?

804
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,100
Yeah, I'm fine.

805
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:50,234
