1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,039
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON 24</i>

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,200
As someone who has alienated followers by choosing the unpopular course,

3
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:19,870
I suggest you tread carefully among your people.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,469
They will come after you.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,300
I need you to authorize clearance for someone to get inside the bunker.

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,154
Once he's inside, he'll carry the ball.

7
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:30,655
You mean, kill the president?

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,564
- We have a cover.
- A cover? Who?

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,269
Assad.

10
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,479
Assad?

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,819
You're trying to make it look like he did this?

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,480
This is tom lennox.
I need to speak to the ranking secret service agent on site.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,249
carson wondered if you were playing us.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,040
He said that he didn't want to bring you into this, but I defended you!

15
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:51,625
Nothing justifies the killing of a president.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,440
The delivery system software was programmed for five high-priority targets.

17
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,050
Because of your carelessness, we are now down to three.

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,525
More than enough for our needs, gredenko.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,225
I don't want to be exposed like this any longer than necessary.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,890
Do you think the authorities know we're working with fayed?

21
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:11,049
If they don't, they will soon.

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,089
Bill, it's jack.

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,710
I've got the correct address for gredenko's safe house.

24
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:17,295
Turner's team will be there any minute.

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,919
Clear!

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,779
Clear!

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,700
Mr.
Buchanan, there's no sign of gredenko or anyone.

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,179
now you talk.
That was from gredenko.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,960
You tipped him off.
Now over half my team is dead!

30
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:33,994
It wasn't gredenko on the phone.

31
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,259
Those aren't his men!

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,900
- Who sent them?!
- Your father!

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,359
He has my son!

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,940
Take a look out the window.
The adjacent roof.

35
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:44,589
Jack: Dad, it's over!

36
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,649
There is no empire to protect.

37
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,710
There's no legacy left.
I'm the one you want.

38
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:52,295
You let josh go, I will surrender.

39
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,529
You could have had it all.

40
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,184
What are you waiting for?

41
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,735
Do it!

42
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,700
- Who am i talking to?
- It's charles logan, jack.

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,930
You must have exhausted all your options to find gredenko.

44
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,561
Come and see me.

45
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:14,112
And come alone.

46
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,690
<i>THE FOLLOWING TAKES PLACE BETWEEN 4:00 P. M. AND 5:00 P. M</i>

47
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,699
Go ahead.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,344
We're on our way to the rendezvous.

49
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:28,919
Good.
We've arrived.

50
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,794
Is the shipment there from nevada?

51
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,736
No, they are behind schedule.

52
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:34,609
But they'll be here any moment.

53
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,849
How soon can you deploy once we arrive?

54
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,230
It will take us two hours to assemble the delivery system and run diagnostics,

55
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,120
another hour to secure the payload.

56
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:46,799
That's longer than I'd hoped.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,720
Listen, we are working with the best technology.

58
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:51,219
It can't be rushed.

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,149
Just remember, without us

60
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,420
you'd be delivering your payload in weeks instead of hours.

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,769
I haven't forgotten.

62
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,630
It seems necessary to remind you now and then.

63
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,920
I'll be glad when we no longer have to deal with these people.

64
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,535
They are living in the dark ages.

65
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,070
And they act like they own the world.

66
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,635
I'd much rather be fighting them.

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,650
If we succeed today, we'll never have to.

68
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,460
The arabs and the west,

69
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,130
they'll destroy each other.

70
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,880
The ambassador just arrived, mr.
President. He's in the waiting area.

71
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,329
Good.

72
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,669
Will tom lennox be joining us?

73
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,209
I spoke to reed pollock.

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,510
He says mr. Lennox is briefing the speaker and minority leader.

75
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,544
When tom's finished, tell him I want to see him, please.

76
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,589
Yes, sir.

77
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,919
Mr. Ambassador.

78
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,484
It's good to see you again, sir.

79
00:03:51,585 --> 00:03:52,789
Mr. President,

80
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,290
first allow me to express my country's shock

81
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,880
and deep regret over the devastating attack in california.

82
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,725
- Thank you, sir.
- Of course.

83
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,650
Any assistance you may require, you need only ask.

84
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,590
I'm asking you now, sir.
That's why you're here.

85
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,430
I believe you know hamri al-assad.

86
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,590
Mr. Ambassador.

87
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,084
I have never met mr. Assad in person,

88
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,959
but I know him by reputation.

89
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,190
His organization has carried out repeated terrorist actions against my country.

90
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,995
Your own policies precipitated those actions.

91
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,690
That's your justification for killing innocent people?

92
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:31,525
You and I define innocent in different ways.

93
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,570
My own deputy lost his seven-year-old son in one of your bombings.

94
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,329
That is how I define innocent.

95
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,280
We are not here to air past differences.

96
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,269
Then why are we here, mr. President?

97
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,480
At our last meeting, I informed you that we were in contact with assad.

98
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:47,931
You told me it was a positive step toward peace.

99
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:50,279
And I meant it at that time, but I must confess,

100
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,910
after the last attack, I didn't expect to see you in the same room with him.

101
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,330
And I'm not so sure I care to remain here either.

102
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,770
It is no more pleasant for me, your excellency.

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,084
Would you give us a moment?

104
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,635
Certainly.

105
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,109
Assad is here because of the attack.

106
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,230
To be frank, sir, we have three more nuclear weapons loose in my country in the hands of terrorists.

107
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,819
We didn't know that.

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,070
In less than one hour assad is going to go on national television and issue a statement.

109
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:25,569
It will be a global appeal to extremists.

110
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,824
Now, he's going to urge them to put down their arms and engage in peaceful netiation with the west.

111
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:31,020
and engage in peaceful netiation with the west.

112
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,590
Now, we are hoping to compel someone to come forward with any information regarding those nuclear weapons.

113
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,179
A petition like this coming from assad?

114
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,090
- It could have a profound effect.
- We're counting on that.

115
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:46,949
What do you need from us?

116
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,990
I want a public statement of support from your prime minister.

117
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,324
And I want it to follow right on the heels of assad'S.

118
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:55,485
Mr. Assad is a polarizing figure in my country.

119
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,600
A public endorsement of him could have grave political consequences for the prime minister.

120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,700
Then you tell your prime minister that we have a carrier group operating less than 25 miles off his shores.

121
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,810
My advisors are pressing me hard for a military response,

122
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:16,735
so if we are attacked again,

123
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,019
I won't be able to hold them off.

124
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,294
This is sounding like an ultimatum, mr.
President.

125
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:22,929
It's not an ultimatum, mr. Ambassador.

126
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm merely pointing out the fact that neither the prime minister

127
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:29,185
nor I have the luxury

128
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,570
of worrying about political consequences on a day like today.

129
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,060
I am putting my presidency on the line, so please,

130
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,479
stop handing me excuses.

131
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,000
Get on the phone and make this happen.

132
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,289
Nadia, what's the status?

133
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,190
Turner's team just completed their second sweep of the house. But the results were negative.

134
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:56,170
If gredenko was using this address, he did a really good job cleaning up after he left.

135
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,079
There was one operating land line.

136
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,580
Morris is checking on the router to see if there's any recent activity.

137
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:03,139
Morris?

138
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,399
- Morris?!
- Yes.

139
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,240
- Any luck on the land line?
- No. I mean, not yet.

140
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,080
They must have used an inverter to stack their calls

141
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:13,067
'cause I can't get any records out.

142
00:07:13,202 --> 00:07:16,070
Mr. Buchanan, jack bauer's on the line.

143
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,869
Go ahead, jack.

144
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,680
Bill, I'm near the airport across the street from the grandmont hotel.

145
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:25,499
I know. What's going on?

146
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,000
It's complicated.
Are the units dispatched?

147
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,840
We have two units on the way to the grandmont. I'll have them meet you.

148
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,229
Okay, I want you to contact lapd.

149
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,679
Have them set up a five-block perimeter around the hotel.

150
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,094
They need to locate my father and take him into custody.

151
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:40,051
- Your father?
- He's involved in this.

152
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,095
I'll debrief you as soon as we've got time.

153
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:44,327
Were you able to pick up anything on gredenko?

154
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:46,489
No.
The glasgow street house was deserted.

155
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,944
We're processing it for clu but so far we've come up empty.

156
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:50,814
We can't be sure gredenko was even there.

157
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,761
I think I might have a lead.

158
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,959
- What is it?
- Charles logan.

159
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,619
- Logan?
- I spoke to him.

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,444
He says he has information on gredenko.

161
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,199
How the hell did you trace this to logan?

162
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,850
Through my father. Bill, I need you to get me a helicopter that can take me to him.

163
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,495
He's at his retreat in hidden valley.
He's under house arrest.

164
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,660
House arrest? How was that possible?
He was involved in the murder of david palmer.

165
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,435
He brokered a closed-door deal.
He plead guilty to obstruction of justice.

166
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:18,500
The public never even knew of his involvement in aiding terrorists or david palmer's assassination.

167
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,669
- Give me that helicopter.
- We have one in the area.

168
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,350
Shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to have it rerouted to your location.

169
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,809
Thank you.

170
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,134
Marilyn.

171
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:29,679
Jack.

172
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,869
What happened?

173
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,989
My father escaped.
I don't know where he is.

174
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,990
He might be in the area.
I want you both to go back to ctu.

175
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,620
Josh, I know that there's a lot to explain, and I promise you when this is over,

176
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:43,390
you and I are going to sit down and I will talk you through what happened.

177
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,759
- Okay.
- Let's go.

178
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,510
- You're not coming with us?
- No, gredenko wasn't at the house.

179
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:51,075
I need to follow up another lead.

180
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,860
- Take these people back to ctu.
- Yes, sir.

181
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,469
Josh, get in.

182
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,419
Jack...

183
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,249
thank you.

184
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,800
Thank you for saving my son.

185
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,090
He reminds me of you.

186
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,020
You can see it in his eyes.

187
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,354
Marilyn, please, you have to go.

188
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,905
Okay.

189
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,870
Gentlemen.

190
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,260
Sign in, sirs.

191
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,974
We'll need to process you again, mr. Carson.

192
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,525
Of course.

193
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,640
- What's your occupation?
- I'm a policy analyst with the stanton institute.

194
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,119
State your business here.

195
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,680
I'm here to consult on civil defense procedures.

196
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,330
At the request of tom lennox.

197
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,080
Test, one, two, three.

198
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,510
<i>: Test, one, two, three.</i>

199
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,470
- Thank you, sirs.
- Thank yoU.

200
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,510
Thank you.

201
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,890
We've got a problem.
Tom lennox tried to warn secret service about us.

202
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:39,929
What?!

203
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,324
I stopped him before he was able to alert anyone.

204
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,219
But I had to restrain him.

205
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,699
You said that lennox was on board with the plan.

206
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,730
I thought that he was. Either he's changed his mind or you're right and he's been playing us all along.

207
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,830
Regardless, we're gonna have to deal with it.

208
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,099
Son of a bitch.

209
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,740
We've got to move him.
I'm going to need this space.

210
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,325
Get me some tape.

211
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,990
Let's go, over here.

212
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,590
Sit down, hands behind your back.

213
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,880
We're going to have to take care of him.
Make it look like a suicide.

214
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,669
No.

215
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,829
No.

216
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,790
Listen, eliminating president palmer is for the good of the country, all right?

217
00:11:39,925 --> 00:11:41,844
It's the only way to get him out of office.

218
00:11:41,945 --> 00:11:44,159
Killing tom lennox only benefits us.

219
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,430
- We don't have any choice.
- Listen. Tom lennox is a very smart man.

220
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,990
Now I think that once vice president daniels is holding the reins,

221
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,670
and enacting the policies that lennox himself created,

222
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,655
we can convince him to keep quiet.

223
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,959
I'm not gambling my life on lennox's good judgment.

224
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,420
Look, it's a risk, but it is a risk that I'm willing to take.

225
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,859
We're not cold-blooded murderers.

226
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,450
We're just trying to save our country.

227
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,610
Either way, we do not have time to resolve this now.

228
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:15,529
Assad goes before the cameras within an hour.

229
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,200
You said it would take 25 minutes for you to assemble this?

230
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,960
25 to 30.
Then you better get started now.

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,224
If we're going to frame assad for the assassination, then this bomb has to explode when they're both together.

232
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,524
then this bomb has to explode when they're both together.

233
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,075
We're never going to have a better chance than now.

234
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,420
Reed.

235
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,639
Yes, melinda.

236
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,140
I'm still waiting for the briefing stats that tom promised me.

237
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,710
Well tom just e-mailed them to you.
They should be on your screen by the time you're back at your desk.

238
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,469
OKAY

239
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,834
By the way, is tom in his office?

240
00:13:10,935 --> 00:13:12,799
Uh, no, no.

241
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,495
Um, no, tom is down in conference B.

242
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,055
He's meeting with some policy analysts from langley.

243
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,530
I just came from conference B.
Secret service is meeting in there.

244
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:24,400
Well, they must have switched to another room, then.

245
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:27,390
Listen, I'll try to track tom down for you.

246
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,429
what is it, morris?

247
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,425
I have to uplink these traffic vectors to the homeland sub-net.

248
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,470
I've been trying, I've been trying and it just won't go through.

249
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,720
- Check your S. I. P. Adapter.
- What about my S. I. P. Adapter?

250
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,170
You've specified the wrong slot assignment.

251
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,245
Oh, what an idiot.

252
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,830
Thank you.
That'll work.

253
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,949
Did you call your sponsor?

254
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,575
I'm getting tired of you giving me the third degree.

255
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah, well, I covered for you.
I didn't tell anyone you took a drink.

256
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:09,975
I didn't take a drink- I spat it out.
I told you.

257
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,434
- You promised me you'd call your sponsor.
- And I did.

258
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:13,399
Well?

259
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,099
We had this long talk.

260
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,990
I feel a lot better, really.

261
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,579
You're not acting like iT.

262
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,840
Why don't we install a breathalyzer at my work station?
Will that satisfy you?

263
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,099
I just want to make sure you're okay.

264
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,130
I helped terrorists arm a nuclear bomb today.
I'm not going to be okay for a long time.

265
00:14:29,265 --> 00:14:32,020
That doesn't mean to say I can't do my job.

266
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,680
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to swap out this server port.

267
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,229
Where's morris?

268
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,279
He's swapping out a server port.

269
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,980
He's supposed to be checking on gredenko's landline.

270
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,240
Well, he's juggling a lot right now. Being short-handed, we're all trying to pick up the slack.

271
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,260
Now, I'm wondering if it's more than that.

272
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,349
What?

273
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,905
Look, he's been tortured. He's under a
lot of stress. Maybe he should be pulled.

274
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,910
Yeah, he's a little upset, but he's still better than 90% of the tech people we have around here.

275
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:21,495
We need morris on the floor.

276
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:30,140
All right, chloe, but I'm keeping my eye on him. If I see anything else I don't like, I go to buchanan.

277
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:32,725
Fine.

278
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,450
<i>Hi, this is jeannie. I'm not here right now, but please leave a message and the time of day you called and I'll get back to you.</i>

279
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,470
Hi, jeannie, this is chloe o'brian.
You don't know me, but I'm morris's ex-wife.

280
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,064
Could you call me back as soon as possible?
It's important.

281
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:59,270
I'm at 597-3781.
Thank you.

282
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:01,129
Nadia,

283
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,579
jack will be arriving at logan's estate any moment.

284
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,994
I want tac teams on alert and prepped for redeployment.

285
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:08,545
- Yes, sir.
- We're out of leads.

286
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,820
Let's hope jack can get something from logan.

287
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,650
Could we have a moment, please?

288
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,980
Must have been hard for you to find out about your father's involvement in all of this.

289
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,549
I'm not here to talk about my father.

290
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,050
Dmitri gredenko- what do you know about him?

291
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,260
I know gredenko supplied fayed with five russian tactical nukes,

292
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:46,619
one of which exploded this morning in valencia.

293
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,360
One of which you managed to disarm, so that leaves us three we need to recover.

294
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,939
That's correct.

295
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,124
I get regular intelligence updates.

296
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,675
And I still have my sources.

297
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,860
So you need gredenko to find fayed.

298
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,020
- Can you help us?
- Yes, I can.

299
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,280
But you want some kind of plea agreement.

300
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,845
You're unbelievable.

301
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,800
I don't blame you for thinking that, jack.

302
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,475
But I want you to know that I'm not the same man that I was two years ago.

303
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:23,160
Just as you're not the same man who was dragged away and thrown into a chinese prison.

304
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,300
I've changed.
I've had time to think about what I did.

305
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,860
I have reconnected with my faith.

306
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:32,729
So, no, I don't want a pardon.

307
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,764
And I wouldn't accept it if it was offered to me.

308
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:37,265
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

309
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,030
I want to give you the information you need with no conditions.

310
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,479
I'm listening.

311
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,904
I never dealt with gredenko directly,

312
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,501
but I know how we can find him.

313
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:49,029
- How?
- Through anatoly markov.

314
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,685
He's the russian consul general, here in los angeles.

315
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,000
Ctu contacted the consul general as soon as we saw gredenko's name on the list.

316
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,910
He denied any knowledge of his whereabouts.

317
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,499
Markov's lying.

318
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,984
He's been the liaison for gredenko for years.

319
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,469
Liaison for what?

320
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,160
For business concerns looking to acquire the products that gredenko provides.

321
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,640
No, don'T.
Don't make the wrong play, jack.

322
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,430
Now if you go down official channels, you'll end up in a hopeless maze.

323
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,430
Markov has friends in the highest levels of the russian government.

324
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:23,649
They can protect him indefinitely.

325
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,020
If you want to access what he knows right now, you need to go through back channels.
you need to go through back channels.

326
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,459
- What back channels?
- Me.

327
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,220
I'm your best chance to get the information you need in the time frame you need it.

328
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:42,160
- What are you proposing?
- That I speak to markov myself, in person.

329
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:45,200
- Why would markov talk to you?
- Because I have leverage.

330
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,770
Markov was involved in the conspiracy that put me where I am today.

331
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,204
I didn't give him up.

332
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:53,755
But he knows I still can.

333
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,979
I don't trust you.

334
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,900
If you want to find gredenko, maybe it's time you started.

335
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,409
go ahead, jack.

336
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,534
Mr.
President, thank you for taking my call.

337
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:28,829
You said it was urgent.

338
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,884
I think we have a way of finding gredenko.

339
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:32,904
It was my understanding that we lost gredenko.

340
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,334
Are you telling me we hava new lead?

341
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,036
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,669
Mr. President,

343
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,220
the lead is charles logan.

344
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,710
- Logan?
- Yes, sir. I'm with him now.

345
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,290
He claims that his administration had dealings with gredenko, and that he has a contact that will lead us to him.

346
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:49,659
Who?

347
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,140
Aanatolyotoly markov- the russian consul in los angeles.

348
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,010
When we learned about gredenko, jack, I placed a call to the consulate myself.

349
00:19:57,145 --> 00:19:58,989
- Now that's a dead end.
- Not according to logan.

350
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,565
He wants to meet with markov in the consulate in person.

351
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,540
He says that's the only way that we can get the information we need.

352
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,770
Jack...

353
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,229
logan is under house arrest.

354
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,730
That's why I'm calling you, mr.
President.

355
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,190
We need an executive order granting logan a temporary furlough.

356
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,669
Do you realize what you're asking me?

357
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,305
Logan was behind the assassination of my brother.

358
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,930
Sir, I would not be calling if I didn't think this was necessary.

359
00:20:24,065 --> 00:20:25,929
I don't trust this man, jack.

360
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,660
This could be some maneuver on his part to gain his freedom.

361
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:31,590
I think we need to take a chance on him,

362
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,950
and I will enter the consulate with logan as part of his security detail.

363
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,500
Besides that, I think he's after something else.

364
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:42,160
And what exactly would that be?

365
00:20:42,295 --> 00:20:43,539
Redemption.

366
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,335
Jack, I have no desire to facilitate any kind of redemption for charles logan.

367
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,760
Mr.
President, right now I think he's the only way we're going to find gredenko and the bombs.

368
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,290
Put him on.

369
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,430
He wants to talk to you.

370
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,059
Hello, mr.
President.

371
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,070
I want to hear it from your lips.
Tell me why I should agree to this.

372
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,870
Because you need me, mr. President.
It's as simple as that.

373
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,109
I can speak to the russian consul myself.

374
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,520
Yes, sir, you could do that, but with all due respect, you'd be wasting your time.

375
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:23,710
I have a prior relationship with markov that... we can exploit.

376
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,660
Again, with due respect, sir, I have more experience dealing with people of markov's character.

377
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,390
You mean criminals like yourself?

378
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,840
I know how he thinks, and that's an advantage you can't afford to ignore.

379
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,480
I want you to know that if this is some kind of move to escape custody, i will commit the resources of my administration to hunt you down.

380
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,180
i will commit the resources of my administration to hunt you down.

381
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:47,600
I can assure you, mr. President, I have nothing like that in mind.

382
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,310
Several years ago, I was in the same situation, and I...

383
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:54,795
reached out to your brother for counsel.

384
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,160
David helped me successfully navigate that crisis.

385
00:21:58,295 --> 00:21:59,716
Yes.

386
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,939
He did.

387
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,150
And you repaid him by killing him.

388
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,294
I would like to do for you what your brother did for me.

389
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,960
I would like to help you get through this.

390
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,300
Don't make the mistake of assuming this represents any kind of forgiveness on my part.

391
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:23,060
I understand that, mr. President, but I hope over time to earn your forgiveness.

392
00:22:23,195 --> 00:22:25,645
Put jack on the phone.

393
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,669
Yes, mr. President?

394
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,220
I'm granting the furlough.

395
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,010
- Just make it count, jack.
- I'll do my best.

396
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:41,595
Thank you, mr. President.

397
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,460
This isn't easy for you, is it, jack?

398
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:47,309
What?

399
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,900
The possibility I may not be the same man you've hated for so long.

400
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,870
You're late.

401
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:11,939
Did you have any trouble?

402
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,750
We had to bypass a vehicle inspection in riverside.

403
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:16,624
Other than that, we had a smooth trip.

404
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:19,175
Good.
Let's have a look.

405
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,120
Open up.

406
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,880
The U. S. Military has spent millions to develop this drone.

407
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:41,930
Today american taxpayers will get a demonstration of...

408
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,290
what their money has produced.

409
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,369
According to charles logan,

410
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,740
anatoly markov, the head of the russian consulate in los angeles, has information on gredenko.

411
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,220
Logan and bauer are going to see markov now.

412
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,825
I want comm locked on any communication outside and possibly inside the consulate.

413
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,890
Morris, are you still the lead on decoding diplomatic communication leaving the consulate?

414
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:08,739
Yes.

415
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,290
I want you to hand that over to chloe.

416
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,909
Why?

417
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,990
Because of what you've been through today. I'm not sure you can handle it, and we can't afford any mistakes.

418
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:18,739
Look, I'm perf...

419
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,810
chloe, I want you to take over morris's workload on the consulate.

420
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,469
- Hold on a second.
- It's okay, morris.

421
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,940
No. No, no, it's not okay.
It's-it's not okay. I...

422
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,889
I'd like to say something to everyone.

423
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm very sorry that I gave the reprogramming device to fayed.

424
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,535
If I could take it back, I would, but I can'T.

425
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,300
And if you don't think I can do my job, mr. Buchanan, then I should leave.

426
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,430
But i can do my job.

427
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,680
Okay, morris.
Give your task full priority.

428
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,739
Thank you.

429
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,540
Mr. Buchanan, I have to disagree with your decision.

430
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,440
I'm sorry, morris, but I just don't think you're ready.

431
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,350
Your objection is noted, nadia.

432
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,190
My decision stands.

433
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,274
You're wasting your energy.

434
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,431
And you're distracting me.

435
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:23,519
The president's gonna die.

436
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,070
There's nothing you can do about it.

437
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,990
People are starting to ask questions about tom's whereabouts.
Are you on schedule?

438
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,590
I told you the bomb would be ready in 30 minutes, and I meant it.

439
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:38,175
Okay.

440
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,500
- is there a problem?
- No.

441
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,640
You can't go soft on us now, reed.

442
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,449
No, it'S...

443
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,000
it's just starting to hit me.

444
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,585
What we're about to do.

445
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,709
My god...

446
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,950
we're killing the president of the united states.

447
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:05,307
We're trying to save this country.

448
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:08,680
That's all you need to think about.

449
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,230
Chloe, look at the function prototypes on morris's report.

450
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,815
- What's the problem?
- Take a look.

451
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,044
You mean the missing sectors?

452
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:33,595
Yes, the missing sectors.

453
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,130
Did buchanan make a mistake by reinstating morris too soon?

454
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,969
No.
The pentagon put a file lock on these items.
I told him we could back-fill them later.

455
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,880
It's not gonna be to anyone's benefit if you're covering for him.

456
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,180
I'm not.

457
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,810
Fine.

458
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,984
Morris, I need you to tell me the truth.

459
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:07,379
Have you been drinking?

460
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,990
I just had a couple of beers, love.
I didn't think anyone would mind.

461
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,950
Don't be sarcastic.
Your data merge is incomplete.

462
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,284
I had to cover for you.
I just told nadia...

463
00:27:14,385 --> 00:27:16,634
whoa, wait.
What was incomplete?

464
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,185
Look.

465
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,604
Oh, for crying out loud, these sectors are irrelevant.

466
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:24,105
I only fill them in when I file my final report.

467
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,059
You know that nadia wants these completed.

468
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,940
Nadia only wants to prove to buchanan
that she was right and that I shouldn't be here.

469
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,389
No one is out to get you.

470
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,595
Look, even I know that I shouldn't be here.

471
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,690
There's a big part of me that wants to go home,

472
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,750
crawl into bed and forget this day ever happened.

473
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:47,110
But I'm staying, because ctu needs me.

474
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,770
<i>"he brought me out of a horrible pit,"</i>

475
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,800
<i>set my feet upon a rock...</i>

476
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,560
<i>and established my goings. "</i>

477
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,510
One step at a time, charles.

478
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,029
One step at a time.

479
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,130
Logan's almost ready-
we should be able to get to the consulate within 45 minutes.

480
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:03,569
What have you got on markov?

481
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:06,019
We ran his name through the interagency sub-net.

482
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,770
He's a career diplomat.
Assigned consul general in '96.

483
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,640
Prior to that, worked in the ministry of foreign affairs for the russian federation.

484
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:17,190
No red flags from nsa, interpol or cia.

485
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,059
As far as they're concerned, he's clean.

486
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,610
<i>out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock
and gave me a firm place to stand. ps27:5;31:8</i>

487
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,749
Jack, what if logan isn't telling the truth?

488
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,769
We're out of options-
I have to trust him.

489
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,029
You know, we have no jurisdiction at the consulate.

490
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,800
Just make sure you have teams ready in case logan's lead pans out.

491
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,385
All right.

492
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,810
- O'brian.
- Chloe, contact the highway patrol.

493
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,400
Have them clear a ground corridor from logan's estate to the russian consulate.

494
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:42,985
Yes, sir.

495
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,454
- hello?
- Yeah, hi. This is jeannie.

496
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:55,209
- You left me a message?
- Yeah.

497
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,880
- Thanks for getting back to me.
- So, what can I do for you?

498
00:29:58,015 --> 00:29:59,779
Look, I know you talked to morris earlier,

499
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,820
and that this is probably way out of line and against your confidentiality agreement,

500
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:06,339
but it's just, I'm really worried about him.

501
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,940
I- I'm sorry, I haven't spoken to morris since
I left the program three years ago.

502
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,059
Hello?

503
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,610
Okay.
Sorry to bother you.

504
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,640
- Have you seen morris?
- No. I'm sorry.

505
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,724
- XXXXX
- is morris down there?

506
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:39,275
I haven't seen him. XXXXXXX

507
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,449
- Morris?
- Chloe?

508
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,109
Morris, what are you doing in there?

509
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,784
- What? Wait.
- Open the door! Open the door!

510
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,509
What the bloody hell is going on?

511
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,140
I called your sponsor, jeannie.
She said she hasn't talked to you in three years.

512
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:02,809
Are you out of your bleeding mind?!

513
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,164
I trusted you-
I put my job on the line for you.

514
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:06,591
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie to you.

515
00:31:06,692 --> 00:31:08,600
- Yes, you did.
- I didn't lie to you-

516
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:10,624
jeannie's not my sponsor anymore; ted is.

517
00:31:10,725 --> 00:31:12,579
- Ted?
- Yeah. Remember ted with the hair?

518
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,500
He's my sponsor.
I called him just like I told you.

519
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:18,085
Check if you want-
I'll give you his number.

520
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,040
Not now!

521
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,850
I don't know what to say.
I was worried about you.

522
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,280
Marching into a men's room isn't worried, it's obsessed.

523
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,980
Now, I appreciate your concern.
I love your concern.

524
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,149
But, darling,

525
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,250
you have to take a look at what's going on in your head.
It's not pretty.

526
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,910
Sorry.

527
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,900
Mr. President.

528
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,679
From the attorney general, sir.

529
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,780
The executive order authorizing president logan's release.

530
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,579
Thank you, melinda.

531
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,230
The communications director wanted you to know
that they'll be ready for an on-camera rehearsal with assad in five minutes.

532
00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:46,815
Fine.

533
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,599
Melinda?

534
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,899
Have we heard from tom lennox?

535
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,170
No, sir. I've been trying him.
There's no answer at his office.

536
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,584
Find him.
I want him present for assad's statement.

537
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:58,135
Yes, sir.

538
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,009
sir.

539
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,645
I'm gonna take that off of you, and I'm gonna clean up that cut,

540
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,970
but if you try to call out, carson will kill you and I cannot stop him.

541
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,505
Do you understand?

542
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,100
Okay.

543
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,304
you have got to put a stop to this, reed.

544
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:39,829
No, Mr. Lennox.

545
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:43,110
When this is done and the president is out of the way,

546
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:45,717
I think that you will see things differently.

547
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:50,319
I think that you will see that this is...
better for our country.

548
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,460
No, you're going to destroy this country, reed.

549
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:56,045
You're just as bad as fayed.

550
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,650
No, no.
There must have been a moment when you were onboard with this plan.

551
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,530
Were you playing us from the beginning?
Hmm?

552
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,219
Were you?

553
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,950
Or did you change your mind along the way?

554
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:13,779
I need to know.

555
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,740
Then know this.
I was against you from the start.

556
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,109
that'S...

557
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,660
...very disappointing.

558
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,469
Hello.

559
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,869
Yes, hello, melinda.

560
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,010
Oh, yes, I'm just with tom right now.
He's just finishing the briefing.

561
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,300
You know, I-I understand.
I will let Mr. Lennox kn right away. Okay?

562
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:48,529
Thanks.

563
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,614
The president is asking for lennoX.
We've gotta move.

564
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:53,165
I'm almost done.

565
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,020
Finished.

566
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,299
- It's armed.
- Okay.

567
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,789
NoW...
this is the detonator.

568
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,830
Press 6-2-4-enter, and a signal will activate the bomb.

569
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,680
Okay.
6-2-4-enter.

570
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,829
Ye.

571
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,750
Once the signal's been sent,
it'll take 15 seconds for the chemicals to intermix.

572
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:53,220
The kill radius is only ten feet.
Make sure palmer's inside it.

573
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,599
You sure you can do it?

574
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,650
I'm the only one who can get close enough to
that podium without attracting attention.

575
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:06,050
I can do this.

576
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,820
all right, everyone, rehearsal's up in five minutes.
Please notify the president.

577
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,164
excuse me, could we have some water for the podium?

578
00:37:33,265 --> 00:37:35,715
- Sure.
- Thank you.

579
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,140
The president is traveling.

580
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,950
Before we continue, I would just like to express my appreciation.

581
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,750
You're taking a great risk, Mr. President.

582
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,875
You and I both are sharing that risk, sir,

583
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:11,200
and maybe that, in and of itself, is something of a victory.

584
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,210
I just hope that someone will listen to our appeal.

585
00:38:14,345 --> 00:38:16,795
You sound skeptical.

586
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,040
The people we're trying to reach,
they abandoned the political process a long time ago.

587
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,430
All we need to do is create a foundation...

588
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,079
to build on.

589
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,630
The rest will follow.

590
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,019
- Reed.
- yes, Mr. president.

591
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,439
This is hamri al-assad.

592
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,374
Mr. Pollock is our deputy chief of staff.

593
00:38:38,475 --> 00:38:40,925
- How do you do?
- Hello, sir.

594
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,980
If you wouldn't mind getting comfortable behind the podium,
I'd like to speak to reed for a minute, please.

595
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,565
Of course.

596
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,449
- Mr. Al-assad?
- Yes.

597
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,300
Would you like to review the teleprompter copy before you rehearse?

598
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:53,659
That would be fine.

599
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,340
I've been trying to reach tom for the past hour.

600
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,290
Is there something I should know?

601
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,344
Something you should know, Mr. President?

602
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:02,779
Reed...

603
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,605
I know how tom feels about this address,

604
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,060
but i was under the impression that he put his opposition aside

605
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,435
and was working with me to make this policy succeed.

606
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,210
Well, I-I'm sure that th's a valid impression, Mr. President.

607
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:17,699
Then he'll be here.

608
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,250
Yes.
Yes, sir, he will, he will be here.

609
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,330
Good.

610
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,830
you try that again and I'll kill you, you understand?

611
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,059
I should kill you anyway.

612
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,000
With the president dead, nobody's going to think too hard
about why his chief of staff hanged himself.

613
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,309
Here we go for rehearsal.

614
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,060
I'm gonna go and check on tom, Mr. President.

615
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,599
I'll give you a seven-second countdown.

616
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,150
The last four seconds will be silent.

617
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,054
All right, here we go in seven...

618
00:41:34,155 --> 00:41:35,196
six...

619
00:41:35,297 --> 00:41:37,747
five...

620
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,380
what is this?

621
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,560
