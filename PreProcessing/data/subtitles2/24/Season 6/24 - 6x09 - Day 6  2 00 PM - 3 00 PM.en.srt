1
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,568
<i>JACK:
That's hyocine-pentothal.</i>

2
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:17,267
<i>You will experience a pain
I can't even describe.</i>

3
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,967
At 8cc's, I run the risk
of inducing heart attack.

4
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:21,501
Four cc's!

5
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:22,667
That's 8cc's total, Jack.

6
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,334
His vitals are spiking
across the line.

7
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:25,134
Four cc's!

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,733
(screaming)

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,867
The connection you found
between Dad and Gredenko

10
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:33,101
had to do with a contract
that was awarded to us.

11
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,201
What did an ex-Russian general
have to do with the contract?

12
00:00:35,267 --> 00:00:39,633
It was his job to release
the old nukes...

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,167
into the U.S.
for decommissioning.

14
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:43,301
He knows you didn't
tell him everything.

15
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,167
Yeah, and I won't.
You know I won't, Dad.

16
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:46,434
Have to be sure.

17
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,867
(muffled grunting)

18
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:52,034
(muffled screaming)

19
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,501
I would like you

20
00:00:58,568 --> 00:01:00,600
to appear on television
and appeal to members

21
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,334
of Islamic communities
everywhere

22
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:05,301
to come forward with
any information regarding Fayed.

23
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,967
<i>I certainly can't
reach out to them for help,</i>

24
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,267
but I know you can.

25
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:11,167
Fayed has already
called me a traitor.

26
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:12,867
And many others will follow him

27
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:15,667
if there is even a suspicion
that I am an American puppet!

28
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:17,201
Not a puppet, a partner.

29
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,534
At least when it comes to
finding these nuclear weapons.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,834
The President just rejected
every one of my proposals.

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,700
<i>REED:
A change in leadership
is imperative to ensure</i>

32
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,501
this nation's security.

33
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:30,733
I'm not talking about
holding hearings.

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,034
Something more... immediate

35
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:34,201
would have
to happen.

36
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,468
This is the engineer?

37
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:36,633
You've got the wrong man.

38
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,867
(grunts)

39
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:40,501
<i>FAYED:
You're going to modify this</i>

40
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,867
so that I can use it
to reprogram the bombs.

41
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:43,900
You will do it.

42
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:45,534
The question is

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,501
<i>how much pain will be inflicted
on you before you comply.</i>

44
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:48,501
(Morris screaming)

45
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,067
(gasping, screaming)

46
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:52,067
Stop!

47
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:54,501
I'll do it.

48
00:01:58,468 --> 00:01:59,401
Arm it.

49
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:05,568
Very good.

50
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,434
(pumps shotgun)

51
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:12,967
TURNER:
Fayed's already gone.

52
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,700
The reprogramming device that
Fayed had me build for him,

53
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,134
if it's not here, it means
he took it with him.

54
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,367
And with it,

55
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:21,267
<i>he can activate
the other bombs he has</i>

56
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,800
<i>anytime he wants.</i>

57
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,900
(helicopter rotors whirring)

58
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,468
* *

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
(phone ringing)

60
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,067
Yes?

61
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:17,301
FAYED:
I have the arming device.

62
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:20,167
But I had to leave
one of the suitcases behind.

63
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,900
What happened?

64
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,834
CTU found me.

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,867
I needed to preoccupy them
with a bomb to enable my escape.

66
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:29,434
The delivery system software

67
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,167
was programmed
for five detonations

68
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,800
at five high-priority targets.

69
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:38,501
Because of your carelessness,
we are now down to three.

70
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:41,501
More than enough for
our needs, Gredenko.

71
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:44,800
You just make sure the delivery
system arrives on schedule.

72
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:48,468
The trucks have left Nevada,

73
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,934
and they'll reach the location
within two hours.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,134
Good.

75
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:53,600
You can use the time you have

76
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,568
to reprogram
your targeting software.

77
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,301
Call me when it's completed.

78
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,334
(vehicle engine starts)

79
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,367
Since the FAA
was unable to track

80
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,900
Fayed's chopper, we have to
assume it set down somewhere

81
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:13,733
outside the containment area.

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,167
We may not know
where Fayed is,

83
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,234
but we do know he's in
possession of a device

84
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:18,867
that will enable
him to activate

85
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:21,067
the three remaining suitcase
nukes in his arsenal.

86
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:24,167
Our only potential lead
was uploaded

87
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,600
from the hard drive of a laptop

88
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,234
recovered at the scene
by Jack Bauer and his team.

89
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,700
Milo.

90
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,600
There was an e-mail fragment
I was able to restore

91
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,401
from the computer's hard drive;
it made reference to

92
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:36,800
recent communications between
Fayed and Dmitri Gredenko.

93
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:40,034
Gredenko is the former
Soviet general in charge

94
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:43,401
of turning over Russian nukes
to the U.S. for decommission.

95
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,434
Ultimately, he was the source of
the weapons Fayed now possesses.

96
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,468
So, clearly, Gredenko's
more involved in this

97
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,201
than we realized.

98
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,367
What's his interest
in helping Fayed?

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,067
Gredenko's an ultranationalist.

100
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:55,401
His desire to harm this country,
economically and otherwise,

101
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:56,667
is in sync with Fayed's.

102
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:58,767
Have we gotten any updated intel
on his location?

103
00:04:58,834 --> 00:04:59,800
BUCHANAN:
Interpol just confirmed

104
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,434
he's no longer in Moscow.

105
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,934
Since the point
of origin

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,934
fingerprint on the
e-mail fragment

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,201
was Pacific time,
I think it's safe to assume

108
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,534
he's somewhere on the West
Coast, possibly Los Angeles.

109
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,201
Chloe, run a data sweep through
INS and customs channels.

110
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,867
See if we can track
how he got in the country.

111
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,667
(sighs softly)

112
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,600
Morris.

113
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:33,201
We have to take
him to Medical.

114
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,267
I just want to talk
to him for a minute.

115
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:36,234
Are you okay?

116
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:38,301
Give us ten minutes.

117
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:02,800
Bill.
Jack.

118
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,667
We able to pull anything
off the hard drive we found?

119
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,267
We have.

120
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,934
Apparently, Fayed's been in
contact with Dmitri Gredenko.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,501
Gredenko?

122
00:06:09,568 --> 00:06:10,767
It's looking
more and more like

123
00:06:10,834 --> 00:06:11,900
he's been aiding
Fayed's operation all along.

124
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,434
You think he's here
in Los Angeles.

125
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:15,468
Evidence on the hard
drive points to that.

126
00:06:15,534 --> 00:06:16,934
What leads do you have
on Gredenko?

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Your father's company
was contracted

128
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,267
to dispose of the nukes

129
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:21,401
Gredenko was
to hand over.

130
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:22,967
My brother Graem
oversaw those contracts,

131
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,101
not my father.

132
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:25,534
He still might have
some information.

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Okay, fine, I'll talk to him.

134
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,767
Where is he?

135
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:28,867
He went to see
your brother's body

136
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:31,600
in the morgue.

137
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,367
Okay, thanks.

138
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:38,167
Chloe, you all right?

139
00:06:38,234 --> 00:06:39,733
Yeah.

140
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,900
Thank you for saving
Morris's life.

141
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,367
Yeah.

142
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm really glad Fayed didn't
kill you this morning.

143
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:49,967
Me, too.

144
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,334
I have to talk
to my father.

145
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,834
I... just want to thank you

146
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,367
for everything.

147
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:40,234
* *

148
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,201
Dad.

149
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:22,201
Whatever your brother
may have done,

150
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:25,134
he didn't deserve this.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,301
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

152
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,767
Yeah.

153
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,633
Well...

154
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:40,067
Dad, I'm sorry about Graem.

155
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:41,700
I am.

156
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:43,934
But right now,
CTU wants to know about

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,034
your connection
to Dmitri Gredenko.

158
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:52,101
What?

159
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,468
We believe that
he's working with Fayed.

160
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,301
They want to know
what you know about him.

161
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:58,667
He was the Russian liaison

162
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,501
on our government contract to
decommission Soviet nukes. Why?

163
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,101
<i>What kind of dealings
did you have with him?</i>

164
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,667
Couple of phone calls to
Moscow, that's about it.

165
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,568
Do you know of any contacts
that Gredenko might have

166
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,501
which would allow Fayed to move
the remaining four nukes?

167
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:13,967
Look, Jack, like I told you,

168
00:09:14,034 --> 00:09:16,334
I had virtually no involvement.

169
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,934
Graem oversaw the project,
he dealt with Gredenko.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,934
Whatever you need to know
died with him.

171
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,468
You know where Marilyn is?

172
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,733
No.

173
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,767
Why?

174
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,267
You gonna question her, too?

175
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:41,101
She's probably with Josh.

176
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,201
He's taking the death

177
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:45,867
of his father
pretty hard.

178
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:48,568
Leave them
alone, Jack.

179
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:52,267
Let them grieve
in peace.

180
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:55,800
I'll make a call to some
of the company executives.

181
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,401
About Gredenko.

182
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:02,468
Maybe Graem shared something
that I wasn't privy to.

183
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:08,034
Thank you.

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,234
DOCTOR:
Try to rest.

185
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:29,334
You're doing
very well.

186
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,767
You can go in now.

187
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,733
Morris?

188
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,834
How are you feeling?

189
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,600
Say something.

190
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,767
What is there to say?

191
00:10:57,834 --> 00:10:59,568
You were tortured.

192
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:02,767
You held out as
long as you could.

193
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,900
I armed a nuclear bomb.

194
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:05,900
You had to.

195
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:06,934
Fayed was gonna kill you.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,434
I wish to God he had.

197
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,367
Because of me,

198
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,600
Fayed has a device that can
arm all the bloody

199
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,534
suitcase nukes
he wants.

200
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,733
You can't blame yourself.

201
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,767
When the next bomb goes off, and
thousands of more people die,

202
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:21,534
everybody will remember

203
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,401
that I was the one
that made it possible.

204
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,267
That's not
gonna happen.

205
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,334
'Cause we're gonna find Fayed
and we're gonna stop him,

206
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:31,568
and none of this
will matter.

207
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:33,501
Are you any closer
to finding him?

208
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,267
No.

209
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,234
Just go, darling.

210
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,334
Go.

211
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,034
(phone rings)

212
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:10,501
Yes, Mr. Bauer?

213
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,134
We've got a problem.
Gredenko's here.

214
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,134
In L.A.?

215
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,568
Are you sure?
Yes.

216
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:17,934
Only, they don't
know where he is.

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,034
We've got to get to him
before they do.

218
00:12:20,101 --> 00:12:23,900
If Gredenko
implicates me, everything--

219
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:27,401
the company I founded
and spent my life protecting--

220
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,633
it's over,
you understand?

221
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,468
Yes. I'll put a
team together.

222
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,800
I'll monitor
CTU from here.

223
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,568
If I hear of anything,
I'll call you.

224
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,267
Yes, sir.
I don't care

225
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,067
what you have to do.

226
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:40,367
You find Gredenko,
and you kill him.

227
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,000
Understood.

228
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,600
I talked to my father
about Gredenko.

229
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,834
He said he'd make
some inquiries, but I
think it's a dead end.

230
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,334
He doesn't
know anything.

231
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,967
The news from here
isn't much better.

232
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:00,301
But Milo managed to trace

233
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,267
the fragment he pulled off
Fayed's computer

234
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,034
to a local I.P. network.

235
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:05,867
It confirms Gredenko is
definitely here in L.A.

236
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:09,167
I've got my people
monitoring chatter,

237
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:11,434
data-mining
interagency backlogs

238
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,867
on Gredenko's activities
prior to going underground.

239
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,134
Right now,
that's all we can do.
Okay.

240
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,733
Have a seat, Jack.

241
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,334
What is it?

242
00:13:23,401 --> 00:13:25,667
It's the toxicology report
on your brother's body.

243
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,501
Forensic evidence indicates that

244
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:32,201
the hyocine-pentathol
you administered to Graem

245
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:35,234
during his interrogation
caused his coronary.

246
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,334
There's something else.

247
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,167
I saw the field tape,

248
00:13:41,234 --> 00:13:44,501
and Rick Burke's
report for Division.

249
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:47,167
He said you exceeded protocols,

250
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:48,434
even after he warned you

251
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,900
of dangerous levels.
That's true.

252
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,234
Agent Burke tried to warn me.

253
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,134
Then you pulled
a gun on him.

254
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,534
You must realize
how this looks, Jack.

255
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,468
Coming right after your
brother tried to kill you.
I lost control.

256
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:03,401
Because you found out he was
responsible for David Palmer's

257
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,134
assassination.
Yes, because I found out

258
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,934
about David Palmer's
assassination.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,867
'Cause I found out
about everything.

260
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:13,534
I lost control.

261
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,534
I tried to tell you I didn't
think I could do this.

262
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,067
<i>This job.</i>

263
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,101
I wanted to kill my brother.

264
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:25,468
I wanted him dead.

265
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:27,900
I was standing over him...

266
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:32,067
and I looked up and I saw
my father in the doorway...

267
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:35,267
and everything just stopped.

268
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:40,101
I ordered Agent Burke
to shut down the IV, he did.

269
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,267
I thought we caught it in time.

270
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,067
Bill, I did not set out...

271
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:58,600
to kill my brother.

272
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,800
I swear to you.

273
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:15,867
I can adjust the report

274
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:18,534
before I send it
to Division.

275
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,534
No.
Jack...

276
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,034
an Internal Affairs
investigation

277
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:23,800
will impede our search
for Fayed and Gredenko.

278
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,401
Right now, you are
critical to that.

279
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:28,201
You cannot cover this up.

280
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,633
I ordered Agent Burke

281
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,434
to administer
the hyocine-pentathol.

282
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:39,900
I killed my brother.

283
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:42,501
Whatever the consequences are,
I accept them.

284
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,568
Bill...

285
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,967
do this right.

286
00:15:56,034 --> 00:15:58,733
Okay.

287
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,234
--I'll submit the report as is.

288
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:19,968
--There is some difficulty
with my statement?

289
00:16:21,434 --> 00:16:22,834
A little more emphasis
on religion,

290
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:24,667
and less on politics
than I expected.

291
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,200
Many of the people
you wish me to sway

292
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,567
have been persuaded
that our cause is a holy one.

293
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:33,133
I am not innocent
in this manipulation.

294
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,667
So I must address them
in these terms

295
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,200
if I am to enlist
their cooperation.

296
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:40,000
(knocking on glass)
Yes?

297
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,567
Excuse me, sir.

298
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,400
Vice President Daniels
is calling for you.

299
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,067
Would you like to take
it in your office?

300
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,734
No, I'll take it in here.

301
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,767
Thank you.

302
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,534
Excuse me.

303
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:02,033
Noah?

304
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,968
Thank you for taking my call,
Mr. President.

305
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,400
I know you're pressed for time.

306
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,334
What can I do for you?
I'll get right to my point.

307
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,901
I've made no secret
of my disappointment

308
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,467
that you rejected
Tom Lennox's plan
for mass internment

309
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,334
of Arab nationals
in our country.

310
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,033
The plan did not delineate
country of origin, Noah.

311
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,801
It was nothing more than
a blanket proposal

312
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:20,067
to arrest and detain

313
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,033
thousands of Muslims
living here,

314
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,934
without due process
I might add.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,267
Be that as it may, since,
as I understand it,

316
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:27,968
the terrorists
have now acquired

317
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:30,868
the capability to arm
the three remaining
nuclear weapons,

318
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:33,701
I'm asking you
to reconsider.

319
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,167
And I thought
I told you that

320
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,033
my decision was not
open for debate.

321
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,734
Well, that's unfortunate,
Mr. President,

322
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,734
since the majority
of your Cabinet feels

323
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:43,033
that you're making
a tragic mistake.

324
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,033
I respect that.

325
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,367
But I firmly believe

326
00:17:46,434 --> 00:17:48,267
that our best
chance of stopping

327
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:50,067
further attacks will come
from the intelligence

328
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,601
drawn from Islamic communities.

329
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,801
And you hope to obtain that
by letting a known terrorist

330
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:02,000
leader address the world
on American airwaves.

331
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,501
The man has murdered

332
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,567
countless innocents
over the past 20 years,

333
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,334
and you are putting your hopes

334
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,667
for this country's
safety on him.

335
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:14,767
Not entirely...
but to the extent

336
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:16,467
that he can help us, yes.

337
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:22,734
Mr. President...

338
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,701
you approached me to be your
running mate because you knew

339
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,701
I could deliver voters
who questioned your...

340
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,868
experience,
who were afraid

341
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:33,033
that your Presidency
would be too weak

342
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,501
on national defense,

343
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:38,300
and I... assured them
otherwise, but now

344
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,000
you're proving them right.

345
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,000
There's a thin line between

346
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,801
conviction and stubbornness.

347
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:48,467
You can stand firm,
but just know that...

348
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:51,334
you're standing alone.

349
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,734
Are we done?

350
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,968
Clearly.

351
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,334
You are paying a very high price

352
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,734
for doing this.

353
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:11,234
Not as high as my country
will pay if I'm wrong.

354
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,100
As someone who has
alienated followers

355
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,334
by choosing
the unpopular course,

356
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,934
I suggest you tread carefully
among your people.

357
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,601
Mr. Assad, our cultures
are very different, sir.

358
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:27,334
It's not just a cultural
issue, Mr. President.

359
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,767
It's simple
human nature.

360
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,267
They will come after you.

361
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:35,300
I assure you of that.

362
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,234
You sure it's safe
to talk in here?

363
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,901
Yes, this area is
currently unmonitored.

364
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:13,067
All right.

365
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,567
You intimated you had some
sort of plan of dealing

366
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:17,734
with the President.

367
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:21,000
Palmer's refusal to implement

368
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,501
your proposals will

369
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,100
unquestionably lead
to the loss

370
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:26,400
of many more American lives.

371
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,267
And I, and many others like me

372
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:30,834
who love this country,
will not

373
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:34,400
stand by idly
and let that happen.

374
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,467
So what is it you propose?

375
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,734
I think you know.

376
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:41,234
I need to hear.

377
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,567
Definitive action.

378
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,701
We are in the middle
of a national crisis

379
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,534
and he is in over his head.

380
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,567
He's brought
this on himself.

381
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,534
Listen, before you start
reconsidering

382
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:05,300
and report me, just know

383
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:08,868
I will deny that we
ever had this conversation.

384
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not...

385
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:16,067
I'm not
reconsidering.

386
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,133
I know what you're saying
is necessary, I just...

387
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,534
cannot believe it has
come to this.

388
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,000
Who else is involved?

389
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:31,334
You don't need to know that.

390
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,701
I'd like to know
who I'm dealing with.

391
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:35,234
Right now you're
dealing with me.

392
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,567
Vice President Daniels,
is he involved?

393
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:39,133
No.

394
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,734
The vice president doesn't
know anything about this.

395
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,934
But we do know that he
shares our sentiment

396
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,534
in regard to the current

397
00:21:45,601 --> 00:21:47,868
state of affairs,
and that he will

398
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:51,634
enact your initiatives
once he has the power to do so.

399
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,067
You seem pretty certain
this is going to work.

400
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:57,734
More so with your help.

401
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,701
I need the President's
itinerary.

402
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,901
Specifically, in regards

403
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:06,033
to Assad's televised address.

404
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,501
I do not have
the proper clearance.

405
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:08,968
I need you to access it.

406
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:10,868
Why? W-why do you need this?

407
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,701
Damn it, Reed.

408
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,434
We're talking about
removing the President

409
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,133
of the United States.
Do not keep me

410
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,601
in the dark here.
I never said

411
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,267
that I was
the architect of this.

412
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,801
I'm just a conduit.

413
00:22:24,868 --> 00:22:27,400
Besides, for your sake, I think
that it is very important

414
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:29,000
that we maintain
a certain level

415
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:30,767
of plausible deniability.

416
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,467
The less you know,
the better.

417
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:42,534
I'll get you that itinerary.

418
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,534
--Marilyn.

419
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:08,167
Hi.

420
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:11,767
I heard you were with Josh,
I didn't want to disturb you.

421
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:13,767
Yeah, well, he's taking it

422
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,601
pretty hard.

423
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:17,634
He loved his
father very much.

424
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:19,867
I'm very sorry.

425
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:22,367
You don't owe me an apology.

426
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,934
Maybe they haven't told you
the circumstances

427
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:26,500
of Graem's heart attack.

428
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,034
They told me enough.

429
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:34,068
Look, Jack, I know the kind
of man Graem was.

430
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:36,968
Even if he did die because
of your interrogation,

431
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:38,167
I don't blame you.

432
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,934
I blame him.

433
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:46,434
The truth is, I've been trying
to leave Graem for years.

434
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,334
But he threatened
to take Josh away from me.

435
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,601
Said I'd never see him again.

436
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,968
Did Josh know
what he was like?

437
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,667
No.

438
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,467
I always tried to protect him
from the truth

439
00:23:58,534 --> 00:23:59,834
about his father.

440
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,068
What have you told him
about his father's death?

441
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:04,834
Only that he had a heart attack.

442
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,133
That's enough for now.

443
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Yeah.

444
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:13,100
I'm sorry, I have to go
back to work.

445
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,901
If there's anything
I can do.

446
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:20,034
Is it true there are more bombs

447
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,634
out there?

448
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:23,334
Yes.

449
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,233
Are you any closer
to finding them?

450
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,734
No, we've hit a road block.

451
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,034
Right now we're looking
for a Russian operative

452
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,601
who we believe is helping
the terrorists.

453
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:32,767
Graem knew him.

454
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:34,001
Russian?

455
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:36,701
A man named Gredenko.

456
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,734
You know him?

457
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:41,500
No.

458
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,068
Come here.

459
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,767
But you know something.

460
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,667
Maybe.

461
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,734
It was probably nothing.

462
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,100
It was months ago.

463
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:07,500
Marilyn, anything you
can tell us might help.

464
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:12,701
Graem was going out
a lot at night,

465
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,100
and, uh, he said
it was work related,

466
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,567
but I didn't believe him.

467
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,801
I thought he was having
an affair on me,

468
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,901
so one night I followed him.

469
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:24,100
It wasn't out
of jealousy.

470
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,701
It was... it was
for leverage.

471
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:28,567
Anything I could use against him
to get custody of Josh

472
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:30,133
if I left him.

473
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,233
Where did he go?

474
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,001
It was to a house in West L.A.

475
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,068
I went to the window.

476
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:37,467
The blinds were drawn,

477
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:40,667
but I could hear him inside
talking to some men.

478
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,167
They had Russian accents.

479
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:43,834
What were they saying?

480
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:46,001
I couldn't hear them
clearly enough,

481
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:48,233
and frankly, once I realized
he wasn't cheating on me,

482
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,867
I got in the car
and went home.

483
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:52,233
Do you remember the
address of the house?

484
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,934
No. Jack, I'm sorry,

485
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:55,934
I wasn't paying attention,
I was more concerned

486
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:57,400
about getting caught.

487
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:59,901
Marilyn, it is vital that
we find this man Gredenko.

488
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:03,133
If we retrace the route
that you took that night,

489
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,034
do you think that you would
recognize the house?

490
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,167
Maybe.

491
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,834
Maybe?

492
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:12,068
Yeah.

493
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:15,167
Yeah. I think so.

494
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,001
Wait right here.

495
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,834
Jack.

496
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:39,968
I think I might have
a lead on Gredenko.

497
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,034
It's a real shot
in the dark,

498
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,834
but right now
we don't have anything.

499
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:46,500
I wanted to know if I had your
permission to follow it up.

500
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:49,034
What do you got?

501
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,500
Hey, Marilyn.

502
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,001
Hey, Phillip.
How you doing?

503
00:26:56,068 --> 00:26:58,634
I'm hanging in there.

504
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:01,734
What's going on with you
and Jack?

505
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:04,734
He's looking for someone.

506
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,001
He thinks I can help.

507
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:08,034
You mean Gredenko?

508
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,034
He questioned me about
the same thing earlier.

509
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,834
What do you know
about him?

510
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,567
Nothing really.

511
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,667
I followed Graem
to a house one night.

512
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:20,867
He, um, he met

513
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:22,934
with some Russians.
What house?

514
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:24,467
I don't know.

515
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,068
It was in West L.A.

516
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:28,500
Jack wants to take me
over there

517
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:31,434
to see if it can
jog my memory.

518
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,334
Phillip,

519
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,434
I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

520
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,901
And I can't leave
Josh alone.

521
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:41,701
Could you please stay with him?

522
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:44,400
Yeah, sure.

523
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,500
Thanks.

524
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,734
Your Tac team's
assembling outside.

525
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,801
I'm sending Milo
along with you.

526
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,300
Milo? Why?
I want a
tech available

527
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:54,534
to pull intel
off any computers

528
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,567
we might find at
Gredenko's location.

529
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,601
Chloe will be running
point from here.

530
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,901
Okay, fine.

531
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:01,934
I'm sorry about leaving
you, sweetheart.

532
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:03,068
But I'll be back

533
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,701
as soon as I'm done
helping Uncle Jack.

534
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,934
Helping him with what?

535
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,200
Where are you going?

536
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:11,767
I'll explain later.

537
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,934
Right now I want you
to stay here

538
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:15,434
with your grandfather,
all right?

539
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,834
Marilyn.

540
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,467
I was thinking maybe I would
take Josh back to my house.

541
00:28:27,534 --> 00:28:28,867
Why?

542
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:31,734
Why can't you just wait
with him here until I get back?

543
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:34,001
Marilyn, look, he's
frightened of this place.

544
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,034
Understandably so.

545
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,267
I think he needs to be

546
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:38,534
in familiar surroundings
right now.

547
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,801
All right.

548
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:44,267
All right, I'll, um,

549
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:46,300
I'll clear it with
Mr. Buchanan.

550
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,334
Will you explain
things to Josh?

551
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,500
Yeah, sure.

552
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,867
All right, you listen
to your grandfather.

553
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,901
He's in charge.

554
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,200
Phillip, thank you.

555
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:04,467
Sure.

556
00:29:07,934 --> 00:29:10,200
Sorry to take you away
from Josh.

557
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:12,167
All you need to do is
identify the house.

558
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,767
I promise you I will not
put you in any danger.

559
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:16,334
I know.
Mr. Buchanan,

560
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,801
I'd like it if Josh's
grandfather could take him back

561
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,901
to his house.
Of course.

562
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:23,834
We should go.

563
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:24,968
Bill, I'll be on comm.

564
00:29:26,267 --> 00:29:29,233
We'll be leaving soon, Josh.

565
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,667
I have to make one phone call.

566
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:31,968
Just be a minute.

567
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,167
MAN (on phone):
Yes, sir.

568
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:47,667
Have your men find
and secure a house

569
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:49,233
in West L.A.
Fine.

570
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,901
I'll text you with the address.

571
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:07,267
--Morris, we have a lead.

572
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:08,900
Jack's sister-in-law
thinks she knows

573
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,167
where Gredenko is.

574
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:11,834
Jack and a Tac team are heading
over there now.

575
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,000
I need your help

576
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:15,100
running tactical.
Don't be ridiculous.

577
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,167
We're shorthanded.

578
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,933
So get your shirt on,

579
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,701
and let's go.
Running tactical
is what you do best,

580
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:24,200
why would you
need my help?

581
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:26,967
Oh... I get it.

582
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,033
You came in here
to give me a pep talk.

583
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,900
Get me back
working behind

584
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,067
that computer
and everything

585
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:33,701
will be tickety-boo.

586
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:35,768
Why don't you be a little
less obvious, Chloe.

587
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,167
I'm a coward, not an idiot.

588
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,534
Morris,

589
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:44,534
I know you've been
through a lot today,

590
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,667
but you're really starting
to piss me off.

591
00:30:46,734 --> 00:30:50,900
Well, let's add that to
my list of failings.

592
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,300
Why did you do that?

593
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:59,434
I didn't want to.

594
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,234
Look...

595
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,200
if you're gonna try
and save a bloke...

596
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:10,000
save someone who's worth it.

597
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:14,334
Stop it, stop it.

598
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:16,768
Jack and his team are entering
a hostile situation

599
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,134
and they need CTU back up.

600
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,000
Yes, I can do it alone,

601
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,634
but there'd be less
chance of a mistake

602
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:23,801
if you would help.

603
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:25,768
So why don't you stop feeling
sorry for yourself

604
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:26,868
and get back to work!

605
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,734
Milo, we just passed
98th Street.

606
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,967
Roger that, Jack,
we're maintaining our position

607
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:44,067
six blocks behind you.

608
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:51,100
I can't imagine what you went
through in China, Jack.

609
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,467
When you were over there,
I thought about you.

610
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:03,634
I tried not to.

611
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,501
I guess, I've been trying not
to think about you

612
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,067
for over 20 years.

613
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,000
Marilyn, we don't need to talk
about this.

614
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,834
It was your father, wasn't it?

615
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,234
He drove you away.

616
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,868
Tried to pressure you
to work for his company.

617
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:19,134
Is that why you left,

618
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,734
and enlisted
in the military?

619
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:22,868
There were a
lot of reasons.

620
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,734
Was I one of them?

621
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,534
No.

622
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:36,933
(phone rings)

623
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,900
Hello?

624
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:44,401
Marilyn, it's me.
Don't say anything...

625
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,567
just listen.

626
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,334
I don't want Jack
to know I'm on the line.

627
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:48,734
Do you understand?

628
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,801
Okay.

629
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,067
You're involved in
something that's much bigger

630
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:54,868
than you can
possibly imagine.

631
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:57,868
So here's the deal.

632
00:32:57,933 --> 00:33:01,601
Unless you do exactly
what I say...

633
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,933
I will hurt Josh.

634
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,100
If you don't
believe that,

635
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,868
you might want
to consider this...

636
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:09,267
Graem's death
was not an accident.

637
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,868
I killed him.

638
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:13,967
I want you to say,
"Thank you, Susan."

639
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,701
Thank you, Susan.

640
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,601
Now, you're not going
to take Jack to the house

641
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,868
where Graem
met the Russians--

642
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:24,667
you're going to take him
to a different address--

643
00:33:24,734 --> 00:33:28,234
9407 Hindry Place.

644
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,534
You got it?

645
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,200
Yeah.
Good.

646
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,900
Now, you do this for me,

647
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:36,534
and I promise you,
you will see Josh again.

648
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,634
If you don't, he dies.

649
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,667
Okay.

650
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:46,067
9407 Hindry Place.

651
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:47,933
Do the right thing, Marilyn.

652
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,100
I already lost a son today.

653
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,834
Don't make me lose a grandson.

654
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,300
Good-bye, Susan.

655
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,534
Are you all right?

656
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:02,200
Fine.

657
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:06,401
Here you go.
Thank you.

658
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,067
That was my office.

659
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,234
A lot of the roads are still
shut because of the bomb.

660
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,100
Can we get home?

661
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:16,134
No. And no one knows seems to
know when they'll open up again.

662
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,834
Then what do we do?

663
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,634
We'll go to a hotel.

664
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:21,933
We can stay there
until they clear up.

665
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:45,900
Marilyn, is any
of this familiar?

666
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:47,967
Yes.

667
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:52,634
Jack?

668
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:55,334
What?

669
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:00,834
What is it?

670
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,267
It's nothing.

671
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,768
I thought I saw the house.

672
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,434
But I was wrong.

673
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:14,467
Oh, that was it.
Hindry Place.

674
00:35:15,534 --> 00:35:17,501
Milo, we got a street.

675
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:19,868
Hindry Place.
Copy that, Jack.

676
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,234
Relaying it to CTU now.

677
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,667
How long before the new targets
are reprogrammed?

678
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:33,768
20 minutes.

679
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,601
You still think you can
trust the Arabs?

680
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:43,334
They serve their purpose.

681
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:46,967
Our country lost the Cold War
because it was afraid

682
00:35:47,033 --> 00:35:49,267
to use these weapons
against the Americans.

683
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:57,267
Today we will correct

684
00:35:57,334 --> 00:35:59,601
that mistake.

685
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,768
And the Arabs will take
all the blame.

686
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:17,234
--All right, we're on it.
Chloe.

687
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:19,534
Marilyn remembers the street
where she believes

688
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,534
her husband met with Gredenko.

689
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,101
Hindry Place.

690
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:24,867
That's a mile away from where
they're looking. Is she sure?

691
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,134
That's what she told Jack.

692
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:28,301
Pull up all access roads
in and out of the area.

693
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:30,568
I'm in the middle of
reconfiguring the uplink.

694
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:37,733
I'll put Morris on it.

695
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,267
Your call.

696
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,633
I know you're lying to me.

697
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,234
Just like my mom.

698
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:06,633
You're all treating me

699
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,034
like I'm just some
stupid little kid.

700
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,301
What are you talking about?

701
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:12,201
I want to know why my dad died.

702
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:14,067
What's your mother told you?
It was a heart attack.

703
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,000
I know, but...

704
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,434
I know he was
doing something

705
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,267
illegal or whatever.

706
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:22,101
But nobody's telling me
what it was, and I just

707
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,733
want to know.

708
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,468
Did it have to do with the nuke?

709
00:37:27,534 --> 00:37:29,700
Look, Josh...

710
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:31,600
you're gonna hear a lot
of things about your father,

711
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,201
what he may or
may not have done.

712
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:36,367
I'm not gonna pretend
it's going to be
easy for you.

713
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,534
You know,
no matter what...

714
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,733
I'm gonna be
there for you.

715
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:01,401
That's it. The pale blue
house on the right.

716
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:02,501
Are you sure?

717
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:03,667
Yeah.

718
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:07,434
We've got an address.
9407 Hindry Place.

719
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,468
Initiate tactical
response with CTU.

720
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:10,967
Have them bring up the
schematics of the house.

721
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,834
Meet me in the alley
behind the target.

722
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,568
All right, I'm on it.

723
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:17,367
Hold on.

724
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:45,934
We're going after
the blue house.

725
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,301
Advise your men,
non-lethal force.

726
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,434
We need Gredenko alive.

727
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:50,834
Jack...

728
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,534
Marilyn, I want you to stay
in the tactical van.

729
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,034
You'll be safe there.
But, I have...

730
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,267
Jack, I've got the schematics.
There are two entrances.

731
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,434
One in the front,

732
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,468
one on the west
side of the house.

733
00:38:58,534 --> 00:39:00,301
Okay, I'll contact
CTU as soon as

734
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:01,401
we've got Gredenko
in custody.

735
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:02,900
Milo, I want you
to stay with Marilyn.

736
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:03,900
Are your men ready?

737
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,101
We're set.
Let's go.

738
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:35,167
All teams go. Go!

739
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:38,201
Go! Go!

740
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,434
Bomb! Everyone out!

741
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:51,367
(loud explosion)

742
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh!

743
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,867
Jack!

744
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:58,600
We've gotta go!
No! No!

745
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,167
Get in the van!
Get in the van
and close the door!

746
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,733
Jack? Jack, can you hear me?

747
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:45,101
(automatic gunfire)

748
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:50,000
(tires screeching)

749
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:56,134
Oh, they're coming!
Get out! Come on! Move! Move!

750
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,201
(screams)

751
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:03,067
Don't hit the woman!
We need her alive!

752
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,401
(gunshots blasting)

753
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:13,234
Move!

754
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:14,301
Move! Come on, come on! Move!

755
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:16,301
Go, go, go!

756
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:48,201
(grunting):
All agents report in.

757
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:51,101
All agents report in now.

758
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,401
Calling in for EMT.



9999
