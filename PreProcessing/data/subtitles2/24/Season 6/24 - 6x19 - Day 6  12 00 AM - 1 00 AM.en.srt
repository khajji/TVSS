1
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:14,700
This is Bauer.
Let me speak to Audrey.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,700
Her well-being's entirely
up yo you, Mr. Bauer

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,500
What we want is a component
from the triggering mechanism
the FB sub circuit board

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,567
You give me the component
I give you Audrey

5
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,767
<i>DOYLE:
Stand down, Jack!
I can't do that.</i>

6
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:35,733
I won't say it again. Drop it!
Agent Doyle, I am following
orders that exceed

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,434
you're security clearance...
He's a rogue agent.
Take him out.

8
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:42,600
It's my understanding, Jack,
that component

9
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,301
holds the key to Russian
defense codes.

10
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,334
<i>JACK:
I need the Chinese to believe</i>

11
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:49,267
that I'm willing to go through
with this exchange.

12
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:52,667
I will destroy the circuit board
with a concealed charge of C-4.

13
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,134
You're going to sacrifice
yourself?

14
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,401
Yes, sir, if I have to.

15
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:56,900
You're asking me to sign off

16
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:58,667
on a probable suicide mission.

17
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,301
Mr. President...

18
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:03,834
you owe me.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,767
JACK:
I want you to help me retrieve
one of those circuit boards.

20
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>CHLOE:
I'm sending it to your system.</i>

21
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:10,301
The Russians have been trying
to keep that technology

22
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,700
out of Chinese hands for years.
I did it for Jack.

23
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:14,167
Well, what are the Russians
going to say

24
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:15,767
when they find out
we just gave it to them?

25
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,600
Well, it's not going
to get that far.

26
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,434
You have to tell Buchanan.

27
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,700
Chloe, I want you to stand down
on this operation.

28
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,134
You've shown me
I can't trust you.

29
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,534
First I want to say that
I'm grateful to report

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,767
that all nuclear devices
have been recovered.

31
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,301
Based on the intelligence
that I've seen,

32
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,201
I can say with full confidence

33
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,167
that-that-that
that we will, uh...

34
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,134
(groans)

35
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,667
Get medical right away!

36
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:41,568
Notify the Senate and the House
of the transfer of power

37
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,201
and the Sec Def and the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs

38
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,800
authorize me under
the 25th Amendment.

39
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:50,568
Wayne Palmer just issued
a finding allowing Jack Bauer

40
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,967
to hand classified Russian
technology over to the Chinese

41
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:55,501
in exchange for the return
of a covertly held hostage.

42
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:58,334
Bauer has guaranteed
that the technology

43
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:01,134
will not fall into the hands
of the Chinese.

44
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,367
Even Jack Bauer can't
guarantee that outcome.

45
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:06,934
Tell CTU to stop Bauer.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,700
CTU has the signal.
They're monitoring the device.

47
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,301
We're set. Let's go.

48
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:13,301
(phone ringing)

49
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,468
Doyle.

50
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,167
<i>BUCHANAN:
Noah Daniels
is acting president.</i>

51
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:19,568
He wants the operation shut down

52
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,367
and Jack brought back
to CTU immediately.

53
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:22,468
Understood.

54
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:23,834
Don't you move.

55
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,867
Jack...

56
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:28,301
Slowly I want you to pull over.

57
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,067
Now.

58
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:32,334
This is going
to end badly, Jack.

59
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:35,134
You can't go against
the White House.

60
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,167
Wait! Wait!

61
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:51,334
Stop! Stop!

62
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:53,934
(horn honking)
Stop! Stop!

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,067
(tires screeching)
Wait! Wait! Stop your car! Stop!

64
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,900
Stop!

65
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,401
Stop! Stop!

66
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:04,700
What the hell?!
Are you crazy?!

67
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,934
I'm a federal agent in pursuit.
I need the vehicle.
Where's your badge?

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,934
(horns honking)

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,934
(tires screeching)

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,834
(phone ringing)
Pressman.

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,201
Milo, it's Doyle.
I need to speak with Buchanan.

72
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:31,667
Hold on.

73
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,700
Sir, Doyle's on line one.

74
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,600
Mike, it's Bill.

75
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,600
Do you have Jack in custody?
No, he got the drop on me

76
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,534
before I could get the
component-- I screwed up.
Where are you?

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,700
I acquired another
vehicle and I'm in pursuit.

78
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,600
Morris, do you have
Jack's position?
Yeah.

79
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,267
The tracker's still embedded
in the sub-board.

80
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,167
He's heading north on the 118.
Copy that.

81
00:03:50,234 --> 00:03:52,101
Mike, Jack's going
to disengage that tracker

82
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,267
the first
chance he gets.

83
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,834
I'll get him
before he does.

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,568
All right, listen up.

85
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,568
Jack Bauer has gone rogue.

86
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:01,034
He has in possession
the FB sub-circuit board.

87
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,800
Mike Doyle is in pursuit.

88
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,201
He needs all
available resources

89
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,633
to stop Jack and
recover the component

90
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,401
before he gives it
to the Chinese.

91
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:10,134
Chloe.

92
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:13,401
I need you on task.
You said that...

93
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:14,767
I know what I said.

94
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:18,434
I need my best people
looking for Jack.

95
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:20,367
Can I trust you
to help me do that?

96
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,534
Yes, sir.

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,934
Good. Thank you.

98
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:37,834
MORRIS:
Oh, that's bloody marvelous.

99
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,000
What?
I just lost
Jack's signal.

100
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,201
How'd you do that?

101
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:41,568
I didn't do anything.
It just disappeared.

102
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,434
(electrical wires crackling)

103
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
CHLOE:
There must be something
in the transit ph.

104
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,711
You don't have to state
the obvious, Chloe.

105
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,834
I know there's something
interfering, I'm  trying
to figure out what it is.

106
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,201
CHLOE:
This doesn't have
to be personal.

107
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,468
Can we just figure it out?
It's not personal,
and I've figured it out.

108
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,301
This stretch of road
runs right along

109
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,767
the main voltage feed
for the Valley,

110
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:28,167
and Jack is using
the power lines as a shield

111
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,101
while he separates
the tracker from
the sub-board.

112
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:32,800
Can you keep an eye
on things? Can you?

113
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:35,101
I have to explain this
to Buchanan.

114
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,967
Hey, I thought
you got sidelined.

115
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:46,767
Buchanan wants me to help
find Jack.

116
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:49,468
Which is going to be harder now
that he's dumped the tracker.

117
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:50,733
Did you pull up Caltrans?

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,767
Yeah.

119
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,934
I just can't believe that Jack

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,468
would give up the circuit board
to the Chinese.

121
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:56,733
Jack would die

122
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,201
before he gives up that
component to the Chinese.

123
00:05:58,267 --> 00:05:59,767
I agree with you.

124
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,267
The question is... would Jack
give up Audrey's life?

125
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,667
Exactly.

126
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,468
Look, I'll...

127
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:11,900
I'll check the satellites.

128
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,767
See if they've restored any
coverage in that area.

129
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:15,000
If you find anything,

130
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:18,401
send it to me, Doyle and LAPD.

131
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:20,067
How much farther?
We lost Jack

132
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:21,834
eight miles north
of your current location.

133
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,834
We think he used the power
lines as a shield

134
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,934
while he removed
the tracker.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,101
You're headed in
the right direction.

136
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,934
See you if you can
pick up a trail.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,134
I'll call you back
when I get closer.
Thank you, Morris.

138
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,501
All right.

139
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:34,733
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a brief statement

140
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,334
and I will not be taking any
questions at this time.

141
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,834
The President is en route

142
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
to Bethesda Naval Hospital
and will arrive shortly.

143
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,034
The doctors have no idea
whether or not

144
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,334
President Palmer
will come out of his coma

145
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,267
in hours, days or weeks.

146
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,501
Vice President Daniels will be
addressing the country

147
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:51,000
at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.

148
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,501
Thank you.

149
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:56,101
That's all, everyone.

150
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,067
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

151
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:00,733
Tom...
Yes, sir.

152
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,700
Stick around.
I want to talk to you.

153
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,934
All right, sir.

154
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:11,767
We need to clear the air,
you and I.

155
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,767
You still have
evidence

156
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,000
that could hurt me,

157
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,867
and I'd like to know what
your intentions are.

158
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:20,867
Truthfully, sir, I haven't
given it much thought.

159
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:24,101
Why don't you think
about it now.

160
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:28,134
All right, sir.

161
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:32,434
It concerns me that you engaged
in conspiracy and perjury

162
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,334
to achieve
political ends.

163
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,700
I don't think

164
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,534
that's behavior befitting

165
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,568
the acting president
of the United States.

166
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,900
Tom, the world has changed
in the last half hour.

167
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:48,800
Right now, this country,
above all, needs stability.

168
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:50,334
If I'm brought up on charges

169
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,834
in the first hours
of this presidency,

170
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,733
then America's left without

171
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,934
elected leadership.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,568
If I might just complete
my thought, sir--

173
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,334
I made that tape both to back
you off your challenge

174
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,767
to President Palmer,

175
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,000
but also to protect me.

176
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,267
Now that was,

177
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:07,568
and remains,
my only reason.

178
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,867
What about forcing
my resignation?

179
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:11,034
That was Wayne Palmer's idea,
not mine.

180
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,367
So...

181
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:20,334
you're okay then
with me in this chair?

182
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:25,934
Sir, it's no secret
that policy-wise

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,101
you and I are in alignment.

184
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,633
I just simply hate
how we got here.

185
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,167
Now that we are here?

186
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:37,934
Yes, sir, you have my support.

187
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,501
(sighs)

188
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:48,267
In the event that we ever get
out of alignment...

189
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:51,301
I can't have you holding
this evidence

190
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,867
over my head.

191
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:54,967
It's understood, sir.
You have my word.

192
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,000
All right, Tom.

193
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:01,501
Glad to have you with me.

194
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,000
Now what do you suggest

195
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,900
we do with Karen Hayes?

196
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,000
Will she slow us down?

197
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,101
Of course she might,

198
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,334
but she is smart,
she brings balance.

199
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,633
Fine, then she stays.

200
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,301
Right. May I let her know, sir?

201
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:20,434
Sure.

202
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,101
Tom.

203
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,101
Thank you.

204
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,767
Thank you, sir.

205
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,401
(phone ringing)

206
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:35,600
Yes.

207
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,733
This is Bauer. I just passed
mile marker 49.

208
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,633
I have the sub-circuit
board with me.

209
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,600
Good. Go east on
the 118...

210
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,034
No, from this point forward
we do this my way.

211
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,568
Don't test me, Mr. Bauer.

212
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,034
Yes, I want
the component,

213
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:50,934
but Audrey Raines' life
means nothing to me.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Listen to me.

215
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,468
CTU is looking for me.

216
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:55,334
They want to stop
the exchange from happening.

217
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:56,367
I know their satellite coverage.

218
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,633
I need to pick the location.

219
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,867
All right.

220
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,434
Where?

221
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,501
There's an abandoned motel
called the Calderone

222
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:06,633
off of Highway 305.

223
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,434
Come through the
front door alone.

224
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,334
We'll make
the exchange there.

225
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:15,367
We both have a chance to get
what we want here, Mr. Bauer.

226
00:10:15,434 --> 00:10:18,034
Don't attempt anything foolish.

227
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,334
We're leaving now,
Ms. Raines.

228
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:23,867
(speaking Chinese)

229
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:49,601
I spoke with Bill,
and he assures me

230
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,834
that CTU has deployed all its
resources to find Bauer.

231
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,567
I don't want to hear about
their assurances, Karen.

232
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:56,134
They let Bauer steal
the component,

233
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,434
so their assurances
mean nothing.

234
00:10:57,501 --> 00:10:59,734
Well, if I may, sir.

235
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:01,200
I could authorize

236
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,367
ancillary agencies
to join the search.

237
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:04,734
That would increase
our chances

238
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:05,734
of finding Bauer.

239
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,033
Do it.

240
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:19,601
Is there anything else
you need from me?

241
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:23,501
Is there anything else
I need from you?

242
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,634
Let me think.

243
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:29,267
(sighs)

244
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:32,000
I have the fate
of the Western world

245
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,868
and the lives of millions of
Americans hanging in the balance

246
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:39,300
and I can't...
stop thinking about you.

247
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,167
I'm not sure this is
appropriate behavior,

248
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,967
Mr. Acting President.

249
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:48,534
Well, there's the phone,
call to the media.

250
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:53,000
Tell them the acting
president's a dirty old man.

251
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,100
They already know.

252
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:14,900
I would like for you...

253
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,933
to spend what's left
of the night.

254
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,634
I'll go home and pick up
a change of clothes.

255
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:27,834
Good.

256
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,933
I'm at the Tampa exit
by the power lines.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,601
It matches the last
coordinates Morris had

258
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,534
before the tracker
stopped working.
Mike, it's Bill.

259
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:56,067
The White House is telling me
if the Chinese get ahold

260
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,434
of this sub-circuit
board, we'll have

261
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:59,167
an international
incident on our hands.

262
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,501
I know the stakes, Bill.

263
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:03,234
Have you been able to figure
out where Jack's headed?

264
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm working on it now.

265
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,134
It looks like he headed east.

266
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,501
What's up ahead?

267
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,334
Two state routes,

268
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:20,868
the 305 and the 98.

269
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,334
Do you have
satellite on both?

270
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,834
No. The radiation
from the fallout

271
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,267
made that area
hard to cover.

272
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,634
But the 98 has
Caltrans cameras--
I can check them.

273
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:28,967
No, don't bother.

274
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,801
Jack would know about
those-- he's on the 305.

275
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:32,434
And check the cell
towers in the area.

276
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:35,401
See if you can pick up a phone
call between Jack and Cheng.

277
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:38,401
And I think I saw Jack pick up
one of the terrorist's phones

278
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,534
at the warehouse-- that
might help narrow things down.

279
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,267
Chloe's got that grid
on her system-- get it from her.

280
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:46,401
Who's that?

281
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:48,768
Doyle. He thinks
Jack's on the 305.

282
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,501
How would he know that?

283
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,801
He figured it out.

284
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:53,367
Chloe, I need you to pull

285
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:54,834
the logs on grid 19-dash-12.

286
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,234
Get everything off that cell
tower for the last 15 minutes.

287
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,200
What am I looking for?
I think Jack's using

288
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,367
one of the terrorist's
phones that were tagged
at the warehouse.

289
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:03,534
Check all outgoing calls.
We'll get it.

290
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,900
Oh, um...

291
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,634
what is this?
Those are today's

292
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:10,300
decryption schemes
from the cell towers.

293
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:12,167
I'm sending you
some scrambled calls.

294
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,768
We're looking for a conversation

295
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:15,933
between Jack and Cheng.

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,367
Why didn't you speak to me first
before over-writing my screen?

297
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:20,567
I don't know,
that's just the way I did it.

298
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:23,467
Okay, okay. We're being
a little hostile, aren't we?
Fine.

299
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,401
I'm hostile,
but I just didn't get there--

300
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:28,234
you pushed me halfway.
Actually, you're right--
it's my fault, all my fault.

301
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,000
I didn't say
it's all your fault.

302
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,367
I said halfway, 50%,

303
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,200
point-five-- see,
you don't listen to me.

304
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,601
That's why I just sent it
to your screen.

305
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,467
Hey, guys.

306
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:40,033
What's going on?
My ex-wife

307
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,300
is suddenly showing signs
of irrational behavior.

308
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:44,467
Okay.

309
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:46,300
Do you know how
to defrag Huffman keys?

310
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:49,768
Yeah. Why?
Can you help me out with this?

311
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:52,334
Yeah.
Great. I'll just send
the files to your system.

312
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:57,834
That's a really good idea.

313
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,900
You should work with Milo--
you know, get cozy.
Would you please

314
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,000
stop acting like this?

315
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,933
I really hate it.
Why don't you

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,267
write down the way
you want me to act,

317
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:10,234
put it in a file, tab delimited,
the Milo loves it, and...

318
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,667
shove it.

319
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:13,734
Okay. I'll write it down--
the first item on the list

320
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,300
would be:
"Don't be such a jealous jerk."

321
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:18,200
Okay. Um, the day I'm jealous
is the day I kill myself.

322
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,634
Is there anything else?

323
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,200
How about: "Don't arm nuclear
bombs for terrorists"?

324
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,801
(exhales)

325
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:29,534
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

326
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,601
That's not how I feel.

327
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,634
Yeah, it is.

328
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:41,834
No, it's not.
It just slipped out of my mouth.

329
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:44,801
Morris...

330
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,801
I'll call Mel
over at the FBI,

331
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,667
get them to share
resources with Bill.

332
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:55,401
(phone rings)
Good, and I'll... Oh.

333
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,868
Excuse me.

334
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:58,434
Yeah?

335
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:01,100
Okay.

336
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:04,734
Well, tell him
I'll be right there.

337
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:06,067
That's strange.

338
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:07,868
Peter Hock
is in my office,

339
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,200
and he wants to talk to me.
Department of Justice?
What is that about?

340
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,367
I have no idea.
Be careful, Karen.

341
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:17,334
He's got a lot of
clout on the Hill.
I know. I'll call you.

342
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,033
Peter.

343
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,768
Early enough for you?

344
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,234
(laughs)

345
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,100
So, what's going on?
It sounded urgent.

346
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,734
You know that
I've been interrogating

347
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:34,434
Tom's chief of staff,
Reed Pollock, after his arrest.

348
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:35,900
That must be pleasant.

349
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,701
(chuckles)

350
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,900
Pollock's looking at a
probable death sentence

351
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:43,100
for his part in the
assassination attempt
on Wayne Palmer.
Mm-hmm.

352
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,601
Out of desperation, he's
offering up everything he knows,

353
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:47,434
hoping we'll show
some leniency.

354
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:50,768
And what does that
have to do with me?
Not just you, this involves

355
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,134
your husband as well.

356
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,900
Take a look.

357
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,367
Listen to me, Peter.

358
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,200
You and I both know
that there are

359
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:05,900
going to be endless hearings
looking into how Fayedmanaged

360
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,567
to acquire the nukes.

361
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:09,868
PETER:
And you know something
about that?

362
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,501
I can give you key information

363
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,267
that will help keep blame
away from this administration.

364
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,601
PETER:
I'm listening.

365
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,033
POLLOCK:
Well, I'm not saying anything

366
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,768
until I have some sort
of deal, in writing.

367
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,100
He's such a weasel.

368
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:24,501
We, uh, danced around
for 20 minutes, then he...

369
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,234
said this.

370
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,100
I'm telling you...
exactly what happened.

371
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,567
Bill Buchanan

372
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,933
had Fayed in custody,
and he let him go.

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,634
PETER:
And where's the proof?

374
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:39,434
POLLOCK:
Karen Hayes put it

375
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:42,134
in a blue file over at Homeland.

376
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,967
That's a cover-up.

377
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:46,167
And if you don't believe me,

378
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:48,933
I have recorded conversations
with Peter Iannone,

379
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,900
Kurt Hueig and Myra Mawk,

380
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:55,134
and they will all testify
that she sequestered the file

381
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,134
to protect her husband.

382
00:18:01,033 --> 00:18:03,267
Do me a favor, Karen.

383
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:06,033
Save me some time.

384
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,734
Is it true or not?

385
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,100
The facts are true.

386
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:10,868
But there's no
cover-up here, Peter.

387
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,967
About two years ago,

388
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:16,734
we apprehended Fayed as part
of an FBI-CTU border sweep.

389
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:17,933
There wasn't enough

390
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,967
to hold him,
he was one of many,

391
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,768
<i>and he was maybe
a mid-level player.</i>

392
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,200
And that turned out
to be wrong.

393
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,367
Fayed wasn't part of a cell;
he wasn't funded.

394
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,134
This all happened
after he was released.

395
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,501
So why was it blue-coded?
Every year,

396
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,534
thousands of suspects
are arrested.

397
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:35,501
If there isn't enough evidence
to hold them, they're released

398
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,300
and blue-coded-- that's
just standard procedure.

399
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,834
<i>The only way to guarantee
that no one becomes</i>

400
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,167
a threat is to hold everyone
and deprive them

401
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:43,467
of their rights and freedom.

402
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,634
All right, Karen,
then if this was a no-fault,

403
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:48,534
why did this carry so much
weight with you 12 hours ago.

404
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:50,067
Why did you resign

405
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:51,900
rather than have this come out?

406
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,734
Come on, Peter,
we were under attack.

407
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,467
There was no way I was gonna
let this information touch

408
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:58,834
the president or my husband.

409
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,933
They needed to lead us
through this crisis unimpeded.

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,401
Well, here we are,

411
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,033
12 hours later,

412
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,634
Palmer's in a coma,

413
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:08,834
the country's in shock
after losing over 13,000

414
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,900
innocent lives, and all people
are going to be asking

415
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:15,801
is who let this happen?

416
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,734
<i>Well, certainly not my husband.</i>

417
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,567
He has devoted his life

418
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,367
to this country.

419
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:26,200
This isn't my call, Karen, but
I think you know how this works.

420
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,567
Someone's going to have
to go down.

421
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,467
And the farther
from the president

422
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:32,401
the better.

423
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,000
So what exactly are you saying?

424
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,667
It's going to be
either you or Bill.

425
00:19:37,734 --> 00:19:40,234
Bill would be
my preference--

426
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,401
he's lower on the food chain.

427
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,434
But you'll do.

428
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:27,034
(phone rings)
Doyle.

429
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:28,934
NADIA:
We found Jack's call to Cheng.

430
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,334
What'd he say?

431
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:31,934
We haven't decrypted it yet,
but the triangulation

432
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,667
shows he's traveling north on
the 305 just like you thought.

433
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,667
Anything between me
and Santa Maria?

434
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,501
Uh, some small populated areas
in the county, unincorporated.

435
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:41,600
When does
the next one come up?

436
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,234
About nine miles
from where you are now.

437
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,267
All right, check it out,

438
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,667
and keep working
on that decryption.

439
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:47,834
I want to know what Cheng
and Jack said to each other.

440
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,334
Okay.
Are we converging
on Jack?

441
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:52,167
(phone rings)
Yeah. Doyle's...

442
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:54,600
Excuse me. Hi.

443
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,767
KAREN:
Hi. It's me.
Do you have a minute?

444
00:21:56,834 --> 00:21:59,301
No. We're closing in on Jack.
What is it?

445
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,700
We have to talk about something.

446
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,234
Why don't you call me
when you have a few minutes.

447
00:22:03,301 --> 00:22:05,967
Okay. Everything all right?

448
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:09,900
Just... do what you have to do
and call me when you can, okay?

449
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,600
All right.
Bye.

450
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,867
Yes?
Well, Doyle's headed
in the right direction.

451
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,434
He can't be that
far behind.

452
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,234
We may have a chance to stop
Jack before he reaches Cheng.

453
00:22:20,301 --> 00:22:23,034
He's traveling north on the 305.

454
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:25,234
About there.

455
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,767
Hey, let me call you back.

456
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,468
Has CTU made any progress
in locating Bauer?

457
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:37,167
They're closing in, but they
don't have him in custody yet.

458
00:22:37,234 --> 00:22:39,167
You were right about Hock, Tom.

459
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,967
I need to talk to you.
All right, shoot.

460
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:44,667
Remember earlier when
you threatened to use

461
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:47,667
that information about Fayed
to damage Bill and me?

462
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,034
Karen, yeah, mea culpa.

463
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,334
Wh-Why are we dredging
this up now?
No, no.

464
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:53,067
Tom, it's not me.

465
00:22:53,134 --> 00:22:54,468
It's Reed Pollock.

466
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,534
He's looking for anything

467
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,568
to bargain his way out
of the death penalty.
Well, he can't.

468
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:02,667
Well, whether he can or he
can't, that ship has sailed.

469
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:05,934
Hock knows now that we released
Fayed from our custody

470
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,534
two years ago
in Seattle.
Okay, okay.

471
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,534
What does Hock want?
Distance from the presidency.

472
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:18,367
Ah, so in other words,
either you or Bill

473
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,700
has to take the blame.
Yeah. But it's more
than blame, Tom.

474
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,234
There's gonna be inquiries,

475
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,267
indictments, investigations--
lives will be ruined.

476
00:23:25,334 --> 00:23:27,067
Not lives, careers.

477
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:28,667
Or rather, one career.

478
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:30,468
And it can't be yours.

479
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:34,201
Well, I can't do
that to Bill, Tom.

480
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:37,501
He's my husband.
Well, he can go on
being your husband,

481
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,468
but he sure can't
keep running CTU.

482
00:23:39,534 --> 00:23:41,667
(sighs)

483
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:43,733
Well, if he goes,
then I'm gonna resign.

484
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,568
Haven't you already
resigned once today?

485
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:50,167
Karen, that's Bill's signature
on Fayed's release document.

486
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:52,167
Now, it's over for Bill.

487
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:55,301
It's not for you-- I mean,
you've got a job here.

488
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,568
Just do it.

489
00:23:58,934 --> 00:24:00,301
(sighs)

490
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,468
Tom, how can I ask him

491
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:03,967
to step down?

492
00:24:04,034 --> 00:24:05,900
You don't ask--
you simply remind him

493
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:08,501
that the man he personally
let out of jail

494
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:10,367
killed over 13,000 people
this morning.

495
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:13,367
Tom, he is not
responsible for that.

496
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:16,134
Karen, it doesn't matter.
He has been amazing today!

497
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:19,334
Look, look, look, the only way
for you to protect yourself

498
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:22,401
is to leave no doubt
in anybody's mind

499
00:24:22,468 --> 00:24:23,733
where your true loyalty lies.

500
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
Now, they got Bill in
the crosshairs, okay?

501
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:28,167
You want to stand shoulder
to should with your husband,

502
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,834
that's your call.

503
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,434
(sighs)

504
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,667
(sighs)

505
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:12,034
(ringing)

506
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:13,267
This is Bill Buchanan.

507
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:15,468
If your matter is urgent,
please dial zero.

508
00:25:15,534 --> 00:25:17,101
If this is not an urgent call,

509
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,900
please leave a message
at the beep.

510
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:19,934
(beep)

511
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,733
Bill, it's Jack.

512
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,134
I'm about to meet with Cheng

513
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:25,733
and exchange the FB
sub-circuit board for Audrey.

514
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,534
Hopefully,
by the time you hear this,

515
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,067
she'll be safe
and in your custody.

516
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:32,501
Bill, I know
I promised the president

517
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:33,934
that I would give him
confirmation

518
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,267
that the circuit board did
not fall into the wrong hands.

519
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:39,267
This message
is your confirmation.

520
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:43,600
The circuit board will be
incinerated in the explosion.

521
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,067
The meeting will take place
at the Calderone Motel

522
00:25:46,134 --> 00:25:47,633
off of Highway 305.

523
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,967
Bill...

524
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,534
Please take care of Audrey.

525
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
And thank you.

526
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:00,802
You've been a good friend

527
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:21,133
All right, Marcy. I'll talk
to you in the morning.

528
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,400
Yeah.

529
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:26,834
You have a second?

530
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:27,867
What is it, Morris?

531
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:34,801
I'd like to request a transfer.

532
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:36,167
Why?

533
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,434
I need to get out of Comm.

534
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,701
You want to
elaborate on that?

535
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,934
Not really, no.

536
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:44,667
You and Chloe having problems?

537
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:47,567
You could say that, yes.

538
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:50,367
I really hate
to lose you in Comm.

539
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,034
Can we talk about
this in the morning?

540
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Nothing's gonna change.

541
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,001
You don't
know that, Miles.
I do.

542
00:26:55,068 --> 00:26:56,901
Look. Please.

543
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:58,834
Figure out where
you want to put me.

544
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,133
Anywhere is fine.

545
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,068
Just get me
out of Comm.

546
00:27:04,601 --> 00:27:06,634
All right.

547
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:08,133
We'll work
something out

548
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,001
that, uh, that's good
for everyone involved.

549
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:14,167
Thank you.

550
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,034
(phone ringing)

551
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,467
Hi, honey.

552
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:23,667
Hey.

553
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:24,701
I have a minute.

554
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,467
Did you want
to talk about something?

555
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:29,233
Bill,

556
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,167
the DOJ investigator
found out about Seattle,

557
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,200
when you and Homeland
had Fayed in custody.

558
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:35,200
"Found out"?

559
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,767
It wasn't a secret.

560
00:27:36,834 --> 00:27:38,034
We did everything by the book.

561
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,133
I can deal with DOJ.

562
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,367
Yeah, I know, but...

563
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:43,467
The problem is, they're
out for blood, Bill.

564
00:27:43,534 --> 00:27:46,701
I can't let
this touch me.

565
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:48,834
Touch you? What are
you talking about?

566
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,968
Bill, I...
Why is this
suddenly an issue?

567
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:51,968
Are you concerned

568
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:53,467
I might implicate you?

569
00:27:53,534 --> 00:27:57,367
No. No, but obviously there's
guilt by association here.

570
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,334
They're looking
for a scapegoat.

571
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,534
Yes. The pundits and
the press are looking

572
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,133
for anything to attack
the administration.

573
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,467
What are you saying?

574
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,567
I have to protect
the White House, Bill.

575
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:13,167
and in order to do that, I have
to distance myself from you.

576
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,634
How are you going to do that?

577
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:16,267
I'm your husband.

578
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,500
You asking me to resign?

579
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,601
No, Bill.

580
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,068
I have to fire you.

581
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:37,034
There's pressure on you, Karen.

582
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,534
Look, this is the only way

583
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:39,901
this can work.

584
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,701
And it has
to happen immediately.

585
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:44,500
or I'll be viewed as complicit
and my ability to stay on

586
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,968
as national security advisor
will be undermined.

587
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,701
Undermined?

588
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:50,400
We're talking about
the end of my career.

589
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:52,034
You don't think that
I've thought this through?

590
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,334
No, I don't.

591
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,767
You don't think
that I don't know

592
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:55,801
what this means to you?

593
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,901
No, I don't.
Bill...

594
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,767
Because the public
will make assumptions

595
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:01,367
that don't exist.

596
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:03,701
13,000 American lives lost.

597
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,767
I had the man in custody who was
responsible, and I released him.

598
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:09,034
It won't matter that I had
no evidence to hold him.

599
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,601
Look, you know how this works.

600
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,334
One of us has to take the fall,
and it can't be me.

601
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,001
I'm too close to the president.

602
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:17,801
I can't believe
I'm hearing this.

603
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,334
Who is pressuring you, Karen?

604
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,434
What are you not saying?

605
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,867
You have to trust me
on this, honey.

606
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,467
We will get through
this, I promise.

607
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:29,068
And... I love you, and that's
all that should matter here.

608
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:30,300
Is it?

609
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,834
Yes.

610
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:45,834
(phone ringing)

611
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:46,867
(hangs up)

612
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:54,500
Why is it taking so long
with Jack's phone call to Cheng?

613
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:55,667
It just is, Mike.

614
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,834
He used a double-length
key to slow us down.

615
00:29:57,901 --> 00:29:59,467
We're going as fast as we can.

616
00:29:59,534 --> 00:30:01,367
All right, I'm off the highway.
Mile Marker 19.

617
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:02,534
Checking surface streets.

618
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,867
(ringing)

619
00:30:13,934 --> 00:30:15,200
Hello, Valley Cab Company.

620
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,200
May I help you?

621
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:17,267
My name is Jack Bauer.

622
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:18,534
I'm a counter-terrorist agent.

623
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:19,701
This is an emergency.

624
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,867
I don't see any sign of Jack.

625
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:25,068
What's further north of here?

626
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,500
Nothing but national forest
for 32 miles.

627
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:31,667
He could be in
the Central Valley by now.

628
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:34,001
Wait. I might
have found something.

629
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:36,001
I'll get back to you.
Okay.

630
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:48,866
Nadia.

631
00:30:48,933 --> 00:30:52,466
Has Doyle
found Jack yet?

632
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:53,766
Well, he might have a lead.

633
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,232
He's checking
it out now.
All right.

634
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:58,933
Come with me.

635
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:11,866
I'm stepping down
as director of CTU.

636
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,366
What?

637
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:15,833
What happened?

638
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,866
All I can say is

639
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:18,232
I have to step down.

640
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,299
No. Sir, that
doesn't make any sense.

641
00:31:20,366 --> 00:31:21,866
Why would you quit--

642
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:22,966
now of all days?

643
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:24,399
I'm not quitting.

644
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,199
I was fired.

645
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:32,299
By who?

646
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,533
It doesn't matter.

647
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,833
I've contacted Division.

648
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,100
For now, you're acting director.

649
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,167
Mr. Buchanan.

650
00:31:42,232 --> 00:31:45,499
We've been ordered
to escort you off the premises.

651
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,633
I know.

652
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,033
I'm briefing Ms. Yassir.

653
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,866
She's taking over
as head of CTU. We'll need

654
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:51,866
one more minute, please.

655
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:52,900
<i>One minute.</i>

656
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:57,933
Sir, we're in the middle
of 50 different things here.

657
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,599
Why would they do
this to you now?

658
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:00,866
I can't talk about it.

659
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:03,499
You need to accept it
and do the best you can.

660
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:05,733
No. I don't understand
why they would fire you.

661
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,766
You're the most ethical,
dedicated person

662
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,199
I've ever known.

663
00:32:09,266 --> 00:32:11,366
There's no way you did
anything to justify this,

664
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:16,433
Damn it, Bill, what is going on?

665
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,067
It's just politics.

666
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:24,466
Division will be sending
over an interim director

667
00:32:24,533 --> 00:32:26,466
in the next few hours.
In the meantime,

668
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,366
you can handle
anything that comes up.

669
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,633
What about the
extra redundancies

670
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,733
and everything else I've
had to go through today?

671
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,232
I'm not the right
choice to take over.

672
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:37,866
I've lifted all the restrictions
on your security clearance.

673
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:41,133
You shouldn't have any
trouble running CTU.

674
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,933
<i>You are the right choice.</i>

675
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,966
I don't know what to say.

676
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,199
Just stay on top

677
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,499
of the situation with Jack.

678
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,133
I will.

679
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,566
No one else
knows I'm leaving

680
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:56,466
You have to inform them
before it's posted

681
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:57,966
on the internal forums

682
00:32:58,033 --> 00:32:59,866
I'll tell them.

683
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:11,299
What you said means a lot.

684
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,566
(phone ringing)

685
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,933
O'Brian.

686
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,966
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, got it.

687
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,332
Doyle just called in.

688
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,666
He's found Jack's truck.

689
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:30,866
Good, Morris.

690
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:37,700
What's happening
to Buchanan?

691
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,700
He's gone.

692
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:41,366
What do you
mean, he's gone?

693
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm in charge.

694
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:52,800
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

695
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,633
In a few minutes you're gonna be
getting a bulletin

696
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,633
on your systems.

697
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,167
Bill Buchanan has stepped down,

698
00:34:00,232 --> 00:34:03,133
which means that
until Division

699
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:07,299
can send over a replacement,
he's named me acting director.

700
00:34:07,366 --> 00:34:10,133
Nothing will change
operationally.

701
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,466
Your objective
remains the same--

702
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:15,833
Bring in Jack Bauer before
he can hand over the component

703
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,966
to the Chinese.

704
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:21,633
Thank you.

705
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,734
CTU, this is Doyle.
Do you copy?

706
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:53,367
Doyle, you're on com.
Go ahead.

707
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:55,634
Do you have anything
on satellite yet?

708
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,667
MILO:
Spotty.

709
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:58,233
Well, I found our truck.

710
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,467
Either Jack switched vehicles
or he parked it and he's nearby.

711
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:03,033
I'm gonna go look
at the buildings.

712
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:10,166
All right, there's some
infrastructure around

713
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,833
we can check
using thermal. Chloe?

714
00:35:11,899 --> 00:35:13,166
I'm on it.

715
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:14,600
Hang on. We might
not need it.

716
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,667
What do you mean?

717
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:17,433
A limo just pulled off
the highway.

718
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,500
Redirect all nearby units
to my current location.

719
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:22,833
Okay.

720
00:35:22,899 --> 00:35:24,333
Send Alpha and Delta teams
to that location.

721
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,233
Also send Air One, Two
and Three for air support.

722
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,667
All right.

723
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,866
Cheng just left the car.

724
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:03,899
Far enough.

725
00:36:03,966 --> 00:36:06,267
Mr. Bauer.

726
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,166
Where's Audrey?

727
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,866
She's in the car.

728
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,100
Until I get the component...

729
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,267
Nothing's going
to happen

730
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,400
until I see Audrey.

731
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,200
I want to make sure
she's all right.

732
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,500
(speaks Chinese)

733
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:27,533
She's coming in now.

734
00:36:30,933 --> 00:36:33,667
Audrey Raines is entering
the premises.

735
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:36,467
I think I'm gonna need
that backup.

736
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:38,799
You have the sub circuit board?

737
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,799
You'll get it as soon
as I know she's safe.

738
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:45,700
(speaks Chinese)

739
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,734
Take the gag
out of her mouth.

740
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,500
Wait!

741
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,933
I'll do it.

742
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,734
(speaks Chinese)

743
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:34,634
(whispering):
I'm so sorry.

744
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,899
CHENG:
You can continue
this reunion later.

745
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:41,533
How is this gonna work,
Mr. Bauer?

746
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,066
Audrey walks out
of her alone.

747
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:47,899
As soon as I see that she gets
down near the bridge

748
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,899
I'll know she's out of
the range of your sniper.

749
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:53,100
Then I'll give you
the component.

750
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,734
There's at least ten guns.

751
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:55,966
I need the field teams.

752
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:57,467
Let's do this.

753
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:03,000
I want you to walk
past the bridge a hundred yards,

754
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:06,500
on the right side of the road,
do you understand?

755
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:09,100
There's a gas station, and
a cab will be waiting for you.

756
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,500
He has instructions
to take you back to CTU.

757
00:38:13,899 --> 00:38:16,267
You need to go.

758
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:17,667
Go.

759
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:29,300
All right, this is
going down now, Nadia.

760
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,933
Where are
the field teams?!

761
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,367
They should be there
any minute.

762
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:34,200
I need to do
something now.

763
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:35,533
They're releasing Audrey
which means Jack

764
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,100
is about to hand
over the component.

765
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,166
Mike, don't let that happen.

766
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,700
Give me the circuit board
or I'll kill her.

767
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:02,866
Oh, damn it!

768
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:18,200
(tires squealing)

769
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:23,734
Miss Raines,
stay where you are.

770
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:24,866
Stay down!

771
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:28,833
(men shouting,
gunfire continues)

772
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,066
(speaks Chinese)

773
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,734
CTU, this is Air One.
Do you copy?
Go ahead.

774
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:42,166
Cheng and his men have escaped.

775
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,333
They're in three black Hummers

776
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,367
heading north
towards the mountains.

777
00:39:44,433 --> 00:39:46,267
Traveling off road.

778
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,500
Pursue and engage.

779
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,066
We've been hit!

780
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,933
We're going down!
I repeat, we're going down!

781
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,766
(engine sputtering)

782
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:17,799
* *

783
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:50,433
Agent Bauer, get down!
My weapon is down!

784
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,467
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

785
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,567
Who is your commanding officer?!

786
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:55,966
I am, Jack.

787
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:58,734
Stand him up.

788
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:00,966
Where's the sub-circuit board?
Cheng's got it.

789
00:41:01,033 --> 00:41:03,400
I was set to blow the building
and destroy the component

790
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,799
until you engaged us
in a firefight.

791
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:06,933
Here's the detonator.

792
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,600
What's the problem?

793
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:13,066
We don't have Cheng, Jack.

794
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,066
What do you mean,
you don't have him?

795
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:16,367
The assault teams didn't have
time to get into place.

796
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:17,400
We had to make
a frontal assault.

797
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:19,100
He must have escaped
out the rear.

798
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,300
Nadia, did you get that?

799
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,000
Cheng escaped with
the sub-circuit board.

800
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,533
We got a chopper down.

801
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,899
We need those
other choppers ASAP.

802
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:27,200
I know. The chopper should be
there in five minutes.

803
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:28,400
Listen, before they went down,

804
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:30,066
they reported seeing Cheng
and his men

805
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:31,433
traveling in three
black Hummers

806
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,267
in the mountains
off road traveling north.

807
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:35,433
Copy that.

808
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,533
Now place Jack under arrest.

809
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,700
Understood.

810
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,200
Is he gone?

811
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:45,799
Yeah.

812
00:41:45,866 --> 00:41:47,600
I gotta take you
into custody, Jack.

813
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,966
I had this handled.

814
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:51,233
Why the hell didn't you
listen to me?

815
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:00,467
Audrey, it's over.

816
00:42:00,533 --> 00:42:01,600
It's all right.
You're safe.

817
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,000
Help me, Jack.

818
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,833
Please don't let them
do this to me.
Audrey...

819
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,667
Help me, Jack, don't
let them do...
Audrey!

820
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,367
It's me. I'm right here.

821
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:18,799
Do you even know who I am?

822
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:20,267
DOYLE:
Sit her down.

823
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:23,634
They've done something to her.

824
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,200
You got to help her, please.

825
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:26,766
We will. Let's go, Jack.

826
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,100
Please.

827
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,433
(indistinct muttering)

828
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,567
My God.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
