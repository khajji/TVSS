1
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:31,234
We have a successful launch.

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,434
a general

3
00:00:32,501 --> 00:00:34,267
in our central command--

4
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,300
General Mohmar Habib, who has
also been in contact with Fayed.

5
00:00:37,367 --> 00:00:39,634
He's been helping orchestrate
the attacks on your country.

6
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:42,167
I really hope protecting this
man was worth pushing us

7
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:44,667
to the brink of World War III.

8
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:49,467
I've never found pharmaceutical
torture all that affective.

9
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,100
I have.

10
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,567
If this is supposed
to frighten me,

11
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:54,501
you're wasting your time.

12
00:00:54,567 --> 00:00:56,067
<i>I won't tell you a thing.</i>

13
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,334
Watch out!

14
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:04,067
<i>BUCHANAN:
We staged a fake rescue
of Fayed by CTU agents</i>

15
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:06,000
<i>posing as members
of a terrorist cell</i>

16
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,200
<i>with loyalties to Habib.</i>

17
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,534
He wants us to help you
rendezvous with your men.

18
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,133
Where do you want us
to take you?

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,467
If you take your orders
from General Habib as I do,

20
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,334
how is it
I've never heard of you?

21
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:18,801
Fayed's gone!

22
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:20,701
Jamal's still alive.

23
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,234
Stay with him, call in a medic.

24
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:48,000
CTU, the bombs are secure.

25
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,133
Hello?

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,601
AUDREY:
Jack, are you there?

27
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:53,801
Can you hear me?

28
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,167
Audrey.

29
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:57,400
Help me, Jack.

30
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,300
Hello, Mr. Bauer.
Yes, Ms. Raines is alive.

31
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:02,234
If you wish her
to remain that way,

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,033
you will call me back
in ten minutes.

33
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,267
If you make any attempt

34
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,801
to find our location, she dies.

35
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,567
(dial tone)
Cheng.

39
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:23,234
Agent Bauer, you really do
need to get to a hospital.

40
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,701
But I understand
the circumstances.

41
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,701
At least this will
help you with the pain.

42
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,267
Thank you.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,901
Hey, Jack, so the
Marines, they're going
to secure the nukes

44
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,501
and prepare them
for transport.

45
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:44,601
They're calling
the shots now.
The military's taking over?

46
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,300
Yeah, according
to presidential order.

47
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,033
I guess DOD doesn't want
CTU in charge anymore.

48
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,734
So Buchanan, he wants you
to call him as soon as

49
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,834
the nukes are ready for
transport to a NEST facility.

50
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,601
Can you handle that for me?
Sure.

51
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,300
Jack?

52
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,734
What?

53
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,367
I just... I know you've
been through hell.

54
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:06,834
Not just today, but
the last couple of years, and...

55
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,133
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did today,

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,501
'cause it could have ended
a hell of a lot worse.

57
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,467
And it would have
if you weren't here.

58
00:03:13,534 --> 00:03:16,567
I appreciate that.

59
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,167
Excuse me.

60
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:21,300
Agent Doyle, Highway
Patrol's finished locking
down all the roads,

61
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,334
and they're awaiting
your instructions.

62
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:37,167
(groans)

63
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,901
(phone rings)

64
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

65
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:47,534
This is Bauer,
let me speak to Audrey.

66
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,701
You've already spoken to her.

67
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:51,100
I want to make sure
she's all right.

68
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,634
Her well-being is entirely
up to you, Mr. Bauer.

69
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,133
Everyone has given
up on you.

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,067
Everyone, except
for Ms. Raines.

71
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,734
Over the objections
of your government, her family,

72
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:03,000
her friends,

73
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:06,567
she came to Beijing,
just to find you.

74
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:08,934
Since you proved to be
a uncooperative prisoner,

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,334
we felt she would be an asset

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,934
we might be able
to exploit one day.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,367
And that day is here.

78
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:17,934
I will hand myself over to you.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,100
Tell me where.

80
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:25,033
A man who won't break
is of no use to us,

81
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,701
but the Russian suitcase
nukes you captured...

82
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,801
Why?

83
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,200
Your country has the technology
to build those weapons.

84
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:35,067
It's not the weapons themselves
we're interested in.

85
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:38,934
What we want is a component
from the triggering mechanism.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,968
It contains a prototype
algorithm...

87
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,567
old enough to be free of any
modern decryption safeguards.

88
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:47,167
With it,

89
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:52,467
we'll have access to virtually
all Russian defense technology.

90
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:55,601
It's a simple exchange.

91
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,767
You give me the component,
I give you Audrey.

92
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,367
If you refuse, I kill her.

93
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,901
The Russians will know that we

94
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,534
supplied you with the algorithm.

95
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,100
You would be
starting World War III.

96
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:09,934
I suggest we leave that
to the diplomats to sort out.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,133
Even if I wanted to, the bombs
are under military control.

98
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,634
I couldn't get
anywhere near them.

99
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,234
You'll find a way.

100
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,434
If I'm going to agree to this,
I want to speak to Audrey now.

101
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,701
Very well.

102
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:32,300
Speak to him.

103
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Jack?

104
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:42,067
Audrey.
Are you all right?

105
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,033
Did they hurt you?

106
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,033
No.

107
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,033
Jack... I...

108
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,100
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,934
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,434
The only thing that's important
is that you're alive.

111
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:54,133
I know what
they're asking for.

112
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,834
I can handle it.

113
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,100
I promise you, I'm going
to get you out of there.

114
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,667
Just don't be frightened.

115
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,834
You have one hour
to call this number

116
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,000
when you're ready
to make the exchange.

117
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,133
An hour's not going
to give me enough time.

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,267
Cheng.

119
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:07,734
Cheng!

120
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:42,901
You know, you really should
work from Medical, sir.

121
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:45,133
Come on, at least they
can monitor you there.

122
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm fine, Tom.

123
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:50,934
I... I don't think
that you are, sir.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,033
And neither does Dr. Welton.

125
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,767
Putting myself under medical
supervision might give

126
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:57,067
the vice president
yet another pretext

127
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,901
to try and take a run at my job.

128
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:01,367
You don't need
to worry about that, sir.

129
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:05,701
What exactly do you have
on Vice President Daniels?

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
I have the truth, sir.

131
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,701
Now is the time that I need
to know what that is.

132
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,601
It is a tape recording

133
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,767
of Vice President Daniels

134
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,868
conspiring with Lisa Miller
to commit perjury

135
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:28,267
at your competency hearing.

136
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,033
I'd love to hear that
as soon as possible.

137
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,534
HAYES:
Mr. President, Tom.

138
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:34,868
I have good news.

139
00:07:34,934 --> 00:07:37,067
CTU has recovered

140
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:38,567
the two remaining
suitcase nukes.

141
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:40,167
When?

142
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:41,267
Just a few minutes ago.

143
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:42,968
I just got off
the phone with Bill.

144
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:44,767
He's waiting to brief you
as soon as you're ready.

145
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,000
What about Fayed?

146
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,367
He and his men were killed
during the assault.

147
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:50,467
Then it's over.

148
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:51,801
Well, it certainly

149
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,000
seems so, sir.

150
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:55,300
Congratulations.

151
00:07:55,367 --> 00:07:58,133
The American people should know.

152
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,834
And I want to tell them
that we're no longer at
risk of a nuclear attack.

153
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:02,734
I'll have the press corps
down here in 30 minutes.

154
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:03,934
No, no, Karen.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,434
We're going to do this
from upstairs,

156
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,601
in the press room.

157
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:07,934
Should we wait for clearance

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,467
from Secret Service?

159
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:11,367
No, Tom, there's no need
for any of us

160
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:12,868
to be hiding underground

161
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:14,334
for a minute longer.

162
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,100
Inform Secret Service that
we'll be leaving the Bunker

163
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,868
and returning
to the Oval Office.

164
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,234
HAYES:
Yes, sir.

165
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,734
Morris is coordinating with the
Marines Technical Escort Unit

166
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,000
to transfer the bombs

167
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,634
to a NEST facility.

168
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:32,033
Now that they've taken custody,

169
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,167
I'd like you all
to submit your briefings

170
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,267
to the respective
department heads.

171
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,767
(phone ringing)

172
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:42,200
I'd like to share my pride in
the work that you've all done.

173
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:45,167
We were hit hard.

174
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,267
But not one of you gave up.

175
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,434
You've done excellent
work today.

176
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:50,801
O'Brian.

177
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,300
Hey, it's me.

178
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,934
Jack. You did it.

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,667
Chloe, listen to me.
I need your help.

180
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,567
Well, can't it wait?

181
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,567
We're just transferring the
bombs, and doing cleanup.

182
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:00,634
No, it can't.

183
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,534
What is it?

184
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:05,801
Chloe, Audrey's still alive.

185
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:08,367
No, she's not.

186
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes, she is,
I just talked to her.

187
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:11,801
The Chinese faked
her car accident.

188
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:13,167
They've been holding
her a prisoner

189
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,868
since she was in Beijing
trying to find me.

190
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,767
Oh, my God.

191
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,033
We have to tell Mr. Buchanan.

192
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,434
He'll never go along with it.

193
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:23,234
Go along with what?

194
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,767
The Chinese want
to exchange Audrey

195
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,834
for an FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the nukes.

196
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:32,067
It'll give them
complete access to
Russian defense technology.

197
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:34,200
I want you to help me retrieve
one of those circuit boards.

198
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:37,234
Jack, we both know
that if we do this,

199
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,734
it will create an international
situation big time.

200
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:40,901
Chloe, I know.

201
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:43,133
I promise I will do
whatever I have to

202
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,501
to stop the Chinese from
getting that circuit board.

203
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,534
But right now I need you

204
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:48,367
to get me the schematics
for those bombs.

205
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:49,934
Those files aren't
on my system.

206
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:51,667
They were reclassified
when the DOD took possession

207
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,167
of the suitcase
nuke you disarmed.

208
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:55,601
Then you're going to have to
figure out a way to get them,

209
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:56,834
'cause without those schematics,

210
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,501
I won't know
what I'm looking for.

211
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,267
Yes, I understand, but I don't
know how I can do this.

212
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,400
Chloe, Audrey's life
is at stake. Think.

213
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,234
Wait.

214
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,234
Morris.

215
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,601
He had to file a report
with DOD

216
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,300
about the work he did
on the nukes.

217
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:14,934
It contained
a revised schematic.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,767
It might still be
on his hard drive.

219
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:17,868
Can you access it?

220
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,801
Only directly
from his terminal.

221
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:21,601
Chloe, please, do it.

222
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,400
Where do you want me to send it?

223
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,701
To the cell phone that
I'm calling you from.

224
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,734
Use a secure line-- Alpha-539.

225
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,634
Hold on.

226
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:44,601
It's here.

227
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,067
The file's coming up.

228
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm sending it
to your screen.

229
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:49,467
Stand by.

230
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:50,834
Copy that.

231
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,400
Come on.

232
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:58,701
Chloe, I don't
see anything.

233
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:01,667
It needs to load
before it sends.

234
00:11:01,734 --> 00:11:05,534
There's still
30% to go.

235
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:07,367
Damn it.
What?

236
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,267
Morris is coming back
to his station.
Hurry.

237
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:11,400
There's nothing
I can do.

238
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,133
I need to log
out now. He's here.

239
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,501
No, Chloe, wait.

240
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,801
Jack...

241
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,601
I got it.

242
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:41,950
(phone beeps)
Yes?

243
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,484
OPERATOR (on phone):
Mr. President,
the vice president is here.

244
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:49,683
Send him in.

245
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,984
Noah...

246
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,317
Please sit.

247
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:13,683
Listen, I, uh...

248
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,750
I want to begin by expressing

249
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,717
my gratitude to you.

250
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:19,984
For a lesson well learned.

251
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,984
I'm not sure what
you mean by that,

252
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,084
Mr. President.
I still believe
attacking Abu Fayed's

253
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:28,917
country with a nuclear
weapon would have been

254
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:31,084
a serious mistake, Noah; I'm not
going lie to you about that.

255
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,451
But...

256
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:36,217
if you hadn't put that option
on the table in the first place,

257
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,618
I never would've gone
as far as I did.

258
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:41,650
And the bombs might
still be out there.

259
00:12:41,717 --> 00:12:43,217
That being said...

260
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,917
I think we would both agree

261
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:47,584
that our relationship
has always been a marriage

262
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,884
of convenience.

263
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,284
A way to strengthen the ticket,
rather than a case

264
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:55,084
of us actually seeing eye to eye
on pretty much anything.

265
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,850
And now that
it's over, this crisis,

266
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,017
it's become clear to me,
Noah, that I just

267
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,518
don't think it's possible for us
to work together anymore.

268
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:10,117
Excuse me?

269
00:13:10,184 --> 00:13:12,151
I'm asking for your resignation.

270
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:17,518
How dare you.

271
00:13:17,584 --> 00:13:19,384
You don't have the right
to ask for my

272
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,451
resignation.
This isn't about

273
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:24,284
what the Constitution
says, Noah.

274
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,384
It's about what's best
for this country

275
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:27,717
in a time of crisis.

276
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:29,451
How in the world do
you figure that?

277
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,184
I can't lead effectively
with you undermining me

278
00:13:32,251 --> 00:13:34,384
at every single opportunity
that you may get.

279
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:37,884
Now let's be honest
with each other.

280
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,717
That's exactly what you would
do if you stayed in place.

281
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,750
Mr. President...

282
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,017
I refuse.

283
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:52,518
Good night.

284
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,217
You don't want
to walk out that door.

285
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,251
Not like this.

286
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:00,417
Otherwise I may
have to make this

287
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:03,017
extremely unpleasant for you.

288
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,017
Now what are you talking about?

289
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:07,917
I'm talking about the
recording that Tom Lennox

290
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:10,384
<i>has in his possession.
That's what I'm talking about.</i>

291
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,017
Conspiracy to
commit perjury

292
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:16,417
is a serious offense.

293
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:18,518
Now I have to assume
you'd rather resign,

294
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:21,351
than spend the rest of
your life living with that

295
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,351
kind of humiliation.

296
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,050
So is resorting to blackmail

297
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:29,117
your idea
of effective leadership?

298
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,783
If there is anything I've
learned anything from you,

299
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,917
Noah, it would be
that sometimes it's

300
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:35,618
necessary to apply
a little brute force.

301
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,618
I don't need your
resignation immediately.

302
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:41,783
Let's give the country
a chance to take a breath

303
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,451
after what happened today.

304
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:45,151
Some time in
the next week

305
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,417
will be just fine,
Mr. Vice President.

306
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,151
NEST wants a flight path
cleared to Edwards

307
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:08,817
for 20 miles
in each direction.

308
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:10,484
Could you get back
to me with confirmation?

309
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,984
Thank you.

310
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,284
ETA on the helicopter

311
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:15,251
that will transport
the bombs is 15 minutes.

312
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:16,917
You should distribute protocols
to the NEST team.

313
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,251
I'm on that.
(keyboard clacking)

314
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,351
(computer beeps)

315
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,584
That's odd.
What?

316
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,817
I think someone's hacked
into my system.

317
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,117
Are you sure?

318
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,351
Yes, I'm sure.

319
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,484
Ever since
what happened to Nadia,

320
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:31,750
I installed a logging
program to track

321
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:33,518
any unauthorized access
to my hard drive.

322
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:34,817
You did?

323
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:37,618
It's telling me
that someone accessed

324
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:40,351
my files ten minutes ago...

325
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,351
and downloaded
the updated schematics

326
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:44,384
to those suitcase nukes.

327
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:47,850
I'm calling security.
Wait!

328
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,817
Don't call security.

329
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:51,117
(hangs up receiver)

330
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:55,417
I'm the one who hacked
into your system.

331
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:59,384
Why would you do that?

332
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:02,417
I'll explain it to you
in a little while.

333
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,317
Explain it to me now.

334
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:23,683
I did it for Jack.

335
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,284
Audrey Raines is still alive.

336
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,817
The Chinese are
holding her hostage.

337
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:28,683
What?

338
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,518
They're going to kill
her unless Jack delivers

339
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:33,184
an FB-sub-circuit board from
one of the bombs to them.

340
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,317
You've been to all
the same briefings.

341
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,551
The Russians have been
trying to keep that technology

342
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:45,717
out of Chinese hands for years.
I know.

343
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:47,351
Well, what are
the Russians going to say

344
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:48,750
when they find out we just

345
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:51,017
gave it to them?
It's not going to get that far.

346
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:52,384
How in the world
do you know

347
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:54,217
it's not going
to get that far?

348
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:56,518
Because Jack gave me his word.

349
00:16:58,717 --> 00:16:59,917
I'm sorry, darling.

350
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:01,551
I can't leave it at that.

351
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,017
Yes, you can.

352
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,817
The bombs that
I reprogrammed for Fayed

353
00:17:06,884 --> 00:17:08,984
could have killed tens
of thousands of people.

354
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,217
But that didn't happen.

355
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:11,917
I know what it felt like
to think that I could've

356
00:17:11,984 --> 00:17:14,017
been responsible for each
and everyone of their deaths.

357
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:17,017
I can't be involved
with something

358
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:19,817
that could easily
end up starting a war.

359
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:21,351
It's not going to start a war

360
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,084
because it's not going
to get that far.

361
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:24,750
Besides, this has
nothing to do with you.

362
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:26,484
I did it.
Yes, it does.

363
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:28,351
Now that you've
told me, it does.

364
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:29,750
You have to tell Buchanan.

365
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,451
I can't.

366
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,284
Then you're forcing me to.

367
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:36,551
No.
I'm going to do it.

368
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:38,584
No! Morris!
I'm doing it.

369
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:49,717
I'll tell him.

370
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,984
Reinforcements aren't
necessary at this point.

371
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,050
The military
is guarding the bombs.

372
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:12,884
There's a CTU SWAT
team standing by.

373
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,584
They'll be en route soon.

374
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,484
All right, thank you.

375
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:20,950
What is it, Chloe?

376
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,484
Mr. Buchanan...

377
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:28,717
I'm sorry, there's something
that you need to know.

378
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,351
* *

379
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,817
You two, come with me.
Sir, this area's

380
00:19:05,884 --> 00:19:08,117
off-limits.
I'm Agent Bauer.
I was the man that was

381
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,551
responsible for securing
these nukes. I'm under

382
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,884
a presidential order to
remove the FB-circuit board
from one of these bombs,

383
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,783
have it transferred back to
CTU for immediate analysis.

384
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,950
We don't have much time.
This building has been
compromised. Now open

385
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:19,551
the gate.
Sir, no one is allowed

386
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,984
in here.
Are you countermanding

387
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,117
a presidential order?
How dare you, Sergeant?!

388
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:25,518
Now you're wasting my time.
What's your name?

389
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,618
What's your name?!

390
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:28,717
I want your name, too.

391
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:29,917
Now!
That's not necessary.

392
00:19:29,984 --> 00:19:31,917
Open the gate.
Open the gate!

393
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:39,750
I want both of you
to stand guard

394
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:42,117
while I remove
the circuit board. Come on!

395
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,251
One, two, three...

396
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,117
DOYLE:
Stand down, Jack!

397
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:24,251
I can't do that.

398
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:25,451
I won't say it again!

399
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:27,317
Drop it.
Agent Doyle, I am
following orders

400
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,117
that exceed your
security clearance!
He's a rogue agent.

401
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,950
Take him out!
I will shoot!
Put your weapon

402
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:32,151
down or I will
shoot you!
Take him!

403
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:34,151
Now!
(blow lands)

404
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:37,584
Secure him, he's under arrest.

405
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:05,650
Doyle, please.
Just listen to me.

406
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:07,383
DOYLE (over phone):
Bill, we've got Jack.
What did he say?

407
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,984
Not much. I had
to subdue him.

408
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,084
Let me talk to him.

409
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:12,817
Hold on.

410
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:14,283
Buchanan wants to talk to you.

411
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,817
Bill...

412
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:18,317
Jack, Chloe just told me
about Audrey and the Chinese.

413
00:21:18,383 --> 00:21:20,751
I can't let you give
them the component.

414
00:21:20,817 --> 00:21:22,817
I'm not going to.

415
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,851
I only need to have it long
enough for them to let her go.

416
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,051
I was never going to let

417
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,450
the Chinese keep it,
Bill, I swear to you.

418
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:30,350
Whatever you have planned,
Jack, I can't let you do it.

419
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,851
Bill, please...

420
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,151
Right now we're the only

421
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:36,250
chance she's got.
I understand what Audrey

422
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,917
means to you. I promise
I will do everything

423
00:21:38,984 --> 00:21:41,250
in my power to get her back.
You didn't even
know she was alive.

424
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:43,751
Cheng is going to make it

425
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:46,350
impossible for us
to ever find her again.

426
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:47,584
We are her only hope

427
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:48,884
and you know it.

428
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:50,517
I don't know what
to tell you, Jack,

429
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,317
except let Doyle
bring you back here

430
00:21:52,383 --> 00:21:54,017
and we'll work out a game plan.

431
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,617
Will you let me make
one more call?

432
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:03,283
I'm asking you
as a friend.

433
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,383
Who do you want
to talk to?

434
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:10,817
President Wayne Palmer.

435
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:13,383
I'll see if I can reach him.

436
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,383
Let me talk to Doyle.

437
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,051
Yeah.

438
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:20,250
He wants
to talk to you.

439
00:22:20,317 --> 00:22:22,350
Doyle.

440
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:25,151
Keep Jack in custody while I
try to contact the president.

441
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,951
I'll route the call
through your cell.

442
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:29,151
Yes, sir. I understand.

443
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:30,383
Get him up.

444
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,417
(Bauer panting)

445
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:35,751
WOMAN (on TV):
White House sources
have confirmed

446
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:37,884
that terrorist leader
Abu Fayed is dead.

447
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:39,884
The president has reportedly
recovered from injuries

448
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,984
sustained from
the failed attempt on his life,

449
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:44,350
and he is expected
to make a statement shortly

450
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:45,851
regarding unconfirmed rumors...

451
00:22:45,917 --> 00:22:47,484
(beeps)
Yes?

452
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,984
MAN:
Mr. President, Bill Buchanan
has Jack Bauer on the line.

453
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,151
Put him through, please.

454
00:22:51,218 --> 00:22:52,317
(beeps)

455
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,550
Go ahead.

456
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:55,550
WOMAN:
Please hold for the President.

457
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:57,084
It's the president.

458
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:58,984
Excuse me.

459
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:01,218
Mr. President.

460
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:02,417
Yes, Jack.

461
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:03,984
Congratulations.
Is everything still all right?

462
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,584
Yes, sir. The bombs are secure.

463
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,184
But I'm calling
because I want you

464
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,550
to authorize a
field operation.

465
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:11,717
For what purpose?

466
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:13,017
To save
Audrey Raines.
What?

467
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,417
Mr. President,
she's still alive.

468
00:23:14,484 --> 00:23:17,051
The Chinese have been holding
her for the past few months.

469
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:19,084
Now they're using her
as a bargaining chip.

470
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:20,951
In exchange for what?

471
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:23,584
For an FB-sub-circuit board
from one of the nukes.

472
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,784
They say they'll release Audrey
unharmed if I bring it to them.

473
00:23:26,851 --> 00:23:29,450
It's my understanding, Jack,

474
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,851
that component holds the key
to Russian defense codes.

475
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:33,517
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.

476
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:35,751
I'm sympathetic, I am,
and I promise you

477
00:23:35,817 --> 00:23:38,383
that I will make available
to you the full resources

478
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,218
of this country
to get Audrey back,

479
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,218
but I hope you're not
expecting me to authorize

480
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:44,051
this exchange.
Not exactly.

481
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:45,151
Then what exactly?

482
00:23:45,218 --> 00:23:47,317
Mr. President,
I need the Chinese to believe

483
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:49,550
that I am willing to go through
with this exchange.

484
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:51,350
I need to have
that component on me.

485
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:52,917
They're going
to need to see it.

486
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:54,617
As soon as I know
that Audrey is free,

487
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:55,784
I will destroy it.

488
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,951
And how can you
guarantee that?

489
00:23:57,017 --> 00:23:59,884
I'm asking you to trust me,

490
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:01,751
Mr. President.

491
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:05,383
I give you my word that
that component will not end up

492
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,817
in Chinese hands.

493
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,784
But if it does, the Russians,
despite our peace accord,

494
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:11,417
may take action against us
for allowing it to happen.

495
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,084
Now, under most circumstances,
yes, your word would be

496
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:17,017
sufficient, but in this case,
Jack, I need to know details.

497
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,118
If I have to,

498
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:21,717
I will destroy
that circuit board

499
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:24,017
with a concealed
charge of C-4.

500
00:24:24,084 --> 00:24:27,017
An explosion of C-4
would take out anything

501
00:24:27,084 --> 00:24:29,751
within 30 feet of it.

502
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:34,283
You're going
to sacrifice yourself?

503
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,550
Yes, sir, if I have to.

504
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:38,151
Jack...

505
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:40,283
Mr. President, please.

506
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,450
Please, I am begging you.

507
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:44,250
Audrey Raines was willing

508
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,417
to give up her life
to save mine.

509
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,417
I cannot and will not do
anything less for her.

510
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:52,617
You're asking me to sign off
on a probable suicide mission.

511
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:53,984
With all due respect,

512
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:55,250
Mr. President, 16 hours ago,

513
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:57,650
your people were willing
to hand me over for dead,

514
00:24:57,717 --> 00:25:00,017
and I did not hesitate.

515
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:05,550
Mr. President, you owe me.

516
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:12,784
And you're sure
this is the only way?

517
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:14,317
Yes.

518
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,784
All right, then.

519
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,784
I will not fail you,
Mr. President.

520
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,984
I'll tell Bill to give you
whatever you need.

521
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:30,517
Now I'm going
to need confirmation

522
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:31,851
that circuit board
has been destroyed

523
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,350
after Audrey has been released.

524
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:35,350
I'll have CTU embed
a tracking device in the board.

525
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:36,684
You'll have your confirmation.

526
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,517
Good luck, Jack.

527
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:40,784
Thank you, Mr. President.

528
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,751
Let me speak with Bill Buchanan.

529
00:25:57,184 --> 00:25:59,617
Yes, sir. I understand.

530
00:26:01,517 --> 00:26:03,617
Get over here.

531
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:13,651
What did he say?

532
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:15,818
Buchanan said the president
signed off on this,

533
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:20,351
and to give you
whatever help you need.

534
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:21,850
I'm going to need someone
to help me

535
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:23,517
with Audrey's extraction
during the exchange.

536
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:24,983
I want that to be you.

537
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,684
Fine.

538
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,584
Where are you going to be?

539
00:26:29,651 --> 00:26:31,250
The name of the Chinese agent

540
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:35,084
that's holding Audrey
is Cheng Zhi.

541
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,150
He was responsible for
my interrogation and torture

542
00:26:37,217 --> 00:26:39,150
for almost two years
in that Chinese prison.

543
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:40,818
As soon as I get
the signal from you

544
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,983
that Audrey is safe, two things
are going to happen.

545
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,384
I'm going to destroy
that circuit board,

546
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:48,718
and Cheng Zhi isn't going
to make it out of here alive.

547
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:50,983
So, in answer
to your question,

548
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,284
where am
I going to be?

549
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:55,818
Wherever I have to.

550
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,351
Let's go.

551
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:11,484
Are you going
to tell me what happened?

552
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:15,584
The president agreed
to Jack's plan.

553
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:18,751
The president's going
to allow Jack to hand over

554
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:20,983
a defense algorithm
to the Chinese?

555
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,317
No. Of course not.

556
00:27:23,384 --> 00:27:24,751
Jack will destroy the component

557
00:27:24,818 --> 00:27:26,084
as soon as he knows
Audrey's safe.

558
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,250
The Chinese will
never get it.

559
00:27:28,317 --> 00:27:29,751
And how is he going
to manage that?

560
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:32,850
I don't know.
I guess President Palmer

561
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,850
trusts him.

562
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:37,517
Telling Buchanan
was the right thing to do.

563
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,017
You know it was.

564
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:40,417
It doesn't matter.

565
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:41,784
You should have trusted me.

566
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,684
Trusted you?

567
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:45,417
You're the one
that broke into my system.

568
00:27:45,484 --> 00:27:47,451
That's because
I didn't think you'd back me up.

569
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:48,950
Obviously, I was right.

570
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:51,417
So you're going to hold this
over my head now, are you?

571
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:54,617
Yeah. For a long time.

572
00:27:54,684 --> 00:27:56,883
For how long?
Could you give me an estimate?

573
00:27:59,983 --> 00:28:01,718
I'll get back to you.

574
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:10,050
Nadia, Doyle's on line three.

575
00:28:10,117 --> 00:28:13,084
They're going to lock you
on the tracker frequency.

576
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:16,217
This is Nadia.

577
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:17,983
It's me.
The tracker's on line.

578
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,818
The frequency marker

579
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:21,150
is Alpha-1793.

580
00:28:25,184 --> 00:28:26,384
Signal's good.
You're on the grid.

581
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:28,551
Copy. Jack and I are
getting ready to move out.

582
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:31,883
(phone rings)

583
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,150
Yes?

584
00:28:33,217 --> 00:28:35,584
I have the circuit board.
Where am I going?

585
00:28:35,651 --> 00:28:37,883
Get on the 180 and head north.

586
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,417
Get off the first exit
after mile marker 49.

587
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:44,050
I will give you
further instructions
when you've exited.

588
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:45,150
I got it.

589
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:46,784
You have
a half an hour.

590
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,850
I don't think I
need to remind you

591
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:48,917
what would happen
if you are late.

592
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:50,818
I understand.

593
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,784
CTU has the signal.

594
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,584
They're monitoring
the device.

595
00:28:57,651 --> 00:29:00,517
I'm set. Let's go.

596
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:02,684
Jack, you're taking
a hell of a risk.

597
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:04,784
If this goes sour,
it could stir a firestorm.

598
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,317
And for what?

599
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:08,384
If you were in my shoes,
you wouldn't do the same thing?

600
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:10,284
I don't mix relationships
with my job.

601
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:13,117
Whatever you had with this
woman, I hope it's worth it.

602
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,718
This isn't about what
I had with a woman.

603
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:17,250
Her name is
Audrey Raines.

604
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:19,850
She served this country
with honor. We owe her.

605
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:21,551
So get in the truck.

606
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,184
(knocking on door)

607
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,883
Come in.

608
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:43,651
You wanted to see me?

609
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,184
Close the door.

610
00:29:58,983 --> 00:30:03,150
The president has just
asked me to resign.

611
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:05,017
What?

612
00:30:05,084 --> 00:30:08,351
And I'm going to comply
with his request.

613
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:12,184
I wanted to

614
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,684
tell you personally before you
found out from someone else.

615
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:17,384
I don't understand.

616
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,384
Why are you going along
with this?

617
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,050
Why don't you just tell him
that you refuse?

618
00:30:21,117 --> 00:30:23,050
He has a tape
of our conversation.

619
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:25,551
The one where we

620
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,651
conspire to commit perjury,

621
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:29,250
and he's threatening to use it
against me unless

622
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:31,784
I step down.

623
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,017
Oh, my God.

624
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:34,084
Tom Lennox

625
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,584
recorded it.

626
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:41,551
Bottom line is, I'm not
being given a choice here.

627
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:45,883
This is all my fault.

628
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,384
If I hadn't asked
you to lie about
Karen Hayes,

629
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,751
none of this
would be happening.

630
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:52,417
You were just trying
to protect me.

631
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,217
I could have turned you down,
but I didn't.

632
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:56,617
Don't blame yourself.

633
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,983
I'm so sorry.

634
00:31:05,317 --> 00:31:06,950
I don't know what to say.

635
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:14,983
Aw, hell,
at least we'll have a lot more

636
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,451
time to
spend together.

637
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:27,084
The president said
to take a week,

638
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:33,818
but I want this letter
of resignation in his hands

639
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:36,983
by the time he finishes
his press conference.

640
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:45,818
I am through being
the loyal opposition.

641
00:31:55,484 --> 00:31:58,517
Please, sit.

642
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,017
First, I want to say

643
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,818
that I'm grateful to report

644
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:05,584
that Abu Fayed, the man
responsible for these attacks,

645
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:07,484
has been killed,

646
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:11,017
and that all nuclear devices
have been recovered.

647
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:13,651
I want to take the time
to acknowledge the brave men

648
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:16,883
and women in our various
law enforcement agencies,

649
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,217
and let us not forget
our armed services.

650
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:23,117
All these people
have worked so hard

651
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:25,250
to bring this crisis to an end.

652
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:29,117
Their dedication, their
perseverance is without equal.

653
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,317
Despite the brutality
of these attacks,

654
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,983
we did not allow the violence
born of extremism

655
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,551
<i>to push us to extremes.</i>

656
00:32:35,617 --> 00:32:37,818
And, as Americans, we can

657
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:41,950
and should take pride
and comfort in that fact.

658
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:46,551
Let me conclude
by asking for your prayers

659
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:51,484
tonight for all those
who grieve this day.

660
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,983
For all those whose lives
have been shattered.

661
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,917
Let us reach out and begin
the process of rebuilding.

662
00:32:57,983 --> 00:32:59,150
Let us reach out

663
00:32:59,217 --> 00:33:02,417
and begin the process
of national healing.

664
00:33:02,484 --> 00:33:03,584
Thank you.

665
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:06,050
I'll take some
of your questions now.

666
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,050
Yes. Ian.

667
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,351
Mr. President, how certain

668
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:10,917
are you that the crisis
is, in fact, over, and that

669
00:33:10,983 --> 00:33:13,384
there are no more of these
weapons on American soil?

670
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,184
Well, based on the intelligence
that I've seen,

671
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,217
I can say with full confidence,
Ian, that the worst has passed,

672
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:20,017
and that the individuals
responsible

673
00:33:20,084 --> 00:33:21,883
for these attacks
have been apprehended,

674
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,250
or else killed.

675
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:24,950
Yes, Andrea.

676
00:33:25,017 --> 00:33:26,017
Robin, sir.

677
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:27,017
Robin, yes. Robin.

678
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:29,784
I'm sorry, it's been a,

679
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,017
it's been a very long
day. Please, go ahead.

680
00:33:32,084 --> 00:33:33,883
Mr. President,
there are several thousand

681
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,484
Muslim Americans
still being held

682
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:38,150
in detention facilities
across the country.

683
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:39,284
What's going to happen

684
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,517
to these people?

685
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:42,017
I've already directed
Homeland Security

686
00:33:42,084 --> 00:33:44,818
to begin dismantling
these detention facilities.

687
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:46,751
Uh... all detainees
are to be released

688
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,551
once the immediate crisis

689
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:50,617
is passed.

690
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,751
<i>Excuse me. Um, now
that the crisis</i>

691
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:58,818
has passed, we will be, um...
we will be reviewing

692
00:33:58,883 --> 00:33:59,950
the situation
regarding individuals

693
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:01,384
that we have in custody.

694
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:03,651
I'm sorry.

695
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:05,684
I'm, not, uh, I'm
not being very clear.

696
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:08,651
Uh, let me say again
regarding your question,

697
00:34:08,718 --> 00:34:10,417
Andrea, that... Robin.

698
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,117
I'm sorry. Robin.

699
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,484
Let me say again regarding...

700
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:18,917
regarding your question
that the, uh...

701
00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:23,250
the detention facilities
that, that, that we will, uh...

702
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:25,917
uh... that, uh...

703
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,317
We, we're going t... Ugh!

704
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:31,250
Oh, my God.

705
00:34:31,317 --> 00:34:34,017
Get Medical right away!

706
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:35,950
LOWRY:
Code 4. Repeat, Code 4.

707
00:34:36,017 --> 00:34:38,284
We need an emergency medical
team to the press room.

708
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:39,684
Get these people out of here.

709
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:40,784
HOLLISTER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

710
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,150
we need to clear this room.

711
00:35:07,617 --> 00:35:09,351
All signs indicate the president

712
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:10,718
has suffered
a cerebral hemorrhage

713
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:14,484
brought on by injuries he
sustained earlier in the day.

714
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:16,217
Meaning he never should have
been brought out of the coma.

715
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:19,150
However detrimental
that decision was

716
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,150
to his health,
I'm confident

717
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:22,684
that in light of
his actions today,

718
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:24,150
he would continue
to support it.

719
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:27,684
I'm glad you're so confident,
Karen, since it was

720
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,184
your reckless action
that resulted in his stroke.

721
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,017
DR. WELTON:
Sir, it's unclear
if the stroke

722
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:33,484
was inevitable,
but in any event,

723
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,684
I'll take full
responsibility.

724
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:35,883
Excuse me.

725
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,850
Now is not the time
for recriminations,

726
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,084
self-imposed or otherwise.

727
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,217
Doctor, when will we know
the extent of the damage

728
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:43,850
and the prospects
for recovery?

729
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:46,050
After the MRI.

730
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:47,584
The president is being
prepped for transport

731
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:49,017
to Bethesda
as we speak.

732
00:35:49,084 --> 00:35:50,117
Based on my
impressions,

733
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:52,517
the damage was severe.

734
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:53,883
I don't think we can

735
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,983
expect the president to regain
consciousness anytime soon.

736
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,718
So it is incontestable
Wayne Palmer won't

737
00:35:59,784 --> 00:36:01,983
be able to continue his
duties as commander-in-chief.

738
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,883
There's no denying that this is
a great tragedy for the nation

739
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,850
and... for those of us who
know the president personally.

740
00:36:18,184 --> 00:36:19,651
Just... take care of him,
Doctor.

741
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:22,150
Of course.

742
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:23,250
Excuse me.

743
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:31,751
Notify the Senate and the House
of the transfer of power

744
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:34,117
and have the sec def and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs

745
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:35,417
authorize me under
the 25th Amendment.

746
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,883
Yes, sir.

747
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,651
Tom...

748
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:42,850
have the press secretary
issue a statement.

749
00:36:42,917 --> 00:36:47,517
President Palmer's been...
incapacitated.

750
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:49,117
No need for alarm.

751
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:51,517
Executive authority's
been transferred to me.

752
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,351
Our...
hopes and prayers are with him.

753
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:55,850
All right, sir.

754
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,850
And I'll also need you

755
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:01,184
available to review everything
on the president's agenda.

756
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,384
All right, sir.

757
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:04,184
Actually, there's something
on the agenda

758
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,317
I think you'll want
immediate clarification on.

759
00:37:06,384 --> 00:37:08,317
What's that?

760
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:10,517
Wayne Palmer just
issued a finding

761
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:13,384
allowing Jack Bauer to hand
classified Russian technology

762
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:15,217
over to the Chinese
in exchange

763
00:37:15,284 --> 00:37:18,850
for the return of a
covertly held hostage.

764
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,784
Can you explain this?

765
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,084
Yes. That was

766
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,050
a personal request from Jack
Bauer to the president.

767
00:37:26,117 --> 00:37:27,384
They have a
longstanding
relationship

768
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:29,818
and as Jack Bauer was
largely responsible

769
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:31,150
for recovering
the suitcase nukes today,

770
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:34,150
the president wanted to honor
his service to this country.

771
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,751
Karen, I asked you
to explain it, not excuse it.

772
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,484
Understood.

773
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,150
Bauer has guaranteed
that the technology

774
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,484
will not fall into the hands
of the Chinese.

775
00:37:45,551 --> 00:37:48,150
It will only be used
to secure the hostage.

776
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:50,684
Incidentally, sir,
the hostage in question

777
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:54,050
is Audrey Raines,
daughter of James Heller.

778
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:56,284
Even Jack Bauer can't
guarantee that outcome.

779
00:37:56,351 --> 00:37:58,517
Now, I am

780
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:03,517
happy to honor Agent Bauer's
service to this country,

781
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:06,050
but not at the risk of giving

782
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,517
classified technology
to the Chinese and...

783
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:11,684
potentially
damaging our
relationship

784
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:12,718
with Russia in the process.

785
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:13,883
You tell CTU

786
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,517
to stop Bauer-- immediately.

787
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,517
Sir.

788
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:18,184
The president expressly...

789
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,784
That's all for
now, Karen.

790
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,184
You, too, Tom.

791
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,384
Unbelievable.

792
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,484
Less than a minute
behind his desk

793
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,818
and he's already disregarding
the president's wishes.

794
00:38:44,883 --> 00:38:47,351
Nevertheless, we both
share Daniel's unease

795
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:48,617
in handing
military secrets

796
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:49,651
over to the Chinese.

797
00:38:49,718 --> 00:38:52,217
I know, Tom, but that
is not the point.

798
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:53,351
No, here's the point.

799
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,217
Daniels is now
the acting president,

800
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:57,284
whether we like it or not.

801
00:38:57,351 --> 00:38:59,751
I'm off to the hospital.

802
00:38:59,818 --> 00:39:01,217
I'll see you there.

803
00:39:06,651 --> 00:39:09,184
(phone ringing)

804
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,417
Buchanan.

805
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,050
Hi, it's me.

806
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,150
How's president Palmer?

807
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,517
Not good.

808
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:17,517
The doctor says that he
has a cerebral hemorrhage

809
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,517
They don't know the
extent of the damage,

810
00:39:19,584 --> 00:39:22,217
but obviously he's
not able to serve.

811
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:24,917
Daniels is going
to assume the office,

812
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:26,517
and the first wave of his hand,

813
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:28,484
he wants to stop
Jack's operation.

814
00:39:28,551 --> 00:39:30,751
Jack has to return to CTU

815
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:32,217
as soon as possible
with the component.

816
00:39:32,284 --> 00:39:34,217
Does the vice president
understand the circumstances

817
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:35,917
under which Wayne Palmer
agreed to this?

818
00:39:35,983 --> 00:39:38,217
No. He's not that
kind of a man.

819
00:39:38,284 --> 00:39:39,651
He doesn't operate
in shades of gray.

820
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:41,917
Does he understand Jack's not
gonna give up without a fight?

821
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:44,417
You just have to get
Jack back to CTU

822
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:46,317
as soon as
possible, okay?

823
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,684
Okay, I'll take care of it.

824
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,651
Listen up.

825
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:56,484
The White House has
ordered us to shut down

826
00:39:56,551 --> 00:39:58,850
Jack's operation. How far away
are support teams?

827
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,050
Six miles.

828
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:01,983
Have them standing by,
ready to move in,

829
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,150
Contact CHP. Have them

830
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:05,850
set up roadblocks.

831
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:07,651
Chloe, I want you
to stand down

832
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:08,718
on this operation.
Why?

833
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:09,718
You've shown me

834
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:10,751
I can't trust you.

835
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:13,950
Morris, you cover comm.

836
00:40:14,017 --> 00:40:15,217
Jack's not gonna
go along with this.

837
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:16,417
I know.

838
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:24,351
(phone rings)

839
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,384
Doyle.

840
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:26,417
Mike, it's Bill.

841
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:28,084
Can Jack hear you?
Say yes or no.

842
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,217
Yes.

843
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:30,284
There's been
a change in profile.

844
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:32,184
Noah Daniels is
acting President.

845
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:35,084
He wants the operation shut
down and Jack brought back

846
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,917
to CTU immediately.
Understood.

847
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:38,551
What's your
current location?

848
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:41,651
We're about two miles east
of the 180 interchange.

849
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:43,317
Okay, I need you to exit

850
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:46,384
at the 70, make
the first left.

851
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,883
We'll have roadblocks set up
with a backup team ready

852
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,883
to take Jack into custody
and recover the component.

853
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,084
All right, we'll do that.

854
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,950
You need to disarm Jack
as soon as quickly

855
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:55,684
and quietly as possible
before he finds out.

856
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,250
No problem.

857
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:00,284
(sighs)

858
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:01,950
CTU's got a report
from Cal Trans.

859
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:04,250
The 180's closed
due to high winds.

860
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:06,417
They're concerned about
possible fallout.

861
00:41:06,484 --> 00:41:09,551
They want us to
take 70 instead.

862
00:41:09,617 --> 00:41:10,983
Fine.

863
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,351
Don't you move.

864
00:41:14,651 --> 00:41:16,883
Jack, what's the problem?

865
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,117
Earlier today,

866
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:21,284
I shot my old partner,
a friend of mine,

867
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:24,184
because he tried to stop me
from doing what I have to do.

868
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,050
Don't think for a second
I won't do that to you.

869
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:30,050
Slowly I want you

870
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,351
to pull over.

871
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,883
Now.

872
00:42:08,983 --> 00:42:10,417
Take the keys
out of the ignition.

873
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:12,883
Put them on the center
console. And your phone.

874
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,651
Jack, you don't want
to do this.

875
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,718
Slowly get out
of the truck.

876
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:26,751
Back up towards
the fence.

877
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:27,751
Jack, listen to me.

878
00:42:27,818 --> 00:42:29,284
Daniels is the acting president.

879
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:30,784
He's the one who
called this off.

880
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:32,684
Shut up and grab the fence!

881
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,184
This is gonna end badly, Jack.

882
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,150
You can't go against
the White House!

883
00:42:37,484 --> 00:42:38,484
Jack!

884
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,751
Jack!

885
00:42:43,818 --> 00:42:46,718
