<i>Previously on</i> 24...

3
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,217
<i>America has been victimized again.</i>

4
00:00:16,488 --> 00:00:18,745
<i>Last night terrorist attack
in San Antonio</i>

5
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,908
<i>was not the latest
in this series of bombings</i>

6
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:23,544
<i>that began 11 weeks ago
in 10 different cities.</i>

7
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,484
Retrieve the package.

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,974
<i>Call me when you have it.</i>

9
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:44,812
- What happened?
- You shouldn't have come here, Scott.

10
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:46,492
I don't wanna hurt you...

11
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,947
But I will
unless you do exactly what I say.

12
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:51,582
I'm Mr Al-Rezani's attorney.

13
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,205
There's no terrorist here.

14
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:55,556
Yes, this is Sandra Palmer.

15
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:56,941
I'd like to speak with my brother.

16
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,972
<i>The FBI was just here</i>

17
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:01,986
and they wanted access
to the IAA personel records.

18
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,025
You know I have to do

19
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,816
<i>whatever I can to stop this attacks.</i>

20
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:07,511
All that includes giving
the law inforcement the autority

21
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:09,304
to follow up
whatever single lead they get.

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,773
I can't find the files.

23
00:01:10,806 --> 00:01:12,062
They've been erased.

24
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,994
Don't bother trying to recall them.
I used the shredding program.

25
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,501
Sandra, what're you doing?

26
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,814
You're under arrest.

27
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,328
Take Mr Al-Rezani in custody.

28
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:21,343
Wait a minute,
he has nothing to do with this.

29
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:24,460
Don't move. Where is Assad?

30
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:26,496
Put down your weapon.

31
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:28,249
I came here alone.

32
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:29,699
Fayed has set you up.

33
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,321
He provided CTU
with the coordinates to this house.

34
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:34,616
Move! Move!

35
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,997
I've gotten most of my people
and the governments that support us

36
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,708
to agree to a cease fire with the West.

37
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:43,909
And that's Fayed wants to sabotage?
- Yes.

38
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,582
But finding Fayed is the key.

39
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:47,043
These are Fayed's men.

40
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,754
They're going in the subway.

41
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:50,074
I can't let 'em get on the train.

42
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:51,919
Only the bomber is getting on the train.

43
00:01:52,757 --> 00:01:54,155
The other man is the handler.

44
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:56,287
You follow the handler.
I'm going after the bomber.

45
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,722
It's a bomb!

46
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:22,696
- We're heading in your direction.
- I copy that. I'll find you.

47
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:25,497
Just stay with the handler.
He's our only connection to Fayed.

48
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:31,723
<i>The following takes place
between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m.</i>(del vo)

49
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,291
You still have Fayed's man in sight?

50
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,823
He's in a grey Sedan,
about 6 cars ahead.

51
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:00,955
- Yes.
<i>- Are you on schedulled?</i>

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,217
Yeah, there was some traffic
around Union Station.

53
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,634
- <i>But I'm on the road now.</i>
- There has been a change.

54
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:09,009
I need you to make that stop in Newhall
before you come back here.

55
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,618
The Americans
will be feeling helpless now.

56
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:13,495
I'm making the call.

57
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:17,578
<i>The casualty estimates in St Louis
is resumed to 112.</i>

58
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,460
The mall attack in Baltimore
is even worse.

59
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:22,037
Over 200 dead.

60
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:24,585
Many of them children.

61
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:26,717
My God.

62
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,184
What about the bomb in Los Angeles?

63
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:31,781
We confirmed that Jack Bauer

64
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,416
averted the attack at the Union Station.

65
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:35,473
Passive surveillance from Metro Transit

66
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:37,579
has also confirmed
he's working with Assad.

67
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:39,417
Have you been able
to contact him?

68
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:41,135
No, sir.
Jack's been dark since he called

69
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,132
to warn us about Fayed.
We didn't listen.

70
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:45,247
<i>I</i> didn't listen.

71
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,938
We're receiving a call from Fayed.
He demands to speak with the President.

72
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:54,862
Mr President, we're receivnig a call
on a scrambled channel from Fayed, sir.

73
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:56,810
He's demanding to speak with you.

74
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:58,491
Put him on.

75
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,249
This is President Palmer.

76
00:04:05,264 --> 00:04:06,881
Mr President,

77
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,998
we've proven we can strike at you
anytime anywhere.

78
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:13,093
But I'm prepared to offer you
a cease-fire.

79
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:16,635
- If you meet my demands.
- Your demands?

80
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,246
Fayed we match your demands before,
remember?

81
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:23,203
When you deceived us about Assad
being the one behind these attacks.

82
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:26,224
And now you expect me to just accept
your assurances of a cease-fire.

83
00:04:26,245 --> 00:04:29,203
I expect you'll take any action that
holds a promise of avoiding the loss

84
00:04:29,232 --> 00:04:30,611
of more american lives.

85
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:33,627
What do you want?

86
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:38,037
You're holding 110
so called enemy combattants

87
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:40,573
at your Palmdale military facility.

88
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,858
In violation of the international law.

89
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:46,224
You must have all these <i>freedom</i> fighters

90
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:48,349
on a non-military aircraft

91
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:50,374
in the air by the end of the hour.

92
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,575
The pilot will be informed
of the destination

93
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,921
once the plane is outside
your country's airspace.

94
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,350
Even if I agree to this

95
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:59,920
- there is not enough time for us to--
<i>- You'll find a way.</i>

96
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,838
Because if you don't release
the prisonners by the deadline,

97
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:05,991
<i>the consequences will be immediate
and devastating.</i>

98
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,339
<i>I will only make this offer once,
Mr President.</i>

99
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,619
For your country's sake...

100
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:14,351
I hope you accept it.

101
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,614
Is it even possible, that's what
these attacks have been about?

102
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,250
Releasing the prisonners at Palmdale?

103
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:25,224
Sir,
I feel it's wishful thinking to assume

104
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:26,726
this is Fayed's endgame.

105
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,192
Bill, contact Palmdale.

106
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,906
<i>Find out exactly what will be involved
in making this happen.</i>

107
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:33,930
Yes, sir.

108
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,059
Mr President...

109
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,423
you cannot seriously consider

110
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:39,329
giving in to this man's demands.

111
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:42,703
I mean you said yourself:
Fayed cannot be trusted.

112
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:43,905
No, he can't.

113
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,028
And, Tom, I don't believe
for one second he has any intention

114
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:49,426
of stopping these attacks.
Not permanently.

115
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,195
But going along with this
buys us more time to find Fayed.

116
00:05:52,204 --> 00:05:53,468
At the very least,

117
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,459
it gives the country
a respite from the bombings.

118
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:59,045
Sir, you'd be releasing 110
extremely dangerous terrorists.

119
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:01,374
Karen, I am very well aware of that.

120
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,001
But unless we find Fayed,
I may be forced to.

121
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:20,791
- We got a problem.
- What?

122
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:21,952
He's heading north.

123
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,608
The farther he gets outside of the city,

124
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,285
the less traffic we'll have to hide in.

125
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:28,378
It's gonna be more difficult to track
him all the way without him seing us.

126
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,752
- What else can we do?
- We need to call CTU.

127
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:32,504
They can give us satellite coverage.

128
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,563
No, I said no CTU. They killed my men,
they tried to kill me!

129
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:38,284
That's because Fayed made them believe
you were behind the bombings.

130
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:40,158
I do not work with my enemies.

131
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,439
You're working with one now.

132
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,836
You might hate this country,
you might hate its values

133
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,698
but if you were serious about disarming,

134
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:51,346
about bringing your organization
and others to the table,

135
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:53,601
then you know you have to compromise.

136
00:06:53,764 --> 00:06:55,598
That is your political reality.

137
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,693
Who's to say they won't put me in prison
once they have me?

138
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:01,087
I can't tell you they won't.

139
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:03,781
But right now,
that is our only lead to Fayed.

140
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:09,500
Make the call.

141
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,114
Thank you.

142
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:14,521
Morris, I need you to load this.

143
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:16,178
What is it?

144
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:17,910
The President just got a call
from Fayed.

145
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,144
He demands we release
all the prisonners from Palmdale.

146
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:22,540
We need to valid each one
in case he goes through with it.

147
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:25,231
What he wants is some pretty serious
high grade terrorist suspect.

148
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:27,300
Calm down, no one's not even go.

149
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:29,168
Excuse-me...

150
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:31,496
Are you refusing to do this?

151
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,100
I think you should give this one
to the girls in Archives.

152
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:36,385
I'm working on Fayed threats,
that's more important.

153
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,671
Okay, I don't really care
what you <i>think</i> is important.

154
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,708
It's not your place
to tell me what's important.

155
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:43,045
Just calm down.
I'm trying to help you do your job.

156
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:45,268
You have to evaluate
directives that come down.

157
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,279
You can't just keep wasting the time
of your most important analysts.

158
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:49,298
- I'm not...
- Morris.

159
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,860
What? What?

160
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,994
I want you to put filters
on each one of these files.

161
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:57,510
If I don't have results on my screen
in 20 minutes you are outta here.

162
00:07:58,751 --> 00:07:59,916
Grow up.

163
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,442
- O'Brian.
- <i>Chloe, this is Jack.</i>

164
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,184
I didn't think I'd ever hear
your voice again.

165
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:09,638
I don't have a lotta time.
I need to speak to Bill Buchanan.

166
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:10,720
Hold on.

167
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,150
Buchanan.

168
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:14,493
<i>It's Jack on line 1.</i>

169
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:17,870
- Jack, where are you?
- I'm in a car with Assad.

170
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:20,166
We're tracking one of the suspects
in the train bombing.

171
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,930
We know you're working with Assad.
Are you sure you can trust him?

172
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,214
I think so.

173
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:26,667
What do you need, Jack?

174
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:28,705
The suspect's on Florence
crossing Ormond.

175
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,658
We believe is ultimately gonna
lead us to Fayed

176
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:32,566
but we need Chloe to give us
satellite support.

177
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,696
Loggin' on to the NSA server now.

178
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:37,379
Jack, Fayed just contacted
the President Palmer

179
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:40,235
and demanded he releases the prisonners
we're holding in Palmdale.

180
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:41,743
What's the President's position?

181
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:43,955
If we don't find Fayed
by the 9:00 a.m. deadline

182
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,393
I believe he'll go through with it.

183
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,854
This could take me at least 10 min
to get satellite coverage.

184
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:50,244
I had to send the repositionning
orders for the sub server.

185
00:08:50,282 --> 00:08:52,307
That's too long,
the suspects is entering route 7.

186
00:08:52,325 --> 00:08:53,889
If we try to follow him, he'll see us.

187
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:55,691
Chloe, can you speed up access?

188
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:58,717
No, the sat queue's overloaded,
the entire country's on high alert.

189
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:01,583
We'll use CalTrans cameras to track him
till the satellite reposition.

190
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,425
If there was a traffic camera
on route 7.

191
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:04,637
There isn't, I already looked.

192
00:09:04,676 --> 00:09:06,920
You're gonna have to figure out
another way to track him

193
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,148
until we get the satellite up.

194
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,436
- Where's yout nearest tac team?
- Curtis has a unit...

195
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:11,496
12 miles away.

196
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,619
Send him in my direction.
I'll get back to you.

197
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,170
Do you think this man
will recognize you?

198
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:20,505
No. What do you have in mind?

199
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,574
Curtis Manning on com.

200
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:25,735
Curtis, I just spoke to Jack.

201
00:09:25,764 --> 00:09:27,976
He's surveilling one of Fayed's men
and needs backup.

202
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,411
- Where is he?
- <i>Last known was Florence Blvd</i>

203
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:31,899
<i>near the entrance to Route 7.</i>

204
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:34,500
He's running this operation with Assad.

205
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,245
Did I hear that correctly?

206
00:09:37,406 --> 00:09:39,254
We're working <i>with</i> Assad?

207
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:41,969
<i>Your orders are to rendez-vous
with them and lend support.</i>

208
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:45,096
All warants on Assad are resended
for the time being. Understood?

209
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:48,169
Curtis?

210
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:50,598
We're on our way.

211
00:09:55,587 --> 00:09:56,664
Don't get up!

212
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:06,109
What's wrong with you?
I know you saw me coming!

213
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:08,909
- It was my right of way!
- You tell me I don't know how to drive?

214
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,660
I'm talking to you!

215
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,990
Hey, you're alright?
I saw the whole thing.

216
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:15,138
Get out of here!
This is got nothing to do with you.

217
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:16,989
I'm a witness!
You drove straight into him!

218
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:18,325
What is it with you, people?

219
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,215
You're gonna stick up for him?

220
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,731
Fine. I'll wait here
until the police arrives.

221
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:26,160
Screw both of you.

222
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:27,763
Screw you!

223
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,099
Where are you going?

224
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:31,780
Hey, this is your fault!

225
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:34,941
I saw his licence for the police.

226
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:38,056
I can't wait for the police.
I can't drive this.

227
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:41,166
I need to be somewhere.
I'll just have to deal with this later.

228
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:42,802
Where are you going?

229
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,871
Newhall. I was getting on route 7.

230
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,097
I can take you to Newhall,
I'll drop you there. Come.

231
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,078
- Come!
- Thank you.

232
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,869
I hope you're not gonna let that bastard
get away with this.

233
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,805
Hit-and-run is a crime.
You must file a police report.

234
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:32,946
I know.

235
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:37,127
Come on...

236
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:41,407
<i>CTU?</i>

237
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,735
This is Jack Bauer.
I need to speak with Bill Buchanan.

238
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:44,684
<i>Hold, please.</i>

239
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,539
Bill, it's Jack.
Fayed's man is now in a car with Assad.

240
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:51,431
What happened?

241
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:53,416
The suspect was involved
in a traffic incident.

242
00:12:53,431 --> 00:12:55,450
Listen to me.
Assad has let his cell phone opened

243
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,780
so that we can monitor the call.

244
00:12:56,828 --> 00:13:00,195
I'm gonna be following roughly
2 miles behind in a white Jeep Cherokee.

245
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:03,584
Through conversation with the suspect,
Assad'll let us know where he's going.

246
00:13:03,602 --> 00:13:05,160
I'm ready to transfer you into the car.

247
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,057
Go ahead, Jack.

248
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:11,515
Bill, they cant hear us on their side.
You should be on call, now.

249
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:19,094
I don't know Newhall very well.

250
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,903
<i>- I need you to guide me, please.
- I will.</i>

251
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,568
Nadia, pull* all agency data pour
on Newhall,

252
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,243
to set up perimeters for a sort.

253
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,774
Chloe, when you get the satellite,

254
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,642
make sure we have coverage of that area.

255
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:32,642
Let Curtis know that he is to intercept
Jack somewhere on route 7

256
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,695
on the way to Newhall.

257
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:38,618
Fayed?

258
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:39,606
What is it?

259
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,040
Our scout is reporting
increased activity

260
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,908
around the Palmdale military prison.

261
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,580
The transport buses are starting
to arrive.

262
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:48,125
Good.

263
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,205
By the time my jailed brothers
are boarded on the aircraft,

264
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:54,139
it will be too late for the Americans
to realize what's happened.

265
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,739
We still don't have the component.

266
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,321
We will.

267
00:13:59,815 --> 00:14:01,929
Ahmed should be on his way
to pick it up, now.

268
00:14:12,997 --> 00:14:14,497
Scott? Is that you?

269
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:15,917
Yeah.

270
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,832
Honey, we were beginning to get worried.

271
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:21,420
- My God, Ahmed! What happened?
- Mom, he has a gun.

272
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,401
What's going on?

273
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,919
What is this? Where is Ray?

274
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,163
Just put the gun down, and...

275
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:34,867
- ... tell me what's happening.
- Call him.

276
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,453
Ray?

277
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,344
Yeah.

278
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,881
What the hell...

279
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:47,136
Don't wanna hurt any of you, but I will
unless you do exactly what I say.

280
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,668
You're a nurse, right?

281
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:50,560
- You have medical supplies, bandages?
- Yeah.

282
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:51,492
Go get them.

283
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:53,519
Now!

284
00:14:57,524 --> 00:14:59,104
You two... on the couch.

285
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:00,428
Now, come on!

286
00:15:05,465 --> 00:15:07,157
Sit... down!

287
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:08,784
Now!

288
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:17,468
I need you to patch this leg.
Stop the bleeding.

289
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,659
My God, Stan was right.
You are a terrorist.

290
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,361
Stan is dead.

291
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:24,943
He killed him.

292
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:26,658
What? I can't stop this bleeding.

293
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,366
Don't tell me that you can't!

294
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:31,366
The wound's too deep.
You have muscle tissue damage.

295
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:32,754
You need to see a doctor.

296
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,078
Just bandage it!

297
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,524
There's a package in there.

298
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:43,004
I'm supposed to take it to a man
who has an item for me.

299
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:44,514
Press.

300
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:48,899
Obviously, I can't do that now.

301
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:50,407
So, you gonna have to.

302
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,462
I'm not leaving you alone
with my family.

303
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,864
Your family will be safe
when you do what I say.

304
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,229
When you pick up the item,

305
00:15:58,595 --> 00:16:00,867
you'll call me,
and I'll give you further instructions.

306
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,506
What's in this package?

307
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:15,766
That's not of your concern.
You're just making a drop.

308
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,341
Grab that phone and come here.

309
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,183
Come here, come here.

310
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:22,432
Understand this:

311
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:24,316
if I see anyone...

312
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:27,251
police, FBI, anybody outside this house,

313
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,707
or if you take too long,

314
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:30,846
your wife and son are dead.

315
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:35,516
Do you understand me? Look at me!
Do you understand me?

316
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:36,827
I understand.

317
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:40,757
Where am I going?

318
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:43,069
There's an address on the front
pocket of that backpack.

319
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,211
It's a man named Marcus.

320
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,036
Go!

321
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:32,158
Curtis, how far away are you?

322
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:33,271
Less than five minutes.

323
00:17:33,339 --> 00:17:34,504
Get there as fast as you can.

324
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,137
Assad and Fayed's man are on open road.

325
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,512
They're already five miles ahead.

326
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:38,844
Got it.

327
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:40,473
- Darling?
- What?

328
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:42,957
Since when do you take Milo's side
against me?

329
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,950
- You're doing him again.
- I was not, my lovely.

330
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,259
Your pick on your bosses
whenever you get stressed out.

331
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,224
Milo's not my boss.
Heaven forbids.

332
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,193
Well, he might as well be.
He can bounce you.

333
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,337
Which is what I think you really want,
sometimes.

334
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,014
And why would I want that?

335
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,325
I don't know, it's your character form,
not mine.

336
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:05,415
The files you wanted are all unlocked.
They'll be on your screen in a minute.

337
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:08,478
Good.

338
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:21,665
Mr. President?

339
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:26,798
I just got off the phone with CTU.
They reconnected with Jack Bauer.

340
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,159
Where is he?

341
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:31,215
He's following a man he's identified
as one of Fayed's operatives.

342
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:34,382
CTU is now coordinating support for Jack
because they believe this man

343
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:35,991
will lead them to Fayed's location.

344
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,319
Did CTU offer a time frame
for locating Fayed?

345
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,972
No, sir. At this point, any estimates
would be premature.

346
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:43,871
And did you speak with
the Palmdale facility?

347
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,129
Yes, and the airfield.

348
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,976
If we wanna meet Fayed's deadline

349
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:49,584
and have these prisoners in the air
before the end of the hour,

350
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:52,824
we have to have them on buses
and the road within the next 10 minutes.

351
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,941
If you still want to proceed...
with that option.

352
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,927
Listen, Karen.
I know you disapprove of my decision.

353
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,901
But unless Jack and CTU call

354
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:06,319
to say they have Fayed,
there is no other option here.

355
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,067
Tell them to load the buses.

356
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,019
Yes, M. President.

357
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,075
Sand Canyon Road.

358
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:29,729
What?

359
00:19:30,396 --> 00:19:31,620
I was just remembering.

360
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,308
<i>I had a friend who lived
on Sand Canyon Road.</i>

361
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:43,739
We can take the service road from here.

362
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,962
They're 2 miles ahead of us
on the service road.

363
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,142
We can monitor their direction
with their cell phone.

364
00:20:03,189 --> 00:20:04,275
CTU wants you on com.

365
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,112
- Copy?
- 10/4.

366
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:17,809
- CTU, this is Manning.
- Go ahead, Curtis.

367
00:20:17,848 --> 00:20:20,379
Bill, I'm with Jack.
Do we have satellite access, yet?

368
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:22,428
It's coming up.
Is Jack on the line?

369
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:23,867
I'm here, Bill.

370
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,857
We're redirecting the NSA satellite

371
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:28,079
to the area around
Sand Canyon road exit mark.

372
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:30,050
As soon as we have a fix
on Assad's vehicle

373
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,345
we'll upload it to your GPS.

374
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:32,775
Copy that.

375
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:39,311
Good to see you, Jack.

376
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:44,953
I'm sorry for what you're put through.

377
00:20:46,827 --> 00:20:48,218
I'm glad you're back.

378
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:52,160
Now, I have to work with Assad.

379
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,556
Doesn't that bother you?

380
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:00,731
The man's a terrorist, Jack!

381
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:02,915
Responsible for taking hundreds,

382
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,833
maybe thousands of innocent lives
over the past twenty years.

383
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,286
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

384
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:13,030
I don't know what
means anything anymore, Curtis.

385
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:19,295
I've spend my all life defending
this country against people like Assad.

386
00:21:20,964 --> 00:21:23,719
And now, he's trying to disarm
his people, renounce terrorism.

387
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,193
Playing field has changed.

388
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,782
And that doesn't change Assad's past.

389
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,874
We have to make sure that he paies
for  the crimes that he's committed.

390
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:35,878
He's our only chance
at a peaceful resolution of all of this.

391
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,144
That might not happened.

392
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:40,762
Anyway, that's not our call to make.

393
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:43,264
We'll see.

394
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:46,202
What is that supposed to mean?

395
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:49,709
Nothing.

396
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:52,298
Good.

397
00:21:58,472 --> 00:21:59,689
This isn't working.

398
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:04,076
There's still too much pain,
I need something stronger.

399
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,409
There are some prescription
pain killers in the kitchen.

400
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:11,361
Get them.

401
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:12,733
And some water.

402
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,117
Make sure I can see you.

403
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:19,778
They are in the cabinet over the TV.

404
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:57,539
Give it to me.

405
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,592
Sit down.

406
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,521
Sit... down!

407
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,728
Sit down, sweaty.

408
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,964
Form an orderly line!

409
00:23:55,795 --> 00:23:57,496
Head count will be taken.

410
00:23:58,017 --> 00:23:59,776
Then, and only then,

411
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:01,766
you'll be loaded onto those buses

412
00:24:02,017 --> 00:24:03,177
Understand?

413
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:07,136
Any problem you cause
will only delay this process.

414
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,629
Get in line!

415
00:24:33,663 --> 00:24:34,899
I'll tell him. Right.

416
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,373
It was the FBI.

417
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:40,209
Your sister, she's been arrested.

418
00:24:40,615 --> 00:24:41,658
What?

419
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,610
- When?
- Less than an hour ago.

420
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:47,388
The FBI agents were sent to the offices
of the Islamic American Alliance

421
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:49,726
to serve a warrant
for the personnel files.

422
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,905
Sandra proceeded to delete them
right in front of the agents.

423
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,586
They had no choice but to arrest her.

424
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:55,968
Damn it!

425
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:59,301
Where is she been taken, Tom?

426
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,871
She's been detained.
One of our provisional facilities.

427
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:31,021
Walid, I am so sorry,
I got you into this.

428
00:25:31,253 --> 00:25:32,509
I deleted those files.

429
00:25:32,606 --> 00:25:35,176
It wasn't right for them
to arrest to you for my actions.

430
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,108
You have nothing to apologize for.

431
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:39,464
You were protecting the right
of innocent Americans.

432
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,807
It's what this country stand for,
even if the government forgot it.

433
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,203
Back away!

434
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,441
Move back.

435
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,717
Come on!

436
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,441
You take him.

437
00:25:53,968 --> 00:25:55,282
Where are you taking him?

438
00:25:55,745 --> 00:25:56,770
Walid!

439
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,871
I'll be alright.

440
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:00,014
Over here, Ms. Palmer.

441
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:02,700
Take-off her cuffs.

442
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:09,952
For you.

443
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,372
I'll be right here.

444
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,638
<i>Please hold for the President...</i>

445
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,599
What were you thinking,
deleting those files?

446
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,170
I was standing-up to unlawful seizure.

447
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:25,517
You making a point,
is the last thing I need today.

448
00:26:25,556 --> 00:26:27,855
I have ordered your release.
Agents are waiting outside.

449
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:29,556
with instructions
to take you back home.

450
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:32,412
I don't want to be released, Wayne.
I want to fight this.

451
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:34,257
Bring attention to the civil liberties

452
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:36,594
that you administration
has allowed to be violated.

453
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:38,410
Do you have any idea
what's going on today?

454
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:39,435
Of course I do.

455
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,358
<i>Innocent people are dying
all over the country</i>

456
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:43,724
and you choose now to make
a civil right case out of this.

457
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:45,309
Well, somebody has to!

458
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:48,158
<i>Look, if you gonna release anybody,
it should be Walid.</i>

459
00:26:48,235 --> 00:26:50,844
Walid is the head
of an organization under investigation.

460
00:26:51,037 --> 00:26:53,742
Now, the FBI just wants to hold him
until it can be determined

461
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:55,268
<i>what was in those files you deleted.</i>

462
00:26:55,287 --> 00:26:57,548
There is nothing increminating
on those files.

463
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:58,881
<i>Wayne, you have my word.</i>

464
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:00,408
Walid is innocent!

465
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,456
The Walid has nothing
to worry about, Sandra.

466
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,437
Listen...

467
00:27:04,881 --> 00:27:06,156
I don't have time for this.

468
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,857
You are released.

469
00:27:07,934 --> 00:27:09,973
Go home, I will call you later.

470
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,791
I need to speak to Walid
before I leave here.

471
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,912
That's not going to happen.

472
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:23,482
I'm his attorney,
you have to give access to him.

473
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:26,129
Don't tell me
what I have to do, Ms. Palmer,

474
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:27,231
I'm following orders.

475
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,854
Walid has rights!

476
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,090
Limited rights, Ms. Palmer.

477
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:33,733
He's been held under the revised
ennemy combatant statute.

478
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:36,824
Applying this statute
to somebody like him is ridiculous.

479
00:27:37,134 --> 00:27:39,713
Is the law just been completely
thrown through the windows?

480
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:41,969
When you're through the lectures,

481
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,785
I have orders to drive you home.

482
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:47,021
Ma'am.

483
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,910
Stay to the left.

484
00:27:54,335 --> 00:27:57,195
Once inside the secure zone,
you will disrobe.

485
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,615
After a cavity search,

486
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:00,412
we will giving back your clothing.

487
00:28:02,576 --> 00:28:03,813
Sir, you have to keep moving.

488
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:05,552
I don't care.

489
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:06,875
I'm innocent.

490
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,692
I want to talk to somebody,
an authority.

491
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,362
We're not gonna ask you again.

492
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:11,947
Hey, don't touch me!

493
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:14,246
Let him alone!

494
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:15,415
Sir, get back in line!

495
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,086
Not until you will let go that man!

496
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:21,279
Take your hands of me!

497
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:26,112
Take him to interrogation.

498
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,289
Do you live around here?

499
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:53,724
No.

500
00:28:54,326 --> 00:28:55,486
Visiting relatives?

501
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:57,766
Why are you asking?

502
00:28:57,785 --> 00:29:00,162
I need to make sure
you can get back to your car.

503
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,597
- I'll be okay.
- "I'll be okay."

504
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:05,726
My son is as this.
He has a memory like a fish.

505
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,716
His mother is very worried.

506
00:29:09,764 --> 00:29:11,504
At the next corner, make a right.

507
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,450
Then drop me off
at the end of the street.

508
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:14,740
Did you copy that?

509
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,020
It's the sixty five hundred block
of Alderton.

510
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,474
Bring out the data on all commercial
and restaurant buildings

511
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,402
within an half mile
and then begin a free sort.

512
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,829
You mean like I'm doing already?

513
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:24,162
Right over here.

514
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,636
- Alright, thanks again for your help.
- Please, it's nothing.

515
00:29:57,257 --> 00:30:00,156
<i>He's cross the sixty fourth road
headed towards the commercial district.</i>

516
00:30:00,228 --> 00:30:03,282
<i>- I'm turning around.</i>
- Here he is.

517
00:30:03,822 --> 00:30:06,094
We've acquired the suspect on satellite.

518
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,417
Curtis, have your men
setup a moving perimeter.

519
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:26,986
Carrier,
take him at across exit port road,

520
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:28,942
setup a moving perimeter
behind the target.

521
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,400
He'll be well trained be carefull.

522
00:30:31,643 --> 00:30:33,385
My men know their job.

523
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,300
- Do I know you?
- No...

524
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,138
- but I know you.
<i>- Subject entering</i>

525
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,457
a commercial building
one block south of where you are.

526
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:42,526
<i>Copy that.</i>

527
00:30:42,587 --> 00:30:43,618
Borman,

528
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,473
we're gonna take Assad with us.

529
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:47,758
Keep him on a close watch
searching for weapons.

530
00:30:47,824 --> 00:30:49,736
Curtis,
Assad is a part of this operation.

531
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,957
Not anymore.

532
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,634
Wait, wait.

533
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:04,178
I'll take care of it
as soon as this is over.

534
00:31:04,358 --> 00:31:05,437
I promise.

535
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:13,347
Thank you.

536
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:19,449
The building is a self storage facility.

537
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:20,935
14 200 units.

538
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:53,764
Borman, keep him here.

539
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,357
<i>- Team leader, do you copy?</i>
- Go ahead, Carrier.

540
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,554
I can see two dozen cases of amunition

541
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,731
Boxes with czech writing.

542
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,513
Bill, this is a dead drop,
Fayed's not here.

543
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:05,359
We only have a few minutes, Jack.

544
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,559
If the suspect
is not going to lead us to Fayed,

545
00:32:07,644 --> 00:32:10,744
in order to stop the prisoners exchange,
we have to move in now.

546
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:12,653
Get the information
through interrogation.

547
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:13,801
Bill, that's too risky.

548
00:32:14,955 --> 00:32:17,000
We have no guarantee
we can make him talk in time.

549
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:18,494
That's a risk we have to take.

550
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,368
Curtis, move your men into position.

551
00:32:20,473 --> 00:32:21,524
Understood.

552
00:32:21,637 --> 00:32:23,061
All teams, we're moving in.

553
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,569
Stealth approach, none lethal force.

554
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:03,441
Come where I can see you.

555
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:07,501
Step out with you hands up.

556
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:14,828
Everyone's back!

557
00:33:26,035 --> 00:33:27,531
Boggey*** the nurse fire hall.****

558
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:29,746
Get the fire department of LA here, now!

559
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,430
Bill, it's Jack, suspect is dead.

560
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,373
He was taking a laptop
out of this storage unit.

561
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,772
We'll check the hardrive
but it has been badly damaged.

562
00:33:36,843 --> 00:33:38,641
Understood Jack, I need the President.

563
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,266
That's a feed
of the prisoners in Palmdale.

564
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:50,726
Yes.

565
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:53,285
<i>Mr. President, I have Bill Buchanan
on the line for you.</i>

566
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,823
- Put him on.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

567
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:56,555
<i>Mr President,</i>

568
00:33:57,255 --> 00:33:59,053
we got a set back to our operation.

569
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,697
- What happened, Bill?
- The suspect Jack was following

570
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:04,911
chose to kill himself
rather than be apprehended.

571
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,750
We're examining the area for evidence

572
00:34:07,807 --> 00:34:09,655
but there is no telling how long
it will take

573
00:34:09,656 --> 00:34:11,630
or if it will lead us to Fayed, sir,
I'm sorry.

574
00:34:11,738 --> 00:34:12,798
So am I.

575
00:34:12,874 --> 00:34:14,672
- Keep me informed.
</i>- Of course.</i>

576
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:20,549
Mr President if you intend on following
through with this prisoner release,

577
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:22,660
we wait orders.

578
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:31,959
Load them on the plane.

579
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:38,973
This is Lennox.

580
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,898
The President has made is decision:

581
00:34:41,267 --> 00:34:42,866
load the prisoners on the plane.

582
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:49,564
Head counts is correct and all men
are accounted for on bus three.

583
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:52,142
I want confirmed head counts
on all other vehicules.

584
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:53,987
<i>Copy that. Bus 1 confirmed.</i>

585
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,778
Roger that.

586
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:01,567
We will proceed single file
and in orderly man onto the plane.

587
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,841
There will be no mistakes,
and no disorder.

588
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:06,559
Is that clear?

589
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:13,858
Let's get this buses
out of here as soon as we can.

590
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,164
- Let's move.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:40,230
We've just heard from the airport.

592
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:42,426
Our people are beiing
loaded on to the plane.

593
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:45,066
The President has giving in to us.

594
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:24,333
Hello.

595
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:32,522
Back here.

596
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,898
- You're Marcus.
- Who are you?

597
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:41,848
I'm supposed to give this to you.

598
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:45,108
And your supposed
to give me something in return.

599
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,439
That's not enough.

600
00:37:05,594 --> 00:37:06,900
What do you mean?

601
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:09,292
Component cost me a little more

602
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,611
than I though it would.
I need another 50.000.

603
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:13,267
But that's all he gave me.

604
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:15,520
Well, go back and get the rest.

605
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:17,368
I can't do that.

606
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:22,232
Look, I need

607
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:24,418
whatever it is you're selling, please.

608
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:25,927
Just...

609
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:28,984
take the money. I am begging you.

610
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:32,665
Until you get more money,
we got nothing more to talk about.

611
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:42,772
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

612
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,695
He wants another 50.000 dollars.

613
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:00,006
Tell him you don't have it.

614
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,378
I did...

615
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:04,208
and he said to come back when I get it.

616
00:38:04,314 --> 00:38:05,435
Listen to me.

617
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,785
There is no more money,
I don't care what you have to do,

618
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,602
but you have to get that item from him.

619
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:13,363
Do you understand
what happens here if you don't, right ?

620
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:18,217
Yeah, I understand.

621
00:38:21,614 --> 00:38:24,274
- What did he say.
- Well, he say that I'll get the money.

622
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:26,625
And, before,
you know I bring it back here,

623
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,695
he just want us to make sure
you really have it.

624
00:38:44,884 --> 00:38:46,143
There it is.

625
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,824
Son of a bitch.

626
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,293
I'll kill you...

627
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,777
Shut up and just take the money,
just take it.

628
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:40,808
OK, Jack,
the hardrive is mostly toasted,

629
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:43,580
<i>but i was able to recover
the most recently accessed files.</i>

630
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:46,476
Some kind of wiring schematic
how much of the file to we have.

631
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:49,575
About a page and a half mostly
in arabic, some of it in russian.

632
00:39:50,786 --> 00:39:52,178
Get Assad over here now.

633
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:54,846
Borman.

634
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:56,058
Bring him.

635
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:05,308
Do you know what this is?

636
00:40:07,777 --> 00:40:10,115
This is a list of electronic components.

637
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:13,337
You have specifications,
programing instructions for a detonator.

638
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:15,392
But...

639
00:40:15,818 --> 00:40:16,869
this...

640
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:19,225
is for a nuclear device.

641
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:24,657
Is it even possible that Fayed
could have acquired a nuclear weapon?

642
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,562
My organisation has tryed
unsuccesfully in the past.

643
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,199
It's possible he may have found a way.

644
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:31,548
Son of a bitch.
You know about that all along...

645
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:34,103
Curtis, get off of him now.

646
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,721
Assad, please.

647
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:42,415
There is a reference file
at the bottom of the page.

648
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,232
Softel 3.

649
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:46,696
That's a compact bomb
the soviets made in the late eighties.

650
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,251
- It refer to the suitecase nuke.
- Are they all accounted for?

651
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:52,430
Officialy they were all destroyed, but
there was a claim that one device

652
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:55,430
was deverted to a nuclear scientist
who's suspected terrorist ties.

653
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,930
He call's himself Saif-al-Din.

654
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:58,122
Looking up his file now.

655
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,195
There won't be much,
Saif-al-Din is a code name,

656
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,621
it mean: "sword of the faith."

657
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,608
intel just never discover his identity.

658
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:06,636
Jack, we have one surveillance photo,
it's about 6 years old

659
00:41:06,892 --> 00:41:07,952
Put it up.

660
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,282
- Do you recognize him?
- Yes.

661
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:15,966
I saw him with Fayed a year ago.

662
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,048
His name is Numair, Hasan Numair.

663
00:41:18,105 --> 00:41:19,969
- Did you copy that?
- Looking up his name.

664
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:22,226
We need to know where this man is now.

665
00:41:23,532 --> 00:41:24,800
I think we already do.

666
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:27,092
Hasan Numair is a terrorist

667
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,105
being release
from the Palmdale military prison.

668
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,558
Get on the phone
the white house.

669
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:32,404
Chloe bring up the feed on the airfield.

670
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:34,665
This is what Fayed
has been planning all along.

671
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,195
This bombings where designed
to make you free this man.

672
00:41:39,468 --> 00:41:40,566
Son of a bitch.

673
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:43,040
Chloe,
have they freed the prisoners yet?

674
00:41:43,078 --> 00:41:45,980
No, they're on the plane and there'll be
2 min before they're in the air.

675
00:41:46,018 --> 00:41:48,479
Give me the CO of the airfield,
send it to my office.

676
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:50,968
Nadia, tell the President
I'm stopping the release.

677
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:52,783
That is Nadia Yassir from CTU.

678
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,301
I need to speak with The President,
priority three.

679
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:03,687
<i>This is Bill Buchanan. The prisoner
you're looking for is Hasan Numair.</i>

680
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:05,423
<i>I'm sending his picture to your PDA.</i>

681
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:06,597
Roger that.

682
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,026
Prisoner Numair,

683
00:42:16,385 --> 00:42:17,881
raise your hand.

684
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,278
I've got the photo.

685
00:42:22,411 --> 00:42:23,499
<i>Copy that.</i>

686
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:29,291
Prisoner Numair, identify yourself now.

687
00:42:31,901 --> 00:42:34,001
We need to go over every square inch
of this plane.

688
00:42:34,086 --> 00:42:37,105
Someone let the sergent know,
he needs to get up here now.

689
00:42:45,058 --> 00:42:46,108
Hurry up.

690
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:47,641
Fayed is waiting for you.

691
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:10,156
