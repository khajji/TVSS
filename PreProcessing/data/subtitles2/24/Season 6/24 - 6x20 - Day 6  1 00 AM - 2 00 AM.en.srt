00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:13,467
We-We're going t...

00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:14,467
(grunts)

00:00:14,534 --> 00:00:16,434
HAYES:
Get Medical right away!

00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,267
<i>LISA:
It is incontestable
Wayne Palmer</i>

7
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:21,434
won't be able to continue his
duties as commander-in-chief.

8
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:23,701
I have the fate of the western
world and the lives

9
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:25,634
of millions of Americans
hanging in the balance,

10
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:27,467
and I can't...

11
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:30,601
stop thinking about you.

12
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:34,267
Bill Buchanan had Fayed
in custody...

13
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,200
and he let him go.

14
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:41,400
Karen Hayes put it
in a blue file over at Homeland.

15
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,300
Someone is going to have
to go down--

16
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:45,367
the farther from the
president, the better.

17
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:46,634
Are you asking me to resign?

18
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:47,968
HAYES:
No, Bill.

19
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,767
I have to fire you.

20
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,601
You should work with Milo,
you know, get cozy.

21
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,000
Don't be such a jealous jerk.

22
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,267
Um, the day I'm jealous
is the day I kill myself.

23
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,534
Is there anything else?

24
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:58,667
How about don't arm
nuclear bombs

25
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,267
for terrorists.

26
00:01:00,334 --> 00:01:02,267
Sorry.

27
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:04,467
That's not how I feel.

28
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,334
Yeah, it is.

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,634
No, it's not-- it just slipped
out of my mouth.

30
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,934
Morris!

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,968
You shouldn't have
any trouble running CTU.

32
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm not the right
choice to take over.

33
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:16,200
You are the right choice.

34
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,667
Nothing will change
operationally.

35
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,567
Your objective remains the same:

36
00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:21,968
bring in Jack Bauer

37
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:24,334
before he can hand over
the component to the Chinese.

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Mr. Bauer.

39
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,167
Let's do this.

40
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:30,200
Audrey walks out of here alone.

41
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,734
As soon as I see that she
gets down near the bridge,

42
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,334
then I'll give you
the component.

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,133
DOYLE:
All right, this is
going down now, Nadia.

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,734
Jack is about to hand over
the component.

45
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,901
NADIA:
Mike, don't let that happen.

46
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,000
MAN:
Cheng and his men
have escaped from the hotel.

47
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,667
They're in three black Hummers,
heading north.

48
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:53,367
Agent Bauer,
get down!

49
00:01:53,434 --> 00:01:54,367
Weapon is down!

50
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:55,400
Down on the ground
now!

51
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:56,701
Who is your commanding officer?

52
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:58,033
DOYLE:
I am, Jack.

53
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,734
I got to take
you into custody.

54
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:01,834
Where's the sub-circuit board?

55
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,300
Cheng's got it.

56
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:05,701
I was set to blow the building
and destroy the component

57
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:07,667
until you engaged us
in a firefight.

58
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:08,934
I had this handled.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Audrey, it's over.

60
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,000
It's all right,
you're safe.

61
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,133
Help me, Jack.

62
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,501
Please don't let
them do this to me.

63
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,267
Audrey!

64
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:16,734
They've done something to her.

65
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,067
You've got to help her, please.

66
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:21,267
(inaudible)

67
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,467
My God.

68
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:33,033
(helicopter propeller whirring)

69
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,501
Mr. Bauer, was this
the only C-4 that
was in the building?

70
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:38,267
Yes, that's everything;
the building's clean.

71
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:40,133
(sniffles)

72
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,133
Ms. Raines,
my name is Mike Doyle.

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,367
I'm a CTU field agent.

74
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:56,234
We're hoping
you saw or heard something

75
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,467
while Cheng was holding you...

76
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:59,834
something that could
lead us to him.

77
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,400
You're safe now,
Ms. Raines.

78
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:09,934
Jack bought your freedom
from the Chinese

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,434
with a component
that contains

80
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,334
highly sensitive
Russian technology.

81
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:25,434
Can you understand me,
Ms. Raines?

82
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,934
Help me, Jack.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,167
Please don't let them
do this to me.

84
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:45,300
I want CHP to work with military
on roadblocks.

85
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,234
You need to set up three-
and five-mile perimeters

86
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,133
from Cheng's
last confirmed location.

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,767
I need satellite scans analyzed
and forwarded to me now.

88
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,234
(over phone):
The system's overloaded.

89
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,534
Yeah, I understand
the system's overloaded.

90
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,534
Those are your orders.

91
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,334
(knock at door)

92
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,734
You wanted to see me?

93
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,267
Yeah. Morris,
I read your request

94
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:03,868
for a transfer out of Comm.

95
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,067
Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:06,534
Is this because you
and Chloe had a fight?

97
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:08,534
Look, your facts
are essentially correct.

98
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:11,167
The why I don't see as being
anybody's business.

99
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,534
Look, Morris, you've had
a hard day-- we all have--

100
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,901
but... I really need you
on the floor.

101
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,467
So I'm sorry; your request
for a transfer is denied.

102
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:24,567
(conversing indistinctly)

103
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:29,167
You're new to the
job, and I'm just
trying to protect you

104
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:30,367
from being caught
in the middle

105
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:32,167
of a very awkward
professional situation.

106
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:34,200
You're asking me
to indulge

107
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,868
your private melodrama
while we're in the middle

108
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,133
of an international crisis.

109
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,667
Bill Buchanan said he'd
consider my request.

110
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:39,834
Did he tell you that?

111
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,667
Bill Buchanan
is not running CTU, I am.

112
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,334
I've made my decision.
Nadia...

113
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,534
Go back to your station, keep
your personal life to yourself.

114
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,868
You can deal with this tomorrow.
Nadia...

115
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:50,100
We're done here, Morris.

116
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,701
(phone rings)

117
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,167
Anything else you want to say?

118
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:54,701
Oh, yeah.

119
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,767
This is Nadia Yassir.

120
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,767
Nadia, it's Mike.
Do you have a lead on Cheng?

121
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,834
We're working on it.

122
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,901
How did it go
with Audrey Raines?

123
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:04,133
Not good.

124
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,367
What, she doesn't know anything
about Cheng?

125
00:05:05,434 --> 00:05:06,701
Where he was holding her,
what he was doing?

126
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,100
She's completely
nonresponsive.

127
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,467
I'm not a shrink,

128
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:11,067
but whatever they did
to her in China...

129
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,534
it left her with some kind
of post-traumatic reaction.

130
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,934
Bring her back here.

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,634
District will want a specialist
to take a look at her.

132
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:18,400
Do you have any idea
what Jack was thinking?

133
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,901
Yeah. He had this
motel rigged with C-4.

134
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,434
He was going to take
this whole place down

135
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,000
as soon as Audrey was safe.

136
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,200
He was willing to
sacrifice his life to
get Audrey released?

137
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:27,834
And his plan would've worked
if I hadn't intervened.

138
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:29,133
You saved his life.

139
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,934
But I lost the component.

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,634
Jack went against a direct order
from the White House.

141
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,167
This was no one's fault
but his.

142
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,234
We're on our way back.

143
00:05:42,767 --> 00:05:44,801
Stevenson, you take Ms. Raines.

144
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:47,567
I'll go with Bauer.

145
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:50,734
(helicopter propeller
whirring nearby)

146
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,234
Audrey!

147
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,834
Audrey!

148
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,834
Audrey!
DOYLE:
Jack, stop.

149
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,100
Where are you taking her?
To CTU, Jack, the same
place you're going.

150
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,300
Let me talk to her, just
for a couple of minutes, please.

151
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,200
You saw what condition
she's in, Jack.

152
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:07,334
I know her.

153
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,801
I know what she's been through.

154
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,234
I might be the only person
that can get through to her.

155
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,267
Please.

156
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,067
You're under arrest, Jack.

157
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:16,033
We'll discuss this back at CTU.

158
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,334
Put him in the
second chopper.

159
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,300
Mike! Let me talk to her now.

160
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,400
HAYES:
CTU is pouring
all their resources

161
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,334
into finding Cheng,
and this executive order

162
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,801
gives them authority to close

163
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,300
all ports and
border crossings.

164
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:46,634
We can't keep migrant workers

165
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,100
from crossing our borders
at will.

166
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,567
How the hell are we supposed to
stop a determined enemy agent?

167
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:53,367
Well, I think the point
is to slow him down, sir,

168
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,367
so that CTU
has more time to find him,

169
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,000
but I agree, Cheng
will find a way

170
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,567
to smuggle out the
Russian component

171
00:06:58,634 --> 00:06:59,567
eventually.

172
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,334
So then Russia loses

173
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,834
its defensive edge against the
Chinese and Moscow blames us.

174
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,834
We will do everything in
our power to prevent that, sir.

175
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:09,000
(sighs)

176
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,000
(slams book)

177
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,567
Thank you.

178
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,234
Karen...

179
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,734
Yes.

180
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,701
Tom told me
about you and Bill,

181
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,534
how you had to...
fire him from CTU.

182
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,667
How did he take it?

183
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:23,000
Not well.

184
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:25,901
Karen.

185
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,067
Yes.

186
00:07:29,434 --> 00:07:32,367
You and I have had our...

187
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:35,100
difficulties in the past,
but I want you to know that...

188
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,234
I value your role here

189
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,434
and that I appreciate
your sacrifice.

190
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:47,100
Thank you.

191
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,100
(knock at door)

192
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,834
Excuse me, sir.

193
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:51,901
What is it, Tom?

194
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:52,934
Russian President's
calling for you

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,100
in the telepresence suite.

196
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,200
He insisting on a face-to-face,

197
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,234
Did he say what he wants?

198
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,667
No, but he's on with the heads

199
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:00,968
of military
and intelligence services.

200
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:04,734
I want both of you
with me on this.

201
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:25,601
(gasps)

202
00:08:32,234 --> 00:08:34,133
Palmer's still
in a coma.

203
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,467
Looks like Noah's going to be
acting president for some time.

204
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,968
Good for Noah.

205
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,501
And good for us.

206
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,634
The only thing he cares about

207
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:45,067
is pushing
his lunatic foreign agenda.

208
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,868
Any pending legislation
on spending...

209
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:50,667
you'll defer to me.

210
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:51,901
Now that he is
acting president,

211
00:08:51,968 --> 00:08:53,067
we're going to have to
be even more careful

212
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,734
We will be.

213
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,434
I've got half an hour.

214
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,601
Let's stop talking.

215
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,801
President Suvarov,

216
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,834
you're on a secure conference

217
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,100
with Vice President Daniels.

218
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,534
President Suvarov.

219
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:24,367
Mr. Vice President.

220
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:27,167
You know my Chief of Staff,
Tom Lennox, and Karen Hayes,

221
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,534
my National
Security Advisor.

222
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,200
How can we help you?

223
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:33,267
Some very troubling news has
been brought to my attention.

224
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:34,934
What would that be?

225
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,667
The nuclear weapons
that fell into terrorists' hands

226
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,868
contained proprietary
Russian technology

227
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,467
that up until now

228
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:44,200
has only been available
to your government and mine.

229
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,834
I'm well aware of that, sir.

230
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,167
Then you are also

231
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:49,434
"well aware"
that an FB-sub-circuit board

232
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,901
from one of the weapons

233
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:55,834
is now in the possession of an
agent of the Chinese government.

234
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:59,667
Do you deny that, sir?

235
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,901
Mr. President,

236
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,834
all I'm prepared
to tell you is that...

237
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,200
we're in control
of the situation.

238
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:12,367
Mr. Vice President,
my generals have confirmed

239
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:15,567
that this component contains
information that will compromise

240
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:17,534
our defensive capabilities.

241
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:21,501
You must stop the Chinese from
leaving your country with it.

242
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,234
I don't appreciate being
dictated to, Mr. President.

243
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,667
Now, I don't need
to remind you

244
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:29,968
that it was a Russian general
who allowed those bombs

245
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,834
to enter the U.S.
in the first place,

246
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:35,501
the same Russian general
who conspired to detonate them.

247
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:39,000
That does not change
our grave concerns

248
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,701
about this development.

249
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,934
If you do not intercept
this component,

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,033
my generals have instructions

251
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,901
to initiate
an appropriate response.

252
00:10:48,968 --> 00:10:50,033
Mr. President...

253
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,200
Good night, sir.

254
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,334
How the hell did the Russians
find out about this?!

255
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,434
Russian intelligence

256
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,033
must have been tracking it.

257
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,968
No, no, no, the information
circle is too tight.

258
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,434
Only select people
at the White House

259
00:11:02,501 --> 00:11:04,567
and CTU even knew about this.

260
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:07,501
So you're saying there's a spy?

261
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,200
There is no other explanation.

262
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:10,868
I will start an immediate
internal investigation

263
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:12,501
into the White House staff.

264
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,567
I'll do the same
at CTU, sir.

265
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,734
What are your reads on Suvarov?

266
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,067
How seriously do
we take his threat?

267
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,300
Oh, I would say very, sir.

268
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,767
With the Chinese in possession

269
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,534
of the component,
the Russians will
need to extend

270
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,067
their defensive line
in Central Asia.

271
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,968
We have a military base
in the region.

272
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,434
Which the Russians
will have to target.

273
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:32,701
We will have to
respond in kind...

274
00:11:32,767 --> 00:11:33,868
Which will escalate things

275
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,067
beyond just a regional conflict.

276
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,400
Give CTU whatever they need

277
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:46,000
to find this man Cheng.

278
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,601
(speaking Chinese)

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,968
(speaking Chinese)

280
00:12:09,067 --> 00:12:10,701
OPERATIVE:
Yes?

281
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,167
I've interfaced the component.

282
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,100
You should have the schematics.

283
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,901
Yes, they've downloaded.

284
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,534
I'm running a diagnostic
on the component now.

285
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:21,033
Good. We'll be there
in less than an hour.

286
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,200
Wait.

287
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:24,767
(typing)

288
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,033
(sighs):
There's a problem.

289
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
What?

290
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,868
The circuit board is damaged.

291
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:29,968
Can you fix it?

292
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,000
No, not unless I have

293
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,534
The security override.

294
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,701
We don't have access
to that information.

295
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:37,267
Without it, this technology's
useless to us!

296
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:40,701
We'll have to find someone
who has the necessary expertise.

297
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:59,154
--LITTLE
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

298
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,487
Noah's waiting for me
to get back.

299
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:20,953
(shower running)

300
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,154
* *

301
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,554
(cell phone ringing)

302
00:13:58,621 --> 00:13:59,587
Yes?

303
00:13:59,654 --> 00:14:01,020
We're all set.

304
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,454
And the girl doesn't know
you're working for us?

305
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,854
Not a clue.

306
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,687
Good.

307
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:12,154
Morris.

308
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,287
Yeah?

309
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:16,387
I saw you arguing with Nadia.

310
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:18,421
Yeah.

311
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,953
Was it about us?

312
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,053
I asked for a transfer.

313
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,421
It was denied.

314
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:31,920
Why did you do that?

315
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:35,421
Because working with you

316
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:38,087
is becoming very uncomfortable.

317
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,587
I told you I was sorry.

318
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,621
You said I should stop
helping terrorists

319
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,387
arm nuclear bombs.

320
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:55,254
We've both said things
that we haven't mean before.

321
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:58,821
Yeah, I know.

322
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,587
But...

323
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:04,587
there's a line,
darling, and...

324
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,788
and you crossed it.

325
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,254
So what are you saying?

326
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,521
I'm saying that...

327
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:15,821
it's over.

328
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,721
There's no going back.

329
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:22,020
We're done.

330
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:28,587
Morris.

331
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:30,788
Look at me.

332
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:35,087
You don't have to do this.

333
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,987
We're done.

334
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,987
But, Morris...

335
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:01,154
(sniffles)

336
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,053
(sobbing quietly)

337
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:11,087
Nadia, the situation
has escalated with the Russians.

338
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,521
They know the Chinese
have the component,

339
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:15,087
and they're threatening
military action

340
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:17,354
unless we stop them from
taking it out of the country.

341
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:18,554
How did the
Russians find out?

342
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:19,587
A leak.

343
00:16:19,654 --> 00:16:21,487
Tom Lennox is
looking into it here,

344
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,821
and he wants you to start
an investigation there.

345
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,320
I'll let Internal
Affairs know right away.

346
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:27,187
Now, what about
Audrey Raines?

347
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,554
Has she provided any information
that will lead us to Cheng?

348
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:30,953
Not yet,
but the psychiatric specialist

349
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,087
from District has just arrived.

350
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,454
So we're hoping he
can get her to talk.

351
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:36,421
Do you have any other leads?

352
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:38,053
Not at the moment.

353
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
That's unfortunate.

354
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:41,687
I cannot emphasize enough

355
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:44,920
how important it is
that we stop Cheng.

356
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:48,120
If you need more resources,
you need to let me know now.

357
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:50,154
Do you understand?

358
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:54,987
I will.

359
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:57,020
One more thing.

360
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:01,120
To be honest, Karen,
what we need is Bill Buchanan.

361
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:04,487
But there's a rumor
flying around you fired him.

362
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:06,287
Well, that's complicated, Nadia.

363
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:08,487
Not as far as
we're concerned.

364
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:11,087
You know more than anyone
how good he is at this job.

365
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,854
I don't see how something
like this could happen

366
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,454
when we're in
the middle of a crisis.

367
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:17,387
Look, I'm not at liberty
to discuss this.

368
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:20,721
Just keep me updated with
your progress on finding Cheng.

369
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:26,488
Dr. Bradley. I'm Nadia Yassir,
acting head of CTU.

370
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:29,020
We're under a time crunch now,
so I'd like to get started

371
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,254
with Ms. Raines
immediately.
She's being prepped in medical.

372
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:32,987
These men can take you there.
I'll join you shortly.

373
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:35,187
Thank you.
I want to hear your first
impressions as soon as possible.

374
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,254
Of course.

375
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:39,787
Nadia, Doyle and Jack
just landed.

376
00:17:39,854 --> 00:17:40,920
Okay, have Doyle secure Bauer,

377
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:42,454
and then have him
meet me in medical.

378
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:46,521
Okay.

379
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:50,554
Can you leave us alone, please?

380
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,354
Thank you.

381
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,887
Ms. Raines.

382
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,354
Ms. Raines, I'm Dr. Bradley.

383
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:02,254
I'm here to perform a medical
evaluation to help you remember

384
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:04,521
whatever you can
about this man Cheng--

385
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:06,154
where you were held,
what you heard.

386
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:07,421
It's all right.

387
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:09,020
It's okay.

388
00:18:21,254 --> 00:18:22,820
Come here. Look at this.

389
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,787
Please, you've got
to let me talk to her.

390
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:30,288
You know CTU's protocol.

391
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:32,021
You know how they're
gonna interrogate her.

392
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,487
They're gonna make her retreat
farther inside herself.

393
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,054
Please,
listen to me!

394
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,154
Sit down.

395
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,720
This will make it
more comfortable.

396
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:48,754
Mike.

397
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,487
Please, I'm
begging you.

398
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:54,687
Take care of her.

399
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,854
Jack's in
holding three.

400
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,087
How you doing?

401
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,388
White House is pressuring us
to find Cheng.

402
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:18,654
We have to hope

403
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,054
he can get some information
out of her.

404
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:24,021
(knocking)

405
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:30,553
Dr. Bradley,
this is Agent Doyle.

406
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,420
He was involved in
rescuing Ms. Raines.

407
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:33,453
Do you have a diagnosis?

408
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,887
My preliminary
is she's

409
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:37,654
a type three catatonic, capable
of following simple commands

410
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,520
and repeating words and basic
phrases, but otherwise,

411
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:40,520
utterly unresponsive.

412
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:41,720
Do you think
that you'll be able

413
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:43,354
to get the information
we need from her?

414
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,720
Within your timeframe?
Not without intervention.

415
00:19:44,787 --> 00:19:46,820
What does that mean?

416
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,887
Ms. Raines is suffering from
severe psychological abuse,

417
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,654
amplified by pharmacological
agents, as evidenced by

418
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,820
more than 100 injection sites
on her arms, feet and groin.

419
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,021
It's gonna be next to
impossible to communicate

420
00:19:56,087 --> 00:19:57,354
with her in
the near term unless

421
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,054
we essentially attempt
to shock her out of this state.

422
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,553
So they used drugs
to torture her,

423
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,221
and you're gonna give her more?

424
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,487
These are different compounds,
sir, used for different reasons.

425
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:05,654
What are the risks?

426
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,854
22 percent of patients

427
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,354
experience
cardiovascular events,

428
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,954
some of it
neurological.

429
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,687
In the most extreme
cases, death can occur.

430
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:13,087
We can't do this.
No, Doyle.

431
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:14,388
I am not
comfortable with

432
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:16,321
the high percentage
of adverse reactions either.

433
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:18,054
But this treatment
is the only way

434
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:20,254
you're gonna get anything
out of her in the time you have.

435
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,420
Maybe not. One of our agents,

436
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,754
Jack Bauer, has a long
history with her,

437
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,887
and the Chinese put him
through something similar.

438
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:26,487
Listen, it makes sense
to see what Jack

439
00:20:26,553 --> 00:20:28,288
can draw from her before
we do anything riskier.

440
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:30,054
Doctor?

441
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:31,787
Yeah, I know who Jack Bauer is.

442
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:33,887
I read Ms. Raines' file
on the way over.

443
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,121
And in my opinion, contact
with him will more likely

444
00:20:36,187 --> 00:20:37,453
upset her than
encourage her to talk.

445
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,288
But there's no chance
of her dying from it.

446
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:41,121
Let's give Jack
a chance with her.

447
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:43,620
With all due respect,
it's not your call, Ms. Yassir.

448
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:45,954
District has formally placed
Ms. Raines in my custody

449
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:47,754
and granted me the authority to
determine appropriate treatment.

450
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,121
I'm gonna begin preparing
for her treatment shortly.

451
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,754
I'll let you know
what the results are.

452
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,987
Good day.

453
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:54,886
You can't let him do this,

454
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:56,516
not without even
giving Jack a...
He has jurisdiction.

455
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,149
The hell with
jurisdiction!
There's nothing I can do.

456
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,180
You can do
what you know is right.

457
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,208
That's what Buchanan
would have done.

458
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,006
And that was uncalled for.

459
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:07,503
Well, I'm sorry.

460
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,869
What I meant to say is,
since you're acting director,

461
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,333
you can't be afraid
to step on toes.

462
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:14,130
Does that go
down better?

463
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:15,628
And part of being
acting director

464
00:21:15,695 --> 00:21:17,526
is respecting
the chain of command.

465
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,654
But thank you for your advice.

466
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:42,296
--It's him.

467
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,258
(ringing continues)

468
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:47,891
Hi.

469
00:21:47,956 --> 00:21:49,687
Where are you?

470
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:51,852
I'm... on my way out the door.

471
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,550
Well, get here as
quickly as you can.

472
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:55,281
There's a crisis.

473
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,679
Has there been
another threat?

474
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:58,577
Yes, but not from
the terrorists.

475
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:00,208
I'll fill you in
when you get here.

476
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,807
I'll be there
in less than 15.

477
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:03,838
Lisa...

478
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,435
I need you.

479
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,464
I need you, too.

480
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:16,356
I have to go.

481
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:17,521
What's going on?

482
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,819
I don't know.

483
00:22:46,953 --> 00:22:48,552
Yes.

484
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:49,716
It's me.

485
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:50,948
What's my next move?

486
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,243
Thank you.
Yes.

487
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,271
I think I've identified
the leak, sir.

488
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,535
Is it here or at CTU?

489
00:23:02,601 --> 00:23:04,366
Oh, it's very much here, sir.

490
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,863
I had NSA run
a data sort

491
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,126
on all White House phone calls
and e-mails

492
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:11,425
over the last two
and half hours.

493
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,723
That's when we found out

494
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,919
the sub-circuit board was
in play.

495
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:16,285
And?

496
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:18,049
During the same time frame,

497
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,846
one of our staffers called
a lobbyist,

498
00:23:20,912 --> 00:23:23,043
Mark Bishop, three times.

499
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,540
Now, CIA had flagged
this Bishop two years ago

500
00:23:26,607 --> 00:23:28,804
as having
"possible to likely contact

501
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:30,135
with Russian Intelligee
agents."

502
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,031
No further investigation
was done

503
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:35,529
due to lack of resources.

504
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,725
Which staffer are we talking

505
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,190
about here, Tom?

506
00:23:40,256 --> 00:23:42,054
Lisa Miller, sir.

507
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:51,876
(scoffs)

508
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:53,508
I find it hard to believe

509
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,739
my Chief Aide is working
for the Russians.

510
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:58,001
I don't think she did
so knowingly, sir.

511
00:23:58,068 --> 00:23:59,999
She wouldn't have called Bishop
from her phone.

512
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:03,196
Then I... I don't understand--

513
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:05,194
how is this man getting
information from her?

514
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,759
Well, so far...

515
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:08,889
we have found
credit card records

516
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:13,018
that show Ms. Miller and Bishop
staying at the same hotels,

517
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:14,383
on the same nights,

518
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,847
several times
over the past year.

519
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,713
Now, I think if we dig
a little deeper,

520
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,743
I'm sure that we will
find more evidence

521
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,839
that shows these two were
sleeping together.

522
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,865
Then we have a bigger problem
than you think, Tom.

523
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,464
Why is that, sir?

524
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:35,291
Because I'm sleeping
with her, too.

525
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:44,348
She...

526
00:24:45,413 --> 00:24:47,511
She started working
for me

527
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:49,541
two years after my wife...

528
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:54,702
After Nancy

529
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,499
died, it...

530
00:24:57,565 --> 00:24:59,563
At that time I didn't think
I'd ever feel anything

531
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,194
for another woman again,
but...

532
00:25:01,261 --> 00:25:03,625
Lisa and I
became close,

533
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:05,722
then last year...

534
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:08,719
we were working
late one night, and...

535
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,612
Well, you understand
how these things happen, Tom.

536
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:19,839
Damn it.

537
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:22,768
What a fool I've been.

538
00:25:26,231 --> 00:25:28,828
What the hell do I do, Tom?

539
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:34,288
You know, actually, sir,

540
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:37,452
handled correctly,

541
00:25:37,518 --> 00:25:42,446
we may be able to turn this
situation to our advantage.

542
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,298
Mike, what's
happening out there?

543
00:25:54,365 --> 00:25:57,328
Will they let me
speak to Audrey?
I tried to make
it happen, Jack,

544
00:25:57,394 --> 00:25:59,359
but they're
not going for it.
Why not?

545
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:00,524
'Cause the shrink
who's treating her--

546
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:01,623
he doesn't think
it's a good idea.

547
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,621
Let me talk to him.
I wish

548
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:04,885
this guy was interested

549
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:06,450
in what other people had
to say, but he isn't.

550
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:08,215
Why?

551
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,777
He's got her
in medical, Jack,

552
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:14,107
and he's about to try
some protocol of his own

553
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:16,105
using big doses of drugs.

554
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:18,702
It could kill her, Jack.

555
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:21,033
Why did you uncuff me?

556
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:24,795
'Cause I think you need
to do something about it.

557
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:28,658
Make it look good.

558
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:41,442
Easy.

559
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,870
(grunts)

560
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,846
(grunts)

561
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:12,339
Vitals are strong.

562
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:13,505
I think she's ready.
Good.

563
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:14,703
Get her IV started.

564
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,624
Excuse me, sir,
you can't be in here.

565
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,322
Have you started
yet?
No.

566
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:28,553
What have you done to her?!

567
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:29,718
Nothing. Nothing.

568
00:27:29,785 --> 00:27:31,982
Consider yourself

569
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,215
lucky.

570
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:35,245
You're Jack Bauer,
I recognize you

571
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:37,143
from her file.
You shouldn't be here.

572
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,874
Seeing you will only
make things worse.

573
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:39,873
Shut up!

574
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,538
(breathing heavily)

575
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:42,869
Audrey, I need you
to come with me.

576
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:44,135
I need you to come
with me now.

577
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:46,165
Please, come on.

578
00:27:50,527 --> 00:27:52,358
(alarm blaring)

579
00:27:52,425 --> 00:27:54,556
Just get me anything you can.

580
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:56,387
(blaring continues)

581
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:58,051
Milo, what's the location
of that alarm?

582
00:27:58,118 --> 00:27:59,715
Clinic, Nadia,
exam room six,

583
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:00,881
where Audrey's
being treated.

584
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:02,081
Get me video feed.

585
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:07,840
She's gone.
Lock everything down.

586
00:28:07,907 --> 00:28:09,105
Get me holding room three!

587
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:11,800
If we just let Jack talk
to Audrey,

588
00:28:11,801 --> 00:28:13,120
none of this would
have happened.

589
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:31,639
--Okay, thank you.

590
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,070
Security's confirmed
that jack didn't pass

591
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,435
through any of the exits
before the lockdown.

592
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:35,468
He's still here
somewhere.

593
00:28:35,534 --> 00:28:36,899
No one left sectors
A through K

594
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,031
they're clear.
All right,

595
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:39,596
so he's got to be on
the lower levels.

596
00:28:39,663 --> 00:28:41,160
Have you checked
those video feeds?
Yes.

597
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:43,325
That's what I'm doing,
just takes a little bit of time.

598
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,790
I know, make it
take less time.

599
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:48,353
Where's Chloe?

600
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:50,616
Morris?

601
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:51,948
I don't... I'm not sure.

602
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:56,344
Doyle.

603
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:58,407
Have you found Jack?
No, not yet.

604
00:28:58,474 --> 00:29:00,238
But I'd like to know how
he managed to overpower you?

605
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,769
I made a mistake,
I got too close.

606
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:04,734
Yeah, see, I don't think
it was a mistake.

607
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,930
You made it very clear
that you wanted

608
00:29:06,997 --> 00:29:08,228
Jack to have a chance
with Audrey.

609
00:29:08,295 --> 00:29:09,461
So, I think you went there

610
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:11,625
with the express purpose
of letting him overpower you

611
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:13,589
and then escaping
with your keycard.

612
00:29:13,656 --> 00:29:17,118
I did what I think
is best for this operation

613
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:18,784
and for Audrey Raines.

614
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,312
I have him!

615
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:25,043
He's headed down
to the lower level.

616
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:26,107
But with everything locked down

617
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,972
he's only going to have access

618
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,238
to corridors L and M.

619
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:30,503
Okay, I'm on my way.

620
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,134
Let me know
if you find anything else.

621
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,232
And have Dr. Bradley
and Doyle meet me there.

622
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:38,660
Hold on.

623
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:41,256
Come on.

624
00:29:57,803 --> 00:29:59,735
(beeping)
(grunting)

625
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,026
It's all right.

626
00:30:07,093 --> 00:30:08,591
It's all right, I'm here.

627
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:09,922
I'm here.

628
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:11,853
I'm not going anywhere.

629
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,619
I'm going
to protect you.

630
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:15,049
I'm going
to take care of you.

631
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:17,181
I promise.

632
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,144
I know you can recognize me.

633
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,677
I see it in your eyes.

634
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:23,506
It's me, Jack.

635
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,071
The men who hurt you,

636
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:26,604
they can't touch you now.

637
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,168
I won't allow it.

638
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:31,364
Right now, I need you
to try and remember.

639
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:33,794
I need you to remember
who you are.

640
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,090
Your name is
Audrey Raines.

641
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:40,486
You were born Audrey Louise
Heller in Albany, New York.

642
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:44,582
Your father was the Secretary
of Defense, James Heller.

643
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,879
Your mother's name
was Alicia.

644
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,343
She died
when you were nine.

645
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:54,337
Please, Audrey,
just try and remember.

646
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:55,436
(computer beeps)

647
00:30:55,502 --> 00:30:56,833
Nadia, I've got Jack.

648
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,332
Room 237 was just sealed

649
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,531
from the inside.

650
00:30:59,598 --> 00:31:00,929
They have to be in there.

651
00:31:00,995 --> 00:31:02,227
I see the room now.

652
00:31:05,024 --> 00:31:07,055
Damn it. It's disabled.

653
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:09,143
Get an entry team
down here now.

654
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:10,978
Need an entry team
at door 237.

655
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:12,646
The men
that were holding you,

656
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:13,914
when they called me

657
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:15,716
there were within an hour
of my motel.

658
00:31:15,783 --> 00:31:17,751
When they moved you,

659
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:20,487
can you remember if,
if you took surface streets

660
00:31:20,554 --> 00:31:23,188
or the freeway, anything
that can help us find them?

661
00:31:24,857 --> 00:31:27,827
I want them to pay
for what they've done.

662
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:45,611
I know
what you've been through.

663
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:50,582
I know what it's like
to feel

664
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:52,583
like it's never going
to end...

665
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,086
to hate them that much,

666
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:58,656
and then need them...

667
00:31:58,723 --> 00:32:01,058
to start blaming
yourself

668
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:03,060
for everything
that's happening to you.

669
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:07,664
But they can't hurt you
anymore.

670
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:10,166
You don't need to hide now.

671
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:11,935
It's over.

672
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:16,573
Please, Audrey, give me
some kind of a signal.

673
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,608
Anything, anything
that let's me know

674
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,943
you understand
what I'm saying, please.

675
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,979
Please!

676
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:27,281
It's all right, I'm...

677
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:28,817
I'm sorry.

678
00:32:28,884 --> 00:32:31,152
It's all right.

679
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:33,187
I know you're trying.

680
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:38,826
I love you with all my heart.

681
00:32:52,506 --> 00:32:54,141
(sizzling)

682
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:01,048
I'm not going
to let them hurt you,

683
00:33:01,114 --> 00:33:02,082
but they're going
to take you away

684
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,215
from me
for a little while.

685
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,451
There's nothing I can do
to stop that.

686
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:06,686
Audrey, we're out of time.

687
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,121
Is there anything
that you can tell me

688
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:09,388
that could help us find Cheng

689
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,190
or at least
where they were holding you?

690
00:33:11,257 --> 00:33:12,825
Please.

691
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:16,996
Come here.

692
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,397
Come on.

693
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,365
Get down.

694
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,573
Jack, put your gun down.

695
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,874
You put your gun down!

696
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:31,542
Get him
out of here.

697
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,410
I'm not letting him take
Audrey back to medical.

698
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:35,412
Jack, you need
to lower your weapon.

699
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:39,150
Not until I get a guarantee
from you that Audrey is safe!

700
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:40,784
(quietly):
Bloomfield.

701
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:41,885
What'd you say?

702
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,421
Bloomfield.

703
00:33:44,488 --> 00:33:45,456
JACK:
Did you hear that?

704
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:46,490
She said

705
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,091
"Bloomfield."

706
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:50,059
I asked her where she was being
held; she's trying to answer.

707
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:51,494
We don't know
if that represents

708
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:52,729
genuine communication.

709
00:33:52,795 --> 00:33:54,664
"Bloomfield" could be
another programmed response

710
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:56,165
meaning nothing.

711
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:57,600
We'll soon find out.

712
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,634
Morris, did you get that?

713
00:33:58,701 --> 00:33:59,969
Bloomfield: have
Chloe track it down,

714
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:01,037
keep Doyle in the loop.

715
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:02,504
MORRIS:
All right.

716
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:03,740
In the meantime, Dr. Bradley,

717
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:05,640
I'd like you to wait
for me in my office.

718
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,476
I'm not going anywhere;
she's my patient.

719
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:09,011
And she's my witness.

720
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:13,849
I suggest you go
with these men, Doctor.

721
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:24,058
Listen to me, Jack.

722
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,327
You have my word, I will
not let him touch her.

723
00:34:28,361 --> 00:34:30,698
Please,

724
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,167
lower your weapon.

725
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:45,512
Audrey, please,
it's all right.

726
00:34:45,578 --> 00:34:47,546
He's going
to take care of you.

727
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,255
Jack, I need you to go with
these men to Holding.

728
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,156
--Yes, of course, General.

729
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:18,757
I'll review the report
with the Vice President.

730
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,659
I'll get right
back to you.

731
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,631
Suvarov wasn't bluffing.

732
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:27,999
No, sir.

733
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:30,635
Air Force satellites confirm
the Russian Army is moving

734
00:35:30,702 --> 00:35:33,338
large numbers of troops into
the Central Asian theater.

735
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:35,207
How long before they're
in range of our base?

736
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:36,808
They'll be within
strike range

737
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,242
within the hour, sir.

738
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:39,845
(door opens)

739
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,481
I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President,

740
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:45,381
I got back here
as soon as I could.

741
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,358
Forward General Wilkes' report
to the Joint Chiefs.

742
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:56,392
Let me know
their recommendations.

743
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:59,130
Yes, sir.

744
00:36:06,736 --> 00:36:08,404
(door closes)

745
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:09,572
What's going on?

746
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,341
Why is Tom talking
to the Joint Chiefs?

747
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:14,109
Because the Russians know
the Chinese have

748
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:16,611
the component.

749
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:18,113
How did that happen?

750
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,281
Someone inside the Beltway has
been selling them information.

751
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:23,252
Someone with access.

752
00:36:23,317 --> 00:36:25,254
A man named Mark Bishop.

753
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:27,288
Do you know him?

754
00:36:27,355 --> 00:36:29,457
I believe he's a lobbyist.

755
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:31,459
Are you sure it's Bishop?

756
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,828
Yes.

757
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:35,630
We began monitoring
his phone calls

758
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,598
as soon as this came
to our attention.

759
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:42,636
Ten minutes ago, he called

760
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:45,304
a known Russian Intelligence
agent from his cell phone.

761
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:48,008
BISHOP (over recorder):
It's me.

762
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:49,308
What's my next move?

763
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,844
MAN:
It's imperative you
reach out to her

764
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,012
over the next few hours.

765
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:53,046
Find out if there are

766
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:54,281
any developments
with the component.

767
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,848
BISHOP:
I'll call her

768
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:58,851
and I'll access her PDA again,
see if she has any new e-mail.

769
00:36:58,918 --> 00:36:59,885
MAN:
Very good.

770
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,395
So how well do you know
this man Bishop?

771
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,865
He's an acquaintance.

772
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,366
He consulted on a white paper
last year on defense spending.

773
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:17,869
Damn it, Lisa,
don't insult me

774
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,536
any more than you already have.

775
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:21,139
Bishop's been
passing intelligence

776
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:25,609
to the Russians that
he got from you.

777
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,012
I don't know if he
read your e-mails

778
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,581
or if you talked
about it in bed,

779
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,749
but the Russians know
about the component

780
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:34,918
and they're threatening
military action against us

781
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:38,555
if we don't get it
back from the Chinese.

782
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:41,390
I always knew you
were a good liar.

783
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:46,095
I just... I just didn't
think you could lie to me.

784
00:37:46,162 --> 00:37:48,698
I guess I thought

785
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,599
too highly of myself.

786
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,935
I swear to you, I didn't know.

787
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:54,971
It's still treason,

788
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:58,140
which I don't need to remind
you is a capital offense.

789
00:37:58,207 --> 00:38:00,343
You didn't just betray me,

790
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:02,510
you betrayed your country.

791
00:38:09,484 --> 00:38:11,886
What do you want from me?

792
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:14,221
You're going to go
back to your boyfriend

793
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:15,789
and you're going
to make him believe

794
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:18,092
that we have the component back.

795
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:21,095
I can't do that.

796
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:23,396
You can and you will
do exactly

797
00:38:23,463 --> 00:38:25,165
what Tom Lennox tells you to do.

798
00:38:25,232 --> 00:38:28,969
And don't you even think
about trying to expose our...

799
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:31,372
relationship.

800
00:38:31,437 --> 00:38:35,309
If you go there, I'll
have you declared

801
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:37,810
an enemy combatant.

802
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:40,178
Put you in solitary; it'll
be years before you speak

803
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:42,648
to anyone about anything.

804
00:38:46,385 --> 00:38:47,719
Noah...

805
00:38:58,263 --> 00:39:00,865
Are you all
right, sir?

806
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:02,767
I'm better now.

807
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,869
Secret Service is sending over
a team to work with her.

808
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:05,903
We'll get this going soon.

809
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:34,297
I've made arrangements
to take you away from here.

810
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:40,034
I'm going to look after you,
Audie, I promise.

811
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:41,035
You will get well

812
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:43,671
and you won't be alone.

813
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:57,018
I'll be right back, sweetheart.

814
00:40:05,193 --> 00:40:08,128
Before I take my daughter,
I'd like to see Jack Bauer.

815
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:09,196
Where is he?

816
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:10,830
He's in Holding, sir.

817
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:13,833
Escort Mr. Heller to Holding.

818
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:17,437
Nadia, hey, did Audrey speak
when he was with her?

819
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,905
No, I don't think so.

820
00:40:19,972 --> 00:40:22,575
Well, it turns out the name she
gave us might be a good lead.

821
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:24,276
There's a Bloomfield Copper
Company that used to have

822
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:26,544
a refining facility
in Jefferson Heights.

823
00:40:26,611 --> 00:40:27,612
Forensics just found

824
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,415
oxidized copper particles
on her clothing.

825
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:31,050
You think that's where
Cheng was holding her?

826
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:33,718
Yeah, I think it might be
his base of operations.

827
00:40:33,785 --> 00:40:35,388
LAPD's locking down
the building,

828
00:40:35,454 --> 00:40:37,788
but I told them to stand
down till I get there.

829
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,457
Good work, Mike.

830
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:41,426
Thanks.

831
00:40:41,493 --> 00:40:43,495
Mike.

832
00:40:46,597 --> 00:40:48,899
You were right.

833
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:50,768
I should have stood up
to Dr. Bradley.

834
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:56,340
You did.

835
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:59,743
When it counted,
you stood up to him.

836
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:29,171
Mr. Secretary.

837
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:31,540
You've seen Audrey.

838
00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:36,010
I made Audrey a promise,
I make the same promise to you.

839
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,912
I will take care of her
as long as it takes.

840
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:40,247
I will be there for her.

841
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:43,150
No, you won't, Jack.

842
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,852
Excuse me?

843
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:48,489
I don't want you to go
anywhere near my daughter

844
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:50,123
ever again.

845
00:41:51,724 --> 00:41:55,095
Audrey went looking for you
and this is how she came back.

846
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:58,398
What's happened
to her is your fault.

847
00:42:00,033 --> 00:42:03,601
I accept that responsibility,
but I can help her.

848
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:08,806
Stay away from her.

849
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:13,278
Mr. Secretary, earlier
I got through to Audrey.

850
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:14,712
I can do the same thing again.

851
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:16,315
I just need some time.
Please.

852
00:42:17,682 --> 00:42:20,918
I'm warning you.

853
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:23,821
Stay away.

854
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:33,029
You're cursed, Jack.

855
00:42:33,096 --> 00:42:35,732
Everything you touch,

856
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:39,635
one way or another,
ends up dead.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
