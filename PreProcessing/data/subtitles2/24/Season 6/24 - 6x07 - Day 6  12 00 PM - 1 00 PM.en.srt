4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,800
Previously on 24

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,300
I need karen hayes to go away.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,400
I understand,sir.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,200
I need the president to sign off on my proposals.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,200
She's gone from being an irritant to an obstacle.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,100
I want to talk about your husband's incompetence,

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,400
and your covering it up.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,100
I did nothing illegal or incorrect.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,900
Your resignation within the hour.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,300
Mr.President,I am tendering my resignation.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,500
Is there anything I can do to change your mind?

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,200
No,sir,there is not.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,500
Walid has earned their trust.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,500
These men know something  about
the bombs that we don'T.

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,500
I don't think these guys you're tracking
are connected to anyone.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,700
They're not terrorists.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm getting walid the hell out of there.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,400
You spied on us?

22
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,600
You're worse than they are!

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,100
Son of a bitch!

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,800
a nuclear bomb just went off,like,
25  miles from here.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,800
When I'm done with this deal,

26
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,900
I may just buy you a small country.

27
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,200
Have you found an engineer?

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I told you I'd find someone and I will.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,900
It's just taking longer.

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
start talking,gray!

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,800
I made a mess.

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,500
Dad's trying to clean it up.

33
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,300
What happened?

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,500
I hired mccarthy to oversee the job,but...

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
so the nukes that these terrorist
are in possession of,

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,900
including the one that was just
detonated in valencia,

37
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,300
was supplied by mccarthy and stolen from you.

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Yes.

39
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm heading to mccarthy's office in simi valley.

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
We have teams standing by.

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Let me know.

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Stop.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He's my son.

44
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,700
What are you doing here,jack?

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,600
Jack: I know what you're trying to cover up,dad.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,000
Gray already told me.

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,900
Mccarthy's not here.

48
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,300
Hey,what are you doing?

49
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,300
Put the gun down!

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,700
You work for me.

51
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,300
No,dad,he doesn'T.

52
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,600
You don't think I'd let you run loose without
keeping an eye on you,do you?

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,000
This is insane.

54
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,800
********

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I am at the edge of the safe zone.

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Behind me is the nuclear blast.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,200
Emergency medical teams are being
overwhelmed by the number of injured.

58
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,100
In what president palmer has confirmed was

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,300
a tactical nuclear weapon detonated
just a little over two hours ago

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
in this valencia neighborhood
north of los angeles,

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,900
more than 12,000 people are
estimated to have perished in the blast.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,100
Lapd is spread thin,but on an encouraging note,

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
we've heard that they are receiving a flood...

64
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,500
I just heard about karen's resignation.

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,900
I'm sorry for the loss.

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,500
Are you really sorry,tom?

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Because your words seemed somewhat hollow to me.

68
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,500
It's no secret karen and i butted
heads the last few weeks.

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,800
Nevertheless,I respected her as an adversary.

70
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,700
She never gave me a concrete
reason why she resigned,

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,000
but there was something...

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,700
something she wasn't telling me.

73
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
This may have something to do with it.

74
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,500
This is a draft of the executive order
I presented this morning.

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,900
Karen found out I was going to resubmit
it to you for your authorization.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,100
And so she quit?

77
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,900
That makes absolutely no sense to me,tom.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
She's never been afraid of a fight.

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,400
maybe she finally realized her
arguments are invalid and that

80
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,000
this is the only possible response
to the danger we're facing.

81
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,600
You want to tell me why I would sign off on
something that I rejected six hours ago?

82
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,300
Because,sir,six hours ago,

83
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,900
we didn't know fayed had nukes.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Even so,tom,you're talking
about suspending habeas corpus,

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,900
extending the length and broadening
the criteria for those detention centers.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,500
Those actions will constitute a
brazen abuse of executive power.

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Those actions will degrade fayed's network,

88
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,600
limiting his ability to make use of
these remaining nuclear weapons.

89
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,600
Sir,fayed's sole intention here is the
destruction of our country,

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,000
its infrastructure,social order,

91
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,300
entire way of life,and he's got the will
and means to make good on that threat.

92
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,800
Tom,have you stopped to think about the fact I
would be forcing the people who elected me

93
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,300
to give up the rights and freedoms that
define the essence of this country?

94
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,700
Sir,if one more nuke goes off,

95
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
it would have been fayed who's
redefined our country.

96
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,100
Pass this out to the cabinet.

97
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,100
We'll convene in 30 minutes.

98
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,300
You're doing the right thing,mr.President.

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
Reed.

100
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,300
Call the cabinet in for an emergency session.

101
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Tell general white we're ramping up.

102
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,000
Does that mean the president
is signing off on this?

103
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,400
He wouldn't convene the cabinet unless he was.

104
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,700
Good work,reed.

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,600
Well,I'm just doing what needs to be done,sir.

106
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Getting rid of karen is distinctly unpleasant,

107
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
but she left us no choicE.

108
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,500
hayes.

109
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,000
Girl,I'm sorry I'm late with the briefing.

110
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,300
Tell the president we're still tracking
fayed through mccarthy.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,300
Bill,I've just had to resign.

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000
Resign?What are you talking about?

113
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,700
Can't get into it right now,

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,700
but I've asked to be reassigned to
cut as an on-site liaison.

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,300
Karen,you can't leave the
president today, of all days.

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Bill,do you think that I would do
this if I had any other choice?

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Lennox has something to do with this,doesn't he?

118
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,200
I cannot talk about this right now.

119
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
I will see you in a few hours.Okay?

120
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,200
Karen?

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,700
mr.Buchanan.

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,900
What is it,chloe?

123
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
I've been trying to reach jack on his cell phone;

124
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,400
he's not answering.

125
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Try his backup teams.

126
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,200
I tried; they're not answering either.

127
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Maybe he had them all go dark.

128
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
He wouldn't do that without telling us first.

129
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,800
Send in the support units,see
if they can get a visual.

130
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,400
All right.

131
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
And keep trying jack.

132
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,100
******

133
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,900
So after we're done,where do
you want us to meet you?

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
I'll be here another hour dumping hard drives.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,700
We'll meet you back at the house,then.

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,000
Just make sure it goes exactly according to plan.

137
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,200
Don't worry.

138
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,400
It's my job to worry.

139
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
it was all for you,jack.

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,300
Everything I worked for,everything I built--

141
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,700
it was all for you.

142
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,800
After you left,I tried to convince myself that
graem was capable of heading the family...

143
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,800
protecting the company

144
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,600
I guess,

145
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,900
on some level,I always knew the truth about him.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
I just wasn't willing to admit it to myself.

147
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
I don't know what you want me to say.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,700
I want you to understand that

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,700
after you left,graem was all I had.

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,100
I pushed you away,didn't I?

151
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,700
I'm really sorry.

152
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,700
get out.

153
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,700
Come on.

154
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,300
Don't do this,sir.

155
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,100
Whatever graem's paying you,I'll double it.

156
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,200
Just keep it moving.

157
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,500
Get down on your knees,both of you.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,800
No.

159
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
You son of a bitch.

160
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,300
At least have the guts to look me in the eye.

161
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,900
I needed to question him.

162
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,300
They were gonna kill us,jack.

163
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Search his pockets for the keys.

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,300
Damn it!

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,600
*****

166
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Bill,it's jack.

167
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,700
Jack,we haven't been able to reach you.

168
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,500
Are you all right?

169
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,800
Yeah,I'm fine,but all the members of
the backup team have been killed.

170
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Have you found mccarthy?

171
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,300
Not yet,but I know how to get to hiM.

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,900
How?

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,100
My brother.

174
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,900
You said your brother wasn't involved
when mccarthy brokered the nukes.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,100
He lied to mE.

176
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
He didn't tell us everything.

177
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Based on what?

178
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
He just tried to have me and my father killed.

179
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,300
Bill,I need you to set up a perimeter
around his house.

180
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,700
I'll send a field team right away.

181
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,400
Have them do an immediate recon,
confirm that he's there.

182
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,300
I want burke standing by with
an interrogation kit.

183
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,000
Jack.

184
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,600
What?

185
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,400
As it stands now,mccarthy is
our only lead to fayed.

186
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,100
We need to find fayed before he arms the nukes.

187
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,700
I'll get back to you as soon as I make
contact with the field team.

188
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,600
We need to go.

189
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,800
rita.

190
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Where do you think you're going?

191
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm hungry.

192
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,300
There's a candy machine in the lobby.

193
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
Don't worry.We'll be leaving soon.

194
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
You said that an our ago.

195
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,600
Sit down,rita.

196
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,400
Yes?

197
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Good news.

198
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,300
I found someone to program the
trigger codes for your bombs.

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,300
Who?

200
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I've just you sent his profile,

201
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,400
employment record,education,
the whole curriculum vitae.

202
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,900
You should have it on your screen.

203
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm looking at it now.

204
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,000
He seems qualified.

205
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,700
Oh,he'll get the job done,

206
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
but he won't work willingly.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,500
He'll need to be coerced.

208
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Okay,when will you have him?

209
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,100
Within the hour.

210
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
Call me when you do.

211
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
mr.Buchanan,

212
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,400
you need to listen to this.

213
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,000
What?

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,700
Nsa intercepted a stream of chatter--

215
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,700
part of it's an audio recording.

216
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,100
They've identified one of the voices
as belonging to fayed.

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Let's hear it.

218
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,700
Good news.

219
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,400
I found someone to program
the trigger codes on your bombs.

220
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,400
Who?

221
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,200
I've just sent you his profile,

222
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,100
employment record,education,
the whole curriculum vitae.

223
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,100
It should be on your screen.

224
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,900
I'm looking at it now.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He seems qualified.

226
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,300
he'll get the job done,

227
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,700
but he won't work willingly.

228
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,900
He'll need to be coerced.

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
Okay,when will you have him?

230
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,000
Within the hour.

231
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,400
Call me when you do.

232
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,200
Second voice matches the sample
we pulled off mccarthy's voice-mail.

233
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,000
They lost numair in the explosion,

234
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,700
so mccarthy found someone else to arm the nukes.

235
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,400
Send the file to audio forensics.

236
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,200
Have them scan for any background
artifacts that could give us a location.

237
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,500
Yes,sir.

238
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,100
I had morris working on something,too.

239
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,700
We also found an image file
inside the data stream.

240
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Nsa thinks it might be a photo of the engineer.

241
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Is this it?

242
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Yeah,it got all corrupted during the intercept.

243
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm writing a salvage utility.

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,900
I should have a new code in a second.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,300
Getting an image of the engineer may be our
only way of stopping those nukes.

246
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Give me an estimate.

247
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,400
Well,that's hard to say.

248
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
Could be ten minutes,it could be an hour.

249
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,700
********

250
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,900
Who's the agent in charge?

251
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,600
My name is jack bauer.

252
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,300
Mr.Bauer,I'm hal turner.

253
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,300
I'll be on point.

254
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Are your men in position?

255
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:50,800
Yes,sir.

256
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,200
We've sealed off a one-block radius,

257
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,700
and our recon has confirmed
your brother's inside--

258
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,500
his wife and son are in there as well.

259
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
I want you to inform your team
to use nonlethal force.

260
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,100
We need to take my brother alive.

261
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Understood.

262
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,000
Let me go in with you.

263
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,700
No.

264
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
You wait here.

265
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,000
I need to question graem alone.

266
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,900
What are you gonna do to him?

267
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Whatever it takes to find out what he knows.

268
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,900
I'm not stupid,graem--

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,200
I know something is wrong.

270
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,800
Everything's fine,marilyn.

271
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,700
You're a lousy liar.

272
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,700
You always have been.

273
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,700
You know,if you insist on being here,

274
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,600
why don't you make some coffee?

275
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,000
Why don't you make your own coffee!

276
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,900
Will you two stop fighting?

277
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,700
That's all you guys ever do is fight.

278
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
I'm sorry,honey.

279
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,000
We're just all a little tense today.

280
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
What's going on?

281
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,900
Nothing.

282
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,000
Nothing.Why don't,

283
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,700
why don't we leave your father alone.

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,400
He needs to work.

285
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,500
put the weapon down!

286
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
Drop the gun!

287
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,700
What the hell is this,jack?!

288
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,100
Put it down!

289
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,600
Do it.

290
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,300
Get on the floor!

291
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,300
Take it easy,jack!

292
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I want you take him into the next room,

293
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,000
have burke prep him for questioning.

294
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,000
I want every hard drive,

295
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,100
every memory stick in this house
uploaded and sent over to ctu.

296
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,700
Pick him up.

297
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,800
Go.Go.

298
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,500
What are you doing to my dad?

299
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,000
Josh,I'll explain as soon as I can,

300
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,600
but right now I need to speak to your mother.

301
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Please,just take a seat.

302
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
Please,son,come on.

303
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,900
Let's go.

304
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,100
Let go of me!

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
stop looking at me like this has
something to do with us,

306
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,400
because it doesn'T.

307
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,000
Graem just tried to have me and our father killed.

308
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,000
Why?

309
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,600
Why would he try and kill you?

310
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,800
They nuclear bomb that was
detonated earlier today--

311
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,700
the terrorists acquired it
from the family's company!

312
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,700
Gray's been trying to cover it up.

313
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry,marilyn.

314
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
I understand how difficult this
must be for you to believe.

315
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
It's not.

316
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,800
I may not know the details of what he's done,

317
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,000
but I know what he's capable of.

318
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,500
There are four more other bombs out there.

319
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,300
We need to get them back--

320
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
is there anything that you can tell me?

321
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,100
Like what?

322
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,400
Did gray talk about a man named mccarthy?

323
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,300
No.

324
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,500
Are you sure?

325
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,900
He hasn't confided in me in years.

326
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,200
He probably never did.

327
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,000
Marilyn,thousands of lives are at stake.

328
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,200
Please,just think.

329
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,900
I wish I knew something,I really wish I did,

330
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,700
but I don't know anything.

331
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,600
And josh doesn't know anything,either,

332
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,900
and he doesn't need to know.

333
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,400
I'll do everything I can to protect him.

334
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,400
No!

335
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,900
I've seen what happens when
you try and protect people.

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,500
I just want to get my son,

337
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,400
and I want to get out of here!

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,800
Marilyn...

339
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
sir,we found two computers,
both linked to one network.

340
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,300
He was trying to erase files--

341
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,900
we're sending what's left over to ctu.

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,100
Okay,good.

343
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,000
My sister-in-law and my nephew
don't need to stay here.

344
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Have them transported back to ctu.

345
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,700
They can be debriefed there.

346
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Yes,sir.

347
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,000
Mrs.Bauer.

348
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,400
We're taking you and your son back to ctu.

349
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,100
Josh?

350
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Grandpa.

351
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,800
You okay?

352
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Not really.

353
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Wait in the car,baby.

354
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,300
Jack told me what graem did,

355
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,200
what he was involved with.

356
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,700
Is it true?

357
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,000
It's complicated.

358
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,200
But it's true.

359
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,100
You make sure he keeps josh out of this.

360
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,100
I panicked,jack.

361
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,100
That's all there is to it.

362
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
You panicked?

363
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,900
That's your excuse?

364
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,200
You panicked?!

365
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
You tried to kill me and our father.

366
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,200
I was backed into a corner.

367
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
I was just protecting my ass.

368
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,700
You knew about a tactical nuclear
weapon on american soil.

369
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,900
You are responsible for the death of
thousands and thousands of people.

370
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,700
You think I really wanted
that bomb to go off,jack?

371
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,600
I think you knew more about
mccarthy than you told me.

372
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,900
How do i find him?

373
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't have a clue.

374
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,500
How do i find him?!

375
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,900
I just told you I don't know.

376
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,300
There are four more bombs out there.

377
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,300
This isn't a joke,gray.

378
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,300
Tell me now,how do I find mccarthy?

379
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,200
I told you everything I know,jack.

380
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,800
respiration and temperature patterns indicate
deception,especially his last reply.

381
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Set up the interrogation package.

382
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,300
You don't want to make me do this,gray.

383
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,400
We grew up together,jack.

384
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
In all those years,I could never make you
do anything you didn't want to do.

385
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
I need to talk to you.

386
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,400
What is it?

387
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,300
Over here.

388
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,100
It's morris's brother.

389
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Timothy?

390
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,600
He's on his way to horizon regional hospital.

391
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,000
On-site paramedics confirmed he
has severe radiation exposure.

392
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,100
It says he's in critical condition.

393
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,300
I'll tell him.

394
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,700
Wait,chloe.

395
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,000
I think we should hold off.

396
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,100
Why?

397
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,700
Morris is the best hope we have
for restoring that file.

398
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
If we drop this on him now,

399
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,300
he might completely shut down.

400
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,300
It's his brother-- we can't keep it a secret.

401
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
I understand.

402
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,000
This might sound insensitive,but for a second,

403
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,100
put aside your personal feelings for
morris and consider what's at stake.

404
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
We need him to finish
writing that salvage utility.

405
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,100
I know morris; he can handle it.

406
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,500
I hope so.

407
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,000
Morris?

408
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Yes,darling?

409
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
I have some bad news.

410
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,400
It's about timothy--

411
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,400
he's been taken to the hospital.

412
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,900
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Well,this can't be right--

414
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,000
it says he was pulled...

415
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,800
from his car by rescue workers
just north of valencia.

416
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,900
Operator.

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,500
Yes,could you connect me with horizon
regional hospital,please?

418
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,800
-******* -What was he doing in valencia?

419
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,700
I'm sorry,sir,all circuits are busy.

420
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Yes,I realize that the lines are busy--

421
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,000
this is ctu,los angeles,calling--

422
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,200
I need an emergency breakthrough.

423
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,700
- I cannot help you at this time,sir.
- I know...

424
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Sorry.

425
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,000
I-I have to go out there.

426
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,600
Morris,hey,

427
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,800
I know it's hard,okay?

428
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,400
But we are in the middle of a crisis.

429
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,300
We need to find the engineer before fayed does.

430
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,500
You can't just leave.

431
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,400
You can't expect me to sit there when my
little brother is dying in the hospital.

432
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,700
I'm sorry,milo.

433
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,900
Morris...

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,100
listen.

435
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,100
12,000 people are dead.

436
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,000
If fayed finds an engineer,
it'll be many,many more.

437
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Four bombs is about a million people.

438
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,600
Think about this.

439
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
You can finish writing the program--

440
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,300
you can do it.

441
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,800
Yes,I can-- but you started already.

442
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,400
It will take me half an hour to
figure out what you've done.

443
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,900
You need to stay here and do your job.

444
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,800
Please.

445
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Okay.

446
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,800
Thanks.

447
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,800
Buchanan.

448
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,100
Bill,it's jack.

449
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,800
Did chloe pull anything off the hard drives?

450
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,300
No,she came up empty.

451
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,500
But 15 minutes ago,the nsa picked up a
conversation between mccarthy and fayed.

452
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,700
*******Mccarthy's found another engineer
to arm the four remaining nukes.

453
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
He's delivering the engineer within the hour.

454
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
The nukes could be operational within 45 minutes?

455
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,200
That's right.

456
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,600
I'll get back to you.

457
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,500
Ctu just confirmed that mccarthy is
looking for an engineer for fayed.

458
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
They're gonna arm the nukes.

459
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,800
Then you're wasting time talking to me,jack.

460
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,800
You're holding something back.

461
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,900
That machine doesn't lie.

462
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,500
Then it must be broken because
I've told you everything I know.

463
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,900
That's hyocine-pentothal.

464
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,300
It's a neuro-inflamatory,designed to induce pain.

465
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,000
All you have to do to stop me from
using it is tell me how to find mccarthy.

466
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,900
Your guess is as good as mine.

467
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,800
Two cc'S.

468
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,700
come on,come on.

469
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,600
I can take this to seven cc'S.

470
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,200
You will experience pain I can't even describe.

471
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,100
At eight cc's,I run the risk of
inducing a heart attack.

472
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,100
Gray...

473
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,300
make no mistake about it,
I will go there if I have to.

474
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,800
Please,just tell me what I need to know.

475
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,000
Please.

476
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,400
I don't want to hurt you.

477
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
You sure about that,jack?

478
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,600
Please,gray,just tell me what I need to know.

479
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,100
How do I find mccarthy?!

480
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,100
Do it.

481
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,200
Two cc'S.

482
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,400
breathe.

483
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,600
Just breathe.

484
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
Just breathe.

485
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,900
Please...

486
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,500
just tell me what I need to know.

487
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,800
How do I find mccarthy?!

488
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,500
Damn you.

489
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Four cc'S.

490
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,300
That's eight cc's total,jack.

491
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,800
His vitals are spiking across the line.

492
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,700
Four cc's!

493
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,100
Jack,don'T.

494
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,400
The machine knows you're lying!

495
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,000
I know you're lying!

496
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,300
Tell me the truth!

497
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,700
it has nothing to do with mccarthy.

498
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,200
it has to do with palmer.

499
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,200
David palmer?

500
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,300
Yes.

501
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,700
I gave the order for his assassination.

502
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,100
And agent tony almeida...

503
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
and agent michelle dessler--

504
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,200
your co-workers--

505
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,300
they're all dead because of me.

506
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,300
I arranged everything.

507
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,500
I set the timetable,

508
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,700
I paid off the killers,

509
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,100
I even lured you out of hiding to take the fall.

510
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,000
Today wasn't the first time
I tried to have you killed,jack.

511
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Why?

512
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,700
Because I love my country!

513
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,300
And in the real world,

514
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,400
sometimes that means you have
to do things,terrible things...

515
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,300
even unforgivable things,
for the sake of your country.

516
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,500
But you know all about that,don't you,brother?

517
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,500
We're the same.

518
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,900
I mean,look at me.

519
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,400
We're the same!

520
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,000
We are not the same!

521
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,400
You want me to kill you?!

522
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,000
Do it!

523
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
I'm gonna do it my way!

524
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,400
Four more cc'S.

525
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,200
I can't do that.

526
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,700
Pick up the syringe!

527
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,700
Do it!

528
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Now!

529
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,200
Son of a bitch!

530
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,100
-******** -Get me somebody in here now.

531
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,400
You want to die?

532
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,200
Drop your weapon!

533
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Drop it!

534
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,800
You're gonna die.

535
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,600
Shut down the iv.

536
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Shut it down.

537
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,300
I'm here,baby.

538
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,600
I'm ashamed.

539
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
What do you mean you're ashamed?

540
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,500
For spying on those men.

541
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,500
I thought I was doing the right thing.

542
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,400
I was wrong.

543
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
You did the only thing that you could do...

544
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,900
okay,and that was the right thing.

545
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,600
you're the bravest,most principled
man I've ever known.

546
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,800
you get some rest,okay?

547
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,300
hello?

548
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,600
Sandra?

549
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
It's wayne.

550
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,400
I just heard what happened to walid.

551
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,200
I am so sorry.

552
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,700
Is he going to be all right?

553
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Yeah,I think so.

554
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,200
What they told me is confusing.

555
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,600
They said walid was working undercover
to expose some plot.

556
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,500
There was no plot.

557
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,900
The men weren't part of any conspiracy.

558
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,800
They were just bystanders.

559
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,900
They tell me these men had information
about the nuclear weapons.

560
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,500
One of the men pulled it from the internet
and showed it to his friends.

561
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
Sandra,they should've reported that.

562
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,100
They were afraid they were going to get into
more trouble than they're already in.

563
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:18,500
Most of these men were pulled from their jobs and
their homes on trumped-up immigration charges.

564
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,800
And now they're facing deportation.

565
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:26,600
Wayne,you are detaining without due process
the people whose help you need the most.

566
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,100
How do you expect for them to help
if they don't have any legal protection?

567
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Wayne...

568
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,700
I'm scared.

569
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
I know.

570
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,600
Everything's gonna be all right.

571
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
What's the status?

572
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,800
Program's finished.

573
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,400
I just ran it,but this is all we got.

574
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,300
I still don't have a clear image.

575
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,400
what are you doing?

576
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm downloading an unlicensed
application from a hacker's site.

577
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,100
It might kick-start things.

578
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
Or it could corrupt the file.

579
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,900
I know these guys.

580
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,200
They write really good code when
they're not serving time.

581
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,300
Unbelievable.

582
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,100
That's what graem was holding back?

583
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,900
Not only was he responsible for
david palmer's assassination,

584
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
but he directed the entire conspiracy.

585
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,400
He was trying to protect the company.

586
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,300
That's what he's trying to do now.

587
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Incredible.

588
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,100
I wish it got us closer to
the nukes,but it doesn'T.

589
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,700
He doesn't know where mccarthy is.

590
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,900
Were you able to pick up anything on nsa chatter?

591
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,400
We think it may contain an
image of mccarthy's engineer.

592
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,600
How long till you know for sure?

593
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,400
Can't say.The file's badly corrupted.

594
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,800
Morris is working on it now.

595
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,200
As soon as my brother's ready for transport,

596
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,400
I want him sent back to ctu
for further debriefing.

597
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,400
I've redirected a chopper to jackson
middle school,

598
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,200
four miles west of your position.

599
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,400
Thanks,bill.

600
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,000
Dad,graem made his own choices after
you let him start running the company.

601
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,200
You can't make yourself responsible for that.

602
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,600
That's not fair.

603
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,500
I'll tell you what isn't fair.

604
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,500
You deserved a better family,jack.

605
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Not this.

606
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,700
Not us.

607
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,100
I can just imagine what you must be feeling.

608
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
All that time we lost...

609
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,200
what I wouldn't give to have some of it back.

610
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,500
Me,too.

611
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:04,800
Agent bauer.

612
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,300
Yeah.

613
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,200
Your brother's been stabilized.

614
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,100
He'll be ready to move in ten minutes.

615
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,100
Thank you.

616
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,600
Dad,i want you to go back to ctu.

617
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Okay.

618
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,000
I need a few minutes.

619
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,500
Of coursE.

620
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,600
They're sending a chopper for me.

621
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,300
I have to go.

622
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,050
there.

623
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,850
What?

624
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,850
The plug-in's working.

625
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,250
How long's it going to take?

626
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:13,950
It's restoring.

627
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,750
You'll have a photo of the
engineer in two minutes.

628
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,850
Just don't touch anything.

629
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,250
Now I have got to go and find out
what's happening with my brother.

630
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,650
Save it,milo.

631
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,050
Thanks for trying to help.

632
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,950
I'm leaving.

633
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,150
Watch my station,okay?

634
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,650
Be careful.

635
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,050
Call me when you find anything out about timothy.

636
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,250
I will.

637
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,150
Congratulations,tom.

638
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,850
It's an excellent plan.

639
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,550
Well,thank you very much,mr.Vice president.

640
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,850
It's about time someone in this administration
stood up to these people.

641
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,050
To be honest,

642
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,750
I didn't think this president had
the stomach for the cure.

643
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,850
I think we're about ready for kickoff here,sir.

644
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,550
I'm going to put you on speakerphone.

645
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,050
Is the vice president with us?

646
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,750
I'm on the plane,sir.

647
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,950
I'm assuming everyone here has
read executive order 1066?

648
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,750
Tom first proposed his plan to me very
early this morning,and I rejected it.

649
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:20,150
Sacrificing the rights and freedoms guaranteed
by the constitution seemed like,

650
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,650
like too steep a price,
even for the promise of securitY.

651
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:31,550
But then fayed murdered 12,000
innocent americans with a nuclear weapon.

652
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,150
I felt compelled to revisit my earlier position.

653
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,950
After careful reconsideration,

654
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,350
I remain convinced that my initial
response was in fact the right one.

655
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,850
That implementing this plan--

656
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,950
would be a terrible mistake.

657
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,750
I cannot and I will not endorse these actions.

658
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,850
Some of you actually seem to feel

659
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,850
that the constitution is somehow
valid only during times of peace,

660
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,950
but not during wartime.

661
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,050
That is not what the founders intended.

662
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,950
With your indulgence,sir,

663
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:17,350
george washington's enemies wore bright
red coats and marched in a straight line.

664
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,150
The founders could have never
conceived of a stateless enemy,

665
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,650
hiding among us,that targets not our soldiers,

666
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,150
but our civilization.

667
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,250
Your plan would only hinder the efforts
of law enforcement to stop fayed.

668
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,750
How does my plan hinder law enforcement,sir?

669
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:40,250
By marginalizing and thereby radicalizing the
very people whose help they need to enlist.

670
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,350
The american muslim community is our best
line of defense against these terrorists.

671
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:55,850
But we americans need to demonstrate that
we are governed by the rule of law and never,

672
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,150
never by the politics of fear.

673
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,150
Mr.President.

674
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,750
Yes,noah?

675
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,250
Before you make any unilateral decisions,

676
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,550
maybe you should hear some
other people's thoughts.

677
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,950
I'm sorry,noah.

678
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,250
The discussion on this matter...

679
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,950
is over.

680
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,150
This better work.

681
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,650
Jack's on his way back to ctu.

682
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,650
I want holding "a" and "b" prepped
for interrogation

683
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,050
and put together a clearance package
for him,no restrictions.

684
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,150
Yes,sir.

685
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,150
We have it yet?

686
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,050
It's gonna be a few more seconds.

687
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,550
As soon as we I.D.The engineer,

688
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,250
I want it posted on the interagency subnet.

689
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,150
We need all eyes possible on this.

690
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,250
Yes,sir.

691
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,150
Oh,my god!

692
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,350
It's morris!

693
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,950
It's his cv,personal history,everything.

694
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,950
Where is he?

695
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,650
On his way to horizon regional hospital.

696
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,250
We got to call that.

697
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,550
His brother was hurt in the blast.

698
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,850
He just left.

699
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:52,850
Security.

700
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,550
This is bill bhanan.

701
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:56,150
Has morris o'brian left the parking lot?

702
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,650
He just drove out,sir.

703
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,450
Damn it!

704
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,550
Milo,contact lapd.

705
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,950
Put an apb out on his car.

706
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,850
Chloe,see if you can raise him on his cell phone.

707
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,250
Bauer.

708
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,950
Jack,we just id'ed the engineer.

709
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,350
It's morris o'brian.

710
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,050
Morris?

711
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,850
Yes.

712
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,050
The file we intercepted was morris's photo and cv.

713
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,750
Mccarthy was sending it to fayed.

714
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,950
There is no doubt morris is the engineer.

715
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,150
Fine.Put him under a protective watch.

716
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,050
We can'T.

717
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,050
He's gone.

718
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,450
He got a call claiming his brother
was in the hospital.

719
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,550
He just left.

720
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,750
We're trying to raise him on his cell.

721
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,050
Morris,hold on.

722
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,150
He's on line one.

723
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,050
We got him,jack.

724
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,150
Patch me through.

725
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,950
Morris,it's bill buchanan.

726
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,250
We're on the line with jack bauer.

727
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:36,850
Where are you?

728
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,450
I'm on my way to the hospital.

729
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,450
You need to come back to ctu immediately.

730
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,550
I can't do that.

731
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,550
Morris,this is jack.

732
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,150
Listen to me.

733
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,350
There is nothing wrong with your brother.

734
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,350
It's a setup.

735
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,750
The engineer mccarthy's looking for,it's you.

736
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:48,850
Me?

737
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,350
It was your photo mccarthy was sending to fayed.

738
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,150
Morris,you need to turn the car around now.

739
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,850
Okay,okay.

740
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,550
Morris!

741
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,850
Get out of the car or the next one's in your head!

742
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,650
What the bloody hell do you want?

743
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,050
Don't talk,move!

744
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,450
Come on.Let's go.

745
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:08,750
Jack,they got him!

746
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,850
It sounds like they're transferring
him to another vehicle.

747
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,250
Chloe,bring up a satellite feed
five-mile radius of ctu.

748
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,850
Hurry.

749
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,450
Drive.

750
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,750
yes?

751
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,850
We're on our way.

752
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,050
How soon can you be here?

753
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,350
15 minutes.

754
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,550
We'll be waiting.

755
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,950
With my money.

756
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,150
You'll get paid as soon as I have what I want.

757
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,550
Let me be clear.

758
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,150
I'm just delivering him.

759
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,450
You'll have to make him cooperate.

760
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,650
He'll cooperate.

761
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,650
Agent burke,

762
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,450
I'd like to speak to my son.

763
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,350
All right.

764
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,950
Five minutes.

765
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,450
Thanks.

766
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,450
How am I doing?

767
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,250
You're doing great.

768
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,350
Everyone thinks jack is so tough.

769
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,050
Maybe he is...

770
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,850
but so am I.

771
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,050
It's nice to know that I can take
anything he can dish out.

772
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,250
You told him about palmer.

773
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,250
I had to give him something to
make him think I cracked,

774
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,850
but I kept you out of it.

775
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,450
It's gonna get a lot worse.

776
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,350
He's not finished.

777
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,350
He knows you didn't tell him everything.

778
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,650
And I won'T.You know I won't,dad.

779
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,550
They're going to take you to ctu.

780
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,050
They'll do things there that'll make
this seem like a cakewalk.

781
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,250
Well,like i said,

782
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,650
I can take it.

783
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,450
I'd like to believe that.

784
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,950
The problem is,I have to be sure.

785
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,150
Well,you can be.

786
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,750
I'll hold my mud,dad.

787
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,150
Everything's going exactly according to plan.

788
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,650
Jack bought the ruse.

789
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,550
Oh,I know.

790
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,950
I'm sure we convinced him that you were
going to have me killed as well.

791
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,050
Yeah,

792
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,650
that makes me the bad guy and you the good guy.

793
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,150
I take the rap,do some time,you skate free.

794
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,350
Get me out when you can.

795
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,950
Meanwhile,the company lives on.

796
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,750
Dad,stick to the plan.

797
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,250
That's what you've always said,right?

798
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:11,850
Make a plan.

799
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,150
Stick to it.

800
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,250
Sometimes you have to make adjustments.

801
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,450
I would never betray you,dad.

802
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,150
I love you.

803
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,850
I love you,too,graem.

804
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,750
You've been a good boy.

805
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,650
Done everything I asked.

806
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,450
Only this time,I asked too much.

807
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,050
Sorry.

808
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,050
Dad...

809
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,050
my son's had a seizure!

810
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,850
Get in here now!

811
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:32,950
Hurry up!

812
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,350
What happened?

813
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,550
Is he going to make it?

814
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:38,750
I don't know. Please,give us the
room so we can work.

815
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,550
Get ctu medical now!

816
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,950
My god,

817
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,750
if you people killed my son,I swear...

818
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,750
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
