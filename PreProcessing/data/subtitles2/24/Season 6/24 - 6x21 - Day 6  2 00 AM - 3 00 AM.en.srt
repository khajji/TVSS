1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,300
Marilyn.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,100
Jack, what happened?

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,900
My father escaped.
I don't know where he is.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
He might be in the area.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,800
I want you both
to go back to CTU.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Josh, I know that
there's a lot to explain,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,100
and I promise you
when this is over,

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
you and I are
going to sit down

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
and I will talk you
through what happened.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,400
Thank you for saving my son.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,200
He reminds me of you.

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,100
I told you I was sorry.

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,600
<i>MORRIS:
You said I should stop</i>

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,700
helping terrorists
arm nuclear bombs.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,400
We're done.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,300
<i>I've interfaced the component.</i>

17
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,700
There's a problem.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,300
The circuit board is damaged.

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Can you fix it?

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
No, not unless I have

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,800
the security override.

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,800
We don't have access
to that information.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
We'll have to find someone
who has the necessary expertise.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,400
An FB sub-circuit board from one

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,500
of the weapons is now
in the possession

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,000
of an agent of
the Chinese government.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,100
If you do not intercept
this component,

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
my generals have instructions

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,100
to initiate
an appropriate response.

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,400
How the hell did the Russians
find out about this?

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Only select people
at the White House

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,800
even knew about this.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,800
So you're saying there's a spy?

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,400
Which staff are
we talking about here, Tom?

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,700
<i>LENNOX:
Lisa Miller, sir.</i>

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
<i>DANIELS:
Bishop's been passing</i>

37
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,000
intelligence to the Russians
that he got from you.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,700
I swear to you, I didn't know.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,500
It's still treason.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,200
You're going to go back
to your boyfriend

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,100
and you're going to
make him believe

42
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,000
that we have the component back.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,900



White House is pressuring us
to find Cheng.

44
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,200
<i>We have to hope we can get</i>
some information out of her.</i>

45
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,800
<i>DOCTOR:
It's going to be</i>
next to impossible</i>

46
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,300
to communicate with her
in the near term

47
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,300
unless we essentially attempt
to shock her out of this state.

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,800
Mike...

49
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,200
will they let me
speak to Audrey?

50
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,400
<i>DOYLE:
The shrink who's treating her</i>

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
doesn't think
it's a good idea.

52
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,300
And he's about
to try some protocol

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
of his own using
big doses of drugs.

54
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,700
It could kill her, Jack.

55
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,100
Why did you uncuff me?

56
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,000
'Cause I think you need to do
something about it.

57
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,600
Is there anything
that you can tell me

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,900
that can help us find Cheng

59
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,700
or at least where
they were holding you?

60
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,200
Please!

61
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,600
DOYLE:
Jack, put down your gun.

62
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,500
Not until I get a guarantee
from you that Audrey is safe.

63
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
Bloomfield.

64
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,300
What'd you say?

65
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,500
Bloomfield.

66
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,800
Morris, did you get that?
"Bloomfield."

67
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,000
<i>Have Chloe track it down,</i>
keep Doyle in the loop.</i>

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Earlier,
I got through to Audrey.

69
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,900
I can do the same thing again,
I just need some time.

70
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,000
Please.

71
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,600
Stay away from my daughter.

72
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:50,300
Everything you touch,

73
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,100
orerJack.
.

74
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,400
(cell door closes)

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
I thought you should know,

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,000
James Heller just left
with his daughter.

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,100
He also reiterated to me
his demand

78
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,400
that you're to stay away
from her.

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,100
He'll be filing a restraining
order to that effect.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,100
I'm sorry, Jack.

81
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,700
The name that Audrey gave us

82
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,800
when I was talking to her--
Bloomfield-- did it pan out?

83
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,000
It did.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,800
It's an old copper refining
facility in Jefferson Heights.

85
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,500
We found oxidized copper
particles on Audrey's clothing,

86
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,700
so we're pretty sure that's
where Cheng was holding her.

87
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,700
Now, if that's his base
of operations,

88
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,100
he should have the Russian
component there,

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
so we're locking it down

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
and dispatching teams now.
You need to let me
go with them.

91
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
You're still under arrest, Jack.

92
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,700
For 20 months
in a Chinese prison,

93
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Cheng tried to break me.

94
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
I know him.
I know how he thinks.

95
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,000
I am your best chance
at stopping him.

96
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,700
You willfully disobeyed
a presidential order.

97
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
Your actions resulted

98
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,700
in Cheng getting ahold
of that component.

99
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,600
That's why I'm begging you
to let me go.

100
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,100
I caused this mess;
let me clean it up.

101
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,600
Please.

102
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,200
Damn it, Nadia, you have the
authority to let me do this.

103
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,200
This isn't about finding
that component for you, Jack.

104
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
This is about getting
revenge against Cheng.

105
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,100
Cheng is responsible
for Audrey's condition.

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,300
You're damn right
this is about revenge.

107
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,700
I want Cheng more than anything
in the world.

108
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,100
But I gave President Palmer
my word

109
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,900
that I would destroy
that component

110
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,600
before I let it
fall into enemy hands.

111
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,400
Please...

112
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,500
give me a chance
to keep my word.

113
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
I'm sorry, Jack, I can't.

114
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,200
Don't even think
about it, Jack.

115
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,100
If you make a move, I will
have you put in restraints.

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,700
Maybe I could help from here.

117
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,000
I could run tactical.

118
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,700
Division is sending over

119
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
a ranking section chief
to replace me.

120
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,000
I promise you I will take it up
with him when he gets here.

121
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,500
Okay, thanks.

122
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,300
MORRIS:
We have a land sat image
of Bloomfield.

123
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
It's a big place.

124
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,500
There's Cheng's Hummer
at the rear entrance.

125
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
All right, port it over to
tactical for analysis.

126
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,800
It's already happening.
Status update

127
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,000
on LAPD?
All reserve units
are on the way.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
They should have a perimeter
in 20 minutes.

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,600
You okay?

130
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,500
Fine.

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,700
You don't look fine.
Since you're so

132
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,200
keen to know, Chloe
and I have split up.

133
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,100
Shut up, Morris.

134
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,900
Pointless being coy
about it, right?

135
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,500
We're still doing our jobs;
we're all professionals.

136
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
It's just that if
I were you,

137
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,400
I'd stay out of it.

138
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
I will.

139
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,900
WOMAN:
These are the transcripts
from Marilyn Bauer's statement.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,800
She needs to review them.

141
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
I'll take care of it.

142
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Wheels are rolling
in five minutes.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,100
All right, gentlemen, listen up.

144
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,800
Your objective is

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,000
the Bloomfield Copper facility
in Jefferson Heights.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,600
We have good reason to believe
this is Cheng's safehouse

147
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
and that he has
the component in
his possession.

148
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,500
LAPD is setting up
a five-block perimeter.

149
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,400
Your job is to penetrate
the facility, apprehend Cheng,

150
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,700
and secure the component.

151
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,600
If Cheng gets out of the country
with that component,

152
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,500
Russia will hold us responsible
for providing the Chinese

153
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
access to their defense codes.

154
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,300
And they'll strike back at us.

155
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
We need to recover
that component.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,400
There is no room
for error.

157
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Real-time tactical feeds
and satellite recon

158
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,500
will be uplinked to your PDAs.

159
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,100
Any questions?

160
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,800
Good luck.

161
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,700
You're doing a good job.

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I'm just trying to keep
the roof from caving in

163
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,800
until my replacement
gets here.

164
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,800
Listen, we're putting
every available agent
out in the field.

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,900
If Cheng is in
that facility,

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,300
we're going to get him
and the component.

167
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Be careful.

168
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,500
(speaks Chinese)

169
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,100
You have the data.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
It's about time.

171
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,100
We have to finalize
our attack plan.

172
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
I want to attack the target

173
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,400
in 15 minutes.

174
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,700
We'll be ready.

175
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,800
(speaks Chinese)

176
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,300
##Josh...

177
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,300
you got to stop watching this
and try and get some sleep.

178
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,200
They're saying that
12,000 people are dead.

179
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,800
All because of
what Dad did.

180
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,600
Honey, it's not
that simple.

181
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,900
Terrorists were
responsible...
But he was involved.

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
He let it happen.

183
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,500
I wish I was never even born.

184
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't say that.

185
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,900
Why? That's how I feel.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,900
I wish I was never part
of this sick family.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
You listen to me.
Listen to me.

188
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,600
You are not your father.

189
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,800
You are not responsible

190
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,200
for anything he did.

191
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,700
Come here.

192
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,600
I love you.

193
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
I do.

194
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
We're gonna be okay.

195
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,500
I promise you
we'll get through this.

196
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,000
We've been here for hours.
I want to go home.

197
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,600
I know, we'll go home
in the morning.

198
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,900
Right now...

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,400
I want you to close your eyes
and get some sleep.

200
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,700
Okay? Come on, lay down.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,800
CHLOE:
Sorry to interrupt.

202
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
It's okay.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,300
This is a transcript
of your statement.

204
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,000
I need you to review it
and make sure it's accurate.

205
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
All right.

206
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Mrs. Bauer?

207
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Please call me Marilyn.

208
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
I know you and Jack are close.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,700
There's something
that you need to know.

210
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,200
What is it?

211
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,100
It's about Audrey Raines.

212
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,000
She's still alive.

213
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,700
What?

214
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,800
(phone rings, vibrates)

215
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,700
Hello.

216
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,800
It's me.

217
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,200
Hey, you.

218
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,200
Thought I wouldn't hear
from you again till morning.

219
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Sorry I left so suddenly.

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
We had a crisis
with the Russians.

221
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
What kind of crisis?

222
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,900
It doesn't matter anymore,
it's been averted.

223
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
That's good.

224
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,000
Anyway, I was thinking maybe we
could pick up where we left off

225
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
if you want.

226
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,400
Well, you know I do,
sweetheart, but, um...

227
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,300
isn't Daniels going to
want you to stick around

228
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
so he can paw you
every chance he gets?

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm the last thing
on his mind right now.

230
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,800
Well, his loss.

231
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,100
How soon can you get here?

232
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
I'm on my way.

233
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
I love you.

234
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,200
I love you, too.

235
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll see you soon.

236
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,500
All right.

237
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
Sounded, uh...
genuine enough.

238
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,400
Now, when you go back

239
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,900
to Mr. Bishop, you will find

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
a way to excuse yourself
from the room to allow him time

241
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,500
to access your PDA.

242
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,400
We've uploaded memos stating
that a Chinese agent was trying

243
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
to smuggle a piece of Russian
technology out of the country,

244
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,900
and was taken out
in a military strike.

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Do you understand?

246
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,300
You want the Russians to think

247
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,900
the component was
destroyed in the attack?

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,900
That's correct.

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
It's up to you now.

250
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,100
If you can feed all this
convincingly to Bishop,

251
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,000
he will relay it
to his Russian contact,

252
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,600
and with any
luck at all,

253
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,900
President Suvarov
will call off his threat

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,700
of military action
against us,

255
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,500
at least for
the time being.

256
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm sorry, I just don't know...
if I can go through with this,

257
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,000
if I can be
with him again,

258
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,300
and act like nothing's wrong.

259
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,700
(snorts)

260
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh, I'm sure you'll manage.

261
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,900
For the last year, you've
had no problem lying to me.

262
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,200
So, at any rate,

263
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,200
Agent Hollister
and I will be in a van

264
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
parked across the
street from Bishop's.

265
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
We'll be monitoring everything.

266
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,900
You do as you're told and...

267
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,000
it should all go smoothly.

268
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,300
Marilyn.

269
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,500
What are you
doing here?

270
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,000
You should be
with Josh.

271
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,300
I had to see if you
were all right.

272
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,600
I'm fine.
I don't think the charges

273
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,800
will stand up, given the
extenuating circumstances.

274
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,800
I meant...

275
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,700
I meant about Audrey.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,300
I'm so sorry, Jack.

277
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,500
I feel awful telling
you she was dead.

278
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,300
You didn't know. No one knew.

279
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,900
Still...

280
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,200
I heard the Chinese caused
her to have some kind of...

281
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,700
psychological breakdown.

282
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,300
Is she going
to be all right?

283
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,300
I don't know.

284
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,700
What do her doctors say?

285
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
It's out of my hands.

286
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,000
What do you mean,
it's out of your hands?

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
Her father's Secretary Heller.

288
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,600
He's already taken
her away from here.

289
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,200
I've been ordered
to stay away from her

290
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,700
and to stay out
of her life.

291
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,900
How could he do that to you?
You saved her life.

292
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,400
Marilyn, please.

293
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,200
I don't want to
talk about this.

294
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,500
Miss Yassir told us
that Josh and I don't need

295
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,700
to be in CTU custody anymore.

296
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,300
They're going to process
us out in the morning.

297
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,500
Good.

298
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,100
I'd like to bring Josh by

299
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,900
to see you
before we go.

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,900
That will be fine.

301
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,700
Jack... whatever happens,

302
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,100
when all this is over,

303
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,400
I want you to know...

304
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,700
I'll be there for you.

305
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Thank you.

306
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
Mrs. Bauer?

307
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,600
Marilyn, you really should go.

308
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,900
Chloe.

309
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,500
Any word on Cheng?

310
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Doyle's leading a team
to Bloomfield right now.

311
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,900
They should be there any second.

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Please, keep me informed.

313
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Jack, we'll get Cheng
and the component.

314
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,100
(door closes)

315
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,900
(sighs)

316
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
There's the
entrance point.

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
There's only one.
Yes, but they
will put you

318
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,800
in an optimal position
for a quick surgical strike.

319
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,600
Hey, Ryan,
take your team around back.

320
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,500
The rest of you, follow me.

321
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
You know, this isn't going
to be bloodless, Cheng.

322
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,700
People are
going to die.

323
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,600
You do what you need to do.

324
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,800
Doyle's team's moving
into Bloomfield now.

325
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Remember, your objective
isn't to cause

326
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,700
casualties.

327
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,200
Your objective
is to obtain the package.

328
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,400
Nothing else
takes precedence.

329
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
I understand.

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,200
* *

331
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,500
We'll access the sewer
lines from here.

332
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,900
Once below ground,

333
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,600
it's roughly 180 meters
to the target.

334
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,500
All right?

335
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
Let's move.

336
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Don't let me down.

337
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,600
Clear!

338
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,900
Clear.

339
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
Anything?
No.

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,500
There's nobody here,
but you have to see this.

341
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,300
We have empty
rifle magazines,

342
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,900
stun grenades, C-4.

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,300
Look, this is
an arsenal.

344
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,700
Yeah.
Continue with the search.

345
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,100
See if you can find
anything else.

346
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,700
Yes, sir.

347
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
(dialing)

348
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,500
(clears throat)

349
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,900
(ringing)

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,900
O'Brian.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,900
Chloe, put Nadia on.

352
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
Nadia, it's Doyle.

353
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,100
Go ahead, Mike.

354
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,200
Yeah. Cheng's not here.

355
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,500
Bloomfield's been evacuated.

356
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
If they haven't hit
one of our roadblocks,

357
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,400
then I'm guessing
they got out before

358
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,700
we could lock
down the perimeter.

359
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,900
Check the satellite feed.

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,700
Try to back-time the frames
before we repositioned.

361
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,900
And there's something else.

362
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,100
We found a whole bunch
of empty weapon crates.

363
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,200
What kind of weapons?

364
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,600
Large-caliber rifles,

365
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
military-grade
C-4, grenades.

366
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,200
There's enough of an arsenal
for a small army.

367
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
Looks like the Chinese
are planning

368
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
to launch a major assault.

369
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
Assault on what?

370
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,800
We're at the junction.

371
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,600
Good. Head east

372
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,100
153 meters.

373
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
That will put you

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,300
directly beneath CTU
and the entrance point.

375
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,400
##I'm scanning these satellite
images from Bloomfield.

376
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm getting a lot of dropped
data fields in Sector Eight.

377
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
Chloe.

378
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,000
I heard you.

379
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, have you any idea
what might be causing it?

380
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,300
'Cause I'm practically
blind here.

381
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,000
You know that patch we
downloaded from the USGS subnet?

382
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,700
Yeah.
Sometimes
it conflicts

383
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,000
with the imaging software--
try deactivating it.

384
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Thank you,
that's what I needed.

385
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,500
Morris.

386
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,600
I know you're trying to be
professional about everything.

387
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,100
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,300
I'm really having a hard time
with what happened between us.

389
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
You have nothing
to apologize for, darling.

390
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
You broke up with me because
I said something stupid,

391
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,000
something I didn't mean.

392
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,300
About me arming the nukes
and being a coward.

393
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
That wasn't stupid.

394
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,100
It's the God's
honest truth.

395
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,200
I don't believe that.

396
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,500
Well, it's a fact.
You were right,

397
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,400
whether you want to admit it
to yourself or not.

398
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,300
So you're saying what
I think doesn't matter.

399
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,200
No. I'm saying...

400
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,200
that I didn't
break up with you

401
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,900
because of what
you said.

402
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,300
I broke up with you
because of what I did.

403
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,100
No matter how much
you think you love me,

404
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,400
I know there'll always
be that knowledge, and...

405
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
you won't be able
to get past it.

406
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,700
You're wrong.

407
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,100
You know me better
than anyone, right?

408
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
Yeah.

409
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,500
When am I ever wrong?

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,200
Remember, as soon
as you're in,

411
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,500
you will create
an opportunity

412
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,700
for Bishop to access
your PDA.

413
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Something wrong?

414
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
I'm frightened.

415
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Well, you should be.

416
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,200
If this thing doesn't work,

417
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,400
you will be facing
treason charges.

418
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I've cooperated fully.

419
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,600
Great, you can testify

420
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,600
to that at your trial.

421
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,800
So...

422
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,800
get a grip here.
You will do

423
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,400
whatever is necessary
to assure Bishop

424
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
that nothing has changed
between the two of you.

425
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
Do you understand?

426
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,900
Yes.

427
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,600
All right, let's get
the car up here.

428
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,300
The surveillance camera's
all set

429
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
in the bag, sir.

430
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
It's all yours.

431
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,200
All right,
let's button things up here.

432
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,900
* *

433
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
(phone ringing)

434
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Yes.

435
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,500
She's on her way inside, sir.

436
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,300
Are you sure she can
pull this off?

437
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,700
Let's hope so, sir.

438
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,200
I appreciate what
you're doing, Tom.

439
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,800
I know this doesn't...

440
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,600
exactly fall under
your job description.

441
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,200
Well, we're all doing
some improvising today,

442
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,900
aren't we, sir?

443
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
We both agreed
it is in our interest

444
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,400
to keep this
circle small.

445
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,300
(sighs)

446
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,600
Hey.

447
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,900
Hi.

448
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,300
You okay?

449
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,100
Of course.

450
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Why?

451
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,900
You seem,
I don't know, tense.

452
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,700
Mark, come on.
With everything that's happened,

453
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,300
who isn't?

454
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,600
Right.

455
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,900
Well, maybe
I can loosen you up.

456
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
How's that? Better?

457
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,900
Yeah.

458
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,700
You know, um,

459
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,900
I'm going to
freshen up first.

460
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Relax.

461
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,800
We already had
a shower, remember?

462
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,200
I'm really happy
you came back.

463
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,900
The more time I spend
away from you

464
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,500
the harder it is
to let you walk out the door.

465
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,600
I may have to strap you
to the bed.

466
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
permanently.

467
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,400
Just get out of the room.

468
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,900
Leave him alone
with the PDA.

469
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I bet you'd like that.

470
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,300
Mm, immensely.

471
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,100
You know what?
I'm sorry.

472
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,600
I'm just feeling
really grungy.

473
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,200
The situation at the White House

474
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,400
has me stressed.

475
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,200
I'll be right back.

476
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,500
I thought you said

477
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,400
that crisis was averted.

478
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,100
It was.

479
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Then you should feel
relieved.

480
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,200
Well... you know me,

481
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,800
always worried
the next crisis

482
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
is around the corner.

483
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,200
Mm. I think I know

484
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,700
how to take your
mind off of it.

485
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,500
Mark...

486
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,100
##We're here.

487
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,800
Set the charges.

488
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,400
Are you ready?

489
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,300
We're in position.
The charges are being set.

490
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,900
Stand by.

491
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,500
Input the code.

492
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,100
It worked. We're in.

493
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,800
Tying us
into their security system.

494
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,700
Overriding their comm.

495
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,900
We'll go in sectors.

496
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,200
Two minutes until
everything is shut down.

497
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,400
Nadia, escape vectors
from Bloomfield.

498
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,700
We analyzed every route
from the facility.

499
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,800
There are over 20.

500
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
So whoever was
holding Audrey

501
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,300
could be anywhere
in the city now.

502
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Morris and Chloe are still
back-timing the satellite feed,

503
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
so hopefully, they'll get a fix
on one of the vehicles.

504
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,300
All right,
keep me posted.

505
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,900
Have we heard anything
from Doyle?

506
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,300
His team's halfway
through the forensic sweep

507
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,100
and they haven't found
anything so far.

508
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,100
What?

509
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,500
Never mind.

510
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,600
Listen, Milo, I saw the look
that you gave me

511
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,900
when I was talking
to Doyle.

512
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,700
(sighs)

513
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,500
I understand if
your feelings

514
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,300
for me have changed.
Milo...

515
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,800
Yes, I, I was hurt, but...

516
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,400
if there is
something going on

517
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,400
between you and
Doyle, I just...

518
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,900
I want you to know
that it's...

519
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,100
...it's okay.

520
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,900
Milo, to be completely honest,
I don't know what I feel.

521
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,200
So much has happened today
I haven't had a chance to...

522
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,100
I haven't had a chance
to think through anything.

523
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,600
I just need some time
to sort it all out.

524
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,900
Nadia...

525
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,300
Nadia, I've got
something.

526
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,000
What is it?

527
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,600
This is from
about 50 minutes ago.

528
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,100
I've checked the frames
before and after.

529
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
MILO:
So they definitely got out
of Bloomfield

530
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,600
before Doyle's team arrived.

531
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,400
Notify LAPD.
Give them a description

532
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,000
of the vehicles.

533
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,800
Chloe, widen the search vector--
see if we can figure out

534
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,600
where those vehicles
were headed.

535
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,100
Charges set.

536
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,900
Clear out.

537
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,300
Doyle.

538
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,300
Doyle?

539
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,900
CTU to Field Unit Bravo,
come in.

540
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,300
Can't get
an outside line.

541
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Yeah, I can't reach Doyle.
Comm's down, too.

542
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,800
Could be a hiccup
in the server.

543
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,600
Check it out.

544
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,800
Pressman.

545
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,200
I don't know what the hell
is happening.

546
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,900
I can't access any
of the servers.

547
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,100
The permissions
have all been reset.

548
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,100
(speaks Chinese)

549
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,200
Got a visual on the SUV
and the van.

550
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,700
Cheng was heading south
on the 110.

551
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,100
He exited Florence heading east.

552
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,100
That's six blocks from here.

553
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,000
That was security.

554
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,200
They just lost visual
surveillance.

555
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,700
What the hell are you
talking about?

556
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Every one of our
security cameras,

557
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,100
they all just went out at once.

558
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,500
Chloe, Code Red
emergency lockdown.

559
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,000
(alarm buzzing)

560
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,500
(phone rings)

561
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,900
This is Nadia Yasser,
Code Red is confirmed.

562
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Lock this place down!

563
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,300
Right away.

564
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,200
Everyone get to your assigned
safe rooms now! Go!

565
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,100
Get moving!

566
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,900
(machine gun fire)

567
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,200
Morris, flood
the outer sectors
with tear gas.

568
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,500
I can't. I can't get
into the system.

569
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
I don't know
how they've done it,

570
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
but we're completely
paralyzed.

571
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,000
Base One, come in!
Base One, come in!

572
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,800
Listen to me!
CTU is under attack!

573
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,200
You need to open the door now!

574
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,900
Base One, come in!

575
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,200
Base One, come in!

576
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,800
Everyone on the floor!

577
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,000
I can hear them!

578
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,200
They're in sector three.
They're coming this way!

579
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,200
Now, let me out!

580
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,000
No one's responding.

581
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,700
They've cut us off
from the main floor.

582
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,200
We need to get up
to the lounge.

583
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
There's civilians there--
I'm gonna need a weapon.

584
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,900
Cell phones, throw them
in front of you!

585
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Head count.
Check the roster.

586
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Set up the comm unit.

587
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,400
Filter all communications
that comes in here

588
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,000
and turn off the alarm.

589
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
(gun cocks)

590
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,600
(alarm continues buzzing)

591
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,300
(automatic gunfire)

592
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,300
(panting)

593
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,000
Who's in command?

594
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,300
Who is in command?

595
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
MILO:
I am.

596
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Milo Pressman.

597
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,900
I'm Acting Director of CTU.

598
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,300
Come here!

599
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,200
##Hello?

600
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,900
(gasping breaths)

601
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
The phones are dead.
Mom, what's
going on?

602
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,500
I don't know.

603
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,000
(gasps)
Josh! Help me push
this against the door!

604
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,400
Hurry, Josh! Hurry!

605
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,400
(Marilyn grunting)

606
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,000
MAN:
On the floor! Now!

607
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,800
We found Bauer.

608
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,200
The boy's with
his mother.

609
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,500
ZHOU:
Good. Bring them here.
On our way.

610
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
All right, get up!

611
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,200
MARILYN:
Leave my son alone!
Where are you taking us?

612
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,900
(Marilyn yells)

613
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
You all right?

614
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,700
Yes, Jack! What's going on?
What do they want with Josh?

615
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,900
What do you mean, Josh?
They came here to get him.

616
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,100
Are you sure they came for Josh?

617
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,300
That's what they said.

618
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,500
Yes.

619
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,300
We got to get out of here.
Come on.

620
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,300
(Marilyn crying)

621
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,500
(whispering):
Stay close. Come on.

622
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,200
(panting)

623
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
Shut the door.

624
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,500
(loud clang)

625
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,700
Come here.

626
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,200
Josh, I want you to
climb up here and crawl
through the air duct.

627
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,400
Just go.
I'm not leaving you!

628
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,700
Josh, you're not leaving
anyone behind; we're gonna be

629
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,200
following you-- just
go through there. Go.

630
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,900
Keep going.

631
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
MAN:
He's out of ammo!
Let's go! Let's go!

632
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,700
Put your weapon
down on the ground.

633
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
Now!
I'm putting the weapon down!

634
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm putting it down!

635
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,000
Both of you, get on your knees!

636
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,200
We have a problem.

637
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,400
What is it?

638
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,700
The boy got away.

639
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,900
He's inside one
of the ventilation ducts.

640
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,800
We have
the boy's mother...

641
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,700
and Jack Bauer.

642
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,000
Send the woman and Bauer
to me-- you wait there.

643
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
(speaks Chinese)

644
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,100
Get up.

645
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
Let's go!
Let's go!

646
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,800
Cut power
to the ventilation system,

647
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,100
and tie me in
to the public address system.

648
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,400
I want to talk to
the boy directly.

649
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,700
(sighs)

650
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,000
Cheng.

651
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,700
The boy's escaped.

652
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
We've captured his mother
and Jack Bauer.

653
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,300
Get the boy back.

654
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
I don't care

655
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,500
what you have to do!
Zhou.

656
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,700
We're getting another call
from Agent Doyle.

657
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,600
I think we need to respond.

658
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,600
Nadia Yassir!

659
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,000
Nadia Yassir, stand up!

660
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,700
Come here.

661
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,900
According to that roster,

662
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,500
<i>you</i> are the ranking
officer here.

663
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,200
Are you?

664
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,000
Are you the ranking officer?

665
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,700
Yes.

666
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,800
One of your men
has been calling.

667
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,400
You need to answer him.

668
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,900
Tell him you had a problem
with your communication system.

669
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,500
If you try to warn him,
I will kill everyone here.

670
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,100
Starting with you.

671
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,900
Do you understand me?

672
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,200
Come on.

673
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,300
Answer it.

674
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,000
(beeping)

675
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,100
This is Nadia.

676
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Nadia, it's Mike--
I've been trying

677
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,800
to get ahold of you
for a while now.

678
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,500
Yeah. We had
a problem with comm.

679
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,800
What kind of problem?

680
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,700
Doesn't matter--
it's sorted out now.

681
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,800
My team still
hasn't picked up

682
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,500
any leads on Cheng--
have you been able

683
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,800
to get a visual on him?

684
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,100
Not yet.

685
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,700
What is taking so long?

686
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,400
Nadia, all you had to
do was reposition

687
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,600
satellite surveillance
over Jefferson Heights.

688
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,300
Mike, we're working
as fast as we can, okay?

689
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
What else do you
want me to do?

690
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,600
As soon as we get a visual
on Cheng's vehicles,

691
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,100
I'll let you know.

692
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,100
All right, thanks.

693
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,400
Now go sit back down.

694
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,400
(Marilyn gasping)
Bring her over here.

695
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,900
What do you want with the boy?

696
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,200
Who sent you?
Jack!

697
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,800
You don't ask
the questions here.

698
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,500
He makes another move,
shoot him.

699
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Activate the P.A.

700
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,000
(over PA):
Josh, I want you to listen

701
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,400
to me very carefully.

702
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,900
I know you're scared,

703
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,500
and I don't blame you,
but you really don't have to be.

704
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,900
The truth is,
we're not going to hurt you.

705
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,900
We're going to take you to
a safe place-- that's all

706
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,700
I can tell you right now.
Leave him alone!

707
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Josh!

708
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,000
I know you heard that, Josh.

709
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,000
Your mother's here with us.

710
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,300
She's okay...

711
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,200
for now.

712
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,800
I don't want to hurt her, Josh.

713
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,600
There's been enough
bloodshed today.

714
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,700
Show yourself to one of my men.

715
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,400
If you do, nothing will happen
to your mother.

716
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,100
If you don't,

717
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,700
I'll shoot her.

718
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,500
She'll die for nothing, Josh,
because one way or another,

719
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
we're going to find you,

720
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,600
even if we have to tear
this building apart.

721
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:57,300
So I'm asking you
to save your mother's life.

722
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm going to give you
ten seconds.

723
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,000
If you don't show yourself
by the time I finish counting...

724
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,800
she dies.

725
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,100
(gasps)

726
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,100
One...

727
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,100
...two...

728
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,600
...three...

729
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,100
four...

730
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
five...

731
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,500
six...

732
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,300
seven...

733
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,800
eight... nine...

734
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,600
(clattering)
Wait.

735
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
I can hear him.
He's coming right now.

736
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
Come on, let's go.

737
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,600
Let's go, let's go.

738
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,200
I got him.
We're coming to you.

739
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,200
Cheng.

740
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,300
We have the boy.

741
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,900
Good work.

742
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,200
Bring him to me right away.

743
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,800
Put her with the others.

744
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,100
(gasps)

745
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,900
Mom!

746
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Josh!
Sit!

747
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,200
(panting)

748
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,600
The operation was successful.

749
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,100
My men have your grandson.

750
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,700
How is he?

751
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,900
Under stress,
a little emotional,

752
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,700
but physically unharmed.

753
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Is his mother alive?

754
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,400
Yes. So is your son, Jack.

755
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Good. You have any trouble?

756
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,000
None to speak of--
the codes you provided us

757
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,000
gave us full access to CTU's

758
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,400
security system.

759
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,900
Have you finished repairing
the sub-circuit board?

760
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,200
Almost.

761
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,300
I'll return it
when you bring me my grandson.

762
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,900
We will meet at the rendezvous
point in 20 minutes.

763
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,600
It'll be waiting.

764
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,600
Call me when I can talk
to the boy.

765
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Will do.



9999
