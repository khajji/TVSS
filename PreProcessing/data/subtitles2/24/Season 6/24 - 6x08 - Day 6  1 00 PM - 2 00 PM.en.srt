1
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:21,234
Congratulations, Tom.
It's an excellent plan.

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,667
<i>It's about time someone
in this administration</i>

3
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:23,934
stood up to these people.

4
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,534
Thank you very much,
Mr. Vice President.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,001
The American-Muslim community
is our best

6
00:00:29,067 --> 00:00:32,634
line of defense
against these terrorists.

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,667
<i>Your plan...</i>

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,834
would only hinder

9
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:37,667
the efforts of law enforcement
to stop Fayed.

10
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,067
I remain convinced

11
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:42,201
that implementing this plan
would be a terrible mistake.

12
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:44,967
15 minutes ago,
the NSA picked up a conversation

13
00:00:45,034 --> 00:00:45,901
between McCarthy and Fayed.

14
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:48,967
<i>McCarthy's found
another engineer</i>

15
00:00:49,034 --> 00:00:50,734
to arm the four remaining nukes.

16
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,467
CHLOE:
Oh, my God. It's Morris.

17
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:55,300
JACK:
Morris, it's a setup.

18
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:57,400
The engineer McCarthy's
looking for-- it's you.
(two gunshots)

19
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,700
Get out of the car or the
next one's in your head.

20
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:01,967
We're on our way.

21
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:02,901
We'll be waiting.

22
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:04,934
With my money?

23
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,234
<i>FAYED:
You'll get paid as soon
as I have what I want.</i>

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,001
I'm just delivering him.

25
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,600
You'll have to make him
cooperate.

26
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,534
How do I find McCarthy?!

27
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:14,667
Four cc's!

28
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,367
His vitals are spiking
across the line.

29
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:17,367
JACK:
Four cc's!

30
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,433
Jack, don't.

31
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,834
<i>It has nothing
to do with McCarthy.</i>

32
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,600
It has to do with Palmer.

33
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,934
David Palmer?

34
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:28,734
I gave the order
for his assassination.

35
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,001
<i>JACK:
Not only was he responsible</i>

36
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,367
<i>for David Palmer's
assassination,</i>

37
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,001
he directed
the entire conspiracy.

38
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,034
He was trying to protect

39
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:34,867
<i>my father's company.</i>

40
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:35,934
Then...

41
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,067
You told them about Palmer.

42
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,534
I had to give
them something,

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,734
make them think I cracked,
but I kept you out of it.

44
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,967
Dad, stick
to the plan.

45
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:44,634
Sometimes you have
to make adjustments.

46
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:54,967
My son's had a seizure!

47
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:57,234
<i>PHILLIP:
If you people killed my son,</i>

48
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,767
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

49
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,834
Chloe, it's Jack.

50
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm en route to the ambush site.

51
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,667
You need to tell me which
direction they took Morris.

52
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,168
I'm bringing
it up now.

53
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:18,801
Jack, what are they
gonna do to him?

54
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,667
Chloe, they have to keep
him alive long enough

55
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,101
to try and make the
bombs operational.

56
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:23,634
That means
we've got time.

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,268
I need you to remain calm
and pull up the satellite now.

58
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,333
I'm trying;
the server's not responding.

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,567
That's 'cause
you're not

60
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:30,433
re-synching the
coordinates correctly.

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,834
I know what I'm doing.

62
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,834
Have you confirmed this
with the field team?

63
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,500
Yes.

64
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,268
Jack's on line 1.

65
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,333
Jack, it's Bill.

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,268
We just got word from the field
team at your brother's house.

67
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:04,268
Graem's dead, Jack.

68
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,667
What happened?

69
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:10,634
We'll know more
after an autopsy,

70
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,967
but all signs point
to cardiac arrest.

71
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:15,168
Because of the interrogation.

72
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,700
The medic on site believes
that was a factor.

73
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,001
My father know?

74
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,834
Yes, he was there.

75
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,600
But your sister-in-law
and nephew

76
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:25,867
were already en route to CTU
when it happened.

77
00:03:25,934 --> 00:03:27,168
Bill, I'd really
appreciate it

78
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,333
if you would be the one
to break the news to her.

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,300
Of course, Jack.

80
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:31,567
Sir.

81
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:33,867
Stand by.

82
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:36,168
Chloe's starting to screw up.

83
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,667
She's worried
about Morris.

84
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,700
I think she's
losing it.

85
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,400
Chloe, have you accessed
the uplink yet?

86
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,901
Not yet.

87
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,400
Listen,

88
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,500
I know what you must be feeling,
but if there's a problem...

89
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,934
Get away from me!
There's not a problem!

90
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,534
The only problem is people
like you bothering me

91
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,767
when I'm trying
to do my job.

92
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,534
Chloe, give up
your post to Milo.

93
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,934
Leave me alone; I can do this!

94
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,034
Now.

95
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,734
Fine.

96
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:14,234
Jack, I've had
to relieve Chloe.

97
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,268
She's too distraught
to function.

98
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,333
You're on with Milo.

99
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,834
Jack, just give
me a second.

100
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:26,001
Okay, I got McCarthy
on satellite

101
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,767
13 minutes ago,
abducting Morris

102
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,901
in a silver Maserati
at the corner of Central

103
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:31,367
and Third.

104
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,101
I'm tracking them
to their current position.

105
00:04:33,168 --> 00:04:34,801
All right, right now

106
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,333
McCarthy's at Adams
and 13th, heading west.

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,767
Copy that.
We should have a visual

108
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:40,001
in the next couple minutes.

109
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,101
How long is it gonna
take the TAC teams

110
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,333
to intercept McCarthy
on the ground?

111
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,234
I don't know.
We'll get back to you.

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,400
Where are we taking him?

113
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,134
Fayed will call soon.

114
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:56,001
Just relax. Drive.

115
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,433
I am relaxed.

116
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,934
I just want to get
this over with.

117
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,400
It's never gonna be over.

118
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,767
CTU knows
who you are.

119
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,801
They're already
looking for you.

120
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:04,801
Shut up.

121
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:06,001
Is that possible?

122
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,467
Don't listen to him.
He's bluffing.

123
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,067
So you're not Darren McCarthy,

124
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:11,333
arms dealer,
subcontracted

125
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,801
by BXJ Technologies.

126
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,834
CTU intercepted a transmission

127
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:16,433
about Fayed hiring
you to do this.

128
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,400
I said shut up!

129
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:18,734
Right.

130
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,268
We're handing him over
to Fayed as planned.

131
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,767
If I'm already
a marked man,

132
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,201
might as well get paid for it.

133
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:26,367
What about me?

134
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,967
He didn't say
they know about you.

135
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,201
And anyway, I'll take care
of you, like always.

136
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:33,901
(helicopter whirring overhead)

137
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,001
Chopper?

138
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:37,168
That's a chopper.

139
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,268
I got him. I got him.

140
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,300
We got a visual.

141
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,201
Turn left.

142
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:49,567
But why...
Just do what I say!

143
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,500
Just do it!

144
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,168
Swing back.

145
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,534
JACK:
They just took off.

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,734
They must have spotted us.

147
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:04,067
All right, I got them
turning north

148
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:05,967
onto Anders.

149
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:20,067
Go around them.

150
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:20,967
I, uh...

151
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,001
Go around them!
What?!

152
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,400
Just do it!
No!

153
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:28,834
Oh, my God.

154
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,268
Are they still there?
Yes.

155
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,201
Turn there!

156
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,600
We got a problem up here.

157
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,234
They're headed
to the 110 interchange.

158
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,134
Damn it. We just lost them.

159
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:13,201
Does CalTrans have any cameras
that are covering that area?

160
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,101
No.

161
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,967
Nothing.

162
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,234
TAC team is still
five minutes away.

163
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,134
Captain, I want you
to put me down now.

164
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,367
Do you know
what this is about?

165
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,234
Fayed, the man
you're taking me to,

166
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,867
is the terrorist who set off
the nuclear bomb in Valencia.

167
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,134
He has four more bombs.

168
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,001
But he needs me
to make them work,

169
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:54,867
so that he can kill tens of
thousands of innocent people.

170
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:58,400
And all you have to do
to stop that from happening

171
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:00,268
is to uncuff me.

172
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,767
McCarthy's right.

173
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,367
CTU doesn't know you exist.

174
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,767
For the love of God,

175
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,700
all of those people's
lives are on you.

176
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,734
Let's go.

177
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,634
Shouldn't I get my luggage?

178
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,067
Forget about the luggage!
Come on!

179
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,834
You did not tell me

180
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,001
this is about nuclear bombs.

181
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:13,268
What this is about
is about $7 million.

182
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,834
Now, get in the truck!

183
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,433
MILO:
Pressman.

184
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,567
They dumped the car.

185
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,867
They must have
switched vehicles.

186
00:09:48,934 --> 00:09:50,234
From the underpass,
they could've merged

187
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
directly onto any one of
six local roads or highways.

188
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:53,867
There's no way
of tracking them

189
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:55,433
without knowing exactly
what vehicle they're in.

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,667
Damn it, Milo.
They could be anywhere!

191
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:58,901
The TAC team's here.

192
00:09:58,967 --> 00:09:59,934
Get back to me.

193
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:07,067
Head south.

194
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,333
I'm sorry.

195
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:23,834
Hello.

196
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,867
I have a new place
for us to meet.

197
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:27,268
Are you certain
you're not being followed?

198
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,333
Yeah.

199
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,433
What's the address?

200
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,134
4332 Florence Avenue,

201
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:34,867
apartment 621.

202
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,433
Have you got
my money?

203
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,201
Yes.

204
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,433
Turn on the GPS.

205
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,634
Apartment 621.

206
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,967
All right?
Don't forget it.

207
00:11:03,433 --> 00:11:04,634
Okay, good.

208
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,667
It's not too far.

209
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:24,201
Yes, yes.

210
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,333
Thank God.

211
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
A bit excessive,

212
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,567
but you did
the right thing.

213
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,867
Now I've got to contact CTU
and give them...
Shut up!

214
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,867
Shut up!

215
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,667
Fayed wants you alive,

216
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:40,667
and whatever shape you're in
beyond that is up to you.

217
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,767
Oh, come on. What are you doing?

218
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:48,268
I am making $7 million.

219
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:52,201
And I can spend it without
having to worry about CTU.

220
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,367
--Listen...

221
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:14,901
I know you think I'm wrong,

222
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,200
and that I blindsided you
by not backing your proposals.

223
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,267
Correct on both counts, sir.

224
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:25,267
Tom, I have always
valued your counsel.

225
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:30,567
Ever since you showed up at my
home and convinced me to run,

226
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,000
spearheaded my campaign.

227
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:36,968
I mean, if it weren't for
you, I wouldn't be here.

228
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,567
But I do hope I can
still count on you

229
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,567
to help me implement
my polices.

230
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,567
AGENT DAN:
Excuse me, Mr. President.

231
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:45,801
The plane carrying
Hamri Al-Assad

232
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:47,234
has landed at Andrews
Air Force Base.

233
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,834
He'll be here soon.

234
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,100
Thank you.

235
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,901
We'll talk later.

236
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,267
(knocking)
Mr. Lennox?

237
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:17,701
Uh...

238
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,734
Everything's okay.
We're fine in here. Thank you.

239
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,901
What happened?

240
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,167
<i>The President
just rejected every one</i>

241
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:27,734
<i>of my proposals right there
in front of the Cabinet.</i>

242
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:31,634
Not only has he changed his mind
on the internment plan,

243
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,400
he is rolling back
on the detention facilities

244
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,133
that are already in place.

245
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,868
I thought... I thought
he was on board.

246
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,100
Well, so did I.

247
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,300
Now he's putting forth
his own agenda

248
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,133
to try and appease
the Muslim population.

249
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,534
Is he hoping that they're
going to cooperate

250
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:46,834
and help find the
nuclear weapons?

251
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,334
That's it! That's it!

252
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,300
And all he will succeed in doing
is to prove to the terrorists

253
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,234
that he does not have
the stomach

254
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,834
to do what is necessary
and inevitable.

255
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:00,901
Okay. Then you need to use your
influence to change his mind.

256
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:02,868
My...?

257
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:05,167
My influence?

258
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:07,334
You don't get it, do you, Reed?

259
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,734
I have no influence.

260
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,501
Not here.

261
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,400
Not in this administration.

262
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,734
No, I'm resigning.

263
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:21,734
Sir, that would be
a terrible mistake.

264
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:25,801
My mistake was to believe
that Wayne Palmer

265
00:14:25,868 --> 00:14:27,801
has the courage and the vision

266
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,300
to fill this office.

267
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,300
Clearly, I overestimated him.

268
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,801
<i>He is certainly not his brother.</i>

269
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:36,434
Which makes it all the more
important that you stay.

270
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,667
Sir, you have the support
of a great many people here,

271
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:41,801
the least of which
is the Vice President.

272
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:43,934
Well, unfortunately,
the Vice President

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
is not the one in power.

274
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,934
<i>And this country
is being led to slaughter</i>

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,968
by the man who is.

276
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,634
No, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

277
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:56,033
I can't, in good conscience,
be party to this. I can't.

278
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,968
Sir, sir, this is
a terrible mistake.

279
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,067
Reed, I cannot talk about this
any further.

280
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,467
Go now and draft
my letter of resignation

281
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,834
and bring it to me now
for me to sign.

282
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,200
Yes, sir.

283
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,868
CARSON:
Yes?

284
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:21,400
Yeah, it's Reed.

285
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,334
Palmer just shot down the Lennox
plan in the Cabinet meeting.

286
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,601
He's rejecting every one
of the initiatives.

287
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,133
Did you hear what I said?

288
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,234
I heard.

289
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,667
Looks like we have no choice.

290
00:15:30,734 --> 00:15:32,267
We'll have to move ahead
with what we all talked about.

291
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,434
I realize it's extreme,
but under the circumstances,

292
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,868
I don't see any alternative.
Do you?

293
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:40,467
No. But there's a problem.

294
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,434
Tom Lennox is resigning.

295
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,000
When?

296
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,868
As soon as I write
his letter of resignation.

297
00:15:45,934 --> 00:15:48,868
Carson, if he goes,
I lose my job.

298
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:50,534
And I lose my access.

299
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,067
Our plan is contingent on your
proximity to the President.

300
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,734
We need you in place.

301
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,801
I know, I am very
well aware of that,

302
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,534
but Tom Lennox is
determined to quit.

303
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,634
He might reconsider
if he knew what was coming.

304
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,968
I suppose I could
feel him out.

305
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:06,100
Then do it, carefully.

306
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,734
We have to protect ourselves.

307
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,234
Has anything turned up
on CalTrans?

308
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,467
Without knowing what vehicle
McCarthy switched in to,

309
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:23,300
it's going to take hours
to scan through frame grabs.

310
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:27,067
Stay on it. Right now,
it's all we've got.

311
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,901
Mrs. Bauer.
Yes?

312
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:32,801
I'm Bill Buchanan,
Director of Operations.

313
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,601
You must be Josh.

314
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:39,501
May I speak with you a moment?

315
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,000
Privately.

316
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,767
Um...
It's okay, Mom.

317
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,801
Okay.

318
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,601
What is it?

319
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,534
I'm very sorry
to have to tell you.

320
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:04,434
Your husband is dead.

321
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:08,434
How?

322
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,200
He appears to have suffered
a heart attack.

323
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:13,834
What did Jack do to him?

324
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,801
I assure you there'll be
a thorough investigation.

325
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,834
Your father-in-law is
accompanying Graem's body here

326
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:20,367
for an autopsy.

327
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:22,300
Unless you have an objection.

328
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,934
No.

329
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:31,400
I have to tell my son.

330
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,033
Of course.

331
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:40,968
Josh.

332
00:17:41,033 --> 00:17:44,534
Your mother wants
to speak with you.

333
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:56,367
MARILYN:
He had a heart attack.

334
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:57,634
He died.

335
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,667
JOSH:
What? No.

336
00:17:59,734 --> 00:18:01,033
Pressman.

337
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
It's Jack.
Let me speak to Buchanan.

338
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,067
Hold on.
Sir... Jack's on the line.

339
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,067
Jack?

340
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,033
Bill, we found McCarthy's body

341
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,133
less than three blocks away
from the interchange.

342
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,901
We intercepted a call from LAPD.

343
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:17,801
The witness said
the shooter was a female,

344
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,701
drove off with a male
fitting Morris's description

345
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,000
in a silver pickup.

346
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,601
Did the witness get
a license plate?

347
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,501
No. But McCarthy
received a call

348
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,734
just about five minutes ago.

349
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,300
The caller ID is blocked.

350
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:31,434
I need you to trace
the source of the call.

351
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,534
You think the call
came from Fayed?
Yeah.

352
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:36,100
I'll give it to Milo as soon
as you upload the phone's data.

353
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,634
It's on its way.

354
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,367
Knock.

355
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,067
MAN:
What do you want?

356
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,300
I'm Darren McCarthy's associate.

357
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,567
I've got your package.

358
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,901
Who are you?

359
00:19:18,968 --> 00:19:21,434
Where's McCarthy?

360
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:22,934
He's waiting to
hear from me.

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,167
If he doesn't
get the money,

362
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,334
he gives you up.

363
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,968
This is the engineer?

364
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,267
Look, this... I don't know
what you're talking about.

365
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:31,734
I-I'm just a data analyst.

366
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:32,801
You've got the wrong man.

367
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,000
Look...

368
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:45,801
I've brought you
what you want.

369
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,033
Just give me the money,
and I'll go.

370
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,834
You'll get your money when
this man completes his task.

371
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,167
You work at CTU,

372
00:19:58,234 --> 00:20:01,734
so you know I have four nuclear
suitcase bombs in my possession.

373
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,634
You may also know these bombs
need to be reprogrammed

374
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,133
before I can use them.

375
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,634
You are here to create a device
that will allow me to do so.

376
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,501
(quivering):
Well, not bloody likely, mate.

377
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:32,400
You're going to modify this

378
00:20:32,467 --> 00:20:35,567
so that I can use it
to reprogram the bombs.

379
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,901
(inhales deeply):
No, I'm not.

380
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,601
--Bill, what's happening
with the phone trace?

381
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,768
BUCHANAN:
Milo's still
working on it, Jack.

382
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,200
What is it taking so long?

383
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,000
Checking into it now.

384
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:19,134
Milo...

385
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,667
what's your status?

386
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,868
All I've got is that the call
was made from a landline.

387
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:23,967
But the number
was routed through

388
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,267
at least a dozen
different servers,

389
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,300
and they keep cycling
back on each other.

390
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:29,367
(bangs table):
Come on!

391
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:30,834
Are you going to be able
to do this?

392
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,401
CHLOE:
Milo.

393
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:34,467
Let me try.

394
00:21:35,567 --> 00:21:37,100
I know I screwed up earlier.

395
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,801
I wasn't thinking clearly,
but let me try this.

396
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:40,134
I need to.

397
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,134
All right.

398
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,967
The number strings are
caught in a loop matrix.

399
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:49,933
CHLOE:
Did you try running a
SatCom overlay filter?

400
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,467
That only works on cell-to-cell
communication.

401
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:53,933
This call was placed
from a hardline.

402
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,501
NSA recently started using
satellite carrier systems

403
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,801
as a backup for
all phone traffic.

404
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,900
You just have to reconfigure
the embedded decryption program

405
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:04,100
to... Got it.

406
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:07,601
That's it.
All right.

407
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,834
McCarthy's call was made
from an apartment building:

408
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,933
4332 Florence Avenue.

409
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,067
Did you copy that, Jack?

410
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:14,467
Yeah, do we know
which apartment?

411
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,467
No, there's no way to tell;
they tapped directly

412
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:17,567
into the building's
trunk line.

413
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:18,801
Our men are ready to move.

414
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:20,033
Have tactical meet us
over there.

415
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,167
Tell them to set up a perimeter.

416
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:23,134
Stay out of sight.
Understood.

417
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,567
Good work, Milo.

418
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:35,134
Sir, it wasn't me.

419
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,567
If you think she's ready,
bring her back in.

420
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,501
Mr. Al-Assad...

421
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,634
right this way.

422
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,267
I've checked out
your background.

423
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:15,868
And despite my
understandable skepticism,

424
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:18,067
I do believe you're serious

425
00:23:18,134 --> 00:23:19,434
about wanting
this negotiated peace.

426
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,467
On my own terms, yes.

427
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,134
Let's table your terms
for the time being

428
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,167
while we discuss mine.

429
00:23:28,501 --> 00:23:31,234
My country, sir...

430
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,000
has suffered a nuclear attack
by the very same terrorists

431
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,501
who used to follow you.

432
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,501
Thousands of innocent
Americans are dead

433
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,167
or dying as we speak.

434
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:42,200
I'm aware of the tragedy
in California, Mr. President.

435
00:23:42,267 --> 00:23:43,634
I was there.

436
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:45,300
Then you understand,

437
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:47,467
that if Fayed
successfully detonates

438
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:49,734
any more nuclear weapons
on US soil,

439
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:51,834
there will be
no chance whatsoever

440
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,134
for a peace agreement.

441
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,933
The American people
are demanding

442
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,634
that we strike back.

443
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:01,300
And not just at organizations
such as yours,

444
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:04,467
but at the governments
that support them.

445
00:24:04,534 --> 00:24:08,167
Now, if just one more nuke
goes off, one more,

446
00:24:08,234 --> 00:24:09,367
we won't have a choice.

447
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:10,834
You understand me?

448
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,434
We're talking about war.

449
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:16,534
You don't have to tell me
what is at stake,

450
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:20,033
but I still don't understand
what you want from me.

451
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,300
I would like you
to appear on television

452
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,967
and make a public address
to the world.

453
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,033
Declare your intentions
for peace,

454
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,434
and appeal to members

455
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,834
of Islamic communities
everywhere to come forward

456
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,601
with any information
regarding Fayed.

457
00:24:32,667 --> 00:24:36,234
You flatter me if you think
I hold sway over all Islam.

458
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,667
No, sir, not all.

459
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:40,834
Just the extremists who share
your hatred of the West.

460
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,000
I certainly can't reach out
to them for help,

461
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:44,334
but I know you can.

462
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,634
But perception is everything,
Mr. President.

463
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,334
So I must present my agenda

464
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,067
to my own people
in my own time,

465
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:53,601
not by appearing on American
television from The White House.

466
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,634
Fayed has already
called me a traitor,

467
00:24:56,701 --> 00:24:58,701
and many others will follow him

468
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:01,167
if there is even a suspicion
that I am an American puppet.

469
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:03,033
Not a puppet,
a partner, at least

470
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,167
when it comes to finding
these nuclear weapons.

471
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:08,167
Now, that's what we have to be
for your peace initiative

472
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:09,401
to have any chance
of working,

473
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,033
so get used to it!

474
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,801
Now, between you
and me, sir,

475
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:15,434
I really don't give a damn
how and when you wanted

476
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:18,801
to present your agenda;
the time is now.

477
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,267
You want to lead
this peace initiative...

478
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,267
then lead.

479
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,100
Who's in command?

480
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,100
Agent Turner.

481
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,300
Agent Turner, what's the status

482
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,667
of your perimeter?
It's in place.

483
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:38,434
We've got agents
in plainclothes

484
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:39,734
covering the exits
to the building,

485
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:41,634
and we have three TAC teams
in position to move in

486
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,000
on your command.

487
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,334
Do you have confirmation
that Fayed's in the building?

488
00:25:44,401 --> 00:25:46,334
Not directly, but
the building manager ID'd

489
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:48,200
Morris O'Brian entering
the building

490
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:49,933
with a woman less
than 20 minutes ago.

491
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,334
We assume the woman
is the driver

492
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:53,234
your witness saw
shoot McCarthy.

493
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,534
There are no cameras
in the building.

494
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,834
We don't know what apartment
or floor they're on.

495
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,834
CTU is patched in
and awaiting your word.

496
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,534
Thank you.

497
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:06,434
Turn it on.

498
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,267
Bill, it's Jack. Do you copy?

499
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:12,401
Yes, Jack. Go ahead.

500
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:13,701
I'm at the staging area.

501
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:14,734
We have a confirmation

502
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:16,100
that Morris is
inside the building.

503
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,200
We do not have
confirmation on Fayed.

504
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,634
There are no cameras
in the building.

505
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:20,734
Do have infrared satellite?

506
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,100
We can't get a live feed,

507
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,033
but we do have a satellite
in position uploading images

508
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,467
at five-minute intervals.

509
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:28,167
The latest scan shows 215 people
in the building,

510
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:30,334
spread out over six floors
and 112 apartments.

511
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,601
It's going to take too long
to go room by room.

512
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,067
We're going to have to
figure out another way ID them.

513
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,634
Is this building on the city's
emergency services grid?

514
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:43,367
Yes, Jack. All buildings over
ten units are required to.

515
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:46,467
Chloe, it's good
to have you back.

516
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:47,933
I'm to need you to get
into their system,

517
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,501
and trigger an
all-building fire alarm.

518
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,667
Okay, we just have to get past
their log-in screen.

519
00:26:51,734 --> 00:26:53,367
Let me know
when you're ready.

520
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,467
Agent.

521
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:23,434
Please...

522
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:25,467
please, stop.

523
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:29,100
Just indicate you'll do what
I've asked, and we will stop.

524
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,234
People are leaving the building.

525
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,534
There really is a fire.

526
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:41,067
What do we do?

527
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,634
There's no fire.

528
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:49,467
CTU knows we're here.

529
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,601
I really need
to get out of here.

530
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,801
Shut up!

531
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:02,067
Up against the wall.

532
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,100
Your time is up!

533
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:39,200
I will use this
all over your body

534
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:41,234
until you die of
shock or blood loss.

535
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,067
Then I'll just find someone else
to do what I need.

536
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:47,834
Do you understand?

537
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:53,534
Look, please...

538
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:55,534
I don't care about the money.

539
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,868
I made a mistake.

540
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:00,734
Just let me get out of here.

541
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:02,834
Please.

542
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,234
So, you give up
the seven million, huh?

543
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,868
Yes.

544
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,834
Okay.

545
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,667
Oh!

546
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:35,067
Stop... stop!

547
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:41,868
I'll do it.

548
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,468
--Come in.

549
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,167
This memo says Palmer's
arranging

550
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:08,934
for Assad to make
a televised statement.

551
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,667
I heard.

552
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:12,834
Not only are we providing
free airtime

553
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,700
to a mass murderer
and a vowed enemy of democracy,

554
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,568
we are proving terrorism works.

555
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:25,301
You have my letter
of resignation?

556
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,367
No, sir, I don't.

557
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,201
Why not?

558
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,134
Because you can't resign

559
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:33,534
while this country is
being brought to the brink

560
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,301
of a nuclear holocaust
by a weak, misguided President.

561
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:39,633
Damn it, Reed. I explained...

562
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,568
I cannot get the President
to budge on policy.

563
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,000
There's nothing I can do
about this.

564
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:50,201
What if I told you that
the climate could change?

565
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,134
What does that even mean,
the climate?

566
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:57,134
Well, I'm just saying that
there are people who believe,

567
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:59,834
like you, that more

568
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,067
aggressive steps need
to be taken to crack down

569
00:31:02,134 --> 00:31:04,900
on terrorism, both here
at home and abroad,

570
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:07,334
and that a change in leadership
is imperative

571
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:09,967
to ensure
this nation's security.

572
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,867
Um...

573
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:19,201
Who?

574
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:21,967
Excuse me, sir?

575
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:24,733
Who are these like-minded people
we're talking about?

576
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,234
I was... I'm just
speaking abstractly.

577
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:31,034
But you'd have
to agree that, uh...

578
00:31:31,101 --> 00:31:33,234
your plan would have
all the support it needed

579
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:36,501
if the Vice President were the
man occupying the Oval Office.

580
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:38,234
Wait...

581
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:40,034
Now, I may dislike

582
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:42,034
the President's current course
of action.

583
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:45,101
I hardly think
it warrants his, his removal.

584
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,767
I'm not talking
about holding hearings.

585
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:50,000
Something more

586
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:51,667
immediate would have to happen.

587
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,234
Oh, my God...

588
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,834
You can't possibly be intimating
what I think you are.

589
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,134
I'm not intimating anything.

590
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:12,967
I'm just simply musing.

591
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:16,367
Careful.

592
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,867
That kind of musing

593
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,934
can get you thrown
into prison for treason.

594
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,134
Well, I'm sorry, sir,

595
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:26,733
that you've misunderstood me.

596
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,934
Yeah, I certainly hope so,
for your sake.

597
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,267
All right.

598
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:34,534
I think you have a letter
to draft for me.

599
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,267
FIREFIGHTER (on bullhorn):
You need to keep

600
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,067
a safe distance
away from the building

601
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,767
until we have determined

602
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,468
there is no danger.

603
00:32:53,534 --> 00:32:56,568
Please move across the street
away from the building.

604
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,767
Anything from your men
on the ground?

605
00:32:58,834 --> 00:33:00,600
They've looked at everyone
who's exited the building.

606
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,767
There's no sign
of Fayed or O'Brian.

607
00:33:02,834 --> 00:33:04,134
If they were inside

608
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:06,568
when the alarm went off,
they're still in there.

609
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,600
Damn it.

610
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,000
BUCHANAN:
Jack, it's Bill.
Go ahead.

611
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,301
We've got the latest infrared.

612
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,733
We're mirroring it
to your screen.

613
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,167
Hold on.

614
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:16,867
I've got it.
I'm looking at it now.

615
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:18,534
Okay, there's three people
left in the apartments

616
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,367
on the second, fourth
and sixth floors.

617
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:21,600
We need to narrow that down.

618
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:22,834
Chloe, who's renting
those apartments?

619
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,167
Superimposing building

620
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:26,034
department schematics
and cross-referencing

621
00:33:26,101 --> 00:33:28,034
with phone company
and police records now.

622
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:35,201
Okay, the woman on the second
floor is handicapped.

623
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:37,667
She probably didn't leave
because she can't.

624
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,234
The other two apartments
are occupied

625
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:41,667
by single males;
the man on the fourth floor
has been arrested

626
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,667
several times
for distribution of narcotics.

627
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:46,000
Fayed wouldn't use anyone
with a criminal record

628
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,401
to set up a safe house.

629
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:48,934
Our hostiles are
in the sixth floor apartment.

630
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Get your men ready.
We're moving in.

631
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:51,834
All right, let's go!

632
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,367
How much longer?

633
00:33:58,434 --> 00:34:01,101
I don't know.

634
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:02,934
McCarthy said this is
a few minutes' work

635
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,167
for an advanced programmer.

636
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:06,401
You're stalling for time.
I am not.

637
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:08,401
It'll be ready
in a minute.

638
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,468
Most everybody seems to have
evacuated the building.

639
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,434
Which is how they intend
to find us.

640
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:16,967
At this point it's only
a question of time.

641
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:41,800
Go.

642
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:45,800
It's done?

643
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,767
Yes.

644
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:50,101
Bring it.

645
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:01,700
You have the bombs here?
Just one.

646
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,301
Let's see if you did
your work correctly.

647
00:35:08,434 --> 00:35:10,401
Arm it.

648
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:12,534
Arm it!

649
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,201
Very good.

650
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:37,934
Kill him.

651
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:40,401
Please, I did what

652
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:42,501
you asked, didn't I?

653
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,967
Now.

654
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:24,867
All agents sound off!

655
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:26,267
Clear.

656
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,301
AGENT:
We're clear.

657
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,633
We took a head count
of the bodies.

658
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
One hostile's missing;
we haven't found Fayed.

659
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,600
It's clear, sir.

660
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,267
Have your men maintain
the search for Fayed.

661
00:36:52,334 --> 00:36:53,867
I want them to identify
every possible exit

662
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,733
from this apartment.
Yes, sir.

663
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,401
What's his status?
Unconscious, but alive.

664
00:36:58,468 --> 00:36:59,633
Chloe, it's Jack.

665
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,733
Morris has been injured,
but he's alive.

666
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,534
Mr. Bauer, you need to see this.

667
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:43,867
(into earpiece):
CTU, this is Bauer.

668
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:57,501
--Jack, be careful.
The bomb has a fail-safe device

669
00:37:57,568 --> 00:37:59,067
that prevents any forced entry.

670
00:37:59,134 --> 00:38:00,834
Through the glass casing I have

671
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,367
two small metal plates slowly
converging on each other.

672
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:05,434
Those are the trigger plates,
Jack; once they touch

673
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:07,167
an electrical charge
will detonate the core

674
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:09,167
causing the nuke to explode.

675
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:10,367
How far apart are they?

676
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:13,234
Approximately three inches.

677
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:15,867
Okay, that gives us
only about three minutes.

678
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:17,534
There's a small metal box
to the right of it.

679
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,900
You need to carefully
unscrew the top of it.

680
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,067
Copy that.

681
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,434
AGENT TURNER:
Agent Bauer, we know
how Fayed got out.

682
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:33,468
They opened up a wall
in one of the closets

683
00:38:33,534 --> 00:38:36,067
to get access to the building's
ventilation system.

684
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:37,267
From there, Fayed could get
to the basement,

685
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:38,667
and, in turn, the sewer tunnels.

686
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,667
Did you mobilize your teams
and set up a perimeter?

687
00:38:40,733 --> 00:38:42,867
Yes, sir. But we believe
Fayed's already gone.

688
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:44,867
Witnesses report
a helicopter taking off

689
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:46,334
from a nearby field
a few minutes ago.

690
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:48,101
It appeared to be
a medical evac chopper,

691
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:49,568
so it got through our net.

692
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,101
Damn it.

693
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:02,501
The top's off.

694
00:39:02,568 --> 00:39:04,000
Come on, Chloe.

695
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:06,167
We are running out of time.

696
00:39:06,234 --> 00:39:07,934
Okay, under the gears
you should see four wires.

697
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,167
Short-circuit each of them.
That should stop

698
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:11,434
the left gear from rotating.

699
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,367
You can access the dip switches
underneath it

700
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:16,501
to open the case and manually
stop the trigger.

701
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:24,067
Okay, the left gear
stopped moving.

702
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:26,201
I see the dip switches.
They're all in the up position.

703
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:27,834
What's next?
Um...

704
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,301
Switch three and four
to the down position.

705
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:46,834
Nothing happened.
The case didn't open.

706
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,767
It didn't?
That's what I said.
It didn't open.

707
00:39:48,834 --> 00:39:50,501
Hold on.

708
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,267
(bomb buzzing)
Chloe, we are
almost out of time.

709
00:39:53,334 --> 00:39:54,501
Okay, I have an updated

710
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:55,967
schematic.

711
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:57,767
It wasn't switches
three and four.

712
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,000
You need to push four and five
to the down position,

713
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,367
and the cover will open.
Are you sure this time?

714
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:05,367
I'm about as sure as I'm going
to be before this bomb goes off.

715
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,234
It's done.

716
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:42,667
The bomb is disarmed.

717
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,834
Notify your men the
bomb's been deactivated.

718
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,334
It's over.
MORRIS:
It's not over.

719
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:57,267
What are you talking about?

720
00:40:57,334 --> 00:41:00,267
The reprogramming device
that Fayed had me build for him.

721
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:02,201
If it's not here,
it means he took it with him.

722
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:05,201
And with it,

723
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:06,867
he can activate
the other bombs he has

724
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,067
anytime he wants.

725
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:11,234
You gave him something
that worked?

726
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:12,867
I'm sorry, Jack.

727
00:41:12,934 --> 00:41:15,000
CTU, did you copy that?

728
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:16,434
BUCHANAN:
We got it, Jack.

729
00:41:16,501 --> 00:41:17,867
Alert the President
immediately.

730
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,767
Organize two teams:
one to search the apartment,

731
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:21,600
one to search
around the building.

732
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,367
Agent O'Brian will tell you

733
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:25,034
what you're looking for.
Yes, sir.

734
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,967
Yes, sir.

735
00:41:58,034 --> 00:42:00,401
You see this flash report
in from CTU?

736
00:42:00,468 --> 00:42:01,600
I'm reading it now.

737
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,067
They let Fayed slip

738
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,134
through their fingers... again.

739
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:07,101
Apparently he now has
the capability

740
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:10,600
to arm these remaining
suitcase nukes.

741
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:13,600
This situation is
immeasurably worse.

742
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,534
You know my letter
of resignation?

743
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,967
Have you got that?

744
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,434
Yes, I just, uh...

745
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,934
I just finished
printing it.

746
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,367
I can bring it over
to you right now.

747
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:22,633
No, no, no.

748
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,167
No, just tear that up.

749
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:25,834
What?

750
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:29,767
Um...

751
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:31,434
That talk we were
having in my office,

752
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:33,134
I don't think
I misunderstood you.

753
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:37,067
And I...

754
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:39,767
would like to discuss
this... further.

755
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,034
Not on this phone.

756
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:45,900
I'll let you know
when I have a secure location.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
