1
00:00:02,901 --> 00:00:07,901

2
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:12,901

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,301
Abu Fayed,

4
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,800
a citizen of your country,

5
00:00:15,867 --> 00:00:17,067
enters the United States,

6
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:18,734
detonates a nuclear bomb

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,067
killing thousands.

8
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:23,034
Next, Assad attempts
to assassinate the president.

9
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,567
AMBASSADOR:
 <i>You know fully well</i>
 <i>that we have cooperated</i>

10
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,800
with you since
the inception of this crisis.

11
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:29,834
I had an understanding
with your president.

12
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,667
And now you're going
to have one with me.

13
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,500
You help us find those nukes
before another goes off,

14
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,901
or I'm going to unleash
the full power of our military

15
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,533
on your country.

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,533
VASILI:
I'm terminating the American.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,201
Do you confirm?

18
00:00:42,268 --> 00:00:43,500
Yes.

19
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:47,500
(grunting)

20
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,433
MARKOV:
 <i>The American has shot Vasili.</i>

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,667
He's in the basement.

22
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,101
Shut down the phone lines, DSL,

23
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:54,867
 <i>everything!</i>

24
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,500
JACK:
 <i>Morris, it's Jack.</i>

25
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:59,001
I know how
to find Gredenko.

26
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:00,001
He's in the...
(dial tone)

27
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:00,967
Morris?

28
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:03,368
Jack? Jack?

29
00:01:04,934 --> 00:01:06,167
Jack Bauer's currently
being held captive 

30
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,533
in the Russian consulate.

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Doyle will help you
put a tactical profile together

32
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:12,334
for an assault on the consulate.

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,767
DOYLE:
 <i>Our primary objective</i>

34
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,767
is to abduct Anatoly Markov,
the consul.

35
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,268
According to Jack, Markov knows
how to find Gredenko,

36
00:01:19,334 --> 00:01:22,201
who controls the remaining
three suitcase nukes.

37
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:23,800
The Americans are coming in.

38
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:25,567
I thought you had that
under control.

39
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,101
 <i>Won't be long</i>
 <i>before they have your position.</i>

40
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:29,634
This drone is ready to launch.

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,201
Arm the bomb.

42
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:32,867
What's going on
at the Russian consulate?

43
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:35,067
Jack Bauer's still at large
and somewhere inside.

44
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:37,467
 <i>We have to go in.</i>

45
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:45,567
Drop your weapon!

46
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,500
My name is Jack Bauer.

47
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,334
You need to contact
Bill Buchanan.

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,901
Tell him that
Fayed and Gredenko

49
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:54,934
are in the Shadow Valley.

50
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,700
Patch me in
with Buchanan.

51
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:10,533
(indistinct radio transmissions)

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,001
Medevac's on the way.

53
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:26,134
How you holding up?

54
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,634
I'm fine.
Doc?

55
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,268
He may have floating
rib fragments 

56
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:31,334
which could cause
internal bleeding.

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
He needs
to be stabilized.

58
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,268
Agent Doyle,
I told you I'm fine.

59
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,600
I want to be involved
in this mission.

60
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,600
CTU has the ball, Jack.

61
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,634
Right now, this is out
of your hands.

62
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,301
We now believe Gredenko
is in possession

63
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,268
of at least five
RQ-2 Aerial Drones

64
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:52,533
(over speakerphone):
somewhere in Shadow Valley.

65
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,834
RQ-2s?

66
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:55,368
Unmanned stealth aircraft

67
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:58,067
which can be remotely piloted
from anywhere in the world.

68
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,467
And Gredenko's arming them

69
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,700
with the nuclear weapons
he provided to Fayed?

70
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:03,201
Yes, sir.

71
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,467
We're redirecting satellite
coverage over the Mojave Desert,

72
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,834
and the Air Force is scrambling
F-16s from Edwards.

73
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,433
But you have no idea how
close Fayed and Gredenko are

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,834
to launching
these drones?

75
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:12,867
No, sir, we don't.

76
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,867
(sighs):
All right, Bill.

77
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:16,533
You keep me updated.

78
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,901
Yes, sir.

79
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,800
GREDENKO:
Bring the trucks around.

80
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:26,600
We are moving out now.

81
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,867
What's wrong?

82
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,767
How many drones
have been armed?

83
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,001
Just this one.

84
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,368
GREDENKO:
Damn it.

85
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,901
We need to launch it now.

86
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:36,368
Get it ready.

87
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,500
Go, go.

88
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,001
Tell me what's wrong.

89
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,001
What's wrong?

90
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:45,334
The Americans
know our location.

91
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,001
How?

92
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:48,600
It was Markov, huh?

93
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,201
Markov told them.

94
00:03:51,268 --> 00:03:54,167
All that matters is
that they know we are here.

95
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,234
We need to launch the drone
before they close in.

96
00:03:57,301 --> 00:04:00,167
We have three bombs
and three targets.

97
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:03,234
We'll find a way to deliver
the other two bombs.

98
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:09,034
All this time we've tolerated
your condescension,

99
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:11,334
berating us for losing
the other bombs.

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,301
But now it's your fault.

101
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,234
Markov was your man.

102
00:04:15,301 --> 00:04:17,433
Blame me all you want,
but if we stay here,

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,400
we'll be captured
or killed.

104
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:25,234
Refit the other bombs
into their casings

105
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:26,567
and load them on the truck.

106
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,234
Do it now!

107
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,967
Take them out!

108
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,600
We're accelerating our schedule.

109
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,301
Why?

110
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:36,834
I don't have time to explain.

111
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:41,134
I need you to launch
drone 0-7-0-9.

112
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,167
I haven't finished implementing
the evasion vectors.

113
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,567
They'll shoot it down
before it reaches its target.

114
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,500
Launch the drone.

115
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:51,767
You'll execute evasion tactics
once it's in the air.

116
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,834
Yes, sir.

117
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,567
(engine whooshing)

118
00:05:25,734 --> 00:05:27,934
We need to leave now.

119
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,967
Come on, let's go.

120
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,034
We're repositioning
our satellites

121
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:39,500
as fast as we can, sir.

122
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:40,800
As soon as we make
visual contact,

123
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:41,967
we'll uplink a real-time feed

124
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,600
to your command.
(quietly):
Here.

125
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,667
(over phone):
Lives are at stake, Yassir.
Get me that intel.

126
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:47,467
Yes, sir.

127
00:05:49,101 --> 00:05:50,834
You okay?

128
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,600
The truth? No, not really.

129
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,967
Hey.

130
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,901
We're going to get
through this, okay?

131
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,234
I hope so.

132
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,901
Is there
a problem, Chloe?

133
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,500
Yeah.

134
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,368
Are you going to tell us
what it is?

135
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:15,001
I was installing
security upgrades,

136
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,334
and I noticed you were using
Milo's clearance code.

137
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,334
Which, in case
you didn't know,

138
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,268
is a felony security breach.

139
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:23,167
No, it must be a mistake.

140
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:24,867
My system's been glitchy,
and I think I...

141
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,201
It's not a glitch, Milo.

142
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:28,101
Nadia's been working
with your user I.D.

143
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,034
So unless she stole it,
you gave it to her.

144
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:33,167
Milo was just trying
to help me do my work.
Nadia...

145
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:34,934
Homeland Security
sent down

146
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,834
an order restricting
my security access

147
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:39,034
because I was born
in the Middle East.

148
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:42,533
I've heard of that directive,
and I think it's wrong for us

149
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,667
to be racially profiling our
own agents, but it's still

150
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:47,234
a felony security breach
for you to be using Milo's code.

151
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,334
Chloe...

152
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,667
If you report this,

153
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,700
we can't help the situation

154
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,800
if we're fired and arrested.

155
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,901
If I wanted to report you,
I wouldn't be talking to you.

156
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,533
I'm telling you this so
that you'll be careful.

157
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,268
I mean, I noticed it.

158
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:08,101
Someone else is going
to notice it sooner or later.

159
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:14,467
BUCHANAN:
Nadia?

160
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,301
Yes, sir.

161
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:18,067
Morris has a satellite visual
on Shadow Valley.

162
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:21,268
It looks like the terrorists
have launched a single drone.

163
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:23,334
I'm conferencing
with General Walsh now.

164
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,634
I'll be right there, sir.

165
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,001
Coordinate with first-responders
in all target zones.

166
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,067
Put General Walsh through.

167
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:31,634
You're on with
Bill Buchanan, sir.

168
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,400
This is Walsh.

169
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,433
BUCHANAN:
General, we've made visual
contact with a single drone.

170
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,001
We're tracking it on satellite.

171
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:40,268
It's heading on a northwest
vector out of Shadow Valley.

172
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,400
Altitude is 3,300 feet
and climbing.

173
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,600
Velocity is 360 miles an hour.

174
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:47,234
I'm looking at the specs
on the RQ-2 now.

175
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,634
It's got a
low-profile design,

176
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,433
virtually impossible
to detect by radar.

177
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,268
We'll need to manually guide
our F-16s to intercept.

178
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:56,700
We're uplinking
a video feed to you now.

179
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,800
Have you determined
its intended target?

180
00:07:58,867 --> 00:07:59,967
Yes. This is Nadia Yassir.

181
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:01,734
The closest target
is downtown Los Angeles.

182
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,201
That's a four-minute window.

183
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:07,368
Maximum airspeed of an RQ-2
is 400 miles per hour.

184
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,767
My F-16s should be able to
intercept it within two minutes.

185
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:14,268
MORRIS:
Um...

186
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:15,268
that may be a problem.

187
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,167
I can't find the drone.

188
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,767
The drone's gone.

189
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,800
How can it be gone?

190
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,067
It was passing between grids,

191
00:08:24,134 --> 00:08:25,301
but when I switched
satellites...

192
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,967
Readjust based on
projected vectors.

193
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,301
I'm doing that now, General,

194
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:29,800
it's just not where
it's supposed to be.

195
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:33,634
Until you find it, I'll have my
F-16s stay in a holding pattern.

196
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,600
(beeping)

197
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,368
Yes?

198
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,800
I've accessed our connection
to CTU.

199
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:46,201
I've disabled
their tracking capability.

200
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:47,400
Then they cannot

201
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,301
detect the drone?

202
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:51,334
No. And I'll be able
to keep it hidden

203
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,467
from their satellites until
we've hit the target.

204
00:08:54,533 --> 00:09:00,667
Good. I'll contact you again
once we are out of the area.

205
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:06,268
Sir, I was just talking
to Bill Buchanan at CTU.

206
00:09:06,334 --> 00:09:08,001
They were tracking
one of the drones.

207
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:09,700
They've now lost
visual contact with it.

208
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,234
Lost visual contact?

209
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,433
Yeah, it's unclear

210
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,667
just how, sir.

211
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,500
They just simply
can't find it.

212
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:17,867
We have the most sophisticated
satellite network in the world.

213
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,600
How the hell did this happen?

214
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,334
CTU is still trying
to determine that, sir.

215
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,268
What about
the military?

216
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:25,767
Well, they've got three
squadrons looking for it,

217
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,034
but these drones
are invisible

218
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,567
to radar, so the pilots
are limited to making

219
00:09:29,634 --> 00:09:32,867
visual ID at night
over hundreds of square miles.

220
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,967
Now, CTU has a ranked list

221
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,400
of potential
targets.

222
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,400
They're running civil
disaster scenarios...

223
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:40,600
Lisa?

224
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:41,901
Sir?

225
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,634
Advance the meeting
with the Joint Chiefs.

226
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,867
When do you want
it to happen?

227
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:47,467
Right away.

228
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:49,134
Wait, sir. Why...

229
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,901
Why are we assembling
the Joint Chiefs?

230
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:53,201
I warned
the ambassador, Tom.

231
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:54,800
You heard me tell him

232
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,433
that I'd hold his country
responsible

233
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,867
if another nuclear weapon
was detonated on our soil.

234
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,867
Sir, there's
absolutely no evidence

235
00:10:02,934 --> 00:10:06,067
that his country
either sponsored these attacks

236
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:07,901
or is even in support of them.

237
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:09,967
His people need
to understand

238
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:12,500
that I'm not just
rattling my saber.

239
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:13,834
They need to see

240
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:16,368
with their own eyes
that I will answer this threat

241
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,901
with an in-kind
military response.

242
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,301
Wait.

243
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:25,167
"In kind," sir?

244
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:27,167
I want the Joint Chiefs

245
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:31,134
to draw up our own target list
for a nuclear strike.

246
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:59,901
--At its rated speed, the drone
should have reached Los Angeles,

247
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,967
so we can eliminate us
as a target.

248
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:03,867
In the next few minutes,
I can take Santa Barbara

249
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:05,334
and San Diego off the list.

250
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:07,368
How many targets does that leave
within the drone's range?

251
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,567
Counting cities with populations
over a million...

252
00:11:10,634 --> 00:11:11,767
fifteen.

253
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:13,667
We have to narrow it down.

254
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:16,533
Assuming they want the maximum
civilian death toll,

255
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,967
how many likely targets
within the drone's range?

256
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,101
Areas with the highest
population density are

257
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,967
San Francisco, Las Vegas
and Phoenix.

258
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:26,400
Confirm that NEST teams and
First Responders have deployed

259
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:27,734
in those cities.

260
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,234
Morris, make sure the
Air Force prioritizes

261
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:33,101
their search
on that basis.
Yup.

262
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,234
(gasps)

263
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:37,268
Give me the projected
coordinates.

264
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,101
Bill.

265
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,334
Bill, did we pick up
Gredenko?

266
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,433
We're working on it.

267
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,567
Bill, what happened?

268
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,600
Gredenko escaped.

269
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,734
But not before
launching one

270
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,867
of the drones.

271
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:54,334
How close is the Air Force
to intercepting it?

272
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,767
F-16s were minutes away,
then the drone disappeared

273
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:57,433
from the satellite grid;
we're still looking for it.

274
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,867
Jack.

275
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,268
Get to medical.

276
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:02,500
There's nothing
you can do here.

277
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,301
Just keep me
informed, please.
I will.

278
00:12:04,368 --> 00:12:07,134
Doyle, I want you
to run point

279
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:08,567
on the search for
Fayed and Gredenko.

280
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,901
Milo's monitoring from
the Situation Room.

281
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,268
I'll be right there.

282
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:22,167
I'll see you over at Medical.

283
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,134
Hey.
Hey.

284
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,834
Could we have a moment, please?

285
00:12:26,901 --> 00:12:28,234
They said you
were hurt.

286
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,268
I'm, I'm fine.

287
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,600
As soon as all
of this is over,

288
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,634
I'll come by and check
on you and Josh.

289
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:46,167
I always regretted things didn't
work out between us...

290
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:48,700
and...

291
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,234
I always believed
you did, too.

292
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:01,134
Maybe I was wrong.

293
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:04,334
No, you weren't.

294
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,268
Listen, Marilyn,

295
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:10,767
before I was taken prisoner
by the Chinese...

296
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,934
I, I was with someone.

297
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,034
She doesn't even know
I'm still alive, but...

298
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:19,167
I need to talk to her...

299
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:21,234
see what happens.

300
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,034
Are you talking
about Audrey Raines?

301
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,067
Yeah.

302
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,467
You don't know.

303
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:33,567
Do you?
(sighs)

304
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,234
Jack, I'm...

305
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:38,467
I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this...

306
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,634
Audrey's dead.

307
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,834
I don't know all the details,
I just know what I read

308
00:13:44,901 --> 00:13:46,334
in the paper
about her accident.

309
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,667
What accident? When?

310
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,500
It was a few months ago.

311
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,500
It was a car accident.

312
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,567
Somewhere in China.

313
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,934
China.

314
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,400
Excuse me.

315
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm sorry.

316
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,567
I have to go.

317
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,600
(panting)

318
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,700
CHLOE:
There'll be separate
channels open

319
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,467
for all First Responders
in at-risk cities...

320
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:18,101
All First Responders
should coordi...

321
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,901
Why the hell didn't anybody
tell me about Audrey?

322
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,034
Mr. Buchanan didn't want to tell
you when you first got back,

323
00:14:25,101 --> 00:14:26,201
because we all thought

324
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,734
Fayed was just going
to kill you.

325
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,067
But I probably should have.

326
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:32,400
I'm sorry.

327
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,368
She was in China looking for me?

328
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:35,800
She was the one
who figured out

329
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:36,967
the Chinese had taken you.

330
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:38,268
Apparently she spent
the past year

331
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,567
going through
back channels,

332
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:40,800
to try to get you out.

333
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,934
The rest of it's
classified by Division,

334
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,268
I don't know any more.

335
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:45,700
We were asked

336
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:46,800
to send the DNA records,

337
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,433
so that they could
get a positive ID

338
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,268
on the remains...
which I guess they did.

339
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,600
I want that file.

340
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,667
All right, Jack.

341
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,301
Now!

342
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:58,001
I have to dig it up
in archives.

343
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,201
Just do it.

344
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,600
The Secretary of Defense

345
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,634
and the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs
will be attending

346
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,500
in person, the State
will be monitoring
via satellite.

347
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,368
And the rest of the
Cabinet will be provided

348
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:20,234
with video
transcripts.
Good.

349
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,834
You should also know that
Karen Hayes will be attending.

350
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,734
I thought I told you I wanted
her excluded from this.

351
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:31,001
She supported Wayne Palmer's
policy of appeasement.

352
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,600
She's going to be a problem.

353
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,433
Well, there was nothing
I could do.

354
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,667
She's still acting

355
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,901
National Security
Advisor.

356
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:39,834
But I've only given her
current circumstances.

357
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,368
Any objection to your plans will
not be able to gain traction.

358
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:43,634
(chuckles)

359
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,134
Oh, I've known Karen Hayes
for many years.

360
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,967
It's always been a mistake
to underestimate...

361
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:52,934
her.

362
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,001
Hello, Tom.

363
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:01,034
Somebody push
you down the stairs?

364
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:03,600
No, Karen, I tripped
over your ineptitude.

365
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,634
On that subject,
welcome back.

366
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Look, Tom,
I don't want to play games.

367
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,067
I won't let you
blackmail me again.

368
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:12,700
So you do what you need to do,

369
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,400
I am here to represent
the President,

370
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,167
and I intend to stay.

371
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:17,533
All right, fair enough.

372
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,001
Karen.

373
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,901
No one is sorrier than I am

374
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:23,301
about what happened to Wayne.

375
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:27,201
Well, at least we have that
in common.

376
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,934
Please be seated.

377
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,067
As many of you
are already aware,

378
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:55,600
the terrorist who attacked us
this morning,

379
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,934
Abu Fayed, with the help
of Dmitri Gredenko,

380
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,400
has launched an aerial drone
that we believe is armed

381
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,867
with another nuclear bomb.

382
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,334
Efforts are ongoing
to locate this drone.

383
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,734
But should
those efforts fail,

384
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,901
we are looking at a second
nuclear attack on our country

385
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:14,934
in less than ten hours.

386
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,867
And I am determined

387
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,767
not to let this
attack happen

388
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:22,134
without a military response
on our part.

389
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,934
A military response
directed against

390
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:27,001
whom, Mr. Vice
President?

391
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,301
We were under the impression

392
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,334
that these terrorists were
essentially stateless.

393
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,934
Secretary Kanin, that is
the fiction they hide behind.

394
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,600
But...

395
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,201
everyone in this room knows

396
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:39,433
that elements within
Abu Fayed's country

397
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,001
train and fund terrorist
organizations like his.

398
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:43,167
It is time

399
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,734
to hold them
accountable.

400
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
The Ambassador
has just been informed

401
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,600
that if the nuclear weapon

402
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,301
on that drone detonates,

403
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:54,034
we will retaliate
with our own nuclear strike.

404
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:55,301
Now this will be

405
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:58,400
a warning shot, not
a full-scale attack.

406
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:01,800
The Joint Chiefs have been
instructed to identify

407
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,934
an unpopulated area

408
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,500
where there will be limited
civilian casualties.

409
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,667
Admiral.

410
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:10,700
The closest match
we have 

411
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:13,268
to that scenario
is territory near
their northern border.

412
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,368
We believe this should result
in fewer than 2,000 deaths.

413
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:19,034
Long-term damage from
radioactive fallout, however,

414
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:21,500
could double that number,
depending on ground conditions.

415
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,834
I can accept that.

416
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,334
Mr. Vice President,

417
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,101
I'm sure you're aware
that our intelligence suggests

418
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,334
that their government
can't control

419
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,467
Fayed either.

420
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:32,101
They are doing the best
that they can.

421
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:36,134
And I'm saying they need to
figure out a way to do better.

422
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,734
Something tells me

423
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,034
that once this bomb hits,
they will.

424
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,634
If this bomb hits,
the opposite will hold true.

425
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,101
The moderates will be driven
from power,

426
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,600
the terrorists' position
will be strengthened there

427
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,467
and in the region,
and I don't hear anyone

428
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:53,001
talking about the Chinese
or Russian response to this.

429
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,467
We could start another
world war.

430
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,533
If I thought there was a high
likelihood of that,

431
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,234
I wouldn't be suggesting this.

432
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:00,867
Mr. Vice President,

433
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:03,533
the stakes are too high
for this decision to be based

434
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,567
on your personal
judgment.

435
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:07,167
It is my opinion

436
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:11,134
that this course of action would
be dangerous and reckless.

437
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:15,067
Consider your concern
registered, Karen.

438
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:20,700
But the debate is over.

439
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,400
America must start

440
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,901
to stand up
for herself.

441
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,734
The attacks on this
country must stop!

442
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,433
And as acting
Commander In Chief,

443
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,268
I believe this is the best way
to make that happen.

444
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,767
Admiral,

445
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:42,067
have a nuclear strike sub
standing by.

446
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,867
--Nadia?

447
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,300
I never got those SIM files
you were gonna send me.

448
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,867
Oh, yeah, your system
was overloaded.

449
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:10,200
So I gave them to Morris,

450
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,267
he's going to take care
of it for you.
Morris?

451
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,068
Yeah.

452
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:16,168
I mean, you really think
he can handle it?

453
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:19,034
Well, he seems
to be himself again.

454
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:22,867
Is he himself because he had
a drink and he smoothed out?

455
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,467
I don't think so.

456
00:20:31,034 --> 00:20:32,034
Hey.

457
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,434
What are you doing?

458
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,467
Setting up a reverse
data stream on the drone's

459
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,200
satellite intel,
okay?

460
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,767
Morris seems better.

461
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:43,600
Is that a question?

462
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,267
Is he?

463
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,034
Yes.

464
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:50,867
Look, I need you
to do me a favor.

465
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:51,901
No.

466
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:53,333
I need you to check his breathe.

467
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,001
If he's better, great.

468
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:56,168
If he had a drink

469
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,567
and he's headed
for another crash

470
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,300
we need to know about that.

471
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:02,300
Fine.

472
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:15,634
Thanks, darling.

473
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,500
What was that for?

474
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,534
Just checking
your breath.

475
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:30,967
He's fine.

476
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:32,867
Thank you.

477
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,901
(typing)

478
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:38,600
Got to love this place.

479
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:39,834
HAYES:
Tom.

480
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:40,867
Tom.

481
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,034
Yes, Karen, I hear you.

482
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,267
You can't possibly
be in favor

483
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,200
of Daniels' plan for
a nuclear strike.

484
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,634
You heard the Vice President.

485
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:50,600
It's a warning shot
into an unpopulated area.

486
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,333
It is a military offensive
on foreign soil.

487
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,200
And you and
I both know

488
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:58,134
it will be impossible
to contain.

489
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,367
Tom, you know this is
insane, I know you do.

490
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:02,600
I saw you in
that meeting.

491
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,333
I saw the doubt in your eyes.

492
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,233
Do not presume

493
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,600
to know what I am
thinking or feeling.

494
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:11,200
I serve at the discretion

495
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:12,834
of those above me.

496
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,567
You serve the interests
of the President.

497
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:16,068
And you know that
Wayne would not

498
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,701
sign off on this course
of action.

499
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,001
Wayne was wrong.

500
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:21,101
Every decision
he made today was wrong--

501
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:23,001
rejecting
my security initiatives,

502
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,267
using Assad as an appeal

503
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,300
to extremist groups.

504
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,767
And look what we've been led to!

505
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:28,867
You can't seriously
believe that.

506
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:29,867
You just cannot!

507
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:32,233
Doesn't matter what I believe.

508
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,600
As long as the President
is in a coma,

509
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,300
Daniels is the acting
Commander in Chief.

510
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:38,500
Now, if you want him

511
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,168
to abort that missile launch,
you had better pray

512
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:45,267
that CTU can find
and stop that drone.

513
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,300
We've got ground teams
on all roads leading out

514
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,200
of Shadow Valley looking
for Fayed and Gredenko,

515
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,767
but with SAT support dedicated
to finding the drone,

516
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,001
there's not much to go on.

517
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,168
MILO:
And CalTrans doesn't have

518
00:22:58,233 --> 00:22:59,967
any cameras set up
in the outlying areas.

519
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,767
Mr. Buchanan, we figured out

520
00:23:01,834 --> 00:23:03,434
how the drone
is able to stay hidden

521
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,534
from our satellites.

522
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Whoever is piloting it
is able to anticipate

523
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:07,801
our repositioning directives,

524
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:09,534
flying through the gaps
in the images.

525
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,134
How can he do that?

526
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,734
CHLOE:
Our satellite data
is being relayed

527
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:14,567
to the drone pilot
through a workstation here.

528
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:15,767
We have a leak.

529
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,300
One of our own people?

530
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:21,534
Looks that way.

531
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
Can you isolate the workstation?

532
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:25,467
No. It's being masked
through a sub-circuit.

533
00:23:25,534 --> 00:23:27,168
Morris is working on it now,
but there are

534
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,300
over 50 stations
in this building.

535
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,300
It could take an hour

536
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,367
to do a
signature trace.

537
00:23:30,434 --> 00:23:31,434
We don't have an hour.

538
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:35,600
Run a trace match

539
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,134
on Nadia Yassir's
station.

540
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,367
Why Nadia?

541
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,467
Do it.

542
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:41,701
MILO: Wait, you
think just because

543
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:42,801
she's a Muslim,
that gives you the right...

544
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:44,168
I'm following
standard protocol.

545
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,500
Standard protocol?
She's already
been tagged

546
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,734
and given restricted clearance.

547
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:47,801
(scoffs)

548
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:49,434
And, yeah,

549
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,434
she is a Muslim.

550
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,634
That's enough to go on.

551
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:54,168
Everyone here
is thinking it,

552
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,600
even if they won't say it.

553
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,400
You're a racist.

554
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:58,400
BUCHANAN:
Milo,

555
00:23:58,467 --> 00:23:59,834
I understand your distaste.

556
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,168
But we have to vet every
system in the building.

557
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,434
There's no reason
not to start with hers.

558
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,667
No, sir, there's every reason.

559
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,233
Nadia Yassir's 100 percent
loyal to this country.

560
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,534
She is not a terrorist.

561
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,534
Is this assessment based on
some private knowledge?

562
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,500
Or is it because you're
itching to sleep with her?

563
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,134
Son of a...
BUCHANAN:
All right!

564
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,867
That's enough!

565
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,367
Agent Doyle,

566
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:21,867
that was way out of line.

567
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,367
We don't have time for
your personal differences.

568
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:27,667
We have to find out
who's subverting our system.

569
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:32,467
It is Nadia.

570
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,867
The signature trace
matches her computer.

571
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,567
Shut down her workstation.

572
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:40,134
CHLOE:
I'm trying. The only way to cut
the data flow is to reboot

573
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,634
CTU's mainframe.

574
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:43,667
We'd be without system power
for more than 20 minutes.

575
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,367
Get security on the floor now.

576
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,333
Surrender
your station.

577
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,734
Excuse me?

578
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,467
Who are you streaming
our satellite data to?
What?!

579
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:02,034
Where is the pilot?
BUCHANAN:
Doyle, damn it,

580
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:03,068
that's enough!

581
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:07,934
Take her to holding.

582
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:10,801
Bill, don't let,
don't let him do this!

583
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,168
What are
you doing?!

584
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:15,333
Bill, I'm innocent!

585
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,901
I'm not a traitor!

586
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:26,500
Morris,

587
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,200
secure her station.

588
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:29,834
See if you can
run a back trace

589
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,367
on that leak.

590
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:33,200
Find out where
the feed is going.

591
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:35,233
Excuse me.

592
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:49,967
Victor.

593
00:25:50,034 --> 00:25:53,434
What is the drone's
current position?

594
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,034
130 miles

595
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:58,034
southeast of target.

596
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:00,801
Have you locked in
the GPS coordinates?

597
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,267
Yes.

598
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,400
The bomb will detonate
over San Francisco

599
00:26:05,467 --> 00:26:07,101
within 20 minutes.

600
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:27,900
--WELTON:
...you want the drip
to stay steady.

601
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:31,067
Add in some glucose
after about an hour.

602
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,267
If you see anything,
any movement,

603
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,700
twitch of the
eyelids, you get me.

604
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,867
Got it?

605
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:38,500
Dr. Welton,

606
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:39,900
I need to speak
with you.

607
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,334
I don't have much time,
Ms. Hayes.

608
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:43,301
What's the President's
condition?

609
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,167
It's worsened
in the last 15 minutes.

610
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:46,667
There was a buildup of

611
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:47,667
intracranial pressure.

612
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:48,900
We had to induce a coma

613
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:50,134
to relieve the swelling.

614
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:51,201
I see.

615
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:52,834
Good news is
we stopped it in time.

616
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,934
Doesn't seem to have been
any neural damage,

617
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,234
and his vitals are
surprisingly strong.

618
00:26:57,301 --> 00:26:59,001
He's a fighter.

619
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:00,834
We have that much going for us.
Excuse me.

620
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,967
Doctor...

621
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,334
Yes.

622
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:05,767
Is there any way that you can

623
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,368
bring the President
back to consciousness?

624
00:27:07,434 --> 00:27:10,167
I know this is an
unusual request,

625
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:13,667
but it's a matter of national
security that I speak with him.

626
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:15,101
I'm sorry.

627
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,101
It could pose
a serious risk to his life.

628
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,201
I couldn't possibly
authorize it.

629
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:19,401
Who could?

630
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:22,267
I'd need consent
from his family.

631
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:23,834
His sister is here.

632
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,700
But I would strongly
advise against it.

633
00:27:26,767 --> 00:27:28,067
If the swelling
isn't contained,

634
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:31,401
the President could suffer
permanent brain damage.

635
00:27:31,468 --> 00:27:33,434
I have to go, Ms. Hayes.

636
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:06,401
* *

637
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,667
This is insane.

638
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,167
Nadia can't be involved in this.

639
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:20,533
The signal was routed
through her station.

640
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
We can't ignore that fact.

641
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,134
Do you really believe that Nadia

642
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,500
is helping the terrorists?

643
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:27,468
I don't want to believe it,
but I really don't know.

644
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:31,134
Doyle's an ass.

645
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,533
He's doing his job.

646
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
If we want him to stop,
we have to prove she's innocent.

647
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,834
Hello. Think I
got something.

648
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,167
What is it?

649
00:28:40,234 --> 00:28:41,434
I've set up
a feedback pulse.

650
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,101
Whoever Nadia's feeding
our data stream to

651
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:45,101
will read it as some
static in the line,

652
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,967
but we may be able
to ride the pulse

653
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,867
back to its source, find
the location of the drone pilot.

654
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,034
I've got it.

655
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:53,001
1530 Hillcrest.

656
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:54,134
Hillcrest, that's close.

657
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,334
Bloody close--
three blocks away.

658
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,967
Okay, tell Buchanan.

659
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:02,767
I'm asking you once
again, cooperate.

660
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:06,134
Help me put
an end to this.

661
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:09,500
(sighs)

662
00:29:11,633 --> 00:29:14,001
(gasps)

663
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,468
I'm warning you.

664
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:19,468
I will do what's necessary
to get the answers I need.

665
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,201
Do you understand?

666
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:23,967
Do you understand?

667
00:29:25,867 --> 00:29:27,834
(gasping)

668
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:36,401
I understand everything.

669
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:40,134
I read your file.

670
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:44,067
I know what you did in Denver.

671
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:45,834
You enjoy hurting people.

672
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,034
You get off on it.

673
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:49,533
We're not here to talk about me.

674
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,500
We're here to talk about

675
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,667
what you know.

676
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:57,500
I don't know anything!

677
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:58,900
MILO:
Get away from
her, Doyle.

678
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,234
I said let her go.

679
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,134
What the hell
are you doing?

680
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,867
We got the drone
pilot's location

681
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,101
through Nadia's computer.

682
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,533
Where is it?

683
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,101
Three blocks from here.

684
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,767
1530 Hillcrest.

685
00:30:17,633 --> 00:30:19,600
We're not through
with her, Milo.

686
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:26,101
(gasps)

687
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,934
Are you okay?

688
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,034
Milo?

689
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:39,767
You know I didn't have anything
to do with this.

690
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,734
Get out of here.

691
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,134
* *

692
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,067
Agent, what's going on?

693
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:52,700
We have a location
on the drone's pilot.

694
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,434
We're mobilizing now.

695
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:03,067
BUCHANAN:
As you know, whoever's
piloting the drone

696
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:05,301
is operating in close
proximity to CTU.

697
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:08,134
I'm instituting a level
one security lock-down.

698
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:11,301
All provisional safeguards are
in effect until further notice.

699
00:32:11,368 --> 00:32:13,900
Let's go to work!

700
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,434
Marcy...

701
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,900
contact LAPD.

702
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:21,368
Have them coordinate
with tactical.

703
00:32:21,434 --> 00:32:23,667
Seal off a perimeter.
Yes, sir.

704
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:26,600
Chloe...

705
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:27,867
have they confirmed
the address?

706
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,167
Yes, it's a relay station.

707
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,667
I've got the building
specs and layout.

708
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:32,134
I'm gonna need a PDA
and a phone.

709
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,667
I'll get them for you.
Thanks.

710
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,401
Jack, what are you doing?

711
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:38,067
I'm going with the team.

712
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:40,368
You're injured.
You should be in medical.

713
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:42,633
You should have told me
about Audrey, Bill.

714
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,134
We were asking you to give
your life, Jack.

715
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,434
I didn't think it
was right to tell you
about Audrey's accident.

716
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,834
It wasn't an accident.
She was murdered.

717
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,001
No one knows that for sure.

718
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,034
I do.

719
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:56,900
Bill, Audrey gave

720
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:59,067
her life trying to get me
out of a Chinese prison

721
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:01,101
because she thought
I was worth it.

722
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:04,101
I'm not going to let
her die for nothing now.

723
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,934
I'm going to finish this.

724
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:07,967
And when I do,

725
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:10,468
I'm gonna track down the people
responsible for her murder,

726
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,734
and I'm going to take
care of them, too.

727
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,734
Please, you have to
let me finish this.

728
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
All right.

729
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:21,567
I'll tell Doyle
you're running point.

730
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,700
--The drone is approaching
the city.

731
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm beginning descent now.

732
00:33:43,867 --> 00:33:46,534
How long until the bomb
detonates?

733
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,034
At its current speed,
the drone will reach

734
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:51,667
the target perimeter
within three minutes.

735
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,167
It will detonate automatically

736
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:54,867
when it reaches
the perimeter line.

737
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:57,967
I'll bring it in
at an altitude of 500 feet

738
00:33:58,034 --> 00:33:59,800
to achieve maximum damage.

739
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:03,867
Don't worry, tovarish,
everything is set.

740
00:34:03,934 --> 00:34:06,934
It will happen exactly
as you planned.

741
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,067
Concentrate on
the task at hand.

742
00:34:10,134 --> 00:34:11,568
Then call me when it's done.

743
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,234
Yes, sir.

744
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:22,733
Bill, it's Jack.
We're in position.

745
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,934
The gate was open,
there's a utility truck

746
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,334
parked behind the building.

747
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,101
Our back-trace shows
the intrusion

748
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,367
into our system is
coming from a room

749
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,767
in the northwest corner
of the switching station.

750
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:34,733
Jack, I'm looking at an updated
schematic now. Your most direct 

751
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,900
route is through the rear
entrance, to the left.

752
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,900
Okay. Did you get that?
Yeah.

753
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:41,000
(grunts)
Do you want me
on point?

754
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,700
I got it.

755
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:43,934
Let's go.

756
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,967
Whatever you say.

757
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,633
(clattering)
What was that?

758
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,667
Go check.

759
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,301
(gunshot, groaning)

760
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,468
Let's get a medic.

761
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:57,067
Chloe, it's Jack.
Do you copy?

762
00:35:57,134 --> 00:35:57,934
We copy.

763
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,967
Jack, what's your status?

764
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,167
The drone pilot is down.

765
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:01,568
I'm at his controls now.

766
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,000
The target is
San Francisco.

767
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,101
I repeat, the target
is San Francisco.

768
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,134
Alert local law enforcement
and First Responders

769
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:08,700
in the area, and
open a channel

770
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,733
with the Regional Control
Center up there.
Got it.

771
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:16,967
These controls are
for navigation only.

772
00:36:17,034 --> 00:36:18,067
There is no way

773
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,468
to deactivate the
bomb remotely.

774
00:36:19,534 --> 00:36:21,367
CTU, we're linking you in now.
You should have it.

775
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:22,501
It's coming through.

776
00:36:22,568 --> 00:36:24,501
Jack, is there any way
for you to determine

777
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:26,267
what triggering
mechanism they're using?

778
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,334
It looks like they wired
a GPS module into the bomb.

779
00:36:28,401 --> 00:36:30,201
It'll detonate as
soon as it crosses

780
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,367
its designated
perimeter.

781
00:36:31,434 --> 00:36:32,867
I'm trying
to steer it away now.

782
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:34,900
Don't turn the drone
too sharply,

783
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,600
or it'll stall,
and you'll lose control.

784
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:37,800
Copy that.

785
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:38,967
On its current course,

786
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,633
the drone will cross
the perimeter

787
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,034
and detonate
in 30 seconds.

788
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:49,600
Jack, you're getting
a stabilizer warning.

789
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,700
I see it.

790
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,733
20 seconds.

791
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,633
Ten seconds.

792
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,767
Okay, it's turning.

793
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:13,534
The drone did not
cross the perimeter.

794
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,700
I'm fighting a stall.

795
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:15,934
I'm losing control
of the drone.

796
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I need to find a
place to land it now.

797
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,301
All right, according
to the specs,

798
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,568
it's gonna need 500 feet
of runway to land.

799
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,700
Okay, closest to the drone's
current position,

800
00:37:24,767 --> 00:37:26,501
there's a long stretch
of residential road

801
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:28,134
straight ahead of you.

802
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:30,501
That's a negative. Find me
an area that's unpopulated.

803
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:31,900
Hold on.

804
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,767
If you can get
the drone farther east,

805
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:39,600
there's an industrial
park along the Bay.

806
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,067
I'm uploading
the coordinates now.

807
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,134
Have Regional Command deploy
units to the area immediately.

808
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,568
Regional Command...

809
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,667
Come on.

810
00:38:03,034 --> 00:38:05,101
(engine whooshing)

811
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,067
The drone is down.

812
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:20,700
(clanking)

813
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:32,934
MORRIS: Mr. Buchanan,
none of the First
Responders in San Francisco

814
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,700
are reporting a detonation.
The bomb did not

815
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:35,800
go off on impact.

816
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:38,267
Jack, did you copy that?
Yeah.

817
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:41,000
Can we get a visual
from anyone at the site?

818
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,201
I'm showing a fire
and rescue unit already

819
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,568
arriving at the scene.

820
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:47,334
What's the status on the pilot?

821
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:48,867
He's alive, barely.

822
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:50,900
Do whatever you have to
to get him conscious.

823
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:55,934
(sirens blaring)

824
00:39:03,501 --> 00:39:05,733
(indistinct radio transmission)

825
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,767
(beeping)

826
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,967
Get the Geiger counter.
(beeping continues)

827
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:21,234
(static crackling)

828
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:25,900
(crackling continues,
then ceases)

829
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,967
Move out! There's radioactive

830
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:30,267
material in this area!
Pull back

831
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,667
and wait for HAZMAT.
Move it!

832
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:57,434
Sir,

833
00:39:57,501 --> 00:40:00,501
I have Bill Buchanan
on line one.

834
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,000
Bill, what do you have?

835
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,501
Mr. Vice President,

836
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,600
the drone was intercepted
before the nuclear bomb

837
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,667
was able to detonate.
Oh, thank God.

838
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:10,000
Congratulations, sir.

839
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:13,201
We were able to take control
of the aircraft,

840
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:14,800
crash-landing it
in an industrial park

841
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,067
at the edge of the city.

842
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:17,800
But in the process,

843
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:19,501
the bomb's nuclear
core was compromised,

844
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:22,201
and radioactive
material was released.

845
00:40:22,267 --> 00:40:23,401
So what we're essentially

846
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:25,000
dealing with is a dirty bomb.

847
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:27,000
Sir, this was not
a dispersal device.

848
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,468
It was a radiological spill.

849
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:30,900
It was an attack
on our nation.

850
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,301
Bill, are there casualties?

851
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,534
Local Responders
got there before HAZMAT.

852
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,767
They were almost
certainly exposed

853
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:42,367
to fatal doses of
radiation, but so far,

854
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,134
it appears that
radioactive material

855
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:45,534
was not widely dispersed.

856
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,401
Casualties should
be minimal.

857
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:50,934
At least we've got that to be
grateful for. Thanks, Bill.

858
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:02,767
Proceed with the warning strike
as planned.

859
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:05,067
Sir, the primary
attack was averted.

860
00:41:05,134 --> 00:41:07,401
CTU was successful.

861
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:10,000
There will be civilian
deaths, as well as untold

862
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,301
environmental damage.

863
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,401
I hardly consider
that a success.

864
00:41:13,468 --> 00:41:15,167
The damage will be minimal

865
00:41:15,234 --> 00:41:17,234
compared to what
we just avoided.

866
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,501
Sir, I think we should
consider ourselves fortunate.

867
00:41:19,568 --> 00:41:21,501
Tom?

868
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:23,568
Sir?

869
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:26,800
Mr. Vice President,
we were led to believe
that this warning shot

870
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:29,367
would be fired
only in response

871
00:41:29,434 --> 00:41:31,867
to the detonation
of a nuclear device.

872
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:34,367
That is a technicality, Tom.

873
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:37,867
I gave fair warning
to the Prime Minister,

874
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:39,733
and I intend to carry it out.

875
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,401
Secretary Kanin?

876
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,101
How long will
it take to move

877
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,034
the submarine
into position?

878
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:51,401
Once you've given the order...

879
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,468
within the hour.

880
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,301
The order is given.

881
00:41:57,367 --> 00:41:59,834
Launch the missile...

882
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,134
...as soon as they're in range.

883
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:08,134



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
