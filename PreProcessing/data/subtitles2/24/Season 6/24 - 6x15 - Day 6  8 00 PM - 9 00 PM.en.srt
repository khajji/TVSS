1
00:00:10,369 --> 00:00:12,622
Previously on 24.

2
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:15,981
The Americans know
our location.

3
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:20,109
We need to launch the
drone before they close in.

4
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:23,067
We'll find a way to deliver
the other two bombs.

5
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,561
Launch the drone.

6
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:33,995
- I can't find the drone.
- Readjust based on projected vectors.

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,534
I'm doing that now, General.
It's just not where it's supposed to be!

8
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:39,699
Until you find it, I'll have my
F-16s stay in a holding pattern.

9
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:41,853
We figured out how
the drone was able to

10
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:44,100
stay hidden from our satellites.
Whoever is piloting it

11
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,248
is able to anticipate our
repositioning directives.

12
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:48,069
How can he do that?

13
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,457
Our satellite data is being
relayed to the drone pilot

14
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:52,492
through a workstation here.
We have a leak.

15
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:54,691
We have to find out who's
subverting our system.

16
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:58,121
It is Nadia. The signature
trace matches her computer.

17
00:00:58,306 --> 00:00:59,660
Surrender your station.

18
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:02,022
Who are you streaming
our satellite data to?

19
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:02,832
What?!

20
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:07,671
I will do what's necessary
to get the answers I need.

21
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,801
- Let her go.
- What the hell are you doing?

22
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:12,631
We got the drone
pilot's location.

23
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:16,163
We're not through
with her, Milo.

24
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,380
Jack, what's your status?

25
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,151
The drone pilot is down.
I'm at his controls now.

26
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,793
The target is San Francisco.

27
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:29,941
There is no way to deactivate
the bomb remotely.

28
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:32,501
I'm fighting a stall.
I'm losing control of the drone.

29
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,802
I need to find a
place to land it now.

30
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:42,883
None of the first responders in San
Francisco are reporting a detonation.

31
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:44,601
The bomb did not
go off on impact.

32
00:01:45,065 --> 00:01:47,972
Move out! There's radioactive
material in this area!

33
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,690
We were able to take
control of the aircraft,

34
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,432
crash-landing it in an industrial
park at the edge of the city.

35
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,903
But in the process,
the bomb's nuclear core was compromised

36
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:58,190
and radioactive
material was released.

37
00:01:58,747 --> 00:02:01,510
So what we're essentially
dealing with is a dirty bomb.

38
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,800
- Sir, it was a radiological spill.
- It was an attack on our nation.

39
00:02:05,405 --> 00:02:07,233
I warned the ambassador, Tom.

40
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:10,092
We were led to believe that this
warning shot would be fired

41
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,131
only in response to the
detonation of a nuclear device.

42
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:16,713
They need to see with
their own eyes that

43
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:20,950
I will answer this threat with
an in-kind military response.

44
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:22,682
The order's given.

45
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:26,230
Launch the missile as
soon as they're in range.

46
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:37,650
Prep two units of fresh plasma.

47
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:41,082
You need to keep him alive.
Gredenko's got two more bombs out there.

48
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,930
Right now this man's
our only link to them.

49
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:44,700
Jack! I just talked to CTU.

50
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,800
There's a situation developing
where the drone went down.

51
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:47,301
What?

52
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:49,042
The casing on the nuclear bomb,
it cracked.

53
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:50,581
There's been some dispersal
into the atmosphere.

54
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:51,531
How bad is the fallout?

55
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:53,413
A dozen first-responders
were exposed to high levels,

56
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,761
but casualties
should be minimal.

57
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:57,193
Wind vectors are okay so far,
and they're starting to evacuate.

58
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:59,813
I want you to go through the pilot's
databases and electronic files.

59
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:02,043
I want you to see if you can
find any link to Gredenko.

60
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:05,382
Agent Bauer.

61
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:08,851
- He didn't make it.
- Damn it.

62
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:13,131
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Jack.

63
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,680
What did you get from
the drone pilot?

64
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,380
No, he's dead.

65
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,583
We've been running down
leads on this end.

66
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,203
So far nothing's
come up on Gredenko.

67
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:22,533
Doyle told me about the fallout,
but he said it was containable?

68
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:23,842
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.

69
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:26,972
The incident has created some serious
policy complications in Washington.

70
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:28,551
Like what?

71
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:32,211
Vice President Daniels has ordered a
nuclear strike against Fayed's country.

72
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,460
What's he trying to do,
start World War III?

73
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:37,200
That'll be seen as an act of aggression
against the entire Middle East.

74
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,073
Which is why we have to
find Fayed and Gredenko

75
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:40,602
before Daniels
launches the strike.

76
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,610
- When is it happening?
- Within the hour.

77
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,241
Bill, that doesn't give us
enough time to find Gredenko.

78
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:47,150
I'll get back to you.

79
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:15,820
Victor's still not answering.

80
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:19,092
Because the
Americans found him.

81
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,683
The bomb was supposed to hit
San Francisco ten minutes ago,

82
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:25,343
but there is
nothing on the news.

83
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:28,062
Even if you're right,
we are safe here.

84
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:32,312
Victor doesn't
know our location.

85
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,012
So we can continue
our operations safely.

86
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:40,000
What operation?
There is no operation.

87
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:42,421
It's over because of
you and your people.

88
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:45,210
No, Fayed, it isn't over.

89
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,952
We have two more bombs.

90
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:59,103
I have the bombs.

91
00:04:59,986 --> 00:05:02,663
But you need me
to deliver them.

92
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:04,251
I'm the only one

93
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:07,910
who can give you the
targets you want.

94
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:10,442
Come on, come on, shoot me now,

95
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:13,010
or put down the gun.

96
00:05:37,556 --> 00:05:39,903
- Yeah.
- Mark Hauser?

97
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:42,690
- Who's this?
- You know who it is.

98
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:48,861
I already gave you
what you asked for.

99
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:51,661
But your employer has
tightened security,

100
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:54,100
so the access I paid
for is no good.

101
00:05:54,568 --> 00:05:56,820
- That's not my problem.
- It is your problem.

102
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:59,592
It became your problem the
moment you took my money.

103
00:06:02,826 --> 00:06:06,212
It'll take some time to download
the new security protocols.

104
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:07,963
How much time?

105
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,641
Half an hour, maybe longer.
I can call you when it's ready.

106
00:06:10,876 --> 00:06:13,171
- I'll be there in 40 minutes.
- Gredenko.

107
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,890
I'm hungry.

108
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:28,140
Knock yourself out.

109
00:06:29,246 --> 00:06:30,510
There's peppers in here.

110
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:33,202
- You like peppers.
- Not red ones.

111
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,970
- I don't eat red food, Mark.
- Since when?

112
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,842
I don't like red food.

113
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:42,720
I'll take the
peppers out, okay?

114
00:06:47,757 --> 00:06:51,450
You take care of me, Mark.
You always take care of me.

115
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,440
I do my best, Brady.

116
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:02,321
While I'm doing this,
I need you to do something for me.

117
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,063
Okay.

118
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:08,951
I need you to access some files
from the mainframe at my office.

119
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:11,013
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.

120
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:33,013
Let's go.

121
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,773
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

122
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:02,111
She's being transferred to a
holding station in Temecula.

123
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:06,100
Sir, I don't know if I can
accept that she betrayed us,

124
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,531
that she spied for Fayed.
I think we're wrong.

125
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,730
This is not easy for any of us.

126
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,602
But the facts at hand indicate

127
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:18,513
she was streaming
intel from her station.

128
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:20,422
- Mr. Buchanan.
- What is it?

129
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:22,100
We may have caught a break.

130
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,582
What do you have?

131
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:28,063
I've been monitoring
everyone on our watch list

132
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:31,143
who's ever communicated with Gredenko
through phone calls or e-mails.

133
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:34,003
The filter algorithm flagged a call
that happened a few minutes ago.

134
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:37,761
Mark Hauser. He does security
consulting for energy companies.

135
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:40,671
His company has contracts with
dozens of chemical facilities--

136
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:43,480
oil fields,
pipelines and nuclear power plants.

137
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:47,153
Unfortunately the call was scrambled,
but we do have Hauser's address.

138
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:48,501
Get that address to Jack.

139
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,643
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, excuse us, guys.

140
00:08:57,047 --> 00:09:00,002
While I was stripping data from
the drone pilot's hard drive,

141
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:01,641
I found this.

142
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:04,590
- What is it?
- Remote access module.

143
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,120
It's how the drone pilot
breached CTU's satellite grid.

144
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:08,628
No, the pilot got
into our system

145
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:11,249
because Nadia Yassir opened
the door and let him in.

146
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,407
No, she didn't.

147
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:15,690
This guy got in through one of the
radical web sites Nadia's
been monitoring.

148
00:09:15,878 --> 00:09:17,511
The access module proves it.

149
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,310
Are you saying Nadia's system was
compromised and she didn't know it?

150
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:22,660
That's right.

151
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:25,681
That puts you in
a tough position,

152
00:09:26,086 --> 00:09:28,563
considering you're the one who
led the witch hunt against her.

153
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,210
I followed standard protocols

154
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,473
based on the information that
was available at the time.

155
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,371
Well, Nadia might
not see it that way

156
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,563
when she takes it up with
the Justice Department.

157
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:38,820
You know,
once the dust settles today,

158
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,252
they might want to
make you an example.

159
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,583
Relax, Mike.

160
00:09:46,908 --> 00:09:49,402
You took care of me in Denver,
and I still owe you for that.

161
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,783
But we're even now.

162
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:57,042
Copy that. I'll get back to
you as soon as we're there.

163
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,911
- We got a lead on Gredenko.
- How good a lead?

164
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:00,883
We'll know soon enough.
It's just a few miles from here.

165
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:02,843
I want you to put together a Tac Team,
we'll move out.

166
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:05,081
I need to stay behind.
We're still processing.

167
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:07,451
Fine.

168
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:11,432
Ryan, get your men together,
come with me.

169
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:50,351
Give us a minute, please.

170
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:57,481
Sandra?

171
00:10:58,498 --> 00:10:59,941
How are you holding up?

172
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,193
I can't believe
this is happening.

173
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,133
It doesn't feel real.

174
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,322
I'm so sorry.

175
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:14,300
Sandra.

176
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:19,110
Unfortunately, I need to
ask you for your help.

177
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,472
There's an extremely volatile situation
developing at the White House.

178
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:26,752
Vice President Daniels
is about to launch

179
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:29,052
a nuclear strike
against the Middle East.

180
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:31,863
- A nuclear strike?
- Yes. And the cabinet is behind him.

181
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:34,861
I've tried arguing against it,
but no one's listening.

182
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:38,673
- Are they insane?
- No. They're just scared.

183
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:41,573
Before the attempted
assassination on your brother,

184
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:44,203
Wayne was reaching out to
the Middle East governments

185
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:48,153
to solicit their help in stopping Fayed.
And it was working.

186
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:50,350
This strike is a
complete reversal

187
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,150
of everything that
he was working for.

188
00:11:54,397 --> 00:11:57,832
You want Dr.
Welton to bring him out of the coma.

189
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,850
Yes.

190
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:03,190
And I need your consent.

191
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:06,613
But the doctor said that
he needs to remain sedated

192
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:09,241
for a few days before
the swelling can subside.

193
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,512
Yeah, but we don't
have a few days.

194
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,590
Yeah, well,
even if Wayne regains consciousness,

195
00:12:14,696 --> 00:12:17,322
we don't know what state he'll be in,
physically or mentally.

196
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,433
But we won't know
unless we try.

197
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,813
Sandra, I wouldn't dare
to ask you to risk this

198
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:25,383
if I did not think it was absolutely
necessary for the sake of our country.

199
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,512
- I'm sorry, I can't do it.
- Sandra, please.

200
00:12:30,976 --> 00:12:35,261
I've already lost one brother.
I can't lose another one.

201
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:37,791
I know you did not ask
for this responsibility,

202
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,851
but like it or not,
it is yours.

203
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:43,041
Wayne Palmer is still the
president of our country.

204
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:46,663
He's the only one who can stop this from
happening, and you are the only one

205
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:50,322
who can give him the chance
to do what he believes in.

206
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:06,520
Give him that chance.

207
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:11,232
Ask yourself what Wayne
would want you to do.

208
00:13:19,737 --> 00:13:21,750
I'll talk to Dr. Welton.

209
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:27,021
And God forgive
me if I'm wrong.

210
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,761
The USS Vickery has been detached
from carrier group Falcon,

211
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:34,733
which is currently on
patrol in the region.

212
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:39,481
Now, the Vickery will reach
launch position in 40 minutes.

213
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:44,071
So, in less than an hour,
we'll have made our point to the enemy?

214
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:45,852
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

215
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:51,543
The B-611 short-range tactical warhead
has a blast yield of 300 kilotons.

216
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:54,882
The message will
be loud and clear.

217
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,343
Very good, Admiral. Exemplary.

218
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:04,492
Tom, give us the damage and casualty
estimates you got from COMPLAN.

219
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,330
- Tom?
- I'm sorry, sir.

220
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:12,382
- Is there a problem?
- No. No, no.

221
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,430
Um, this projection is,
of course,

222
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:20,373
based on theoretical models generated
at our nuclear facility in Alamogordo.

223
00:14:20,747 --> 00:14:26,062
COMPLAN estimates a high range
of general damage by zone,

224
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,122
as well as multiple
casualty numbers

225
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:30,610
based on various
climate models.

226
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,861
- Now, should the...
- I'm sorry, Tom.

227
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:36,823
I need to step
out for a minute.

228
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,851
Carry on with the briefing.

229
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,852
Right. Uh,
should the enemy mount a response,

230
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:45,860
the potential does exist
for the US to be drawn

231
00:14:46,188 --> 00:14:47,963
into a conflict in
which its troops...

232
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,501
What the hell does this mean,
they're taking him out of the coma?

233
00:14:50,537 --> 00:14:53,122
Apparently, Sandra Palmer gave
her consent a few minutes ago.

234
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:59,131
- This is Karen Hayes.
- I don't know, sir.

235
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:03,303
I only found out about this because I
have a source inside the medical bay.

236
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:08,871
Put me through to Dr. Welton.

237
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:15,040
Okay. I've cut the
pentobarbital drip.

238
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:18,142
His metabolic rate's up,
and he's breathing on his own.

239
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:19,912
What about the
swelling in his brain?

240
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:22,303
No sign of
intracranial hypertension,

241
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:24,082
but it's still
too early to know

242
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:27,180
when or even if he'll
regain consciousness.

243
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:31,552
Dr. Welton, Vice President Daniels
on line one. He says it's urgent.

244
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:33,803
Dr. Welton,
what are you going to tell him?

245
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,430
The truth.

246
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,782
Mr. Vice President,
this is Dr. Welton.

247
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:47,162
I've just been told you're trying to
rouse the president out of his coma.

248
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:48,850
That's correct, sir.

249
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,101
I thought you induced the coma
to save the president's life.

250
00:15:51,137 --> 00:15:54,383
Treating patients with head
trauma's a fluid process.

251
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:58,500
Sounds to me like you're risking the
life of the president of the
United States.

252
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:01,092
With careful monitoring,
we can minimize that risk.

253
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,821
- Let's cut the crap, Doctor.
- Sir?

254
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:05,410
We both know what's
going on here,

255
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,573
why Sandra Palmer wants
her brother conscious.

256
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:09,383
She's trying to subvert
my policy agenda.

257
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,100
Policy's not my concern.

258
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:12,782
Oh, I think you're
very concerned,

259
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:14,950
and I think you agree
with what she's doing,

260
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,612
and you're willing to risk the life
of the president to get it done.

261
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:20,233
So if you don't stop now,
I will compel you to stop.

262
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:21,542
With all due respect, sir,

263
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,720
the president's medical
treatment is not under...

264
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:28,530
- You'll do what I tell you.
- No, sir. I'm sorry, I will not.

265
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,442
I am required to follow the
wishes of Sandra Palmer.

266
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,570
You're free to take up
your concerns with her.

267
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:39,112
If the president dies or suffers any
permanent damage from your actions,

268
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:40,840
I will nail your
ass to the wall.

269
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:44,082
- Do you understand me?
- Perfectly, sir.

270
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:12,533
Chloe, I need that photo.
I need it now.

271
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:13,930
Sending now, Jack.

272
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:19,651
Team B,
advise when you're in position.

273
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:27,102
- Team B in position.
- Copy that.

274
00:17:27,427 --> 00:17:28,503
I've got a positive ID.

275
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:30,752
Move in on the house now,
move in on the house now!

276
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:38,751
Federal agent!
Get on the floor!

277
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:43,213
- Don't move!
- Do what they say, Brady.

278
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:44,521
Put him in a chair.

279
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,902
Mark, Mark.

280
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,760
Take him in the
living room now.

281
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:56,691
- Let's go.
- He doesn't know anything.

282
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:58,121
- Shut up!
- Mark.

283
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,202
He's got some
arterial bleeding.

284
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:02,632
We need to get
him to a hospital.

285
00:18:02,945 --> 00:18:05,013
We don't have time. Do whatever
you have to to stabilize him.

286
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:05,743
All right.

287
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,390
Let me have the room.

288
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,332
I know you're scared right now,

289
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,750
but everything's
going to be okay.

290
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:22,900
I want to see my brother.

291
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:25,292
I'm going to let you
see your brother,

292
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:27,153
but I need to ask you
some questions first.

293
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,870
- I'm not allowed.
- You're not allowed? Why?

294
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,792
Mark says,
don't talk to strangers.

295
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:34,221
I'm not a stranger.
I'm a police officer.

296
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:35,953
You can talk to me.
It's all right.

297
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,941
My name is Jack Bauer.
What's yours?

298
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:40,981
- Brady.
- Brady.

299
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:44,302
Brady, when we came in,
you were working on your computer.

300
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:46,083
What were you working on?

301
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:50,112
- Getting files.
- What kind of files?

302
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:52,282
I don't know.

303
00:18:52,476 --> 00:18:56,331
Mark asked me to get through the IPC
firewall to set up a proxy server port.

304
00:18:56,825 --> 00:19:00,251
- Oh.
- Can I see him now?

305
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:02,250
Soon.

306
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:07,881
I'm going to talk to him first,
and then you can see him, okay?

307
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:10,952
You're doing great, Brady.

308
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,230
Stay with him.

309
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,993
You were getting paid to give
Dmitri Gredenko information.

310
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,882
You used your brother to
get that information.

311
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:25,223
Now he's in a lot of trouble.

312
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,001
My brother's got
nothing to do with this.

313
00:19:27,098 --> 00:19:28,311
That's not what he told me.

314
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:31,780
He doesn't...
he doesn't know what he's doing.

315
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,801
That's not how the Justice
Department's going to see it.

316
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,310
They're going to prosecute him
for treason unless I intervene.

317
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:38,482
Now I'll help your brother
because you and I both know

318
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,130
he didn't understand
what he was doing,

319
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:42,932
but you're going to have
to give me Gredenko.

320
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,222
What kind of information
were you selling him?

321
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:49,472
- Security specs.
- What security specs?

322
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,233
The Edgemont
nuclear power plant.

323
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:58,240
Bill, this is Connell Johnson.
He's on loan from District.

324
00:19:58,436 --> 00:19:59,221
- Connell.
- Hey.

325
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,723
We swept the drone
pilot's system.

326
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,881
Most of the hard drives and
data files are encrypted.

327
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,800
Our digital forensics
people are expecting you.

328
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,290
We'll see what we can find.

329
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:08,800
Have you gotten anything
more from Nadia?

330
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,183
She still claims
she was set up.

331
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,122
- Is she in the building?
- Yeah.

332
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:14,231
She's being transferred
to a holding facility.

333
00:20:14,265 --> 00:20:15,862
- Why do you ask?
- Just curious.

334
00:20:16,137 --> 00:20:18,390
Sir, Jack's on line two.
He's got Hauser in custody.

335
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:27,033
Jack?

336
00:20:27,318 --> 00:20:29,371
Bill, Hauser admitted
to selling Gredenko

337
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,913
the security specs for Edgemont
nuclear power facility.

338
00:20:32,217 --> 00:20:33,811
- Does Gredenko have the specs?
- Not yet.

339
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:35,410
He's going to pick them
up in about 20 minutes.

340
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:37,681
- Can your team handle the grab?
- We've got a situation.

341
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:40,190
Hauser was wounded, but he's got
a brother that Gredenko knows.

342
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,820
We're going to use him to go
through with the transaction.

343
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,491
Right now, it's the best shot we've
got of getting Gredenko alive.

344
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:47,161
I'll get back to you as
soon as I've got anything.

345
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:08,043
Brady, we need to talk.

346
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:11,503
Are you really a policeman?

347
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,502
Yeah.

348
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,171
Then... my brother
did something wrong.

349
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:20,302
He's made some mistakes,
but he's helping us fix them.

350
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:24,251
Everyone makes mistakes.
I make mistakes all the time.

351
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:27,091
- And you try and fix them, right?
- Yeah.

352
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:31,040
That's what your brother's trying to do,
but he needs your help.

353
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,902
- Why don't we go talk to him?
- Okay.

354
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,033
Come on, let's go.

355
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,050
Mark? Mark?!

356
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,283
It's okay, Brady. It's okay.

357
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:45,572
It's not as bad as it looks.

358
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:49,153
They're taking me
to the hospital.

359
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:51,780
- I want to go with you, Mark.
- You need to stay with them.

360
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,320
Don't leave me alone,
Mark, please.

361
00:21:53,516 --> 00:21:55,433
Listen to me, Brady. Listen.

362
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:01,670
You need to do whatever
this man tells you to do.

363
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:05,893
You'll be fine.

364
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:09,050
Who takes care of you, Brady?

365
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:13,591
- You do, Mark.
- That's right.

366
00:22:14,796 --> 00:22:18,603
So you need to trust me when
I tell you you'll be fine.

367
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,283
He'll take care of you.

368
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:25,611
Okay?

369
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,250
Okay.

370
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,202
Let's make the call.

371
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:48,582
- Yes.
- It's Hauser.

372
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,942
I have the security protocols,
but there's a problem.

373
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,420
- What problem?
- My supervisor wants me to come in.

374
00:22:55,836 --> 00:22:58,840
- I'll be there in 20 minutes.
- He wants me at the office now.

375
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:03,940
If I'm not there in ten minutes,
the protocols will default,

376
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,242
and I'll have to download
them all over again.

377
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,732
I need those protocols.

378
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,393
I can leave them
with my brother.

379
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:13,322
Brady?

380
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:16,040
Unless you want to wait for me
to get back from the office.

381
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:18,753
I don't have time.

382
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,530
Have your brother meet me in the
parking lot across the street.

383
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:28,111
He'll be there. Good-bye.

384
00:23:30,197 --> 00:23:33,621
The parking lot.
Across the street. 20 minutes.

385
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:36,151
He needs to get to a hospital now.
Take him.

386
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,500
Mark! Mark!

387
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:41,521
Brady, it's all right.

388
00:23:41,706 --> 00:23:44,142
It's all right. We're going to
take care of him, I promise.

389
00:23:44,938 --> 00:23:47,330
Right now, I need you to
listen to me very carefully,

390
00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:51,180
just like your brother
told you to. Okay?

391
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:52,660
Okay.

392
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:05,953
- Milo Pressman?
- Yeah.

393
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,843
Connell Johnson. I'm on loan
from District. Data forensics.

394
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:11,333
Yeah, I think we
crossed paths in Denver.

395
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:13,442
- That's right, we did.
- What can I do for you?

396
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,670
Well, I hear you and
Nadia Yassir are friends.

397
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,462
Yeah. Why do you ask?

398
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,093
Because I came across evidence
at the switching station

399
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:23,771
that proves Nadia's innocent.

400
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,700
- Explain.
- She wasn't streaming intel.

401
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,760
Her system was breached.

402
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:32,912
Where is this evidence?

403
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:35,072
- Ask Doyle.
- Doyle?

404
00:24:35,257 --> 00:24:37,983
I hate to be a platoon rat,
but I don't know where else to go.

405
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,742
I gave him the evidence
at the crime scene,

406
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,291
and he still hasn't
logged it in.

407
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:43,973
Thank you.

408
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,613
Make sure Jack's team has a full
surveillance package with
infrared capability.

409
00:24:46,647 --> 00:24:48,140
Why'd you do it,
you son of a bitch?

410
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:49,631
- Are you crazy?!
- Milo, hat's enough!

411
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,432
Tell him! Tell...
He's got evidence that Nadia's innocent!

412
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:55,381
- Is this true?
- Yeah.

413
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:57,000
And he buried it to
save his own ass.

414
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,690
He didn't bury it.
Milo. He didn't bury it.

415
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:03,453
It's a remote access module
that breached Nadia's computer.

416
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,612
He gave it to me
ten minutes ago.

417
00:25:07,555 --> 00:25:08,911
Why didn't you tell
us about this?

418
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:10,811
Because I got it from
an unreliable source.

419
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:13,463
I wanted to make sure it was real
before I submitted it for evidence.

420
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:14,831
I ran a verification scan.

421
00:25:15,105 --> 00:25:17,602
It's definitely real,
and Nadia is definitely innocent.

422
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,270
I'll review the evidence.

423
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:21,473
If it's true,
I'll release Nadia.

424
00:25:21,758 --> 00:25:23,580
In the meantime,
go back to work!

425
00:25:26,448 --> 00:25:27,612
Come with me, Morris.

426
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:34,170
Doyle...

427
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:38,702
I owe you an apology.

428
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:40,430
It's not your fault.

429
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:41,922
Still.

430
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,050
Milo, forget about it.

431
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,673
Johnson.

432
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:57,510
You have screwed with the wrong
guy for the last time, pal.

433
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:18,923
Uncuff her.

434
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,423
Excuse us, please.

435
00:26:40,158 --> 00:26:42,551
We found evidence at
the switching station.

436
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,571
It proves your computer was
breached from an outside source.

437
00:26:48,766 --> 00:26:49,792
You're cleared, Nadia.

438
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,730
I'm sorry this happened.

439
00:26:58,048 --> 00:26:59,113
So am I.

440
00:27:00,918 --> 00:27:06,281
Your first impulse will be to quit,
take legal action.

441
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,580
I don't blame you.

442
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:11,631
That's what I'd do.

443
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:15,153
But I'm asking you to stay.

444
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:18,960
This crisis is far from over.

445
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:21,670
We can't afford to
lose our best people.

446
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:24,982
We need you, Nadia.

447
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:34,553
I'll stay.

448
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,702
Milo's setting up
your workstation now.

449
00:27:45,635 --> 00:27:48,742
I just sent over the assault vectors.
Nadia should be good to go.

450
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:49,702
Thank you.

451
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:53,030
We all thought she was guilty.
This is going to be awkward.

452
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:56,691
- Yeah.
- Especially for you.

453
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,353
Why especially for me?

454
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:03,802
Your feelings for Nadia
aren't exactly a big secret.

455
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,781
Thank you for
pointing that out.

456
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:29,190
Your station's all set.
Comm's up.

457
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:32,962
You'll have full security
access to the subnet.

458
00:28:33,106 --> 00:28:33,841
Thanks.

459
00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:37,041
Listen, Nadia, I just...

460
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:39,633
Look, Milo, I don't have time for
a heart-to-heart right now, okay?

461
00:28:39,665 --> 00:28:42,491
I got a lot of catching up to do.
Excuse me.

462
00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:45,213
I understand that. Nadia, wait.

463
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,841
Damn it! You're not going to
make this easy for me, are you?

464
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,990
You know what? Actually, I am.

465
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,413
Whatever you thought might happen
between us, you can just forget it.

466
00:28:53,736 --> 00:28:54,662
That's not fair.

467
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:57,303
Milo, believe it or not, I don't
even blame you for suspecting me.

468
00:28:57,338 --> 00:29:00,291
But you have to admit, this is not the
best place to start a relationship.

469
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:31,090
You're probably right.

470
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:38,892
But I still wanted
to say I'm sorry.

471
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:44,440
You said it.

472
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:52,091
I should get to work.

473
00:30:06,606 --> 00:30:08,431
- Here.
- Thanks.

474
00:30:09,498 --> 00:30:11,082
We haven't heard
from Dr. Welton,

475
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,382
and he's been giving
us regular updates.

476
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:15,440
Well, I'm sure if there
was something to report,

477
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,082
we would have heard from him.

478
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:20,460
Oh, gosh. I've never been
good at waiting for anything.

479
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:24,400
David had the patience of Job.
But not me.

480
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,331
Wayne is always
somewhere in between.

481
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,302
- We have a decision to make.
- What is it?

482
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:39,742
There's an increase in
intracranial swelling.

483
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,472
How serious is it?

484
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:43,691
It's not life-threatening yet,
but if it continues,

485
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:45,973
it could cause
permanent brain damage.

486
00:30:46,527 --> 00:30:48,822
I suggest we
re-induce the coma.

487
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:52,112
No.

488
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:57,081
Sandra, you understand
the danger?

489
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:59,403
Yeah, but there's a
chance he'd be okay.

490
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,211
Yes, there's a chance.

491
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:05,052
Well, even if it's a small chance
for Wayne to stop Daniels,

492
00:31:05,235 --> 00:31:07,443
then it's worth the risk.

493
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:10,990
I know Wayne would want
to see this through.

494
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,760
Dr. Welton?
You need to come quickly.

495
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:20,152
He's crashing. Get a code team in
here right away. Wait outside!

496
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:23,472
Code team to One!
Code team to One, stat!

497
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:45,392
Teams are in position.
You sure he can do this?

498
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:47,910
He just needs to get
Gredenko out of his car.

499
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:53,161
We don't have another option.

500
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,612
Just tell Charlie team
they've got one shot at this.

501
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:02,302
Damn it.

502
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:08,290
Brady, I need you to
wear one of these.

503
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:09,880
So we can talk to each other.

504
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,561
This way, you'll be able to hear me,
and I can hear you.

505
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:15,983
- I need to put it in your ear.
- Will, uh, it hurt?

506
00:32:16,216 --> 00:32:17,290
No.

507
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:18,781
No, I promise.

508
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:22,440
See?

509
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:25,510
Now, I'm going to talk
you through this.

510
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:29,560
But we don't want Mr.
Gredenko to know that you can hear me.

511
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,991
So we have to pretend
that you can't.

512
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:33,913
- You understand?
- Yeah.

513
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:36,351
Good.

514
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,103
You're going to give him this.

515
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,321
He's going to meet you in the
parking lot across the street.

516
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:44,642
I want you to stand on the sidewalk.
That's your position.

517
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:47,451
Okay.

518
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:48,613
We're set.

519
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:50,940
We should go now.

520
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:10,933
You don't need to be scared, Brady.
Everything's going to be fine.

521
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm going to be able to
watch you the whole time,

522
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:14,991
and I'm going to be able to
hear everything that you say.

523
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,062
Now, I need you to
go to your position.

524
00:33:17,137 --> 00:33:18,810
You remember the position
we talked about?

525
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:20,343
Yeah. I'm going to
go to my position.

526
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,551
Okay.

527
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:33,490
All teams, report in.

528
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:34,791
Alpha team, in position.

529
00:33:34,978 --> 00:33:35,932
Bravo team, in position.

530
00:33:36,096 --> 00:33:37,213
Charlie team, in position.

531
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:38,761
Charlie team,
you are responsible

532
00:33:38,988 --> 00:33:41,053
for taking out Gredenko
with the tranquilizer dart.

533
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,480
Teams A and B,
I want you to acquire remaining targets.

534
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:46,961
Do whatever you have to,
to protect this kid.

535
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:55,901
Brady, it's Jack.
Can you hear me?

536
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,440
- I hear you.
- You're doing great.

537
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:02,363
- When can I see my brother?
- As soon as this is over, I promise.

538
00:34:02,826 --> 00:34:05,411
Okay. Okay, good.

539
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,792
I have a visual on Gredenko's SUV.
Windows are tinted.

540
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:20,343
I can't see who's inside.

541
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,991
Brady? Do you see the car
that's coming towards you?

542
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:24,763
Yeah.

543
00:34:24,906 --> 00:34:26,331
It's time to get ready.

544
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:38,842
I got a visual on Gredenko.

545
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:41,511
Charlie team, take your shot
as soon as you've got one.

546
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:42,392
Copy that.

547
00:34:42,628 --> 00:34:44,072
- Do you have it?
- Yeah.

548
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,231
Give it to me.

549
00:34:49,227 --> 00:34:52,133
I have a negative line of sight.
Hauser's in the way.

550
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:11,951
You look nervous, Brady.

551
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:16,360
Why are you so nervous?

552
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:23,260
Gredenko just gave the
order to shoot the kid

553
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:25,060
as soon as the
information's been verified.

554
00:35:25,066 --> 00:35:26,623
Charlie team,
do you have your shot yet?

555
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:28,022
Negative. Hauser's
still in the way.

556
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:29,720
- Can you move position?
- Negative.

557
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:33,750
Brady. Don't forget to pretend
like you can't hear me.

558
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:37,362
You're doing great. I want you
to listen to me very carefully.

559
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:41,163
When I tell you, I want you to go
down to the ground and stay there.

560
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,971
Wait till I tell you.

561
00:35:54,796 --> 00:35:56,290
Brady, get down on the ground.

562
00:35:57,957 --> 00:35:59,502
Brady, get down on the ground!

563
00:36:01,908 --> 00:36:03,402
All teams,
take out your targets.

564
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:07,322
All teams, there's a third
hostile inside the vehicle!

565
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:17,461
Brady. Brady, are you okay?

566
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:20,272
It's over. It's over.
You did great.

567
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:22,800
- I want to see my brother.
- Okay.

568
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:25,071
You can see your brother
just like I promised.

569
00:36:25,545 --> 00:36:28,641
Get Gredenko back in the house.
Prep him. Contact CTU.

570
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:30,811
Advise Buchanan that we've
got Gredenko in custody

571
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:32,442
and we're prepping
him for interrogation.

572
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:33,363
Yes, sir.

573
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:52,313
Watch your head.

574
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:57,113
Brady, this man's going
to look after you.

575
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,973
He's going to take you
to see your brother.

576
00:36:59,038 --> 00:37:00,623
- I want to see my brother.
- Yeah.

577
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:05,853
You did great. Thank you.

578
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,170
Okay.

579
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:28,311
We searched Gredenko's vehicle
and the surrounding area.

580
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,372
- There's no sign of the bombs.
- Is he conscious yet?

581
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:33,222
- Yes. You want help with him?
- No.

582
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,663
You know who I am?

583
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,402
I know all about you,
Agent Bauer.

584
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:57,390
Then you know what
I'm going to do to you

585
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:59,881
unless you tell me
where the bombs are.

586
00:38:01,036 --> 00:38:02,303
And when I'm finished,

587
00:38:02,436 --> 00:38:05,111
I'm going to put you on the fastest
plane we've got back to Russia.

588
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:09,563
I don't think President Suvarov's
going to be too happy to see you.

589
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,612
- Fayed has the bombs.
- Where is he?

590
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:16,810
I don't know.
But I can help you find him.

591
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:21,950
I'm listening.

592
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:26,230
I came here

593
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:31,532
to get security specs for the
Edgemont nuclear power plant.

594
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,692
- That's your next target.
- Yes.

595
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:37,710
Fayed's waiting for my call.

596
00:38:39,707 --> 00:38:41,012
Make the call.

597
00:38:42,627 --> 00:38:43,892
No.

598
00:38:45,278 --> 00:38:46,770
First, my terms.

599
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:49,640
Amnesty from your government.

600
00:38:50,015 --> 00:38:53,262
And a guarantee I won't
be returned to Russia.

601
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:56,582
What?

602
00:38:57,786 --> 00:39:02,250
I'm offering you Fayed.
What's the problem?

603
00:39:03,735 --> 00:39:05,422
I'm not martyr.

604
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:09,130
I'm soldier. And realist.

605
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:15,990
If I don't call him soon,
Fayed will get suspicious.

606
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,400
Admiral Smith,
is the Vickery ready to launch?

607
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:28,583
It's seconds from optimal launch
position, Mr. Vice President.

608
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:29,980
- Good.
- Mr. Vice President.

609
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:32,470
- Yes, Tom?
- Just spoke to Bill Buchanan at CTU.

610
00:39:32,658 --> 00:39:35,991
They've taken Gredenko into custody.
Jack Bauer is questioning him now.

611
00:39:36,185 --> 00:39:38,720
Does Bill think there's a chance
this could lead to something?

612
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:41,511
Well, he's confident that Bauer's
the man for the interrogation,

613
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:43,812
and he's hoping they get
the answers they need.

614
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:46,900
I hope his confidence
is justified.

615
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:50,851
Sir, the Vickery's in position.
They're standing by.

616
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:53,610
- Proceed with the strike.
- Yes, Mr. Vice President.

617
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:55,343
Mr. Vice President, if I may.

618
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:57,312
In light of the
developments at CTU,

619
00:39:57,637 --> 00:40:00,400
do we not want to delay
this launch and just

620
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:02,180
see what Bauer gets
out of Gredenko?

621
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:03,862
I'm not going to
delay our response

622
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:06,112
based on what Gredenko
may or may not reveal.

623
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:07,753
But if Gredenko
gives up the bombs,

624
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:09,672
then surely that is
the desired result...

625
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,541
Then we can consider
this strike

626
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:13,701
as retaliation for American
lives already lost!

627
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:17,442
A reminder to the world there are
consequences to attacking our country.

628
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:22,583
Admiral Smith...

629
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:23,892
proceed with the launch.

630
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:25,481
Yes, Mr. Vice President.

631
00:40:41,495 --> 00:40:46,013
Sir, the Vickery just received a
message over the COMPLAN subnet.

632
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:47,981
They've been ordered
to stand down.

633
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:51,841
What the hell are you talking about?
Who gave this order?

634
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:54,132
President Palmer, sir.

635
00:40:55,527 --> 00:40:57,210
President Palmer?

636
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:02,780
Conference Room, Lisa Miller.

637
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:06,842
One moment.

638
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:10,460
It's for you, sir.

639
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:14,913
Yes.

640
00:41:16,117 --> 00:41:18,500
Noah... it's Wayne.

641
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,893
Mr. President.

642
00:41:23,798 --> 00:41:26,423
It is an incredible relief
to hear your voice.

643
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:29,772
To be frank, it's a surprise.

644
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:33,431
- I've called off the strike, Noah.
- We just received word.

645
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:39,003
Sir, this action
is a product of

646
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:42,573
careful deliberation between
myself and the Joint Chiefs.

647
00:41:42,987 --> 00:41:45,331
Yeah, well, be that as it may,

648
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:48,993
the decision is mine
and mine alone.

649
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,100
I'm resuming my duties
as Commander in Chief.

650
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,980
Inform Admiral Smith
and the others,

651
00:41:57,255 --> 00:42:00,602
there's to be no hostile action
without my direct authorization.

652
00:42:02,637 --> 00:42:04,273
Is that understood?

653
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:07,173
Understood, Mr. President.

654
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:09,671
Good.

655
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:24,943
It's apparent to me that...

656
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:27,463
the President is still

657
00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:32,161
suffering the effects from
the attack on his life.

658
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:35,493
He's not thinking clearly,

659
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,721
and in my judgment,

660
00:42:39,898 --> 00:42:42,901
he's not capable of
discharging his duties.

661
00:42:44,635 --> 00:42:45,910
I can't let him
remain in power.

662
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:53,141
Get me the Attorney General.

663
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:58,140
