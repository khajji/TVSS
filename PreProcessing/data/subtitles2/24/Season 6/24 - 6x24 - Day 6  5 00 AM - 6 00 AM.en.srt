1
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:15,267
I'm aware that your

2
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:17,000
generals are pushing you

3
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,034
toward a military response.

4
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,334
SUVAROV:
 <i>Until you have the component,</i>

5
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:25,134
I have no choice but to continue
on our present path.

6
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,568
The man who has the component

7
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,267
is no longer working
with the Chinese.

8
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:30,834
He's offered to
trade it back to us,

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,767
and I've authorized
the exchange.

10
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:35,167
Phillip Bauer
is a sociopath.

11
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:47,401
 <i>We can't trust that</i>
 <i>he'll give us that component</i>

12
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:50,867
re probably on their way'
to arrest me.

13
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,201
They're here.

14
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:54,667
Send the kid down now.

15
00:00:54,733 --> 00:00:57,234
Show the sub-circuit board
first.

16
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:58,867
 <i>I need to verify it.</i>

17
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,267
There they are.
They've got Josh.

18
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,767
 <i>I don't have a clear shot</i>
 <i>without putting</i>

19
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:11,934
Josh at risk.

20
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,367
Get down!

21
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:17,867
I want you to get me

22
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:20,267
the names and locations of every
offshore oil platform

23
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:23,000
within a ten-mile radius.
My father

24
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:24,733
didn't pick this location
at random.

25
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:29,401
Morris, no luck

26
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:31,401
tracing the oil leases
through the CNC server.

27
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:32,834
You okay?

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,767
Yeah. I'm fine.

29
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,867
My God! Chloe! Chloe?

30
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:41,667
Could someone
please help me?

31
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:43,767
Darling? Darling?
Can you hear me?

32
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:45,967
Can someone please help me?!

33
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:59,700
(motor humming)

34
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:09,501
(motor stops)

35
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:22,800
Joshua.

36
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,101
I don't want to be
here with you!

37
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,468
We're not staying here.
We're leaving.

38
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,633
I don't want
to go anywhere with you.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,101
Look, Josh,
I don't expect you to understand

40
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,967
everything.
Not now, anyway.

41
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,101
Someday, you will,
and you'll thank me for it.

42
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:47,000
In the meantime,
you'll do as
you're told.

43
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,468
Is that clear?

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,034
Good.

45
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,867
(Cheng speaking Chinese)

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,334
The submarine is on schedule.

47
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:03,834
How soon before
they pick us up?

48
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,834
30 minutes.

49
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,468
Her vitals are strong.

50
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,767
She's in no immediate danger.

51
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,633
Then why did she collapse?

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,967
Dehydration. Exhaustion.

53
00:03:35,034 --> 00:03:36,934
She hasn't slept
in 36 hours.

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,633
He said I'm fine, Morris.

55
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,301
It's not a big deal.

56
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,834
You should be
at your workstation.

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,134
No. I should
be right here with you.

58
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,468
You should
be checking

59
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,800
the EPA database, to see what
oil platforms are owned

60
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,900
by Phillip Bauer.
Other people can do that.

61
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,900
If you really want
to make me feel better,

62
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:59,234
then go find Phillip Bauer.

63
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:01,800
Are you sure you're all right?

64
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:08,700
Okay, then.

65
00:04:19,534 --> 00:04:21,267
(sighs)

66
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,700
Morris, is Chloe all right?

67
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,401
The doctor's still running
some tests, but he says

68
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:36,667
she's going to be fine.

69
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,568
Jack was right about his father.

70
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,234
One of his companies
owns a federal lease

71
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,568
on an oil platform
six miles offshore.
That's where you think

72
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,134
Phillip Bauer's keeping the boy?

73
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,568
Well, the platform's
been decommissioned.

74
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,534
Okay. Give me
the wheel, Nadia.

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Let's try a thermal scan.

76
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:53,034
See if we can pick up
any signs of life.

77
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,934
That's awfully crowded
for a decommissioned platform.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,967
Can you back-time the satellite
imagery a few minutes?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay, there. That must be
Josh Bauer arriving.

80
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,800
That would be 20 minutes
after he was taken.

81
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,501
The timing works.
Send a copy of this

82
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,667
to my screen, and forward
it to the White House.

83
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,733
Will do.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,667
Get me Tom Lennox, please.

85
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:34,934
(phone rings)

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,434
Dr. Hastings here.

87
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:37,934
This is Morris O'Brian.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,167
Have Chloe O'Brian's
test results come in yet?

89
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:42,401
You just left here
a few minutes ago,
Mr. O'Brian.

90
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,934
We're still
running those tests.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,501
Well, when do you
expect the results?

92
00:05:46,568 --> 00:05:47,900
Soon.

93
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,700
Can you call me
when you get them?

94
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,967
I'm afraid I can't
release that information.

95
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:54,000
Not without
Ms. O'Brian's permission.

96
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,401
I'm her husband.

97
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,667
Ex-husband. I'm sorry,
but I can only share information

98
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,401
with Ms. O'Brian's family.

99
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:02,867
Fine.

100
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,000
And reports indicate
the Russians
are setting up

101
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,733
an offensive
position.
All right. Thank you.

102
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,867
Meaning they can attack our base
at a moment's notice.

103
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,633
That's correct, sir.

104
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,000
Sir, that was CTU.
They've just located

105
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,568
Phillip Bauer
and a dozen or so

106
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,367
confederates
on an oil drilling platform

107
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:20,967
six miles off the coast
of Los Angeles.

108
00:06:21,034 --> 00:06:22,501
And he has
the sub-circuit board?

109
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:24,334
We are assuming so, sir.

110
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:26,401
I'll pass this on to Suvarov.

111
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,000
Maybe it'll buy us
some more time.

112
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:30,733
Meanwhile, I want an assault
team dispatched

113
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,534
to that oil rig.
Mr. Vice President,

114
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,301
if I may?

115
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,134
Go ahead, Ethan.

116
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:37,000
If the platform
is well-defended,

117
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,367
an assault team might
run into trouble.

118
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,067
I recommend an air attack.

119
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,700
Two Navy F-18's could

120
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,401
obliterate that platform
and everyone on it.

121
00:06:45,468 --> 00:06:47,867
What about
the sub-circuit board?

122
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,967
If it's not destroyed
in the attack,

123
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,134
it'll sink into the ocean,

124
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,867
the salt water will
render it useless

125
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:55,234
in minutes.
Tom?

126
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,000
Sir, we think
Phillip Bauer's grandson

127
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,700
is on that same platform.

128
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:04,568
Now, he might well
survive a surgical strike
by an assault team,

129
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,267
but there's no way
he's going to live

130
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,201
through this proposed
aerial attack.

131
00:07:08,267 --> 00:07:12,401
We are talking about an innocent
16-year-old boy here.

132
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:14,067
None of us like
this any more

133
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,101
than you do, but
if the Russians attack our base,

134
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,067
a lot of innocent young men
are going to die.

135
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,201
And the truth is,
an air strike

136
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:24,468
would be the
most effective

137
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,234
from a political point
of view, as well.

138
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,700
It'll show the Russians
that we're

139
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,900
sparing no effort
to destroy

140
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,501
the sub-circuit board.

141
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,201
Send the F-18's immediately.

142
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,834
Yes, sir, Mr. Vice President.

143
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,867
You're gonna be
all right, Mike.

144
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,101
You're going
to make it.

145
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:44,134
Jack, I'm sorry.

146
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,733
You were following
your orders.

147
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,067
(phone rings)
Get the kid...

148
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,434
Get the kid,  Jack.

149
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,700
I will.

150
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,267
Did you find my father?

151
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,900
Yes. We believe
that he's on a
decommissioned

152
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,000
Tomol oil platform,
six miles offshore.

153
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,201
Were you able to confirm
that Josh is with him?

154
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,101
Thermal scan shows
three people arriving
on the platform

155
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,900
20 minutes after
Josh was taken,

156
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,633
so it's highly likely
he's one of them.

157
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,301
Nadia, I want
to lead the assault team.

158
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,000
There's not going
to be an assault team, Jack.

159
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,434
What are you talking about?

160
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,934
I just got notification that
the White House has ordered

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,501
an air strike by Navy F-18s.

162
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:17,000
The Vice President thinks an
assault team will take too long.

163
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:19,067
I couldn't call those jets back
if I tried.

164
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:20,267
When is it going to happen?

165
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,000
In less than 30 minutes.
Look, I need

166
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:23,633
you and Bill to come back to CTU

167
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,334
on Aerial One
for an immediate debrief.

168
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,600
Jack?

169
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,167
Fine.

170
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:34,101
What's wrong?

171
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,800
CTU located my father and Josh

172
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,900
on one of the offshore
oil platforms.

173
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:39,534
There's not going
to be an assault.

174
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,800
They've launched
an F-18 air strike.

175
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,167
No one on that platform
is going to survive.

176
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:45,934
I'm sorry, Jack.

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,468
Jack, don't even
think about it.

178
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,700
You'll only
get yourself killed.
You won't save Josh.

179
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:53,501
Look, I realize
he's your nephew...

180
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,867
I'm not going to do something
because he's my nephew.

181
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,501
I'm going to do
something because
he's an innocent kid being

182
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:00,733
written off as some kind of an
acceptable loss. It's wrong.

183
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,367
Nadia has ordered
us back to CTU
in Chopper One.

184
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,401
I'm going to take it.

185
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:07,967
I'll fly.

186
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:10,301
You prep the weapons.

187
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,167
It's been a while, but I can
get us to the platform.

188
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:16,034
With any luck,
I might even be able
to get us back.

189
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:18,301
You don't need
to do this, Bill.
Yes, I do.

190
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,934
I don't want to live
with this one either.

191
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,934
Let's get ready.

192
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,867
You're going to need that.

193
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,900
We're commandeering
your helicopter. Get out.

194
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,234
#Fixing target coordinates.
Be in range in 22 minutes.

195
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:45,600
Sir, significant numbers
of Russian troops

196
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,734
have assumed
a flanking position

197
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,468
along the eastern rim
of our military base.

198
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,967
What am I to
take from that?

199
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:55,867
A tactical advancement like that
indicates imminent attack.

200
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:59,301
All right.
Put him through. Sir?

201
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,934
You got Suvarov?

202
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:03,201
Yes, sir.

203
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,468
Mr. President, this is

204
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,633
Vice President Daniels.

205
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,734
Mr. Vice President,
the last time we spoke,

206
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,567
you said an opportunity
had presented itself.

207
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,001
Unfortunately, that
didn't work out,

208
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,001
but there has been

209
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,667
a significant
new development,

210
00:11:20,734 --> 00:11:23,101
and I'm asking
you to hold off

211
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:26,134
on any military
assault on our base.

212
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:27,734
For what reason, sir?

213
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,234
The Chinese agents who are
in possession of the component

214
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,368
have been tracked

215
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:34,368
to an oil platform
off our West Coast.

216
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:38,134
We assume they're there
awaiting transport to China.

217
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:41,468
I've ordered an air strike
to destroy the platform

218
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:43,834
before that rendezvous
can happen.

219
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,633
I realize that...

220
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,800
you have no reason
to accept what I'm telling you.

221
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:54,734
Not without proof, at least,
but I implore you...

222
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,067
Mr. Vice President,
I believe you.

223
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,734
Just moments ago, one
of our listening posts

224
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,401
intercepted a transmission
to a Chinese submarine

225
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:04,401
operating in the
western Pacific.

226
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:07,734
The point of origin is
ten miles off your coast.

227
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,500
And the contents suggest that
the submarine is en route

228
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,700
to pick up the component.
Then you know that I'm
telling you the truth.

229
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,434
You say you have
already launched

230
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,267
an air strike
against this oil platform.

231
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:20,533
Yes. That's the only way we can
make absolutely certain

232
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
that the component's
been destroyed.

233
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:23,934
Sir,

234
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:26,600
we're prepared to give you
a real-time uplink

235
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,234
to our satellite feed
of the assault operation.

236
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:32,167
One moment, please, sir.

237
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:36,368
(indistinct murmuring)

238
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:39,368
Uh, how long until your fighters

239
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:40,468
reach the target?

240
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,767
Less than 20 minutes, sir.

241
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,500
20 minutes,

242
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,734
Mr. President.

243
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,800
Very well,

244
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,067
but be advised,

245
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:53,101
nothing less than
the complete destruction

246
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,734
of this oil platform
will give us

247
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,401
the assurance we require.

248
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:57,734
Understood.

249
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,533
Stand by.

250
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,767
The satellite feed will
be there momentarily.

251
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,267
I wish you luck,
Mr. Vice President.

252
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,468
Yes, the Coast Guard
and the Navy

253
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,767
are coordinating directly.
They're patrolling a five-mile

254
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:17,167
perimeter around
the target.

255
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:21,001
Yes, sir. I'll keep
you in the loop.

256
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,134
What is it, Morris?

257
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,667
Jack's commandeered
a CTU chopper.

258
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:27,234
He's requesting an uplink
to our satellite feed.
What?

259
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,767
He's on the way to the
oil platform. He's
with Bill Buchanan.

260
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,301
NADIA:
Arial One, please confirm.

261
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:38,301
Come in.

262
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:39,967
This is Bauer. We copy.

263
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:42,034
Look, Jack, I know you
want to save your nephew,

264
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:43,967
but I can't authorize
a suicide mission.

265
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:46,001
We don't need your
authorization, Nadia,

266
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,067
we need your help.

267
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:48,767
Those F-18s will be
within striking range

268
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,134
in 18 minutes.

269
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,834
What if we find the
component first?

270
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,234
It won't make a difference.

271
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:54,567
The strike team's orders
are non-contingent.

272
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,301
All you're gonna do
is get yourselves killed.

273
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,468
BUCHANAN:
Nadia, it's Bill. Look,

274
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,700
I understand the
pressure you're under,

275
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,767
but you have to believe
me when I tell you--

276
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,800
this is the right call to make.

277
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:10,967
Morris said you need a visual
on the oil platform?

278
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:12,567
Yes.
We need to know

279
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:14,567
how many hostiles
are on the platform
and where they are.

280
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:15,834
MORRIS:
Uploading the latest

281
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,434
satellite capture.
Okay, you'll have it in

282
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,600
a few seconds.
Copy that. Send it to my PDA.

283
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:20,734
PDA? Got it.

284
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,967
BUCHANAN:
Thank you, Nadia.

285
00:14:22,034 --> 00:14:23,500
You did the right thing.

286
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:34,368
Bill, I need you to put
your comm unit in.

287
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:41,767
How should I make
our approach, Jack?

288
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,001
Wind's heavy out of the west.

289
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:45,468
If we fly into it and
stay low to the water,

290
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,101
we should be able to
catch them off-guard.

291
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,334
It won't buy us much time.

292
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,967
We'll have to engage
them from the air.

293
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:51,600
I'll hold them off
so you can land,

294
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,967
then we'll move in.

295
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,834
The radar is locked
onto the target.

296
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:13,734
Josh.

297
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,167
We'll leave
in 15 minutes.

298
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:19,734
Please just let me go.

299
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,834
I can't do that.

300
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,834
Why not?

301
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,134
Because I can't.

302
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,567
You have a
lot to learn.

303
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,667
Now, it's my
responsibility

304
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:31,267
to teach you. The
first lesson is...

305
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:32,401
pay attention.

306
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:42,533
(speaking Chinese)

307
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,101
What is it?

308
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,101
There's a helicopter
approaching.

309
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,368
We need to get
to the boat and head west.

310
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,600
There's a locator
beacon onboard.

311
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,500
The submarine
will pick us up.

312
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,067
Here. Take the component.

313
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:02,201
I'll see about
the helicopter.

314
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,334
I'll join you shortly.

315
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:25,134
Once we hit the deck,
we're gonna have to move hard.

316
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,067
You ready to move up?

317
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:37,800
Ready!
Take it up!

318
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:47,001
We're clear to land!

319
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,167
(yelling)

320
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:17,834
Don't move!

321
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,600
Where's the boy?
Where is the boy?!

322
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:21,867
You're too late.

323
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:24,267
Take this. Get him

324
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,201
up to the chopper
What are you doing?

325
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm gonna make sure Josh
isn't on this platform.

326
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,234
We only have ten minutes!

327
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:32,301
Get up! Get up!

328
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:57,800
#Come on, Josh. Stop it.

329
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,268
I can't.

330
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,268
Of course you can.

331
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:02,167
All it takes is a
little self-control.

332
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:06,001
You're behaving like a child.

333
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:11,533
You have to learn to
control your emotions.

334
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,268
You must never let
them control you,

335
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:15,567
you understand?

336
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,167
Good.

337
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,834
Come on.

338
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:35,734
(gunshots)

339
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:46,734
Target will be in range
in four minutes, 30 seconds.

340
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,368
(groans)

341
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:10,368
(panting)

342
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,634
I'm not going with you.

343
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:19,500
You're not gonna shoot me.

344
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:21,067
Give me the gun.

345
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:24,934
Now.

346
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:25,834
No.

347
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,500
As long as you're alive, me
and my mom will never be safe.

348
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,268
Josh, listen to me.

349
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,467
I've always cared about you.

350
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,567
No!

351
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:37,067
You only care
about yourself.

352
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,334
That's not true.

353
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,134
You're the reason
I'm doing all this.

354
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:40,967
Shut up!

355
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:41,967
I love you, Josh.

356
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:43,201
(gunshot)
(groans)

357
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:50,934
Josh!

358
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:55,067
It's all right.
I've got him.

359
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:56,334
You can lower that weapon.

360
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,834
Josh!

361
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,400
Lower your gun.

362
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:09,433
I know how scared and angry
you must feel right now.

363
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,800
I know. I've been exactly
where you are.

364
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:15,001
I know exactly how
you feel, but you're

365
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:16,433
gonna have to trust me on this.

366
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,301
You do not want
to live with the pain

367
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:21,500
of taking another person's
life, even if you think

368
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,634
they deserve it.

369
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,234
In a few minutes,
there's gonna be

370
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:26,767
an F-18 air strike
on this platform.

371
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,268
We need to get
out of here.

372
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:29,901
We need to get
out of here now.

373
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,101
Please.

374
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,101
It's all right.

375
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,901
Just give me the gun.

376
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,101
It's all right.

377
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,134
It's all right.

378
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,234
It's over. It's over.

379
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:39,934
I need you to get up

380
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,234
to the top of
the platform

381
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:42,533
and get in the
chopper now.

382
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,533
Go. Move! 

383
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,533
What about you?

384
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,867
I'll be right behind you!

385
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:46,867
Keep going!

386
00:20:46,934 --> 00:20:48,134
Get up.

387
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:51,967
Get up!

388
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:53,800
It's over.

389
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,167
Then finish it.

390
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,533
No.

391
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,834
You are gonna be held
accountable for what you

392
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:01,067
have done today.

393
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,167
I don't think so.

394
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,433
You don't have time to carry me,

395
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,301
not if what you said
about the air strike

396
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,734
is true.

397
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,967
And you don't
want to die.

398
00:21:13,034 --> 00:21:16,101
Not here.

399
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,433
Not with me.

400
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,934
You're gonna get off easy.

401
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:48,067
CTU, this is Aerial One.

402
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:50,400
My count shows the
strike in two minutes.

403
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:51,800
Negative. You
have 90 seconds

404
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:54,634
before those F-18s are
within striking range.

405
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,268
You need to
get off that
platform <i>now.</i>

406
00:21:58,268 --> 00:21:59,700
Bill. Confirm.

407
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:02,101
Copy that! Stand by!

408
00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:06,934
Where's Jack?
He's with my grandpa.

409
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:08,268
Get in!

410
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:16,901
Mr. Vice President, the target
is in range. Strike team

411
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,467
reports... missile lock.

412
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:22,834
Take it out.

413
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:27,301
Echo six-four is
clear to engage.

414
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,867
Echo six-four,
you are clear to engage.

415
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,967
Roger that.
Stand by for missile launch.

416
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:39,433
Wait! We can't leave
without my uncle!

417
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,067
We're not leaving. Hang on.

418
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,167
Jack, I'm coming
around to the south.

419
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:46,301
Meet me on level three.

420
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:48,101
Copy that, Bill. I'm on it.

421
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:54,167
Bill, I see you.

422
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:56,001
I'm on the southwest corner.

423
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:02,734
Fox One, fire.

424
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,934
(grunts)

425
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:34,034
Aerial
One, please
confirm.

426
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:38,967
Bill, please confirm.

427
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,034
Bill, this is Nadia.
Do you copy?

428
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:42,567
BUCHANAN:
CTU, this is Aerial One.

429
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,600
We copy.

430
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:47,400
I've got Jack
and his nephew,

431
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,667
and Cheng in custody.

432
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,134
We're heading back to CTU.

433
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,234
We'll have a landing crew
standing by, sir.

434
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,034
Strike team reports multiple

435
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:10,600
direct hits.

436
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,268
Satellite recon
is reporting...

437
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:17,101
target is completely

438
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,433
destroyed.

439
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:22,001
Good work.

440
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,467
Mr. President, you're seeing
what we're seeing.

441
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,368
Yes, we are.

442
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,368
(indistinct murmuring)

443
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:35,834
We concur that the target
has been eliminated.

444
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:38,400
Then I trust you're satisfied
that the component's

445
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,167
been destroyed, as well.

446
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,334
I am.

447
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,034
I'm ordering the full withdrawal
of our troops

448
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,001
from the eastern rim of your

449
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,700
military base.

450
00:24:49,767 --> 00:24:51,234
Good, Mr. President.

451
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:53,901
You will excuse me if I wait
until your troops

452
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,567
are completely withdrawn
before I order

453
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:57,667
our squadrons in the air
to stand down.

454
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,368
Yes, of course.

455
00:25:00,433 --> 00:25:03,301
And Mr. Vice President...

456
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:07,134
I regret that the
events of this day

457
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:08,967
have brought us
to such a dangerous

458
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:11,901
and unfortunate
situation, but...

459
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,834
when my country's security
is threatened...

460
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:18,234
I understand, Mr. President,
all too well.

461
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:21,101
Yes, I'm sure you do.

462
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:24,533
My best wishes for the recovery
of President Palmer.

463
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:30,067
Thank you.

464
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:32,901
Good-bye, Mr. Vice President.

465
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:58,533
What the hell happened?

466
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,634
He fell!

467
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,268
Uncle Jack fell!

468
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:05,101
All right, I'm going back.

469
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,467
He's all right.

470
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:53,334
* *

471
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:04,467
Where are we going?

472
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:05,734
Back to CTU.

473
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,001
No, we can't.
We have to go back for him.

474
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:11,201
Jack's not ready to go back yet.

475
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,433
#You should know, sir,

476
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,667
we've received
confirmation

477
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:50,634
the Chinese have recalled
their sub to its base in Ningpo.

478
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:56,600
Tell Admiral Smith to have one
of our subs shadow them.

479
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,801
I want the Chinese to
know that we're aware

480
00:27:58,867 --> 00:27:59,934
of their activities.
Yes, sir.

481
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:03,567
And thank you, Ethan,
for everything.

482
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:06,901
Extend my gratitude
to the Joint Chiefs.

483
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:10,001
Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

484
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,967
Sir, not to quash your flush
of victory here...

485
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:17,667
the actions of the Chinese
cannot go unaddressed.

486
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:21,634
We'll leave that
for another day, Tom.

487
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,067
Right now, I don't know about
you, but I could use some sleep.

488
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:28,134
There's just one other
outstanding issue

489
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:30,034
I would like to
discuss with you, sir.

490
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,567
Karen Hayes.

491
00:28:34,634 --> 00:28:38,333
Sir, she's about to be
transferred into FBI custody.

492
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,101
Now in light of the recent
terrorist

493
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:43,333
attacks, the nuke
in California,

494
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,967
the plot against
the President,

495
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,268
I just think we need
to preserve whatever...

496
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,934
(sighs)

497
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:51,734
...fragile faith the American
people might still have

498
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,201
in this administration.

499
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:01,834
Just let Karen and Bill resign
with their reputations intact.

500
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,600
All right, Tom.

501
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,600
Take care of that for me.

502
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,134
All right.

503
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,634
Thank you, sir.

504
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:19,168
Here's that tape recording
you asked for.

505
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,534
(sighs)

506
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:37,600
Hey.

507
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:38,600
Hi.

508
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,400
How you feeling?
Good.

509
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,867
Jack got the boy.
They're both safe.

510
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:48,268
What about the Russians?

511
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,767
They backed off.

512
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,600
They were satisfied that
the component was destroyed.

513
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,333
And Jack's father?

514
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,834
He was killed in the air strike.

515
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:56,801
And Cheng's
in custody.

516
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:58,234
Good.
Look...

517
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,500
um...

518
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:02,134
I was talking
to Dr. Hastings.

519
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,567
He says the test
results are in,

520
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:04,801
but he's not
telling me anything.

521
00:30:04,867 --> 00:30:06,534
He insists I talk to you.

522
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,967
Is it... serious?

523
00:30:12,034 --> 00:30:14,300
Yeah.

524
00:30:14,367 --> 00:30:17,734
Bloody hell, Chloe, whatever
it is, I'll help you get

525
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:19,333
through it.

526
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,667
No, you won't.
We're not together.

527
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:22,967
Oh, sod that.

528
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:24,734
Really, come on,

529
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:27,168
when you collapsed,
I thought something

530
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:29,201
might really be wrong.

531
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:31,867
I can't lose you, darling.

532
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:32,934
Really?

533
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:34,467
Yeah, really.
I love you.

534
00:30:37,034 --> 00:30:39,034
Okay.

535
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:42,034
That's good,
'cause I'm pregnant.

536
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,467
You mean what?

537
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,367
With child?

538
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:51,534
That's usually how it works.

539
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,001
(whispers):
Chloe...

540
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:58,101
You know...

541
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:01,168
this is a nice moment.

542
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,600
Let's not ruin it by saying
something stupid.

543
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,600
Let's just go back to work.

544
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:12,867
Okay.

545
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:14,767
Okay.

546
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,967
Tom?
Karen.

547
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:30,767
You've come to say

548
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:31,634
good-bye?

549
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,967
Well, in a manner
of speaking.

550
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,967
You're free to go.

551
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:39,234
The Vice President is dropping
all charges against you.

552
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:45,067
What about Bill?

553
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,134
He's being pardoned, as well.

554
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:48,467
Of course,
the Vice President's

555
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,234
still expecting
your resignations,

556
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,433
but, uh... you're free to
go live your lives

557
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,268
without fear of prosecution.

558
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:58,700
Is that suitable?

559
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:01,400
Yes. Yes.
Yes, it is.

560
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:02,967
All right.
Well, good luck.

561
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:05,801
I know you had a hand
in this, Tom.

562
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,834
Thank you.

563
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,067
You know, Karen,

564
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,333
I actually think
I'm going to miss you.

565
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,567
Really?

566
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,134
I can answer that better
after you've gone.

567
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,934
There's your mother.
Josh!

568
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,067
(sobbing)

569
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:57,534
You'll be debriefed at
a federal detention facility.

570
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,700
My people will not abandon me
like you abandoned Jack Bauer.

571
00:33:04,034 --> 00:33:05,867
Get him out of here.

572
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:15,001
It's good to see you
again, sir.

573
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:17,567
You did good work today.
You should be proud.

574
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:19,901
Thank you.

575
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:21,600
That means a lot
coming from you.

576
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,001
Where's Jack?

577
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:30,500
He fell from the chopper

578
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:33,268
into the ocean
during the extraction.

579
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,934
He made it to shore;
he's fine.

580
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:37,268
Why didn't you pick him up?

581
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,201
He didn't want me to.

582
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,700
I don't understand.
We need to find him.

583
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:46,034
We'll never find him.
Not if he doesn't want us to.

584
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:50,667
Let him go.

585
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,667
Somehow it just
doesn't feel real.

586
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,901
But I am grateful
that she's alive.

587
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,500
Of course.

588
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:05,734
I'll let you know.

589
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:07,234
Thanks.

590
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,433
(sighs)

591
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,600
(door closing)

592
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,101
Put it down.

593
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,101
Now.

594
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:52,600
Are you here to kill me?

595
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,168
Depends.

596
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:56,101
Where's Audrey?

597
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,101
I told you before,
you're not getting

598
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,667
anywhere near
my daughter...

599
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,433
You do not tell me what
to do anymore!

600
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,767
Do you understand me?

601
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,567
You do not tell
me what to do.

602
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:12,034
I just watched my father die...

603
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:13,268
and I felt nothing.

604
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,667
You know why?

605
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,367
Yeah, you know why.

606
00:35:20,433 --> 00:35:22,834
Because that man was dead
to me years ago.

607
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,367
I admired you, I looked up
to you like a father.

608
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:30,433
You were the kind
of man I wanted to be.

609
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,667
And you took
advantage of it!

610
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:32,834
Jack, listen to me.

611
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:35,967
No! You are going
to listen to me.

612
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:44,067
Earlier today,

613
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:46,634
you said that I was cursed.

614
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,433
That anyone I touched...

615
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,667
ended up dead

616
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:53,667
or ruined.

617
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,034
How dare you.

618
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:59,134
How... dare you.

619
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,734
The only thing I did,

620
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:02,967
the only thing
I have ever done,

621
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,767
is what you and people like you
have asked of me.

622
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,067
Why didn't you try
to get me out of China?

623
00:36:14,134 --> 00:36:15,234
I did try.

624
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,867
Not hard enough!

625
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:21,433
You had the political power.

626
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,168
Was the timing not right?

627
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:28,734
Was it a little
too complicated?

628
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,667
Or was I just
an acceptable loss?

629
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:33,567
Jack, I understand your anger...

630
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:35,367
Shut up!

631
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:40,600
You don't understand
a thing about me.

632
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,834
But I know you.

633
00:36:46,901 --> 00:36:48,934
I know why you're angry at me.

634
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:51,600
And it wasn't because Audrey
went to China to save me.

635
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,600
It was because when you
told her not to,

636
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:57,067
she did it
anyway.

637
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,067
You'll never understand
that kind of commitment,

638
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:03,400
that kind
of loyalty.

639
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:05,767
You're right, Jack.

640
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:10,367
It wasn't fair of me
to put all this on you,

641
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:11,967
to blame you for what
happened to Audrey.

642
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:16,700
I know the sacrifices
you've made.

643
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:21,534
I know this country owes you
more than it will ever repay.

644
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,634
I'm not interested in what you
think this country owes me.

645
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,567
I want my life back,

646
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:31,934
and I want it now.

647
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:33,967
Audrey's all I've got.

648
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:36,967
And you can't stop me.

649
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:39,400
In case you've
forgotten,

650
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:42,234
I'm very good
at disappearing.

651
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,567
And if you try sending
someone after us,

652
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:46,700
I'm kill them.

653
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,834
I'm pretty good at that, too.

654
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:54,534
Simply getting your life
back, Jack,

655
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
isn't going to change

656
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:57,934
who you are.

657
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:00,234
And you can't
walk away from it.

658
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,634
You know that.

659
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,001
You've tried it.

660
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:05,667
Sooner or later you're going
to get back in the game.

661
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:08,268
And my daughter's going
to pay the price,

662
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,801
like your wife did.

663
00:38:13,901 --> 00:38:15,700
You son of a bitch.

664
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:19,201
Jack, I beg you,
just stop for a moment

665
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:22,067
and think.

666
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,433
Think, Jack.

667
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,534
You won't be able to take care
of her the way you want to.

668
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,201
Where is she?

669
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:34,467
Take me to her now.

670
00:39:00,801 --> 00:39:03,901
* *

671
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,734
It's me. I'm here.

672
00:40:02,001 --> 00:40:04,433
I know that I promised...

673
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:09,734
to take care of you...

674
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:12,300
and protect you...

675
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:18,168
But I'm at a crossroads.

676
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:25,201
Right now, the best way...

677
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:35,134
The only way...

678
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:37,834
to do that is to let you go.

679
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,300
I hope one day
you can understand that.

680
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:57,801
I hope one day 
you can forgive me.

681
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,534
I love you with all my heart.

682
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,901
And I always will.


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
