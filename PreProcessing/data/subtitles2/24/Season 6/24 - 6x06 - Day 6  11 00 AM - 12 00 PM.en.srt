MAN:
Going down! No!

00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:24,401
WAYNE:
 <i>How many people died in this?</i>

6
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:26,267
No less than 12,000.

7
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,733
Four more tactical nuclear

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,934
weapons were stolen along
with the one that went off.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,067
 <i>CTU was trying to determine</i>

10
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,134
where Fayed was

11
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:35,167
at the time.
The worst case scenario

12
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:36,633
is that he
is still alive

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,267
and in possession of the
remaining nuclear weapons.

14
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,501
My engineer died

15
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,800
in the blast.
The device used

16
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:44,434
to reprogram the trigger
was destroyed as well.

17
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,633
 <i>I have four more bombs</i>
 <i>whose triggers need</i>

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,034
to be made operational.

19
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,468
We need someone who could
replicate what that device did,

20
00:00:50,534 --> 00:00:52,034
with modern equipment.

21
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:53,700
McCarthy will find
someone for us.

22
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,700
Tell the man these bombs
will go off today.

23
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:58,800
Walid overheard
some conversations

24
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:00,000
about the bombs.

25
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:02,000
 <i>If there is an active</i>
 <i>shell inside</i>

26
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:05,434
 <i>that detention facility,</i>
 <i>we need Walid to find out more.</i>

27
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:08,101
He's wiring you.
It's a two-way radio.

28
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,034
Now you're going
to tell me

29
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,501
what we found in your
wallet, you understand me?

30
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:12,267
(grunts)

31
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,401
You're going to say

32
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,034
that I asked about this man.

33
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:16,800
Got to make them believe
you're working for them.

34
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,867
What if they find out
he's wearing a wire?

35
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:20,301
The guards inside know
what's going on.

36
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:21,534
They'll keep an eye
on him.

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,434
I sent Fayed to negotiate

38
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,600
with an ex-Soviet general

39
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,534
about the cache of tactical
nuclear weapons.

40
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,700
What was the name
of the general?

41
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:29,234
Dmitri Gredenko.

42
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,334
Assad just gave us the name

43
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:31,667
of a Russian general

44
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:34,101
Fayed contacted a year ago
about the nukes.

45
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:36,834
 <i>Gredenko did business</i>
 <i>with BXJ Technologies,</i>

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,301
 <i>specifically with your father.</i>

47
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:39,733
My father?

48
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,633
I haven't spoken to him
for over nine years.

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,501
Well, we'll send someone over
to talk to him.

50
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:44,568
I should do this.

51
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:46,234
He'll talk to me, if I go alone.

52
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,367
You will never guess
who just called here.

53
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,468
Who?

54
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:50,667
Your brother Jack.

55
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,000
 <i>What's he want?</i>

56
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:53,468
He's looking for the old man.

57
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:55,501
Damn it, we should have killed
Jack when we had the chance,

58
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:57,067
instead of handing him over
to the Chinese.

59
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:59,134
Look at the bright side:
you got out--

60
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:00,934
you're here--
so just relax a little bit.

61
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:05,401
Gray, people in
this country are dying.

62
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,167
And I need some information.

63
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:08,867
Are you going to
give it to me

64
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:10,067
or do I have to start
hurting you?

65
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:11,700
I told you I don't
know where Dad is.

66
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,434
What do you want from me?
The truth!

67
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,134
That is the truth.
I swear to you on
my family's life.

68
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,800
Not good enough.

69
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,468
(sudden shout)

70
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:30,900
WAYNE:
Although the crisis we face
today is a grave and dire one,

71
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:32,301
we will rise above it.

72
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:37,067
We have been challenged
as never before.

73
00:02:37,134 --> 00:02:39,900
This time, against this enemy,
armed with these weapons,

74
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:42,733
we must rely
on the strength and faith

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,468
of every single American.

76
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:46,733
And that faith is unshakable.

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,234
We must rise above our fears,
above our bigotries

78
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,667
and stand our ground.

79
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:56,234
Our goal is the defeat of
the enemy and the preservation

80
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,767
of our values.

81
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:00,800
We've achieved that goal
in the past.

82
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:03,201
And so we shall again.

83
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,201
Thank you.

84
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:07,934
I wish he had not

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,934
said that.
Sir?

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,434
Made a promise
he can't keep.

87
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,534
The American people have got
to get used to the fact

88
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,234
these security measures
are a way of life,

89
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,101
they're not some
temporary Band-Aid.

90
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,667
Now you're making policy
unilaterally, Tom.

91
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:28,434
The president was

92
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:30,468
absolutely clear

93
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:31,633
about your proposals.

94
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,101
I'm sorry,
what is this about, Karen?

95
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,767
"National Guard
supplanting police

96
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,101
"in major cities,

97
00:03:39,167 --> 00:03:42,534
expanding detentions
based on soft intel."

98
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,633
You authorized these
without presidential consent.

99
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,534
Now how many times do you think

100
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,167
we are going
to be going over this?

101
00:03:49,234 --> 00:03:51,600
I am taking preparatory steps

102
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,334
to allow the president
to act swiftly,

103
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,134
should he decide to act at all.

104
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,767
Nobody is authorizing anything.

105
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:00,733
That's what you said
about the detention facilities,

106
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,134
and yet those
"preparatory measures"

107
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,867
turned into an illegal
paramilitary operation.

108
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:08,134
Well, however you may choose
to characterize it,

109
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,167
The president agreed
to all of these actions...
That's because

110
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:11,800
you've distorted the facts.
What is it, Tom?

111
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,234
Is it that you think I'm some

112
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,167
bleeding heart liberal

113
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:16,534
preaching civil liberties--
is that it?

114
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,568
I'll tell you what I think.

115
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,967
The Constitution is
a wonderful thing, Karen,

116
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:23,301
but back in the days

117
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,468
of the Founding Fathers,
the weapon at hand was

118
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:27,401
a single-shot musket.

119
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,667
It took a half a minute
to load and fire.

120
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,867
Fayed just killed 12,000 people

121
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,934
in less time without
even taking aim.

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I love the Constitution,

123
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,667
but I won't be ducking behind it
when the next nuke goes off.

124
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:42,700
I'm a realist, too, Tom, and
I am willing to do what it takes

125
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:43,667
to protect this country...

126
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,000
No, you are not!

127
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,434
But I am looking a little
further down the road.

128
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,000
These warrantless arrests and

129
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,234
detention centers
will cause

130
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:52,034
irreparable damage
to this country.

131
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,301
Hey, you know something?
Why don't you just hop a shuttle

132
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,534
over to Justice Department...

133
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
You are using this crisis...
You don't belong

134
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,067
in National Security.

135
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:00,301
...to advance a very
dangerous agenda,

136
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,101
Tom, and take advantage
of Presidential power.

137
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,434
You know something?
I'm done in here.
And I will
not let you do it.

138
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:05,800
And if you think
that you are going

139
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,468
to wear me down, you are

140
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:09,700
sadly mistaken.

141
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,967
Actually,
you're wearing me down.

142
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:19,934
No, that's right,
you won't make

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,967
the same mistake again, because
you're going to give the file

144
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:24,000
to Sharon, she's going
to handle it from there.

145
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:26,034
No, get it done.

146
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,234
I need Karen Hayes
to go away.

147
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,434
I'm putting the last

148
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,767
ties on that...
I need this now.

149
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:34,367
I need the president to
sign off on my proposals.

150
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,101
She has gone from being an
irritant to an obstacle.

151
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,834
And she will be gone
soon, sir, I promise.

152
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,034
I'm just waiting
to hear back

153
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,900
from a few more people,
then you can approach her.

154
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:47,034
This work you're doing for me,
it doesn't go unnoticed.

155
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,967
Thank you, sir.

156
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,867
Mr. Buchanan.
Yes.

157
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:00,401
Are you aware
of the internal

158
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:02,534
security mandate that's
just been issued?

159
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,900
I haven't looked
at the hourlies yet.

160
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:05,101
What's going on?
Anyone identified

161
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,301
with a Middle Eastern
background is required

162
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,067
to put a redundancy layer
on all their log-ins.

163
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:11,667
I see.

164
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,000
Look, normally, I'm not
sensitive to this kind of thing,

165
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:16,468
you know that,
but this is not the time to be

166
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:19,267
racially profiling people
who have grade-four
security clearance.

167
00:06:19,334 --> 00:06:20,633
I agree, I'm not going
to argue with you.

168
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,034
Good-- so you give
me an exemption?

169
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,568
I'll take this issue
to the attorney general,

170
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,267
but it's not going
to happen right away.

171
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:27,700
Well, how am I supposed to work

172
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,900
with one hand tied
behind my back?

173
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,034
Listen, you
and I both

174
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:31,334
knew when I hired you that

175
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,767
a Muslim working counter-terror
in the United States

176
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:35,000
was going to have to
put up with some unfair

177
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,334
measures-- this is
one of them.

178
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:38,000
I know.
But today, of all days...

179
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,733
Especially today.

180
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,667
I need you to stay focused
on the big picture.

181
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,700
When this is behind us,
I will take this issue

182
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,733
to the attorney general,
I promise you.

183
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,367
Have we heard from Jack yet?

184
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:53,101
Not since he went
to go see his brother.

185
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,334
Want me to try and reach him?

186
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:56,234
No. He'll call us
when he has something.

187
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:01,501
(muffled grunt,
rapid gasping)

188
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,367
(explosive cough,
wheezing)

189
00:07:03,434 --> 00:07:04,934
You lie to me again,
the bag goes back on.

190
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,967
Do you understand me?

191
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,134
(raspy coughing)

192
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,501
Start talking, Gray!

193
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:11,834
(gasping):
Dad...

194
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,201
Dad didn't want anyone to know
where he went.

195
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,900
He didn't even leave a number,
in case of an emergency?

196
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,167
No, you can't reach him, Jack.

197
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:20,201
(catching breath):
After the bomb was...

198
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:22,334
detonated,
he told me he was

199
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,867
cutting himself off.

200
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,468
(crying quietly)

201
00:07:26,534 --> 00:07:28,434
I don't believe you.

202
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:29,468
(sobs loudly)

203
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,468
I think he told you
where he was going.

204
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,568
No, no! It's the truth!

205
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:33,934
Fine...

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,234
No, no!
I don't know! I don't know!

207
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:37,733
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

208
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,000
(growling gasps)

209
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:45,534
He went to see a...
a guy who works for us.

210
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,167
His name's
Darren McCarthy.

211
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,633
Why?

212
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,367
It was my fault.

213
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,600
I made a mess.

214
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,633
Dad's trying
to clean it up.
What do you mean?

215
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,301
You were right.
It's about the nukes.

216
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:01,367
(sighs, gasps)

217
00:08:01,434 --> 00:08:02,967
The connection you
found between Dad

218
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,401
and Gredenko had to do
with a... a contract

219
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:06,733
that was awarded to us.

220
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,900
Through the company?

221
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,301
Yeah, it all went
through BXJ.

222
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,301
What did an ex-Russian general
have to do

223
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:12,434
with the contract?

224
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,301
It was his job... to release

225
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:17,201
the old nukes into the U.S.
for decommissioning.

226
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:21,267
BXJ was hired to dismantle
some of the smaller bombs

227
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,267
and to recycle their cores

228
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,800
into energy production--
we do it all the time.

229
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:27,934
What happened?

230
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,733
(heavy sigh)

231
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,733
I hired McCarthy to
oversee the job,

232
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,468
but I didn't check him
out carefully enough.

233
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,334
So, basically, he came in
with the lowest bid

234
00:08:35,401 --> 00:08:36,700
and you just hired him!

235
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,600
I-I... M-My head was into
other things at the time.

236
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:42,067
I-I-I... H-He came in
with good references.

237
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:43,367
I saw no reason to get
all anal about it.

238
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,767
So the nukes that these
terrorists are in possession of,

239
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,234
including the one that was just
detonated in Valencia,

240
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:49,733
were supplied by McCarthy

241
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,934
and stolen from you.

242
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, in a nutshell,
that's it.

243
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,167
Sam told me Dad left
yesterday...

244
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:57,101
which means that you and he
knew about this

245
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,301
before today,
and you didn't report it.

246
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,834
We didn't report it
because we thought

247
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,334
we could take care of it
more efficiently.

248
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:02,700
Damn it, Gray!

249
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:03,967
Do you know how many people
have died

250
00:09:04,034 --> 00:09:05,134
because you're trying
to cover your ass?!

251
00:09:05,201 --> 00:09:07,167
We had no idea that this
was going to happen.

252
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,000
And besides,
what Dad and I are doing

253
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,301
to stop this is
more effective

254
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,167
than what you and your
people are gonna do.

255
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,600
What, exactly,

256
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,867
are you doing?

257
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,800
Dad put together a security team

258
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,800
and he went out
to look for McCarthy.

259
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,167
Where?

260
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,834
He was staking out
McCarthy's office.

261
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,733
He checked in about an hour ago.

262
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:33,800
Where is this office?

263
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:35,434
He's in Simi.

264
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,301
We're going.

265
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,201
I'm not leaving
my family, Jack.

266
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:45,800
Not today.

267
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,034
Oh, yes, you are.

268
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:55,501
Get up!

269
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:13,733
Graem, where are
you going?

270
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,534
Jack and I have to go
find Dad.

271
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,101
What do you mean,
find him?

272
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:19,000
He's not reachable right
now; we have to go out

273
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,334
 and pick him up-- I want you
to stay here, all right?

274
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,501
You stay with Josh,
don't either of you
go outside the house.

275
00:10:23,568 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

276
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,633
What's the address?

277
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,234
McCarthy's office
is off the 23.

278
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:40,101
5137 Olson Avenue.

279
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,367
Who are you calling?

280
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,367
(phone ringing)

281
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,834
CTU. O'Brian.

282
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,501
Chloe, it's Jack.
Let me speak to Bill.

283
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:46,600
He's being briefed
on Fayed.

284
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:48,334
Have you picked up
any threads?
Not yet.

285
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:50,800
I've got one-- I want you
to send two field units

286
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,501
to 5137 Olson Avenue,
in Simi Valley.

287
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,733
It should be off
the 23.

288
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,367
I want them to wait
for me there.

289
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,867
Get Bill to call me back
as soon as he's out of
the briefing.

290
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,167
Okay, I will.

291
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:00,733
So that's it, Jack, huh?
You're just gonna

292
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,367
sell out Dad and me.

293
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,264
--We've been monitoring
ground movement

294
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:19,931
ever since
the bomb went off.

295
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:21,097
We locked down streets,
we're doing vehicle

296
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:22,464
searches--
so far, nothing.

297
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,364
No sign of Fayed.
MORRIS:
Which means he could still

298
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:26,197
hunkered down within
the perimeter-- what are
we doing about that?

299
00:11:26,264 --> 00:11:27,597
We've got NEST teams
in the area now.

300
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:28,864
They're going
street by street.

301
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,697
That'll take hours.
Yeah, Morris,

302
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,764
it's all going to take time.
If we could do it quicker,

303
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:35,364
we would.
We can use the direction
of the fallout to our advantage.

304
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,297
If Fayed is still
in the perimeter,

305
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,631
he'll be moving
in the opposite direction.

306
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,831
And he'll have to be
monitoring the fallout.

307
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:43,664
Which means he's got technology
in the "on" position.

308
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:44,798
Let's use radio
frequency satellite,

309
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,330
see what we can come up with.
Good.

310
00:11:46,397 --> 00:11:48,464
Get on it.
Mr. Buchanan,
Jack just called in.

311
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,564
He's following some kind
of lead in Simi Valley.

312
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,631
He wants you to call
him right away.
Anything else?

313
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:53,963
Nothing.
He asked me to send

314
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,798
two teams to meet him.
Any leads on finding

315
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,330
Gredenko?
Not yet.

316
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,697
CIA is trying
to track him

317
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,464
down in Moscow.
Okay, thank you.

318
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:10,063
If you give CTU McCarthy's name,

319
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,497
they will eventually
come after the family.

320
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,264
That is not
necessarily true.

321
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,864
CTU is interested in
finding these bombs,
not networking

322
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,764
a series of indictments.
Oh, will you not be

323
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:19,130
so simple-minded for once

324
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,697
in your life!
CTU,

325
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:22,930
like every other federal
organization, is made up

326
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:24,564
of human beings
with ambition.

327
00:12:24,631 --> 00:12:26,297
When the dust settles,
they will start

328
00:12:26,364 --> 00:12:27,564
digging deeper,
you can count on it.

329
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:29,063
Well, unfortunately for you,
Gray, right now

330
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,798
you're going
to have to trust me.

331
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:33,297
Trust you? After what you
did to me at the house,

332
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:35,230
all I trust in is your
sadistic tendencies.
(cell phone ringing)

333
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,697
This is Bauer.
What'd you find out?

334
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:40,097
Bill, I want you
to run a locater check
on a Darren McCarthy.

335
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:42,898
Who is he?
He was an independent
munitions contractor.

336
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,197
He worked for
BXJ Technologies.

337
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,464
How does McCarthy
figure into all this?

338
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:49,063
My father's company
hired him

339
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,364
to decommission
the nukes.

340
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,963
I believe he brokered
them to Fayed.

341
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,731
So except for McCarthy,
your father's company

342
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:56,731
had nothing to
do with Fayed?

343
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:58,464
I don't know BXJ's
involvement yet.

344
00:12:58,531 --> 00:12:59,831
All right, we're on it.
Where are you?

345
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:01,997
I'm heading to McCarthy's
office in Simi Valley.

346
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:04,831
I don't think he's there,
but I might be able to get
something off his computer.

347
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:06,297
We have teams standing by.
Let me know.

348
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:08,963
Copy that.
(phone snaps shut)

349
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,431
You know, if you're doing
this to come after me,

350
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:14,097
eventually Dad will
get caught in the middle.

351
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:16,597
Or maybe you want that,
maybe you want

352
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:18,930
Dad to go to prison, too.

353
00:13:20,997 --> 00:13:23,097
Boy, Jack...

354
00:13:23,164 --> 00:13:25,564
it's good to see your loyalty's
still with your family.

355
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:30,364
If I were you,
I wouldn't talk about loyalty.

356
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:35,330
McCARTHY:
I know it's not easy, that's why
they're willing to pay

357
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,330
$7 million cash.

358
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,130
What about Taylor Paskal,
why can't he do it?

359
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,798
MAN (on phone):
He's a theoretical physicist.

360
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:42,130
He doesn't have enough
practical background

361
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,930
to reprogram a nuclear trigger.
Who does?

362
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:46,330
I'm still looking.
Fayed needs

363
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:48,664
someone now;
get me a name, damn it!

364
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:51,130
(slams phone down)

365
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,297
Where are we going now?

366
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,963
What do you care
where we're going?

367
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,264
Darren, I don't feel
safe in this city.

368
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,497
I was here when you
mentioned that earlier.

369
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:02,097
Okay... It seems to me

370
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,631
like whatever this is
you're trying to do

371
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:04,831
is a long shot.

372
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:06,397
You're just going
to waste all this time

373
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:08,497
and it's going to be
harder to get away.

374
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:11,030
(tires screeching)

375
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:14,464
Get out.
What?!

376
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:15,930
Your negativity is not
what I need right now.

377
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:18,464
I need less stress, not more.

378
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,497
(gasping)

379
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:24,497
(wry laugh)

380
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:32,264
How sure a thing...

381
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,297
is this $7 million?

382
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,464
Now that's the
type of question

383
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:39,464
that I love
hearing from you.

384
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:41,531
(cell phone ringing)

385
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:45,230
Yeah.

386
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,431
Have you found an engineer?

387
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:48,764
Not yet.

388
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,798
Why not?

389
00:14:50,864 --> 00:14:52,364
(sighs):
Give me a break, Fayed.

390
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:54,564
This is not some easy
one-stop shopping.

391
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:55,997
You said within
the hour.

392
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,164
I know what I said.

393
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,831
It's just taking longer.

394
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:01,063
I told you I'd find someone

395
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,097
and I will.
(closes phone)

396
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:11,597
SAMUELS:
That's the last of the group.

397
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:14,431
So what do you do with them now?

398
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,097
Patch the images over to CTU.

399
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:18,864
They can cross them
with international watch lists.

400
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,464
Didn't you already
vet these people?

401
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:21,864
CTU has more resources.

402
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,631
They can go deeper,
find the connection to Fayed.

403
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:36,097
Samuels just sent us
images of the men

404
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,731
Walid is undercover with.
MORRIS:
Excellent.

405
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,030
Send them to my system,
when Nadia

406
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:40,531
gets me the manifest;
I'll cross them against

407
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:41,898
all of our watch lists.

408
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:43,798
Wait... Nadia didn't get you
the manifests yet?

409
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:45,030
No.
Why not?

410
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:46,297
I haven't a clue, mate.

411
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:52,364
Hey, you were supposed
to send the manifest

412
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:53,697
from the detention
facility over to comm.

413
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:55,297
Why don't we have it yet?
I'm backed up.

414
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:56,697
Well, why are you backed up?

415
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:58,030
Milo, I'm doing
the best that I can here.

416
00:15:58,097 --> 00:15:59,230
You got a problem with it,

417
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:00,397
take it somewhere else.

418
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:02,230
Hey...

419
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:03,697
I'm just trying
to understand what

420
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,898
the problem is.
The detention facility's

421
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,364
one of the only
live leads we have.

422
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:09,230
Go ask Buchanan.

423
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,097
Okay.

424
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:23,297
We've got a support team
in place, if Jack needs

425
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:24,330
more backup,
he'll let you know.

426
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,798
Yeah.
What is it, Milo?

427
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,063
Nadia.

428
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,164
She's falling
behind on her tasks.

429
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,664
What's going
on with her?
Nothing.

430
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:37,731
Petition her workload

431
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:39,664
and hand some of it off
to another analyst.

432
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,264
I've only got her
working on one process.

433
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,464
She's doing some things
for me directly, Milo.

434
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:44,963
Just do it, please.
Mr. Buchanan,

435
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,230
with all due respect,

436
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,431
is there something
going on here you don't

437
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,230
want me to know about?
Yes, there is, Milo.

438
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:51,564
Either give Nadia enough
time to finish the work,

439
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:52,864
or give the work
to somebody else.

440
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,164
Sir, I'm the technical leader
on the floor.

441
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,664
If you want me to do my job

442
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,264
effectively, I need to
know what's happening.

443
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:06,297
Because Nadia's of
Middle Eastern descent,

444
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:07,464
she's been flagged

445
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:08,898
by Homeland Security.

446
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,898
That's ridiculous.

447
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,564
She's... lived in this country

448
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:14,864
since she was two years old.

449
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,764
She's... a registered

450
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:18,097
Republican, for crying out loud.
You're wasting your

451
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:19,464
breath, Milo--
there's nothing I can do

452
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,564
about this right now.
Let it go, will you please?

453
00:17:21,631 --> 00:17:23,664
No, sir, I don't see how
we can just "let it go."

454
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:25,130
Aren't we trying
to find four

455
00:17:25,197 --> 00:17:27,264
suitcase nukes that might
still be in this city?
Milo...

456
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,264
I need everyone on the floor
working at full speed.

457
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,464
I understand that, Milo.

458
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,664
Now get back to work.

459
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,130
Yes, sir.

460
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:48,597
(phone ringing)

461
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:49,864
Yeah, hi.

462
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,531
Have you heard
about this latest mandate

463
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:52,831
from Homeland Security?

464
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:54,063
No, why. What is it?

465
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,063
They're racially
profiling our own agents.

466
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,397
What?!

467
00:17:57,464 --> 00:17:58,731
It just came down
from the White House.

468
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:01,664
The problem is one of my best
people is hamstrung.

469
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:04,197
She has to work twice
as hard to get through these

470
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,731
security measures.
They're not security
measures, Bill.

471
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,597
They're the paranoid delusions

472
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:10,898
of Tom Lennox.

473
00:18:10,963 --> 00:18:12,230
Is there anything you can do?

474
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:15,230
I can talk to the president.

475
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:18,063
Thank you.

476
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,030
You're welcome.

477
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:22,063
(hangs up phone)

478
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,264
He went off to Valencia

479
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,798
over an hour ago.

480
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,764
How many were killed?

481
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:33,397
We don't know yet.

482
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:35,898
(over speaker): They say
there are four more visitors.

483
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:37,564
WALID:
Four more visitors.
What does that mean?

484
00:18:37,631 --> 00:18:38,764
I'm not sure.

485
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,364
But you think it
may have something

486
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,497
to do with what happened
in Valencia?

487
00:18:42,564 --> 00:18:43,864
How did you get the information?

488
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,097
Why are you asking
so many questions?

489
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:49,431
Whatever happens
out there

490
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:51,030
affects us in here.

491
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:54,531
We need to share 
everything we know.

492
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:02,564
Heydar has been in contact.

493
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:04,264
How?

494
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,197
He smuggled in a cell phone.

495
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:10,898
How did you do that?

496
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:14,063
Cell phone? How did he get
a cell phone in there?

497
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,731
These facilities
were put up quickly.

498
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,764
The security's
still pretty porous.

499
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,397
Then we need
to get this man's phone

500
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:20,764
and find out
who he's talking to.

501
00:19:20,831 --> 00:19:23,264
If Walid can get the phone,
I can trace any call

502
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,731
that's been 
made from it.

503
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,264
If I can get a live
conversation, that's worth

504
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,297
more than a list 
of phone numbers.

505
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:30,063
Fine. Then, after that,
get Walid out of there.

506
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,930
No. They're talking to him now.
That's a big get.

507
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,731
We have to keep
listening in

508
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,664
on whatever they say.

509
00:19:36,731 --> 00:19:38,297
This is Agent Samuels.

510
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,431
I'm going to need
to get into a cell tower--

511
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,930
grid location:
15 comma

512
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:44,464
twenty-seven.

513
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:56,464
It's done.

514
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,764
All these people
will come forward

515
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:02,364
if we need
them to testify?

516
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,164
Yes. I put the screws
to every one of them myself.

517
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,431
They're all yours.

518
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,464
Good.

519
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,631
Oh, Karen...
I need to talk to you.

520
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:12,631
Just a minute.

521
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:14,464
 <i>Now</i> would be better.

522
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:18,531
Have this signed,
and then send it out.

523
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:20,997
This, uh, this just simply
isn't working for me.

524
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:22,631
I can't have you
stand in my way

525
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,963
anymore.
What?

526
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,898
I need the president's
undivided attention,

527
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:28,631
and you, frankly,
are dividing it.

528
00:20:28,697 --> 00:20:31,531
Well, I'm not going
to stop doing my job, Tom,

529
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,564
just because it irritates you.
I thought

530
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,997
I made that 
perfectly clear.

531
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:36,564
Yeah. I'd like you to tend
your resignation, Karen.

532
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:37,930
(scoffs)

533
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,030
My resignation?

534
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:41,831
What are you smoking?

535
00:20:41,898 --> 00:20:44,697
No, no, no. I'm here

536
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:46,130
to blow away all of the smoke.

537
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:47,330
I want to talk about your

538
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:49,030
husband's
incompetence,

539
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:50,864
and your covering it up.
I don't like this

540
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,997
conversation.

541
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:53,364
What are you talking about?

542
00:20:53,431 --> 00:20:54,531
14 months ago,

543
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:58,764
we had Abu Fayed in CTU custody
in Seattle,

544
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:01,297
and Bill Buchanan
signed off on
his release.

545
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:02,431
I don't believe this.

546
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:03,664
The case that
you're referring to,

547
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:06,531
if I remember correctly,
involved over 20 detainees.

548
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:10,164
Not prisoners, Tom.
Detainees.

549
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,230
And, at the time,
there was not enough evidence

550
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:13,731
to hold them.

551
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:15,930
It's just a little grayer
than that, now, isn't it?

552
00:21:15,997 --> 00:21:17,230
If what you're saying
is true, how come

553
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:19,898
that incident wound up
blue-coded at Homeland

554
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:22,597
in a dead-end file?

555
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,197
I got Peter Iannone here,
Kurt Hueig, Myra Mawk...

556
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:28,197
They were all
in the pipeline--
all ready to testify

557
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:30,697
that you sequestered that file
to protect your husband. 

558
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:33,030
I did nothing illegal
or incorrect!

559
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:34,631
Every single one

560
00:21:34,697 --> 00:21:37,464
of those detainees
were cleared of any
conspiracy charges.

561
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,798
Nevertheless,
one of these detainees

562
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,631
detonated a nuclear bomb
in Los Angeles.

563
00:21:41,697 --> 00:21:44,330
You think your husband
could survive that story?

564
00:21:44,397 --> 00:21:45,564
Or you, for that matter?

565
00:21:45,631 --> 00:21:47,864
Do you want to get in the ring
with me, Tom?

566
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,864
You've got skeletons

567
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,030
in your closet,
and I will not

568
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:53,030
hesitate to pull them out.

569
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:55,297
We've all got
our skeletons, Karen.

570
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,664
It's proof
we don't all have.

571
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,130
I've got mine.

572
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:01,963
How long before
you get yours?

573
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,898
You're a son of a bitch.

574
00:22:03,963 --> 00:22:06,063
I never claimed otherwise.

575
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,230
But I am not out to hurt
you or your husband

576
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,997
personally.

577
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:14,764
I just need room to work.

578
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,397
Your resignation

579
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:18,197
within the hour.

580
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:42,197
--Can we go a little slower?
There's no rush.

581
00:22:42,264 --> 00:22:43,830
Morris, I'm going
as fast as I can.

582
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,497
Why don't you just go back
to your station?

583
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:47,131
I'll send it over as soon
as I'm ready.

584
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:48,463
No, I'm curious as to why

585
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,097
it's taking you five minutes
to do something

586
00:22:50,164 --> 00:22:51,430
that should take
ten seconds.

587
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:55,097
Because I borrowed
two of her processors

588
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,064
to run a batch job.

589
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:57,764
She's running on 20%.

590
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,364
Oh, yeah? Then why didn't
somebody tell me this?

591
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,664
I just did.

592
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,164
Fine. But don't

593
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,231
keep any secrets
from me, darling.

594
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:06,997
We're on the same side.

595
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,730
Why'd you lie for me?

596
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:14,830
I talked to Buchanan.

597
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:17,764
Yeah, it's pretty frustrating.

598
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,463
I'm sure.

599
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:30,364
What are you doing?

600
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,897
I'm logging you in
under my user I.D.

601
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:34,997
That's illegal.

602
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:38,331
And you didn't do it, I did.

603
00:23:42,164 --> 00:23:43,897
Thank you.

604
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,931
Yeah, you should...
be fine.

605
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,931
(quiet conversation)

606
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,964
Excuse me, Mr. President,
I need to speak with you.

607
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:20,563
Karen, I'm a little
squeezed for time right now.

608
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,630
Can we talk later?
No, sir, we can't.

609
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,864
Okay.

610
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,364
Thank you.

611
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:39,298
Mr. President, I am tendering
my resignation,

612
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:41,197
effective immediately.

613
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:44,764
What's going on, Karen?

614
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,031
It's a personal
matter, sir.

615
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:48,164
Is there something wrong
with you or Bill?

616
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,597
No, we're fine.

617
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,497
It's... I cannot elaborate.

618
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,897
I've noticed that you and Tom

619
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:57,264
have been locking horns

620
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,664
these past few weeks.

621
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,398
Is that what
this is about?
Sir, I would rather not say.

622
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:02,231
Damn it, Karen,
that is unacceptable.

623
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:04,064
Mr. President...
I need you!

624
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:06,064
I need different
points of view.

625
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:08,697
Now I understand it's difficult
to sit in a room with someone

626
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,031
who opposes you
constantly,

627
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,597
but that is part
of your job.

628
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:14,997
And I have never seen
anyone handle it
better than you.

629
00:25:15,064 --> 00:25:18,830
Now I am sorry, Karen, but I
cannot accept your resignation.

630
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:21,097
Not now, not today.

631
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:23,797
No disrespect, sir,
but you're going to have to.

632
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:27,997
Mr. President,
I'm here to tell you

633
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,463
that the past few weeks
have been

634
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,131
some of the must difficult weeks

635
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,997
that I have ever seen
a president face.

636
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:37,697
And I am truly honored
to serve under you
here in Washington.

637
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:40,031
And I appreciate that you value
my advice,

638
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:43,398
but, sir, the truth is, you have
been your own best counselor.

639
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:50,097
You know what
to do, sir.

640
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:53,964
And I have no doubt,
absolutely no doubt...

641
00:25:54,031 --> 00:25:58,064
that you will continue
to rise to this challenge.

642
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:11,064
Is there anything I can do
to change your mind?

643
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:14,830
No, sir, there is not.

644
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:17,264
I would appreciate it,

645
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:21,331
however, if you would reassign
me to L.A. CTU.

646
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:23,197
I feel I will serve best there.

647
00:26:23,264 --> 00:26:27,964
I'll approve you for
military transport west.

648
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:29,830
Thank you, sir.

649
00:26:34,864 --> 00:26:36,331
Mr. President.

650
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:39,430
I'm sorry.

651
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,264
So am I.

652
00:26:57,697 --> 00:26:59,164
Oh.
Oh.

653
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:01,298
Excuse me, Karen,
I'm so sorry.

654
00:27:01,364 --> 00:27:03,131
Oh, actually, Karen,
I'm glad I caught you.

655
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:05,797
I've got a State Department
white paper

656
00:27:05,864 --> 00:27:06,964
I was hoping you
could look over

657
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:08,031
and then take
to the president.

658
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:09,664
No, you'll have
to give it to Tom.

659
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,730
Well, I thought
you handled that.

660
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,364
Give it to Tom.

661
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,064
Excuse me.

662
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,364
(phone ringing)

663
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,164
Yes.

664
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:34,131
Karen Hayes is out.

665
00:27:55,164 --> 00:27:57,663
--The last one is a black Kia,
California license plate

666
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,763
Niner, Yankee, Sierra,

667
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,097
Uniform, 1-0-8.

668
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:05,431
That one's not registered
to McCarthy either.

669
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:07,231
Okay, I want you
to cross-reference the names

670
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:09,197
with registered owners,
see if any of them correlate.

671
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:11,663
What do you want
me to do with the
backup teams?

672
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,830
Where are they?

673
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:14,531
They're holding
a two-block radius.

674
00:28:14,598 --> 00:28:16,231
Send one of them over
to the parking lot here,

675
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:17,564
tell the other
to stand by.

676
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,364
I'll get back to you.

677
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,598
Where's McCarthy's office?
What floor?

678
00:28:21,663 --> 00:28:23,131
Second floor.
Let's go.

679
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:12,264
--You all right?

680
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,430
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

681
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:20,597
--All right, I've got the phone.

682
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:22,697
Good. I'm going to give you
a number to dial

683
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:24,998
then CTU will be able
to access the phone's records.

684
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,364
After dialing the number,
hit the star button twice.

685
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:33,230
The number is 310-597-3781.

686
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:38,397
Again, the number:
310-597-3781.

687
00:29:38,464 --> 00:29:39,998
Once we get everything
off the SIM,

688
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:42,130
I'll let you know,
you can put the phone back.

689
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,230
All right, but hurry.
It won't be long before

690
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,230
he discovers it's missing.

691
00:29:45,297 --> 00:29:46,230
He got the phone.

692
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:47,430
There's nothing else he can do.

693
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:50,597
Well, let's just
see what we get.

694
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:51,697
CTU. O'Brian.

695
00:29:51,764 --> 00:29:52,631
Chloe, it's Agent Samuels.

696
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:53,731
We've got the phone.

697
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:55,030
I'm piping a byte stream
to you now.

698
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:59,898
Work up every number you get.

699
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,864
All right, it's coming through.

700
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:01,931
What's it look like?

701
00:30:01,998 --> 00:30:03,097
This data's encoded.

702
00:30:03,163 --> 00:30:05,464
It looks like there's over
120 numbers or so.

703
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:07,464
I can't tell if they're
recently dialed or stored.

704
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:09,797
I'll untangle it
and get back to you
in a few minutes.

705
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:10,831
But you got
everything, right?

706
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:11,864
Yeah.

707
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:16,864
Walid did a great job
of getting that phone.

708
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:18,631
Then please let him go

709
00:30:18,697 --> 00:30:20,264
before he gets hurt.

710
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,030
I'm going to tell you
one last time, Ms. Palmer--

711
00:30:23,097 --> 00:30:24,597
these men know something
about the bombs

712
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:26,130
that we don't.

713
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:29,163
Walid has earned
their trust.

714
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,097
That's a situation
that we've lucked into.

715
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,831
And we will
not terminate it

716
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,564
as long as he can continue
to harvest information.

717
00:30:37,697 --> 00:30:38,964
All right, Walid,

718
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,230
you can put the phone back.

719
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,497
Okay.

720
00:31:34,097 --> 00:31:35,831
(phone rings)

721
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:38,430
Yeah, Chloe.

722
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,664
I don't think these guys

723
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,964
you're tracking are connected
to anyone.

724
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,230
What are you talking about?

725
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:44,564
They knew about
the other four bombs.

726
00:31:44,631 --> 00:31:45,898
They found out
from a web page.

727
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:48,030
What?

728
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,931
The cell phone had
a browser on it.

729
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:51,898
The cache had a web page.
It wasn't public,

730
00:31:51,964 --> 00:31:53,264
but they could've
connected in.

731
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,764
Was the Web site
password protected?

732
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,264
No. These pages
come and go.

733
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,297
But a lot of people
know about them.

734
00:31:58,364 --> 00:32:00,931
These guys aren't terrorists--
they're just spectators.

735
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:02,397
Why didn't they report
the Web site?

736
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:03,731
Because you have them locked up

737
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,264
for having
terrorist links!

738
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,030
Why would they
give you information

739
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:08,898
that, in your eyes, would
incriminate them even further.

740
00:32:08,964 --> 00:32:10,797
All right, thanks, Chloe.

741
00:32:10,864 --> 00:32:11,797
I'm getting Walid

742
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,230
the hell out of there.

743
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:14,664
This is Agent Samuels.

744
00:32:14,731 --> 00:32:16,163
Notify the guards.

745
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,797
We are taking
Walid Al-Rezani out.

746
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:25,330
I was at home with my
wife and my children,

747
00:32:25,397 --> 00:32:27,764
and they barged right in
and the grabbed me.

748
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:28,931
No search warrant,

749
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:31,130
nothing.

750
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:34,464
And they say this country
is about freedom.

751
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:35,898
This is not freedom.

752
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:37,230
My phone.

753
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:40,230
It's gone.
What do you mean it's gone?

754
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:41,464
I just had it over there.

755
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,230
You... You took it.

756
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:50,230
No, I did not take your phone.

757
00:32:50,297 --> 00:32:51,397
Yes, he did.

758
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:53,464
I was walking back here.

759
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:54,631
He fell in front of me.

760
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:58,230
Search him.

761
00:32:58,297 --> 00:33:00,130
No, get away from me.

762
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:03,664
Open the gate.

763
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,697
Can't do that, ma'am.
I need to get in
there right now.

764
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:08,797
What are you doing?

765
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,764
You spied on us?

766
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:13,931
You're worse than they are!

767
00:33:13,998 --> 00:33:17,097
You son of a bitch!
Heydar, no!

768
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,697
(shouting)

769
00:33:21,397 --> 00:33:23,998
Let us in.

770
00:33:40,297 --> 00:33:44,230
(clamoring)

771
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,831
Walid, Walid.

772
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,130
Oh, my God.

773
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:56,297
I'm okay.

774
00:33:56,364 --> 00:33:57,364
Oh, no, no, you're not.
You're hurt.

775
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,464
I need a medical team
on site now.

776
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:01,330
I've got a civilian down.

777
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:17,131
--CTU. O'Brian.

778
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:18,397
Chloe, we're here.

779
00:34:18,463 --> 00:34:20,730
The parking lot's almost empty.

780
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:23,298
Yeah, the building's been
evacuated because of the bomb.

781
00:34:23,363 --> 00:34:24,730
Does Jack want us in there?

782
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:26,164
No, hold your positions.

783
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:28,363
Keep an eye on all the
exits and entrances;
wait for my call.

784
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,198
All right. Standing by.

785
00:34:48,897 --> 00:34:50,630
Which one's his office?

786
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:51,964
Last door on the right.

787
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,897
Let's go.

788
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:19,164
Take a seat.

789
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,630
What are you doing?

790
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,664
I'm looking for anything

791
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,797
in McCarthy's system

792
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:36,997
that connects him
to BXJ or the nukes.

793
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,497
What's that?

794
00:35:41,564 --> 00:35:42,564
That's McCarthy's employment

795
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,298
contract with BXJ.

796
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:46,330
Whoa, whoa! What happened there?

797
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:49,831
Some kind of electronic
shredding trail.

798
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,330
Look at the time code.

799
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,231
Ten minutes after
the bomb went off,

800
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:54,530
McCarthy started
shredding files.

801
00:35:54,597 --> 00:35:55,831
(door bangs)

802
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:58,363
(whispers):
Get up... now.

803
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,231
Come on, Jack!

804
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:09,597
Don't make a noise.

805
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:30,430
(light tap)

806
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:46,430
(louder tap)

807
00:36:58,597 --> 00:36:59,564
Don't you move.

808
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,097
(grunts)

809
00:37:03,397 --> 00:37:04,797
Stop.

810
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:08,630
You know him?

811
00:37:08,697 --> 00:37:11,397
Yeah.

812
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:12,430
He's my son.

813
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:17,831
I'm surprised to see you
here, Jack.

814
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:22,797
We all feared
the worst.

815
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:24,497
Give me my gun back.

816
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,430
What are you doing here, Jack?

817
00:37:30,497 --> 00:37:33,264
I'm working with CTU.

818
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:34,363
We're looking
for Darren McCarthy.

819
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,198
McCarthy's not here.

820
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:38,397
I know what you're trying
to cover up, Dad.

821
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:39,430
Gray already told me.

822
00:37:39,497 --> 00:37:42,097
Did he? And where is he?

823
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:43,797
McCarthy's office.

824
00:37:43,864 --> 00:37:47,697
There's nothing there, Jack,
believe me.

825
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:48,697
Get Graem in here.

826
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:50,097
Wait.

827
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:55,463
You'll need these.

828
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:59,031
I didn't trust him not to run.

829
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,363
I'm doing everything I can
to find McCarthy.

830
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,630
What in the hell
are you thinking,

831
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:07,231
trying to do this
on your own?

832
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:09,198
I only learned about it
yesterday.

833
00:38:09,264 --> 00:38:11,530
When Graem told me
about the diverted weapons...

834
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:12,630
The second you knew
the bombs were missing,

835
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:14,031
why didn't you call
the authorities?

836
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:17,097
He told me that the bombs
couldn't be detonated;

837
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:18,664
the triggers were deactivated.

838
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,764
He was wrong.

839
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,164
Evidently!

840
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:26,764
Look, Jack,
I'm just trying

841
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:29,131
to keep my son
out of prison.

842
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:30,530
Dad, where is McCarthy?

843
00:38:30,597 --> 00:38:31,864
I don't know.

844
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,831
When I do, we can

845
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,397
pick him up together.

846
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:36,797
That's not what he wants, Dad.
He wants us both in prison.

847
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:38,564
What I want
is to find the nukes.

848
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,897
If you're held accountable
for what you've done,

849
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:42,363
that's the bed you've made.

850
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,997
You hear that, Dad?

851
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,497
You hear that family love?
We'd be better off

852
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:49,097
if he was still rotting away
in a Chinese jail.

853
00:38:49,164 --> 00:38:50,198
Who are you calling?

854
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:51,198
CTU.

855
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:53,730
Jack, look, work with me.

856
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:55,497
I'll tell you
what I know,

857
00:38:55,564 --> 00:38:57,164
but for now,
keep Graem out of it.

858
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:02,864
We're talking about
prison, Jack.

859
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:04,264
He's your brother.

860
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,997
Graem knew what
he was doing was wrong.

861
00:39:06,064 --> 00:39:07,730
He was responsible
for those nukes.

862
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:09,164
He should have been
more careful.

863
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,198
And the second he knew
they were stolen,

864
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,397
he should have reported it!

865
00:39:11,463 --> 00:39:13,530
Oh, you always do what
you should, right, Jack?

866
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:14,764
How about when Dad needed you

867
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,097
and you disappeared?

868
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:19,064
Come on, Jack, give us a chance
to clean this up.

869
00:39:19,131 --> 00:39:21,330
Dad, there are four more bombs
out there.

870
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:23,430
I cannot-- I will not--
be responsible

871
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:25,564
for thousands and thousands
of lives just

872
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,897
to try and protect
this family.

873
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,597
Wrong! Protecting family is
everything, and I think

874
00:39:29,664 --> 00:39:31,298
your dead wife
would agree.
You son of a bitch!

875
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:33,131
Jack!

876
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:36,564
All right,

877
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,964
let's do it your way.

878
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:40,064
No, Dad!
No, no, no,
he's right.

879
00:39:40,131 --> 00:39:41,964
Call CTU.

880
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,931
I don't think so.

881
00:39:49,198 --> 00:39:51,530
Hey, what are you doing?!

882
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,730
Put the gun away.

883
00:39:53,797 --> 00:39:55,264
You work for me.

884
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,231
No, Dad, he doesn't.

885
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,831
This is insane.

886
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:03,363
You don't think
I'd let you run loose

887
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,897
without keeping an eye
on you, do you?

888
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,997
Tell them to put the guns away.

889
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,797
Shut up, Dad.

890
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:11,298
Well, I'm glad we can

891
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:13,097
all finally put our cards
on the table.

892
00:40:14,964 --> 00:40:17,831
Family. (scoffs)
Let's go.

893
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:31,264
Yeah, talk to me.

894
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,064
Yeah, so?

895
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:36,330
You think you can get him?

896
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:37,964
And he hasn't left town?

897
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:44,164
Okay, text me everything
you've got on him.

898
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:45,463
They're
looking for you

899
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,264
at your place.

900
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,064
What makes you think
they can't find you here?

901
00:40:49,131 --> 00:40:50,831
A: Because I'm not that stupid,

902
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,864
and B: Because we're not going
to be here long enough

903
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:54,298
for anyone to know.

904
00:40:54,363 --> 00:40:56,997
I really hope you know
what you're doing, Darren.

905
00:40:57,064 --> 00:41:00,231
Always.

906
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:02,198
And when I'm done
with this deal,

907
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:04,564
I may just buy you
a small country.

908
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,597
As long as it's not
Palm Springs.

909
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:19,264
Everything's been handled.

910
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,530
We're clear to go.

911
00:41:20,597 --> 00:41:22,530
Good. Let's move.

912
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,164
Good God.

913
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:02,430
What have you done?

914
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,564
Jack forced my hand.

915
00:42:05,597 --> 00:42:06,964
Call me when it's over.
